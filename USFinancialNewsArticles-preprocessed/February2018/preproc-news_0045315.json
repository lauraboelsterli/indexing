    "text": "Full year 2017 net income and adjusted EBITDA of $325 million and $212 million, respectively Excluding the impact of Tembec acquisition, full year adjusted EBITDA of $177 million, in-line with previous guidance $30 million of cost transformation improvements achieved in 2017 with an incremental $25 million of cost transformation targeted in 2018 Completed acquisition of Tembec in November; three-year synergy target raised from $50 million to $75 million Three-year target of $155 million of EBITDA improvement before inflation and changes in commodity prices Authorized a $100 million share repurchase plan to be implemented as part of overall capital allocation strategy\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE:RYAM) today reported 2017 full year net income of $325 million, or $5.81 per diluted common share, compared to $73 million, or $1.55 per diluted common share in 2016. Full year 2017 adjusted net income was $57 million, or $0.97 per diluted common share, compared to $67 million, or $1.43 per diluted common share in 2016. Adjusted net income and earnings per share for 2017 exclude the impact of acquisition related costs, inventory write-up to fair value, a gain on derivative instrument, and a gain on bargain purchase all associated with the acquisition of Tembec Inc. (“Tembec”). Additionally, 2017 full year adjusted net income excludes the tax expense impact associated with U.S. tax reform legislation. Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per common share amounts for 2016 exclude the gain on debt extinguishment associated with the repurchase of the Senior Notes.\nFourth quarter 2017 net income was $295 million, or $5.01 per diluted common share compared to $11 million, or $0.18 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income was $29 million, or $0.50 per diluted common share, compared to $11 million, or $0.18 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share exclude acquisition related costs, inventory write-up to fair value, a loss on a derivative instrument and a gain on bargain purchase all associated with the acquisition of Tembec. Additionally, fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income excludes the tax expense impact associated with U.S. tax reform legislation.\nFourth quarter and full year net income were negatively impacted by approximately $4 million and $7 million, respectively, due to Hurricane Irma, which forced the closure of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing facilities during September. Additionally, the Company’s fourth quarter and full year sales were impacted by approximately $18 million as a result of an operational disruption at a major customer.\n“In 2017 we faced new challenges and took advantage of exciting opportunities. Our operating results were significantly impacted by both Hurricane Irma, which shut our plants for an extended period of time, and an operational disruption at one of our major customer’s facilities,” said Paul Boynton, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Despite these challenges, we continued to execute on our cost transformation program delivering $30 million of savings and, most importantly, we announced and completed the acquisition of Tembec which positions us well to grow the business.”\nFull Year 2017 and Fourth Quarter Operating Results\nFull year 2017 sales were $961 million compared to $869 million in the prior year, an increase of $92 million, or 11 percent. Excluding the impact of Tembec sales of $139 million since closing November 17, 2017, sales decreased $47 million or 5 percent compared to the prior year. The $47 million decrease in net sales was driven by a decline in cellulose specialties sales prices of 4 percent, as expected, and a 4 percent decline in cellulose specialties sales volumes primarily due to the impacts of Hurricane Irma and an operational disruption at a major customer. Additionally, commodity sales volumes decreased 3 percent due to discrete production issues and the impact of Hurricane Irma. These declines were partially offset by improved commodity sales prices due to stronger commodity markets resulting in higher sales prices for both commodity viscose and absorbent materials.\nFourth quarter 2017 sales were $349 million compared to $231 million in the prior year, an increase of $118 million, or 51 percent. Excluding the impact of Tembec sales of $139 million since closing, sales decreased $21 million or 9 percent compared to the prior year period. The $21 million decrease in net sales was driven by a decline in cellulose specialties sales prices of 2 percent and lower sales volumes, as previously discussed. The cellulose specialties declines were partially offset by improved commodity sales prices and sales volumes due to stronger markets and the timing of revenue recognition, respectively.\nFull year 2017 operating income was $57 million, which represents an $81 million decline from 2016. Excluding the impact of acquisition related costs and inventory write-up to fair value associated with the acquisition of Tembec, full year 2017 adjusted operating income was $114 million, which represents a $24 million decline from 2016. Full year 2017 results reflect lower cellulose specialties sales prices, cellulose specialties sales volumes and commodity product sales volumes, partially offset by higher commodity product sales price declines, as previously discussed. Savings from Cost Transformation were more than offset by costs incurred to achieve additional future savings, higher production expenses due to sales mix, chemical prices and production issues, as well as, investments in customer product development.\nFourth quarter 2017 operating income was break-even, which represents a $26 million decline from the 2016 comparable period. Excluding the impact of acquisition related costs and an inventory write-up to fair value associated with the acquisition of Tembec, fourth quarter 2017 adjusted operating income was $44 million, which represents a $18 million improvement from the 2016 comparable period. The fourth quarter 2017 results reflect lower cellulose specialties sales prices and sales volumes, partially offset by higher commodity product sales prices and sales volumes, as previously discussed. Savings from Cost Transformation more than offset costs incurred to achieve additional future savings, higher production expenses due to sales mix, chemical prices and production issues, as well as, investments in customer product development. Other operating income improved primarily due to lower costs associated with disposed operations.\nThe Company’s adjusted operating income for the full year and fourth quarter 2017 includes Tembec’s adjusted operating income from the date of acquisition to year end 2017 of approximately $26 million and depreciation and amortization of $9 million.\nDuring 2017, the Company achieved its gross cost savings target of $30 million under its Cost Transformation pillar, primarily due to cost improvements related to the Company’s supply chain, chemical usage and wood optimization. Savings from the Cost Transformation pillar now total $115 million since inception in January of 2015.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net of interest income and other expense, was $37 million for 2017, comparable to the prior year due to lower average debt balances, offset by higher LIBOR interest rates on floating rate debt and the increased amortization of deferred financing costs as a result of the refinancing of the Company’s term loans.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 6 percent for 2017, which compares to 35 percent during the prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to the non-taxable gain on bargain purchase partially offset by the impact of the U.S. tax reform legislation and certain non-deductible acquisition related costs.\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nYear-to-date, the Company generated operating cash flows of $130 million and adjusted free cash flows of $91 million, excluding expenses associated with the acquisition of Tembec. With strong adjusted free cash flows, the Company ended the fourth quarter with adjusted net debt of $1,150 million and $312 million of total liquidity, including $96 million of cash and $216 million available under the revolving credit facility after taking into account outstanding letters of credit.\nOutlook\nHigh Purity Cellulose\nCellulose specialties prices are anticipated to decline 4 to 5 percent in 2018 primarily due to lower acetate prices, offset by improved pricing in the ethers and other cellulose specialties products. The Company believes that its 2018 acetate pricing is now consistent with its competition. Demand for ethers and other cellulose specialties continues to show strength and will provide opportunities for the Company to expand sales in these faster growing end-uses. Additionally, the Company’s expanded capabilities in ethers and its enhanced innovation footprint should allow the Company to further diversify its portfolio of products.\nForest Products\nIncreased demand from the steady growth of the U.S. housing market is expected to result in record lumber prices in 2018. The Company’s business is currently operating under countervailing and anti-dumping duties on lumber sold into the U.S. These duties are anticipated to affect approximately 50 percent of its sales in this segment and reduce EBITDA by approximately $25 million during 2018, but should not impact sales volumes.\nPulp and Paper\nHigh-yield pulp prices are currently at peak levels due to increased Chinese demand driven primarily from the reduction of imports of recycled fiber. This demand is not expected to continue at its current level for the entire year. In paperboard, markets are expected to remain stable though peak pulp prices, which benefit our high-yield pulp, will impact the cost of raw materials. Finally, in newsprint, reduced industry production capacity has resulted in a temporary supply imbalance and higher pricing; however, continued decreases in demand and the potential for final countervailing and anti-dumping duties are expected to negatively impact results.\nCapital Allocation and Investment\nThe Company anticipates that it will spend approximately $100 to $110 million in maintenance capital expenditures across its businesses in 2018. In addition, the Company has identified approximately $90 million of potential strategic capital expenditures in its facilities with attractive payback periods of 1 to 3 years which may be acted upon over the next 3 years. These capital investment opportunities are predominantly in the High Purity Cellulose and Forest Products segments and the Company currently anticipates spending approximately $45 million on high-return projects in 2018, with an average pay-back of less than 2 years.\n“With the acquisition complete, we have greater product and geographic diversity within the high purity cellulose business which will reduce volatility through the cycle. Additionally, we are a stronger, more balanced business with greater scale to drive substantial value over the next several years,” Boynton continued, “Looking forward over the next 3 years, we see opportunities to deliver approximately $155 million of EBITDA growth through our strategic pillars, as we capture up to $75 million of synergies in costs and market optimization, leverage shared R&D capacity to create new products and re-invest capital into high return capital projects. We will also strive to maximize shareholder value through a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy focused on reducing leverage and providing strong risk-adjusted returns.”\nConference Call Information\nRayonier Advanced Materials Inc.

These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to each of their respective most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on Schedules C - D of this earnings release. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our board of directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.\nWe do not consider these non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they may exclude significant expenses and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expenses and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management provides reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon, in whole or part, in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of the Company.\nRayonier Advanced Materials Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income\nDecember 31, 2017 (Unaudited)\n(millions of dollars, except per share information)\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, September 23, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Sales $\n349\n$\n210\n$\n231\n$\n961\n$\n869\nCost of Sales (311 ) (179 ) (189 ) (822 ) (687 ) Gross Margin 38 31 42 139 182 Selling, general & administrative expenses (39 ) (13 ) (12 ) (80 ) (38 ) Other operating expense, net 1 — (4 ) (2 ) (6 ) Operating Income (Loss) — 18 26 57 138 Interest and other expense, net (12 ) (9 ) (9 ) (37 ) (35 ) Gain on bargain purchase 317 — — 317 — Gain (loss) on derivative instrument (8 ) 14 — 8 — Gain on debt extinguishment — — — — 9 Income Before Income Taxes 297 23 17 345 112 Income tax expense (2 ) (7 ) (6 ) (20 ) (39 ) Net Income Attributable to Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. $ 295 $ 16 $ 11 $ 325 $ 73 Mandatory convertible stock dividends (4 ) (4 ) (3 ) (14 ) (5 ) Net Income Available to Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc.
