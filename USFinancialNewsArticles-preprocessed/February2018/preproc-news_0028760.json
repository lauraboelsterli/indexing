    "text": "LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange said on Friday that volumes on short- and medium-dated carry trades rose in January following a reduction in trading fees last year.\nThe LME cut fees on short-dated carries in October and on medium-dated carries in November in a bid to revive volumes after total turnover on the exchange fell by 4.3 percent in 2015 and 7.7 percent in 2016.\nThe LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd , on Friday said average daily trading of short-dated carries was 4 percent higher in January than the daily average over the period from January to September last year, before fees were cut.\nIt said average daily volumes on medium-dated carries was 19 percent higher in January than the average over January to October last year. Medium-dated carry fees were cut one month later than the short-dated carries.\nCarry trades are used to link contracts that mature on different dates.\nReporting by Peter Hobson.
