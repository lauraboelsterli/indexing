    "text": "Incentives from Montgomery County, Gaithersburg and the State of Maryland helped facilitate the Relocation\nROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Applied Biomimetic, a leader in the convergence of polymer and protein membrane technologies, has relocated to Gaithersburg, Maryland, from Cincinnati, Ohio, setting up a corporate headquarters and R&D facility on Clopper Road.\nApplied Biomimetic has a patented, cutting-edge protein membrane technology that provides a superior water treatment and purification system with great potential in food/beverage manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and other areas. The company plans to add at least 30 full-time employees in its new location. The availability of strong biotech talent was instrumental in the decision to move to Montgomery County.\n“We are grateful for the support provided by the University of Cincinnati in hosting us and helping us develop our technology. After several years of research and incubation at their facilities, we achieved a level of scale in both research and manufacturing that required us to expand,” said Applied Biomimetic CEO, Steen Sondergaard Nissen. “After considering many locations, we chose the vibrant technology corridor of Gaithersburg, Maryland.”\nNissen credits the city and county for their support in making the transition possible, including fast tracking the permitting process and providing overall partnership and support. The Danish-owned company first planted its North American roots in Cincinnati in 2006.\nThe Montgomery County Economic Development Corporation (MCEDC), along with Gaithersburg and state partners, helped assist the move from Cincinnati. “We welcome Applied Biomimetic to Montgomery County,” said MCEDC President & CEO, David Petr. “The company’s unique combination of biotechnology and engineering has great potential to improve the water purification industry and others. Their work leverages Montgomery County’s strong biotech talents while expanding our industry reach. We see a great future in Montgomery County for this growing, innovative company.”\n“We are so pleased that Applied Biomimetic recognized Montgomery County’s advantages for both research and development and manufacturing,” noted Montgomery County Executive Ike Leggett.\n“Attracting and maintaining innovative biotechnology companies strengthens our community and adds to its vibrancy,” said Jud Ashman, Mayor of the City of Gaithersburg. “We look forward to welcoming Applied Biomimetic to Gaithersburg and witnessing its future growth.”\n“Applied Biomimetic is a great example of the innovative, young companies that we continue to attract to Maryland,” said Governor Larry Hogan. “Companies like this locating in our state reinforces our leadership in the life sciences and positions Maryland as a hub for the development of innovative treatments, diagnostics, and cures. We are excited to welcome Applied Biomimetic to Maryland.”\nJacob Vind, Danish Consul General & Head of the Danish Water Technology Alliance added, “At the Danish Trade Council we are working closely with Applied Biomimetic through our Water Technology Alliance in the US. We are happy to see our partners succeed, grow and expand their businesses, not only in Denmark but also here in the US. I’m proud that Danish companies are creating thousands of jobs all over the US and excited to see Applied Biomimetic contribute to those numbers.”\nTo facilitate the relocation, Applied Biomimetic received a $55,000 MOVE grant from Montgomery County; a $100,000 incentive from the Maryland Economic Development Assistance Fund; and $20,000 from the City of Gaithersburg from the Economic Development Tool Box.\nAbout Applied Biomimetic\nApplied Biomimetic is a leader in the convergence of polymer and protein membrane technology, and have developed a high-performance membrane platform for water, life science, enzyme, food, and dairy separation applications. Applied Biomimetic holds global patents for the concept of embedding proteins in a proprietary polymeric membrane structure.
