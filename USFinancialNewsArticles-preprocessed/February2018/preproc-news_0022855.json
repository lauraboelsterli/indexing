    "text": "OSLO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Norwegian salmon exports to China fell to 355 tonnes last week from 523 tonnes the previous week, but were up from just 15 tonnes in the corresponding week last year, data from Seafood Norway showed on Thursday.\nThe Chinese volumes remain small when compared to Norway’s overall salmon exports, which last week hit 17,306 tonnes.\nThe industry considers a recovery of salmon exports to the Chinese market as important, as output has risen this year and prices have fallen.\nIn late 2016, Norway and China began to normalise political and trading relations following a diplomatic row over the 2010 award of the Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident.\nSalmon exports to Vietnam rose year-on-year however, as the country had previously been seen as a backdoor to China.\nCombined for China and Vietnam, volumes last week rose to 784 tonnes from 403 tonnes in same week last year.\nThe European Union is by far the biggest export market for Norwegian salmon, buying 76 percent of volumes last week, down from 77 percent from the previous week.\nNorway’s average export price last week stood at 56.94 Norwegian crowns per kilo compared to 66.07 crowns in the same week of 2017, when total export volumes amounted to 14,550 tonnes.
