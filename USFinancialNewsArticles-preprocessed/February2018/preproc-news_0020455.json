    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Ford of Europe said it has applied for a German banking license in case the carmaker’s British bank is no longer allowed to offer services on a pan-European basis after Britain leaves the European Union.\n“The reason that Ford Credit Europe has submitted an application for a German banking license is to ensure it is able to provide ongoing support for Ford dealers and customers post-Brexit,” a company spokesman said in a statement on Friday.\nThe license application was first reported by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper on Thursday.\nReporting by Edward Taylor and Chris Steitz; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
