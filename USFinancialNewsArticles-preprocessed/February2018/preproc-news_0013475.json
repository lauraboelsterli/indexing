    "text": "Adam Henrique scored the overtime-winner, and the Anaheim Ducks made goalie Ryan Miller victorious in a return to the city in which he spent the bulk of his career in a 4-3 game Tuesday night at KeyBank Center in Buffalo, N.Y.\nMiller, the all-time winningest goalie in Sabres history, made 30 saves to collect the victory that snapped his team’s three-game losing skid.\nThree times leads were erased in a wild affair.\nBuffalo’s Zemgus Girgensons opened the scoring with a fluky shorthanded goal. Miller stopped a sharp-angled shot, and the puck bounced out to the side of the net, from where Girgensons simply whacked at it into the netminder and it banked into the cage.\nBut Rickard Rakell got that one back for the Ducks with a power-play goal just 21 seconds into the second period. Rakell hit the post with his rebound attempt, but the puck bounced off the leg of Buffalo goalie Robin Lehner and into the net. Rackell is riding a five-game point streak with four goals and five assists.\nJack Eichel put the Sabres ahead again late in the second period with a man-advantage marker, converting on a nifty touch-pass by Sam Reinhart, but Ondrej Kase tied it with 38.7 seconds remaining in the frame when his backhander dribbled over the line.\nCorey Perry was credited for a Sabres own goal midway through the third period after Ryan O‘Reilly tried to shoot away a puck from the edge of his crease only to put it in the net. O‘Reilly later made amends when he scored into the right net with 14.5 seconds remaining in regulation.\nPerry has only 10 goals on the season, but has collected two goals and six points in a three-game point streak.\nLehner stopped 29 shots in the loss.\nTo make the night a double disappointment for Buffalo, defenseman Jake McCabe left the game after the first period. He was hit by Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf late in the frame and didn’t return.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
