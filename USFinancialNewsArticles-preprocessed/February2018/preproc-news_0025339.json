    "text": "Denver-based firm closes its fourth platform\nDENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mountaingate Capital (Mountaingate) announced today that it has backed Minneapolis-based Bold Orange Company (Bold Orange), a human connections company that works to modernize loyalty, customer relationship management (CRM) and digital experiences for brands, in connection with its acquisition of Great Lakes Scrip Center (GLSC), the largest gift card fundraising company in the country.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180212005964/en/\nBold Orange’s founder and CEO, Margaret Murphy, recently launched Bold Orange with a two-fold purpose: to create business and societal progress. Bold Orange’s acquisition of the Grand Rapids, Mich., -based GLSC aligns directly with that mission. For more than two decades, GLSC has helped over 48,000 local organizations and nonprofits such as schools, community groups, sports teams, and churches raise more than $680 million for needs such as computers, tuition, band instruments, athletic equipment, or church operations all while driving $9 billion in revenue to retail partner brands.\n“Great Lakes Scrip Center has done a fantastic job of deepening connections among communities, loyal supporters and the brands they love, and we are excited to build on that legacy and drive greater engagement for our partner and retail organizations and the millions of families that are connected through this powerful network,” said Margaret Murphy. “Together with their talented team of employees, we plan to blend traditional scrip fundraising with a more modern digital experience – connecting with people in ways that are even easier, more relevant, and more meaningful.”\nGLSC works with local organizations to sell the branded gift cards to their supporters, who, in turn, use the cards to shop at their favorite stores, both online and at brick-and-mortar. A percentage of every gift card purchase is returned to the organization as a rebate and can be used to fund its initiatives. Thousands of private K-12 schools across the country also allow families to apply a portion of the funds they raise towards their family tuition.\nThe acquisition also allows Bold Orange to partner with companies on a deeper level, helping them not only to create a local community platform and drive sales through gift cards, but also to transform their own business through modern loyalty and CRM experiences. Bold Orange will be investing in the digital user experience and marketing tools to make GLSC even easier for organizations, their supporters, and brand partners to engage.\n“Great Lakes Scrip Center has built a powerful network of national and local brands, community based organizations, and dedicated families that has been disruptive to the fundraising industry. We are extremely bullish on the prospects for expanding this network under Margaret Murphy’s leadership and will be investing aggressively to support her efforts at Bold Orange to execute our shared vision,” said Colton King, Mountaingate managing director.\nAbout Mountaingate Capital\nMountaingate Capital is a private equity firm based in Denver that specializes in building and empowering lower middle market companies with strong growth potential and engaged leadership teams.
