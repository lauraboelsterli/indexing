    "text": "U.S. Treasury yields fell in midday Friday trading as traders bet on fewer rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield briefly fell below 2.80 percent to a low of 2.788 percent, and traded near 2.81 percent as of 12:58 p.m., ET. On Thursday, the yield came close to a 4-year high of 2.885 percent that had helped trigger Monday's stock market sell-off. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nThe rate-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield fell to near 2.05 percent.\nAs measured by CME's fed funds futures, the probability of a June rate hike fell below 50 percent from near 55 percent a week ago. Markets were still expecting a quarter-point hike in March.\n\"Any more weakness in stocks may have some believing it will slow the Fed's rate increases,\" said Bryce Doty, senior vice president of Sit Fixed Income Advisors.\nU.S. stocks traded nearly 1 percent lower or more Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average tracking for its worst week since Oct. 10, 2008, during the financial crisis. The S&P 500 hit its lowest level since late October.\nSymbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR --- \"Short-term we've begun to see a little bit of conflict, whether bond markets go down or go up [with stocks],\" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. Tipp added that a major event for the week was to see how markets handled new supply of bonds.\n\"If you get a little outperformance at the back end of the market that may be a good sign that maybe the markets are hitting a clearing level,\" he said.\nThe yield on the 30-year Treasury bond traded little changed near 3.13 percent, after hitting Thursday a high of 3.168 percent, its highest level since March 15.\nIn economic news, U.S. wholesale inventories rose a more-than-expected 0.4 percent in December.\n\"Quite honestly, getting to 3 [percent] or a little higher wouldn't be surprising to us\" on the 10-year yield, said Craig Bishop, lead strategist, U.S. Fixed Income Strategies Group at RBC Wealth Management. But \"at this point it'll take another piece of economic data to do that.\"\n\"At current levels with Treasurys the yields aren't significantly higher enough to cause a big shift from equities into bonds,\" Bishop said, noting that level for him stands around 3.75 percent or 3.5 percent. \"There's a lot of activity, a lot of noise, but our view on rates hasn't changed. We don't expect a significant spike in rates.\"\nVolatile trading continued across markets worldwide. Asian stocks dropped Friday, with the Nikkei 225 falling more than 2 percent. Major European stock markets traded more than 1 percent lower as of Friday morning New York time.\nOn Thursday, U.S. stocks finished deep in the red with the S&P 500 officially in correction territory, or more than 10 percent from a recent high, as higher interest rates continued to weigh on sentiment.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average finished the session down 1,032.89 points at 23,860.46 — also entering correction territory . In addition, developments in the political space have been keeping investors on edge.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nIt became apparent late Thursday that parts of the U.S. government would be entering a shutdown , after the Senate failed to secure the passing of a spending bill by the midnight deadline.\nDuring Friday's early hours, however, the Senate managed to pass a short-term funding bill , paving the way for an increase in military and domestic spending. The House also decided to pass the bill and send it to President Donald Trump for it to be signed — helping end the brief government shutdown.\nNo U.S. Treasury auctions or Federal Reserve policymaker speeches are scheduled for Friday.\n—CNBC's Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report",
