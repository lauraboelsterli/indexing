(Photo: Business Wire)\nChristian Olivier is an accomplished executive with an extensive track record leading profitable business units, managing multi-site product development and manufacturing operations, as well as large go-to-market organizations in the telecommunications and high-tech industry.\nBefore joining Sigfox, Christian held General Management roles at blue chip companies including Alcatel, ST Microelectronics, Teledyne e2v, and Esterline. He recently led Global Business Development at Aversan, a defense and aerospace company. Christian also founded and ran his own consulting firm, providing international development and management expertise to technology players across North America, Asia, and Europe.\nSince joining Sigfox, Christian has focused on accelerating market adoption in the United States, implementing a regional strategy, targeting system integrators and solution providers who intimately know the region and customer needs. Christian is resolved to continue the United States network rollout momentum, expanding coverage in the 19 plus regions Sigfox is deployed in and is committed to finding non-traditional nationwide deployment site opportunities to expedite coverage. In his new role, Christian piloted coverage as a service (CaaS) for customers with viable use cases outside of coverage areas. To encourage device ecosystem growth, Christian is working with South America Sigfox operators to bundle the Americas, RCZ-2 and RCZ-4, to generate business value for use cases across these two zones.\n\"Christian is uniquely qualified to tackle the challenges and opportunities in the United States market. With his breadth of experiences, he will usher tremendous progress in the United States, adding to what will be an exciting and successful year for the company,” said Ludovic Le Moan, Co-Founder, and CEO of Sigfox.\n“I’m looking forward to driving significant progress in the United States for Sigfox,” said Christian Olivier, President of Sigfox USA. “We are strongly positioned to enable our customers’ IOT use cases in key verticals, thanks to our low power cost efficient technology, value proposition, and our network coverage that will continue its expansion in 2018 across the United States.”\nAbout Sigfox\nSigfox is the world’s leading provider of connectivity for the Internet of Things (IoT). The company has built a global network to connect billions of devices to the Internet while consuming as little energy as possible, as simply as possible. Sigfox’s unique approach to device-to-cloud communications addresses the three greatest barriers to global IoT adoption: cost, energy consumption, and global scalability.\nToday, the network is present in 45 countries and on track to cover 60 by 2018. With millions of objects connected and a rapidly growing partner ecosystem, Sigfox empowers companies to move their business model towards more digital services. Founded in 2010 by Ludovic Le Moan and Christophe Fourtet, the company is headquartered in Labège near Toulouse, France’s “IoT Valley”. Sigfox also has offices in Paris, Madrid, Munich, Boston, San Francisco, Dubai, Singapore, Sao Paulo, and Tokyo.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220005603/en/\nSigfox North America\nKristi Mason, +1-603-493-7038\nCommunications Director\nkristi.mason@sigfox.com\nor\nEdelman for Sigfox\nJames Cook, +1-212-738-6085\nJames.Cook@edelman.com\nSource: Sigfox",
