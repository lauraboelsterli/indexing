    "text": "OMAHA, Neb., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Valmont Industries, Inc. (NYSE: VMI), a leading global provider of engineered products and services for infrastructure development and irrigation equipment and services for agriculture, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.\nFourth Quarter\nYear-to-date\nSummarized Financial Information\n13/14 Weeks Ended\n52/53 Weeks Ended\n30-Dec-17\n31-Dec-16\n30-Dec-17\n31-Dec-16\nNet sales\n$ 714,978\n$ 674,575\n$ 2,745,967\n$ 2,521,676\nOperating income\n63,717\n56,093\n266,432\n243,504\nOperating income as a % of net sales GAAP\n8.9%\n8.3%\n9.7%\n9.7%\nOperating income-Adjusted 1\n63,717\n63,434\n266,432\n255,929\nOperating income as a % of net sales Adjusted 1\n8.9%\n9.4%\n9.7%\n10.1%\nNet earnings (loss) - GAAP\n(3,611)\n70,064\n116,240\n173,232\nNet earnings - Adjusted 1\n38,166\n36,343\n158,412\n145,767\nDiluted EPS - GAAP net earnings\n$ (0.16)\n$ 3.10\n$ 5.11\n$ 7.63\nAverage shares outstanding - Diluted\n22,565\n22,611\n22,738\n22,709\nDiluted EPS - Adjusted net earnings 1\n$ 1.67\n$ 1.61\n$ 6.97\n$ 6.42\nAverage shares outstanding - Diluted\n22,801\n22,611\n22,738\n22,709\nFourth Quarter Highlights:\nRevenues increased 6.0% to $715.0 million with sales increases in all reportable segments Volumes were higher in the Irrigation and Utility Support Structures segments, partially offset by volume declines in Engineered Support Structures and the grinding media business GAAP operating income increased 13.6% to $63.7 million. On an adjusted basis, operating income was comparable to 2016 Inflationary cost pressures resulted in a $3 million incremental impact from LIFO inventory valuation expense compared to 2016 GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.16 compared to earnings per share (EPS) of $3.10 in 2016 ($1.67 and $1.61 adjusted). 1 GAAP results for 2017 include a $42 million tax expense resulting from the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") 1\nFull Year Highlights:\nFull year revenues increased 9.0%, reflecting higher sales in all reportable segments, the first full year of sales growth since 2013 Higher volumes in the Utility and Irrigation segments, partial price recovery of raw material costs across all reportable segments, and favorable foreign currency translation, led to the revenue increase GAAP operating income increased $22.9 million to $266.4 million, (increased $10.5 million from $255.9 million adjusted in 2016) 1 GAAP diluted EPS was $5.11, down 33% compared to $7.63 last year ($6.97, up 8.6% compared to $6.42 adjusted in 2016) 1 Productivity improvements and cost reductions were not enough to fully offset lagging recoveries of zinc and steel costs throughout the year Total year operating cash flows were $145.7 million and capital expenditures were $55.3 million, resulting in free cash flow of $90.4 million\nResegmentation\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company modified its management and reporting structure to four segments, eliminating the former Energy and Mining as a reporting segment. This reflects a reduced dependency on the energy and mining end-markets, and the pending divestiture of the grinding media business, subject to regulatory approval. The following changes were made:\nAccess Systems is now reported in the Engineered Support Structures Segment The offshore structures business is included in the Utility Support Structures Segment, and Grinding media is reported in \"Other,\" pending its divestiture.\nImpact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nFourth quarter earnings include a $42 million, or $1.84 1 per diluted share, expense for the estimated impact of the recently enacted TCJA. This is comprised of:\n$20.4 million of expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets at a lower rate $21.6 million of expense related to the taxation of unremitted foreign earnings, including anticipated withholding taxes on foreign dividends\nFourth Quarter Summary\n\"We achieved solid results for the quarter despite some headwinds,\" said Stephen G. Kaniewski, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Strong underlying demand in North America utility and international irrigation drove higher sales. The Coatings Segment successfully recovered higher zinc costs, but the Engineered Support Structures Segment was challenged to fully recover inflationary costs. As expected, the grinding media business was faced with lower volumes, and difficulties fully recovering steel costs, similar to prior quarters.\"\n\"One particular challenge we faced was rapid inflation of raw material costs. On balance, sales price increases and productivity improvements mitigated the impact of inflation on earnings. We believe we managed well through these challenges.\"\nFourth Quarter Segment Review\nInfrastructure-related\nEngineered Support Structures (35.0% of Sales)\nPoles, towers and components for the global lighting, traffic and wireless communication markets, engineered access systems, and highway safety products.\nSales of $250.1 million were 2.4% higher than last year. Higher highway safety product sales in Australia, were partly offset by lower sales of lighting, traffic and wireless communication structures globally. Access Systems revenues were similar to last year.\nIn North America, sales of lighting and traffic structures were lower, due to a decline in non-residential construction. An initiative by the Australian government to improve roadway safety resulted in increased sales of our highway safety products in that region. In Europe, lighting sales were up slightly.\nGlobal wireless communication structures revenues were lower. Increases in North America were more than offset by significantly lower sales in China. One particular challenge we faced in China, were government mandates to reduce pollution, leading to cuts in steel production and telecom demand.\nOperating income was $16.3 million or 6.5% of sales, compared to $16.5 million, or 6.8% of sales in 2016, ($22.7 million and 9.3% adjusted). 1 Despite the modest increase in sales, operating income as a percentage of sales was lower. Unfavorable sales mix was only partially offset by productivity improvements.\nUtility Support Structures (34.0% of Sales)\nSteel and concrete structures for the global electric utility industry, wind and offshore structures.\nSales of $243.4 million increased 14.0%, driven by continued strong demand in North America and price recovery of increased steel costs. International sales were lower than last year due to a large project in the fourth quarter of 2016 that did not repeat.\nOperating income increased to $28.4 million or 11.7% of sales, compared to $22.6 million or 10.6% of sales in 2016. Increased volume, factory productivity, and SG&A leverage were the major contributors to improved profitability.\nCoatings Segment (11.6% of Sales)\nGlobal galvanizing, painting and anodizing services.\nSales of $83.0 million were up 10.1% compared to last year. Increased sales to other Valmont segments, improving market conditions in Australia, and pricing to recover zinc cost increases led to the sales gain.\nOperating income was $14.1 million, or 17.0% of sales compared to $9.5 million, or 12.5% of sales in 2016, ($9.8 million and 13.0% adjusted). 1 Pricing actions to recover inflation, and favorable SG&A comparisons drove profitability gains. In the Asia Pacific region, productivity improvements, and volume recoveries, further contributed to profitability improvement.\nAgriculture-related\nIrrigation Segment (20.9% of Sales)\nAgricultural irrigation equipment, parts, services and tubular products.\nGlobal irrigation sales of $149.5 million were 9.4% higher than last year, mainly driven by project activity and elevated demand in our core international markets. Sales in North America were comparable to 2016.\nOperating income was $18.3 million or 12.2% of sales, compared to $15.7 million or 11.5% last year, ($16.2 million and 11.9% adjusted). 1 The increase in operating income was the result of improved volume leverage in our factories and pricing actions amid increased inflation.\nOther (2.2% of sales)\nManufacture of forged steel grinding media for the mining industry\nSales in grinding media were $15.8 million compared to $21.9 million in 2016, a decline of 28%. Fourth-quarter operating loss was $1.6 million compared to operating income of $2.1 million in 2016. As announced last August, the divestiture of the grinding media business is pending and subject to regulatory approval.\n2018 Restructuring Plan\nThe Company is planning to restructure certain operations in 2018, primarily in the Engineered Support Structures segment, through consolidation and other cost-reduction activities. A pre-tax charge of $10 million is expected, of which $8.5 million is cash expenses. We anticipate these expenses to be recovered through lower operating costs within 12-18 months of their occurrence. We will continue our ongoing efforts to reduce costs as appropriate and further improve productivity.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company is issuing 2018 annual guidance of GAAP diluted EPS to be approximately $7.70, and adjusted diluted EPS to be approximately $8.00. Adjusted EPS does not include the impacts of the 2018 Restructuring Plan. Any effects from the divestiture of the grinding media business or potential acquisitions have not been included in the earnings guidance\nAssumptions:\nRevenue growth of 7%, excluding the impact from the divestiture of the grinding media business and any potential acquisitions Inflationary environment in raw material costs will continue through the year, which are expected to be mostly offset by pricing actions, cost reductions, and productivity improvements. Inflation assumptions do not include potential tariffs and quotas enacted by the U.S. Department of Commerce Modest positive impact from foreign exchange translation Tax rate of 25%\n\"We expect sales and earnings growth in 2018,\" said Mr. Kaniewski. \"We also anticipate continued challenges from an inflationary environment, particularly in steel and freight. We will strive to recover these increases through strategic pricing actions and ongoing efforts to improve productivity.\"\n\"The current global economic recovery should produce modest growth for the Engineered Support Structures and Coatings segments. Continued good market conditions in Utility support a positive outlook. Expected growth in our Irrigation business will be driven by international markets, with modest growth in North America.\"\nAn audio discussion of Valmont's fourth quarter results will be available live by Telephone by dialing 1-877-493-2981 and entering Conference ID#:2874769 or via Webcast at 8:00 a.m. CST February 22, 2018 at https://engage.vevent.com/rt/valmontindustries_ao~2874769\nA replay is available through the above link or by telephone (855) 859-2056 or (404) 537-3406, Conference ID#: 2874769 beginning February 22, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. CST through 12:00 p.m. CST on March 1, 2018.

The access systems applications product line is now part of the Engineered Support Structures (\"ESS\") segment and the offshore and other complex structures product line is now part of the Utility Support Structures segment. Grinding media will be reported in \"Other\" pending the completion of its divestiture.\nThe backlog of orders for the principal products manufactured and marketed was $670 million at the end of fiscal 2017 and $603 million at the end of the 2016 fiscal year. We anticipate that most of the backlog of orders will be filled filled during fiscal year 2018. At year-end, the segments with backlog were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\n30-Dec-17\n31-Dec-16\nEngineered Support Structures\n$204\n$190\nUtility Support Structures\n359\n336\nIrrigation\n100\n64\nCoatings\n-\n-\nOther\n7\n13\n$ 670\n$ 603\nValmont has aggregated its business segments into four reportable segments as follows.\nEngineered Support Structures: This segment consists of the manufacture of engineered metal and composite structures and components for global lighting and traffic, wireless communication, access systems and roadway safety.\nUtility Support Structures: This segment consists of the manufacture of engineered steel and concrete structures for the global utility industry and offshore and other complex steel structures used in energy generation and distribution outside the United States.\nCoatings: This segment consists of global galvanizing, painting and anodizing services.\nIrrigation: This segment consists of the manufacture of agricultural irrigation equipment and related parts and services worldwide and tubular products for industrial customers.\nIn addition to these four reportable segments, the Company had other businesses and activities that individually are not more than 10% of consolidated sales, operating income or assets. This includes the manufacture of forged steel grinding media for the mining industry and is reported in the \"Other\" category.\nVALMONT INDUSTRIES, INC.
