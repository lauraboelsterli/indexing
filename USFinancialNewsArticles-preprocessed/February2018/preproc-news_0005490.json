    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- IPG Mediabrands announced today that it has appointed media industry vet Graham Moysey to CEO, IPG Mediabrands Canada, heading up the company’s operations in the region from its Toronto headquarters. He officially starts on February 12 th and replaces Harvey Carroll. Mr. Moysey will report to Jim Hytner, COO of IPG Mediabrands.\nIn his new role, Moysey will be responsible for setting and advocating the strategic vision for the Canadian market, ensuring the highest standard of client service throughout the enterprise, strengthening existing client relationships as well as opening new ones.\n“Graham has delivered strong results wherever he has worked. His proven track record of success in Canada, as well as his wealth of global experience, make him the perfect person to take the helm of one of our most successful markets,” said Hytner. “I also want to thank Harvey for all he’s done to move our Canada business forward and the success he has brought us over the past four years.”\nMoysey brings over twenty years of digital and media experience to his new position. For the last five years, he held the position of Head of International for AOL (now Oath), where he was responsible for all revenue and consumer engagement for the company’s non-U.S. business. He managed teams across 12 core markets and the fastest growing revenue portfolio within the company. Under his leadership, the company doubled the size of its non-U.S. business.\nPrior to that role, Moysey was General Manager for AOL Canada, promoting the AOL brand and conducting a strategic review of the divisions to maximize both customer satisfaction and growth of the business. Earlier stints include serving as Head of Digital for Canwest, spearheading all revenue, product and digital strategies for the company’s publishing and broadcast divisions and Vice President of Sales and Business Development for Bell Canada where he played an instrumental role in building the Sympatico and MSN strategic alliance.\n“As I was considering my next career step, I was attracted to the breadth and scope of opportunity afforded by this role,” said Moysey. “Thanks to Harvey and the entire leadership team across the IPG Mediabrands portfolio, this is one of the most transparent, independent and forward-thinking players in the market. With its programmatic offering coupled with massive investments in data and analytics, Mediabrands sits at the center of the most dynamic part of the evolving consumer and media landscape. I couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity to work alongside the Canadian and global teams as we help clients achieve their business results.”\nMoysey is a former Director of the Interactive Advertising Bureau and currently sits on the board of WE.org .\nAbout IPG Mediabrands\nIPG Mediabrands was founded by Interpublic Group (NYSE: IPG) in 2007 to manage all of its global media related assets.
