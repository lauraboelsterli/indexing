    "text": "LURAY, Va., Feb. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Blue Ridge Bankshares, Inc. (OTC Pink: BRBS), parent company of Blue Ridge Bank, N.A., announced today its unaudited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company reported net income of $3,350,124 for 2017, or $1.22 per common share, compared to 2016 net income of $688,728, or $0.31 per common share. The Company declared a dividend of $0.08 during the fourth quarter of 2017, which is an increase of 2.17% compared to the 2016 fourth quarter dividend of $0.0783. The dividend yield is 1.79% based on the February 2, 2018 share price.\nThe Company reported its highest ever annual net income in 2017 as a result of the acquisition of River Bancorp, Inc., though balance sheet growth fell short of expected growth. Loan growth in 2017 was weaker than expected, which resulted from a combination of a very competitive loan marketplace and growth efforts being diverted into merger integration activities. Certain deposits were allowed to roll off as well in conjunction with loan demand experienced during the year. Notably, loan demand in the fourth quarter picked up and the Company sees a stronger loan pipeline heading into 2018.\nOne-time events impacted fourth quarter and annual earnings. The reduction in the corporate income tax rate created a deferred income tax asset write-down of approximately $200,000. Also, the Company purchased a consumer loan pool in the fourth quarter for which it funded all anticipated losses in the allowance for loan losses of $285,000. Lastly, the Company had an additional $60,000 in expenses associated with the purchase of a majority stake in a payroll processing company which is expected to enhance noninterest income and net income in 2018 and beyond.\nFinancial Highlights (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n12/31/17\n12/31/16\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nNet income\n$\n286\n(405)\n$\n3,350\n689\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n286\n(405)\n$\n3,350\n689\nEarnings per Common Share\n$\n0.10\n(0.18)\n$\n1.22\n0.31\nDividend per Common Share\n$\n0.0800\n0.0783\n$\n0.320\n0.313\nKey Ratios\nTotal stockholders' equity to assets\n8.59%\n8.04%\n8.59%\n8.04%\nCommon stockholders' equity to assets\n8.59%\n8.04%\n8.59%\n8.04%\nNet Interest Margin (bank level)\n3.88%\n3.62%\n4.13%\n4.04%\nReturn on Average Assets (annualized)\n0.27%\n(0.47%)\n0.80%\n0.20%\nReturn on Average Equity (annualized)\n3.27%\n(5.61%)\n9.56%\n2.39%\nBalance At\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nTotal assets\n$\n424,121\n418,124\nNet loans held for investment\n$\n328,002\n317,614\nDeposits\n$\n339,290\n340,874\nTotal stockholders' equity\n$\n36,442\n33,627\nCommon stockholders' equity\n$\n36,442\n33,627\nBook value per common share\n$\n13.18\n12.29\nTangible book value per common share\n$\n11.76\n11.25\nNumber of common stock shares outstanding\n2,765,635\n2,737,136\nNumber of weighted average common shares\nOutstanding\n2,751,503\n2,227,501\nPrior year per share data adjusted for 3-for-2 stock split.\n\"It was a year of significant change for our Company as we integrated the acquisition of River Bancorp, Inc. from late 2016, which included the addition of a mortgage division as a significant noninterest income enhancement to our earnings model,\" stated President and Chief Executive Officer Brian K.
