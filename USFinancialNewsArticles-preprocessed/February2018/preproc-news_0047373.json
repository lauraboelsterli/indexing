The departure comes after the government earlier this month said it would examine documents related to the hiring of advisers, after media reports revealed the company’s main restructuring advisers, U.S.-based firm AlixPartners, had hired Ramljak’s former firm as a local consultant in devising the restructuring programme. “I file irrevocable resignation in order not to be the main obstacle in reaching an agreement (with creditors),” Ramljak said in a statement.
