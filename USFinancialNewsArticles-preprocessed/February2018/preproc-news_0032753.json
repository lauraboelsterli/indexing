    "text": "ROME, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Telecoms firms in Italy have lost an appeal against a ruling that bills must be issued monthly rather than at shorter intervals, to avoid over-charging customers, a consumer group said on Monday.\nOperators Wind Tre, Telecom Italia, Vodafone and Fastweb had all appealed against a ruling that they must stop issuing bills every 28 days, but instead count solar months.\nConsumer group Movimento Consumatori said on its website that the regional court in Lazio, whose principal city is Rome, had rejected the appeal.\nThe ruling Democratic Party banned 28-day billing periods last year, saying they force customers to pay the equivalent of 13 monthsâ€™ worth of bills.
