    "text": "ANDOVER, Mass., Feb. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mercury Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRCY) ( www.mrcy.com ) today announced that Michael D. Ruppert, Mercury’s Executive Vice President, Strategy & Corporate Development, has been named Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer effective immediately. Mr. Ruppert, 44, joined Mercury in 2014 as Senior Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development.\n“We are pleased to have Mike assume the CFO role,” said Mark Aslett, Mercury’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “In this capacity, he will run the combined finance and M&A teams building tighter linkages between our corporate development, finance and accounting activities as we seek to continue our record of organic and acquisition-related growth. Mike’s experience in strategy, corporate finance, capital markets and acquisitions, coupled with his in-depth knowledge of Mercury’s businesses, including recent acquisitions, makes him especially well-suited for this position. This change did not arise from any issues involving the Company’s business practices, internal controls, financial reporting procedures or financial results, which are meeting our expectations. We remain confident in our recent guidance for Mercury’s fiscal 2018 third quarter and year,” Aslett concluded.\nMr. Ruppert succeeds Gerald D. Haines, who assumed the role of Mercury’s Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in 2014 after having joined the company in 2010 as head of Corporate Development. “We greatly appreciate Gerry’s commitment and service to Mercury during his time with the company, and wish him the very best in his future endeavors,” said Aslett.\nMercury Systems – Innovation That Matters ™\nMercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY) is a leading commercial provider of secure sensor and safety-critical processing subsystems.
