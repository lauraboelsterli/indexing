    "text": "(Adds hiring of investment bank for potential stake sale)\nSAO PAULO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Brazilian online bank Banco Intermedium has hired an investment bank to look for potential buyers for a stake while it also explores an initial public offering, two people with knowledge of the matter said.\nAccording to the sources, Inter, as the bank is known, has hired the Brazilian subsidiary of Japan’s Nomura Securities International to sound out investors, simultaneously with a potential listing on Brazil’s stock exchange.\nAmong investors contacted by Nomura were unnamed buyout firms that usually invest in Brazil, the sources added.\nThe simultaneous efforts to sell a stake to investors and list the company are intended to identify the best deal. Inter filed on Friday for an initial public offering with Brazilian securities regulator CVM.\nBanco Inter and Nomura declined to comment.\nUnder the regulatory filing, the bank said it would issue new shares and its controlling shareholders, members of Brazil’s Menin family, will also sell shares.\nThe proceeds will be used by Inter to expand its loan book and for potential acquisions.\nThe Menin family, which controls the bank, is also controlling shareholder in homebuilder MRV Engenharia e Participações SA.\nInvestment banking units of Banco Bradesco SA, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc and Banco do Brasil SA have been hired to coordinate the offering. .\nIn December, Inter had 380,000 clients, 3.5 billion reais ($1.1 billion) in assets and 383 million reais in net equity. In 2017, its return on equity was 13 percent. ($1 = 3.2440 reais) (Reporting by Carolina Mandl; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Cynthia Osterman)\n ",
