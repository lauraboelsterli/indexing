Many companies still deal with price pressures due to heavy competition, leaving little room for higher wages.”\nWage growth in many rich countries has failed to pick up even as unemployment falls, stumping many economists. The rise of automation and increasing global competition are seen as contributing to the weak rise in pay.\nHowever, pay talks now taking place in Germany are expected to end years of wage restraint in Europe’s biggest economy, potentially helping the European Central Bank get euro zone inflation back up to its target rate of just below 2 percent.\nRECORD RESULTS Randstad beat analyst expectations on Tuesday with a 15 percent rise in fourth-quarter core earnings, to 307 million euros, and an 8 percent increase in sales to 5.98 billion euros.\n“We achieved record results in 2017 and the trend continued into 2018”, Van de Kraats said. “We see growth continuing in all regions, with especially strong demand in manufacturing and export sectors.”\nRandstad shares were up 2.8 percent at 56.42 at 0935 GMT, leading the slightly negative blue chip AEX index in Amsterdam.\n“Revenue grew strongly, following another strong European result”, KBC Securities analyst Bart Cuypers said. “Positive evolutions have been converted into a record high dividend.”\nRandstad said its dividend for 2017 would be up 46 percent over a year earlier, at a record high of 2.76 euros per share, as net profit for the year rose 10 percent to 756 million euros.
