    "text": "Unilever reported a bigger-than-expected acceleration in fourth-quarter sales growth on Thursday helped by a step-up in emerging markets that saw the consumer goods maker end its tumultuous year on a higher note.\nThe maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream - which spent most of last year reviewing its business after rebuffing a $143 billion takeover bid in February - said underlying sales rose 4 percent. Analysts on average were expecting 3.7 percent, according to a company-supplied consensus.\nshow chapters We're developing our own brands, but also complementing our portfolio: Unilever CEO 10 Hours Ago | 00:38 That marks an improvement from 3 percent in the first half and 2.6 percent in the third quarter.\nFor the full year, underlying earnings per share were 2.24 euros, above analysts expectations for 2.21 euros per share.\nLooking ahead, the company forecast underlying sales growth of 3 to 5 percent for 2018 and an improvement in underlying operating margin and cash flow that will keep it on track for its 2020 targets.",
