    "text": "GENEVA, Feb 26 (Reuters) - South Sudan is likely to return to famine within months, with 155,000 people likely to be in a catastrophic situation between May and July, a survey by a technical working group including South Sudanese and U.N. officials said on Monday.\nThe survey said 5.3 million people, 48 percent of the population, were already in “crisis” or “emergency” - stages three and four on a five point scale - and 155,000 could be at stage five, a famine, later this year.
