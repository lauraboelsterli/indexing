    "text": "GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo.—Republican Rep. Mike Coffman couldn’t get to the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance at a town-hall event Tuesday evening before his constituents made it clear he was in for a rough night.\nPresident Donald Trump, deeply unpopular with Democrats and independents, presents challenges for the Colorado congressman in this competitive district. But it was Mr. Coffman’s own views on gun laws, not the GOP president or his policies, that provoked the ire of many constituents who showed up.\n... RELATED VIDEO 20 Years of School Shootings Since 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths.
