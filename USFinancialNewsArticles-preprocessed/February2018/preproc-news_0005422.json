    "text": "(Reuters) - Profile of the New England Patriots, who will play the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl on Sunday in Minneapolis.\nFounded: 1959. The Pats, as they are commonly known, joined the American Football League in 1959 as the Boston Patriots. In 1971 they moved to Foxborough, Massachusetts, and became the New England Patriots.\n- - AFC titles (season): 10 (1985, 1996, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2017).\n- - Super Bowl titles (season): 5 (2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016)\n- - Head coach: Bill Belichick. Has won five Super Bowls and eight AFC championships with the Patriots. The NFL’s longest-tenured active head coach, Belichick ranks first in all-time playoff victories with 28.\n- - Starting quarterback: Tom Brady. Like his coach, Brady has won five Super Bowls and eight AFC titles. He has also won four Super Bowl most valuable player awards and been selected for 13 Pro Bowls. He holds the NFL record for most postseason touchdown passes (68) and his eight Super Bowl appearances are a record for a starting quarterback.\n- - Leading receiver: Rob Gronkowski. Caught 69 passes for 1,084 yards and eight touchdowns during regular season.\n- - Leading rusher: Dion Lewis. Rushed 180 times for 896 yards and six touchdowns during regular season.\n- - Fun Facts\n- Upon relocating to Foxborough the team adopted the “Bay State Patriots” moniker that was quickly changed to New England Patriots given the unfortunate “B.S. Patriots” abbreviation.\n- The Patriots have not had a losing season since 2000, the year before Brady took over as the team’s starting quarterback.\n- Brady was only a sixth-round pick in the 2000 NFL draft, taken with the 199th overall pick. Six other teams drafted quarterbacks before Brady was selected.\n- Patriots are worth an estimated $3.7 billion, second among the NFL’s 32 teams, according to a September Forbes estimate.\n- - Famous Patriots of all-time\n- Tom Brady: Considered by many to be the National Football League’s greatest quarterback of all-time, Brady owns a slew of NFL records to go along with his five Super Bowl victories and is a sure-fire first-ballot Hall of Fame player when he becomes eligible for induction.\n- Rob Gronkowski: No tight end has ever had a greater impact on the game of football as Gronkowski. At 6-foot-6 (198 cm) and 265 pounds (120 kg), the towering tight end is a mismatch against every opponent he faces and has proven equally dangerous as a blocker.\n- John Hannah: Considered one of the best offensive linemen to play in the NFL, Hannah, an offensive guard, was a nine-time Pro Bowl selection while competing for the Patriots from 1973 through 1985. He entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1991.\n- Mike Hayes: A cornerback and punt returner, Hayes was named to the Pro Bowl six times in seven years (1976-82) with the Patriots before playing for the Oakland Raiders. Was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997.\n- Andre Tippett: The talented linebacker was the AFC defensive player of the year in 1985. He totaled a franchise record 35 sacks for the 1984-55 seasons and had 100 for his career between 1982-93. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2008.\n- - Team name and colors: Patriots name selected in public contest with a drawing of a Minuteman preparing to snap a football the original logo. Once called the Boston Patriots, the team changed its name to New England Patriots after moving to Foxborough outside of Boston in 1971. Colors: Nautical blue, New Century Silver, Red and White.\n- - Most famous supporter: Boston-born actor and producer Mark Wahlberg is a routine guest inside Patriots owner Robert Kraft’s luxury box, has been on the sidelines for many games and has appeared with good friend Tom Brady in “Entourage” and “Ted 2.”\n- - 2017 regular season record: 13-3, won AFC East division\nWeek 1 - vs Kansas City, lost 42-27\nWeek 2 - at New Orleans, won 36-20\nWeek 3 - vs Houston, won 36-33\nWeek 4 - vs Carolina, lost 33-30\nWeek 5 - at Tampa Bay, won 19-14\nWeek 6 - at New York Jets, won 24-17\nWeek 7 - vs Atlanta, won 23-7\nWeek 8 - vs Los Angeles Chargers, won 21-13\nWeek 9 - Bye week\nWeek 10 - at Denver, won 41-16\nWeek 11 - at Oakland, won 33-8\nWeek 12 - vs Miami, won 35-17\nWeek 13 - at Buffalo, won 23-3\nWeek 14 - at Miami, lost 27-20\nWeek 15 - at Pittsburgh, won 27-24\nWeek 16 - vs Buffalo, won 37-16\nWeek 17 - vs New York, won 26-6\n- - AFC playoff seeding: 1\nPath to the Super Bowl- First round bye; beat Tennessee 35-14 in divisional round; beat Jacksonville 24-20 in AFC Championship.\nReporting by Frank Pingue, editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
