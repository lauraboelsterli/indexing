    "text": "MOUNT LAUREL, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PHH Corporation (NYSE: PHH):\nHighlights:\nNet loss attributable to PHH Corporation of $49 million or $1.49 per basic share, which includes a $30 million unfavorable impact from federal tax reform, $18 million of pre-tax operating losses related to PLS and $13 million pre-tax expenses related to Exit and disposal costs that were partially offset by $16 million of favorable pre-tax notable items. Entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of the Company to Ocwen Financial Corporation at a price of $360 million, or $11.00 per share on a fully-diluted basis. Updates estimate of potential excess cash (1) to $635 million from $655 million, which includes $301 million of share repurchases completed in 2017. The update to the estimate is due to the impact of federal tax reform, which was partially offset by lower liquidity earmarks and certain other cash inflows. Our Total Servicing Portfolio was comprised of 671,790 loans serviced representing $148 billion of unpaid principal balance, including 629,174 loans in our subservicing portfolio.\nSummary Consolidated Results (In millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Results Net revenues $ 109 $ 72 $ 456 $ 622 Loss before income taxes (7 ) (206 ) (273 ) (304 ) Net loss attributable to PHH Corporation (49 ) (133 ) (217 ) (202 ) Basic & Diluted loss per share attributable to PHH Corporation $ (1.49 ) $ (2.49 ) $ (4.62 ) $ (3.77 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding — Basic & Diluted shares 32.631 53.659 46.912 53.627 Non-GAAP Results* Core loss (pre-tax) $ (22 ) $ (151 ) $ (284 ) $ (223 ) Core loss (after-tax) (48 ) (100 ) (210 ) (147 ) Core loss per share $ (1.44 ) $ (1.86 ) $ (4.47 ) $ (2.74 ) (1)\nThe amount of excess cash is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the execution of the sale of our remaining MSRs committed for sale and the related servicing advances, the monetization of our investment in PHH Home Loans, the successful completion of our PLS exit activities, the resolution of our outstanding legal and regulatory matters and the successful completion of other restructuring and capital management activities in accordance with our assumptions. There can be no assurances that the actions will result in the amount of estimated excess cash.\n*\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: Core earnings or loss (pre-tax), core earnings or loss (after-tax) and core earnings or loss per share are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). See the “Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a detailed description and reconciliation of such Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as required by Regulation G.\nNotable items, Exit and disposal costs and net MSRs fair value adjustments included the following:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Pre-Tax Post-Tax Pre-Tax Post-Tax $ Per Share $ Per Share Notable items: Net proceeds from PHH Home Loans asset sales (1) $ 21 $ 0.39 $ — $ — Legal and regulatory reserves 2 0.03 (22 ) (0.27 ) Strategic review expenses (6 ) (0.11\n) (21 ) (0.24 ) Equity method investment (impairment) / gain on acquisition of interests 1 0.03 (23 ) (0.26 ) Loss from MSR sales and related costs (2 ) (0.03 ) (1 ) (0.01 ) Re-engineering and growth investments — — (6 ) (0.07 ) Exit and disposal costs $ (13 ) $ (0.24 ) $ (41 ) (0.47 ) Market-related MSRs asset and secured liability fair value adjustments, net of related derivatives (3 ) (0.05 ) (55 ) (0.63 ) (1) During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed the remaining three asset sales of our PHH Home Loans Joint Venture to Guaranteed Rate Affinity, and recognized a gain of $42 million in Other income, which is reduced to $21 million after excluding the portion attributable to noncontrolling interest. Capital Update\nIn November 2017, our Board of Directors provided a $100 million share repurchase authorization. We have not repurchased shares under this authorization as a result of becoming engaged in material discussions for the sale of the Company.\nLegal and Regulatory Update\nIn connection with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (\"CFPB\") enforcement action with respect to our legacy reinsurance activities, in January 2018, the en banc court of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reinstated the October 2016 panel decision as it related to the RESPA issues, which included vacating the CFPB’s order imposing $109 million in disgorgement penalties. In February 2018 the en banc court remanded the matter back to the CFPB for further proceedings in compliance with the reinstated panel opinion.\nWe reached a settlement agreement with a multistate coalition of certain mortgage banking regulators (\"MMC\") and consent orders with certain state attorneys general to resolve and close out findings from the MMC examination, without any admission of liability. Under the terms of the settlement, we will pay approximately $45 million in aggregate, of which $38 million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2017. The remaining settlement amount not yet paid is included in our recorded liability as of December 31, 2017.\nStrategic Transaction Call/Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on Wednesday, February 28, 2018, to discuss the strategic transaction.

As of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to sell MSRs, representing $6.5 billion of unpaid principal balance, for $39 million in MSR fair value. Additionally, we had commitments to transfer approximately $110 million in Servicing advances to the counterparties of these agreements.\n(2) MSRs secured liability. In 2017, we completed sales of MSRs to New Residential which did not qualify for sale accounting treatment under GAAP and have been treated as a secured borrowing. Under this accounting treatment, the $419 million of related MSRs remain on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet within Mortgage servicing rights and the proceeds from the sale are recognized as a MSRs secured liability.\nWe have elected to record the MSRs secured liability at fair value thereafter, consistent with the accounting treatment of the related MSR asset, and any changes in fair value of the MSR asset and liability related the New Residential transfers will fully offset in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (3) Unsecured Debt Tender Completed. In July 2017, we completed a tender offer on our unsecured debt and repaid $496 million principal for $524 million in cash, plus accrued interest. After the completion of the tender offer, $119 million principal of unsecured debt remains outstanding.\nPHH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (In millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 REVENUES Origination and other loan fees $ 22 $ 65 $ 136 $ 280 Gain on loans held for sale, net 15 50 144 262 Loan servicing income (loss), net 41 (13 ) 137 125 Net interest expense (13 ) (9 ) (36 ) (32 ) Other income (loss) 44 (21 ) 75 (13 ) Net revenues 109 72 456 622 EXPENSES Salaries and related expenses 40 77 263 345 Commissions 6 15 44 64 Loan origination expenses 4 12 31 64 Foreclosure and repossession expenses 3 9 19 35 Professional and third-party service fees 28 45 120 156 Technology equipment and software expenses 8 12 35 42 Occupancy and other office expenses 7 12 33 47 Depreciation and amortization 3 3 14 16 Exit and disposal costs 13 41 62 41 Other operating expenses 4 52 108 116 Total expenses 116 278 729 926 Loss before income taxes (7 ) (206 ) (273 ) (304 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 24 (73 ) (79 ) (111 ) Net loss (31 ) (133 ) (194 ) (193 ) Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 18 — 23 9 Net loss attributable to PHH Corporation $ (49 ) $ (133 ) $ (217 ) $ (202 ) Basic and Diluted loss per share attributable to PHH Corporation $ (1.49 ) $ (2.49 ) $ (4.62 ) $ (3.77 ) Segment Results (In millions) Fourth\nQuarter\n2016\nFourth Quarter 2017\nMortgage\nProduction\nMortgage\nServicing\nOther Total PHH\nCorporation\nTotal PHH\nCorporation\nOrigination and other loan fees $ 22 $ — $ — $ 22 $ 65 Gain on loans held for sale, net 15 — — 15 50 Loan servicing income — 46 — 46 82 MSRs asset & secured liability fair value adjustments: Prepayments and receipt of recurring cash flows — (2 ) — (2 ) (40 ) Market-related, net of derivatives — (3 ) — (3 ) (55 ) Net interest income (expense) 1 (14 ) — (13 ) (9 ) Other income (loss) 44 — — 44 (21 ) Net revenues 82 27 — 109 72 Salaries and related expenses 19 12 9 40 77 Commissions 6 — — 6 15 Loan origination expenses 4 — — 4 12 Foreclosure and repossession expenses — 3 — 3 9 Professional and third-party service fees 6 7 15 28 45 Technology equipment and software expenses — 3 5 8 12 Occupancy and other office expenses 4 3 — 7 12 Depreciation and amortization 1 — 2 3 3 Exit and disposal costs 9 — 4 13 41 Other operating expenses: Repurchase and foreclosure-related charges — (4 ) — (4 ) 9 Legal and regulatory reserves — (2 ) — (2 ) 22 Corporate overhead allocation 20 7 (27 ) — — Other 3 5 2 10 21 Total expenses 72 34 10 116 278 Income (loss) before income taxes 10 (7 ) (10 ) $ (7 ) $ (206 ) Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 18 — — Segment loss $ (8 ) $ (7 ) $ (10 ) Segment Results (In millions) Year Ended\nDecember\n31, 2016\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nMortgage\nProduction\nMortgage\nServicing\nOther Total PHH\nCorporation\nTotal PHH\nCorporation\nOrigination and other loan fees $ 136 $ — $ — $ 136 $ 280 Gain on loans held for sale, net 144 — — 144 262 Loan servicing income — 208 — 208 353 MSRs asset & secured liability fair value adjustments: Prepayments and receipt of recurring cash flows — (59 ) — (59 ) (138 ) Market-related, net of derivatives — (12 ) — (12 ) (90 ) Net interest income (expense) 5 (41 ) — (36 ) (32 ) Other income (loss) 73 2 — 75 (13 ) Net revenues 358 98 — 456 622 Salaries and related expenses 150 58 55 263 345 Commissions 44 — — 44 64 Loan origination expenses 31 — — 31 64 Foreclosure and repossession expenses — 19 — 19 35 Professional and third-party service fees 26 32 62 120 156 Technology equipment and software expenses 3 14 18 35 42 Occupancy and other office expenses 20 11 2 33 47 Depreciation and amortization 6 2 6 14 16 Exit and disposal costs 38 2 22 62 41 Other operating expenses: Repurchase and foreclosure-related charges — 3 — 3 19 Loss on early debt retirement — — 34 34 — Legal and regulatory reserves — 22 — 22 38 Corporate overhead allocation 92 34 (126 ) — — Other 17 22 10 49 59 Total expenses 427 219 83 729 926 Loss before income taxes (69 ) (121 ) (83 ) $ (273 ) $ (304 ) Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 23 — — Segment loss $ (92 ) $ (121 ) $ (83 ) Mortgage Production\nMortgage Production segment loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8 million, compared to a loss of $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our results in the segment reflect the reduced volumes associated with our exit of the PLS business during 2017, and reductions in our Real Estate channel from the transfer of our PHH Home Loans locations. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2017 segment loss includes $18 million of PLS operating losses and $9 million of Exit and disposal costs, that were partially offset by a $21 million net gain on sale from the proceeds of the PHH Home Loans asset sales.\nNet revenues were $82 million, a decline of $14 million or 15% from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily driven by lower application and closing volumes from our PLS business and Real Estate channel. Total retail closing units in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined by 64%, primarily driving the decrease of $43 million in Origination and other loan fees, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Gain on loans held for sale, net decreased by $35 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily from a 67% decrease in saleable applications that was related to our exit of the PLS business and transfer of our PHH Home Loans locations. These declines were offset by an increase to Other income of $42 million primarily as a result of the gross proceeds from PHH Home Loans asset sales.\nTotal expenses were $72 million, a decline of $86 million or 54%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Salaries and related expenses decreased by $30 million as a result of declining average employee headcount from our exit and Reorganization activities, and lower contract labor and overtime from declining application volumes. Commissions were down $9 million primarily due to a 57% decrease in closing volume from our Real Estate channel and lower private label closing volume, and Loan origination expenses were down $8 million primarily due to a 72% decrease in retail application units. Exit and disposal costs decreased by $24 million primarily from asset impairment charges of $15 million in 2016, and lower severance and retention expenses for employees impacted by our exit and Reorganization activities. Corporate overhead allocation decreased by $6 million primarily due to reduced professional fees for information technology shared services. Other expenses decreased by $6 million from a decrease in certain loan fees from less production.\nWe accepted our last application from our PLS clients during the fourth quarter of 2017, and we expect to be substantially complete with the wind-down of the PLS business by the end of the first quarter of 2018, subject to certain transition support requirements. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed our asset sales of PHH Home Loans to Guaranteed Rate Affinity, LLC. We expect to liquidate the residual assets of PHH Home Loans, and we have agreed to purchase Realogy's membership interests at book value on or before March 19, 2018. At the completion of these actions, we expect to discontinue the operations of our PLS business and Real Estate channel.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions) Segment Results:\nOrigination and other loan fees $ 22 $ 65 $ 136 $ 280 Gain on loans held for sale, net 15 50 144 262 Net interest expense 1 2 5 10 Other income (loss) 44 (21 ) 73 (13 ) Net revenues 82 96 358 539 Salaries and related expenses 19 49 150 216 Commissions 6 15 44 64 Loan origination expenses 4 12 31 64 Professional and third-party service fees 6 5 26 22 Technology equipment and software expenses — 1 3 4 Occupancy and other office expenses 4 7 20 27 Depreciation and amortization 1 1 6 8 Exit and disposal costs 9 33 38 33 Other operating expenses 23 35 109 145 Total expenses 72 158 427 583 Income (loss) before income taxes 10 (62 ) (69 ) (44 ) Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 18 — 23 9 Segment loss $ (8 ) $ (62 ) $ (92 ) $ (53 ) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 ($ in millions) Closings:\nSaleable to investors $ 1,094 $ 2,552 $ 6,757 $ 10,146 Fee-based 2,368 6,333 13,000 27,083 Total $ 3,462 $ 8,885 $ 19,757 $ 37,229 Purchase $ 1,716 $ 3,392 $ 10,999 $ 16,140 Refinance 1,746 5,493 8,758 21,089 Total $ 3,462 $ 8,885 $ 19,757 $ 37,229 Retail - PLS and Portfolio Retention $ 2,700 $ 7,100 $ 14,287 $ 29,261 Retail - Real Estate 762 1,785 5,470 7,383 Total retail 3,462 8,885 19,757 36,644 Wholesale/correspondent — — — 585 Total $ 3,462 $ 8,885 $ 19,757 $ 37,229 Retail - PLS and Portfolio Retention (units) 4,446 12,371 23,588 51,089 Retail - Real Estate (units) 2,310 6,147 18,239 26,075 Total retail (units) 6,756 18,518 41,827 77,164 Wholesale/correspondent (units) — — — 2,298 Total (units) 6,756 18,518 41,827 79,462 Applications:\nSaleable to investors $ 876 $ 2,695 $ 8,829 $ 14,275 Fee-based 1,424 5,414 13,047 31,134 Total $ 2,300 $ 8,109 $ 21,876 $ 45,409 Other:\nIRLCs expected to close $ 400 $ 688 $ 2,473 $ 4,373 Total loan margin on IRLCs (in basis points) 299 405 305 352 Loans sold $ 1,451 $ 2,744 $ 7,233 $ 10,548 Mortgage Servicing\nMortgage Servicing segment loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7 million, compared to a loss of $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet revenues were $27 million, an increase of $51 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by a $54 million favorable change in Loan servicing income, net. The improvement in Net revenues primarily reflects lower changes in fair value in our MSRs of $90 million from a 90% decline in our average capitalized servicing portfolio resulting from our MSR sales during 2017. This was partially offset by a decrease in contractual loan servicing income from the shift in mix of our serving portfolio to primarily subserviced loans which lowers our contractual servicing fees since we receive a smaller fee per loan from our subservicing clients as compared to the servicing fee received for our capitalized servicing rights.\nTotal expenses were $34 million, a decline of $59 million or 63% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Salaries and related expenses decreased by $2 million due to declines in average employee headcount. Foreclosure and repossession expenses decreased by $6 million primarily due to lower foreclosure activity and improved delinquencies that were partially the result of the Lakeview MSR sales of delinquent government loans. We had a $24 million favorable change for legal and regulatory matters compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by adjustments for negotiated settlements related to our legacy mortgage servicing practices and provisions for other matters. Corporate overhead allocation decreased by $4 million primarily from decreases in professional fees for information technology shared services. Repurchase and foreclosure-related charges had a favorable change of $13 million resulting from higher expenses in 2016 that were not reimbursed pursuant to mortgage insurance programs.\nAt December 31, 2017, our subservicing portfolio consisted of approximately 629,000 units, up 138% from December 31, 2016. The increase in total subservicing units during 2017 was primarily driven by the addition of subserviced loans from the sales of MSRs to New Residential Mortgage, LLC. We expect the transfer of approximately 115,000 subservicing units off of our platform between May 2018 and April 2019, based upon receipt in February 2018 of formal notices and verbal indications from two of our largest subservicing clients. Approximately 65,000 of these units are subject to a portfolio defense agreement and will no longer be solicitable units upon transfer to a new servicer.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions) Segment Results:\nLoan servicing income (loss), net $ 41 $ (13 ) $ 137 $ 125 Net interest expense (14 ) (11 ) (41 ) (42 ) Other income — — 2 — Net revenues 27 (24 ) 98 83 Salaries and related expenses 12 14 58 68 Foreclosure and repossession expenses 3 9 19 35 Professional and third-party service fees 7 8 32 35 Technology equipment and software expenses 3 5 14 17 Occupancy and other office expenses 3 4 11 17 Depreciation and amortization — 1 2 3 Exit and disposal costs — — 2 — Other operating expenses 6 52 81 131 Total expenses 34 93 219 306 Segment loss $ (7 ) $ (117 ) $ (121 ) $ (223 ) December 31, 2017 2016 ($ in millions) Total Loan Servicing Portfolio:\nConventional loans $ 137,029 $ 151,004 Government loans 9,715 21,801 Home equity lines of credit 1,411 1,837 Total Unpaid Principal Balance $ 148,155 $ 174,642 Number of loans in owned portfolio (units) 42,616 567,647 Number of subserviced loans (units) (1) 629,174 264,718 Total number of loans serviced (units) 671,790 832,365 Weighted-average interest rate 3.9 % 3.8 % Portfolio delinquency\n% of UPB - 30 days or more past due 2.49 % 2.56 % % of UPB - Foreclosure, REO and Bankruptcy 1.49 % 1.96 % Units - 30 days or more past due 3.54 % 3.59 % Units - Foreclosure, REO and Bankruptcy 2.02 % 2.37 % Total Capitalized Servicing Portfolio:\nUnpaid Principal Balance of capitalized MSRs owned $ 8,592 $ 84,657 Unpaid Principal Balance of capitalized MSRs in secured borrowing arrangement (2) 49,193 — Total Unpaid Principal Balance of capitalized servicing portfolio $ 57,785 $ 84,657 Capitalized servicing rate 0.82 % 0.82 % Capitalized servicing multiple 3.0 2.9 Weighted-average servicing fee (in basis points) 27 28 Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions) Total Loan Servicing Portfolio:\nAverage Portfolio UPB $ 149,965 $ 197,263 $ 159,671 $ 220,458 Owned Capitalized Servicing Portfolio: (3)\nAverage Portfolio UPB 8,845 86,607 43,547 92,303 Payoffs and principal curtailments 418 5,109 7,667 19,211 Sales 542 254 17,628 996 (1) For December 31, 2017, includes 363,062 units of New Residential subserviced loans that are accounted for as a secured borrowing arrangement.

See Non-GAAP Reconciliations below for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as required by Regulation G.\nThese Non-GAAP measures are used in managing certain aspects of the Company’s business. For example, management’s reviews of results incorporate Non-GAAP measures and the Company has also designed certain management incentives based upon the achievement of targets related to Non-GAAP measures. The Company believes that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures can be useful to investors because they provide a means by which investors can evaluate the Company’s underlying key drivers and operating performance of the business, exclusive of certain adjustments and activities that investors may consider to be unrelated to the underlying economic performance of the business for a given period.\nThe Company also believes that any meaningful analysis of the Company’s financial performance by investors requires an understanding of the factors that drive the Company’s underlying operating performance which can be obscured by significant unrealized changes in value of the Company’s mortgage servicing rights and mortgage servicing rights secured liability, as well as any gain or loss on derivatives that are intended to offset market-related fair value adjustments on the Company’s mortgage servicing rights.\nThe Company believes these Non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors that is supplementary to our results in accordance with GAAP; however, there are inherent limitations to these measures and they should not be viewed as a substitute for our results in accordance with GAAP as measurements of the Company's financial performance.\nCore earnings or loss (pre-tax and after-tax) and core earnings or loss per share\nCore earnings or loss (after-tax) and core earnings or loss per share involves differences from Net income or loss attributable to PHH Corporation and Basic earnings or loss per share attributable to PHH Corporation computed in accordance with GAAP.\nCore earnings or loss (pre-tax and after-tax) and core earnings or loss per share measure the Company’s financial performance excluding unrealized changes in fair value of the Company’s mortgage servicing rights and mortgage servicing rights secured liability that are based upon projections of expected future cash flows and prepayments as well as realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives that are intended to offset changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. The changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights, mortgage servicing rights secured liability and related derivatives are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and are dependent upon the level of current and projected interest rates at the end of each reporting period.\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS - CORE EARNINGS\n(In millions, except per share data)\nSee “Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above in this press release for a description of the uses and limitations of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
