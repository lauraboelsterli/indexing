(NYSE:FI) (the “Company” or “Frank’s”) today reported revenues of $118.3 million and a net loss of $109.1 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted net loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter was $0.26, excluding $50.5 million in severance and other charges, net of tax, primarily related to a write down in inventory of pipe and connectors, with weighted average shares outstanding of 223.2 million. Company revenue of $118.3 million was up 9.5% from the third quarter of 2017, and up 9.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.2 million, down $31.9 million from the third quarter of 2017 and up $38.9 million from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull year 2017 revenues were $454.8 million and net loss was $159.5 million, or $0.72 per diluted share. Adjusted net loss per diluted share for the full year 2017 was $0.61, excluding $52.2 million in severance and other charges, primarily related to a write down in inventory of pipe connectors, net of tax, and a benefit of $29.0 million due to the net after-tax impact of the tax receivable agreement liability decrease and establishment of tax valuation allowances. Weighted average shares outstanding for the full year 2017 were 222.9 million. Company revenue for the full year 2017 of $454.8 million was down 6.7% compared to the full year 2016. Full year cash flow from operations was $24.8 million, up $35.6 million from the full year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a loss of $1.4 million, down $3.3 million from the third quarter of 2017. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 was $5.7 million, or 1.3% of revenue, down $19.3 million from the full year 2016. Free cash flow for the full year 2017 was $16.9 million. Financial measures not presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) are defined and reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures included in this release.\nMike Kearney, Frank’s International’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “We closed 2017 with positive momentum in our Tubular Sales and Blackhawk segments that will provide the basis for an upward trajectory in revenues in the year ahead. We also significantly improved our cash flow generation during 2017 through lower costs, improved processes and the divesting of nonessential assets. We also had our safest operating year on record and significantly improved our service reliability. We believe we have reached a market bottom in activity and we are well positioned to take advantage of increased activity in each of our business segments in 2018.”\nKearney continued, “In the fourth quarter, we established clear organizational goals and constructed a detailed plan of strategic initiatives to help us achieve these goals. These initiatives are centered around realigning our internal organization to improve efficiency and drive accountability, accelerating the commercialization of new technology that will lower costs to our customers and improve service reliability, and growing profitability through the expansion of new and existing products and services globally. We will be an organization that is margin minded and cost conscious, where employees are motivated and accountable, and where the technology we offer is customer-focused and automation intensive. As we begin to execute our plan in 2018, we will use our strong financial position to invest in technology for the future, diversify our portfolio of offerings organically and inorganically, strengthen our workforce and work to develop strategic partnerships that benefit our customers, employees and shareholders.”\nSegment Results\nInternational Services\nInternational Services revenue was $52.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down 1.6% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and up 15.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 revenue was $206.7 million, down 12.8% year-over-year. Fourth quarter 2017 revenues were lower sequentially due to lower activity and pricing in Europe and Africa. Full year 2017 revenue decreases were driven primarily by declines in the Africa and Asia Pacific regions. Decreased rig activity from completed projects and pricing concessions were the primary drivers of the decline.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $5.3 million, or 10.1% of revenue, was down 52.1% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and up $3.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential decrease was primarily related to lower activity and pricing in the Europe and Africa regions and a non-recurring payroll tax credit from the previous quarter. Segment adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $30.8 million, or 14.9% of revenue, down 7.4% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased due to lower revenue and margin contribution from Africa, partially offset by improved work mix in Canada. Prior year adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by an accounts receivable allowance related to our Venezuela operations. During the fourth quarter of 2017, management decided to temporarily abandon all operations in Venezuela and as a result took a net write-off on investments (including accounts receivable) in the country as a charge to severance and other charges.\nU.S. Services\nU.S. Services revenue was $28.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down 0.6% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and down 12.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 revenue was $118.8 million, down 22.3% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower activity and pricing in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by higher U.S. land activity and pricing.\nFor the fourth quarter, onshore revenue within the U.S. Services segment of $14.4 million was up 1.0% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and up 59.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 revenue was $52.3 million, up 49.7% year-over-year. The year-over-year onshore business revenue increase was correlated to the increased drilling activity and improved pricing, partially offset by lower market share due to heightened selectivity with our customer base.\nOffshore revenue within the U.S. Services segment of $14.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 was down 2.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and down 39.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 revenue was $66.4 million, down 43.4% year-over-year. Lower activity and pricing concessions were primarily responsible for the decline in revenues in 2017.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a loss of $11.6 million, down $0.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 and down $13.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Segment adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was a loss of $39.4 million, down $28.3 million year-over-year. The lower adjusted EBITDA was driven by lower offshore contribution, partially offset by onshore increases in revenue and margin.\nTubular Sales\nTubular Sales revenue was $17.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up $9.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2017, and down $1.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 revenue was $58.2 million, down 33.5% year-over-year. Revenue decreased year-over-year due to lower demand in the Gulf of Mexico market.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.4 million, or 8.3% of revenue, up $2.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2017, and up $1.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Segment adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 was $3.2 million, or 5.5% of revenue, up $1.4 million year-over-year. Tubular Sales adjusted EBITDA increased from 2016 due cost reductions and lower manufacturing costs.\nTotal pipe and connector inventory decreased $68.7 million from December 31, 2016 to $33.6 million at December 31, 2017. In 2017, we recorded charges of $51.2 million related to a lower of cost and net realizable value adjustment for our pipe and connectors inventory.\nBlackhawk\nBlackhawk revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $19.1 million, up 8.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017. Revenue was higher on increased product deliveries in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore product sales.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.4 million, or 18.0% of revenue, down $0.1 million from the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA declined due to a shift from services to lower margin product sales, lower contribution from well intervention services with the end of hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico and integration costs.\nCapital Expenditures and Balance Sheet\nGross capital expenditures were $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, excluding $3.3 million of proceeds from sale of assets. The Company’s consolidated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2017 was $294.0 million, compared to $293.9 million at September 30, 2017. Short-term investments of $81.0 million have maturities of more than three months, but less than twelve months. At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents was $319.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had no outstanding indebtedness and $2.8 million in letters of credit outstanding under its $100 million credit facility, which has been reduced to approximately $14 million due to decreased adjusted EBITDA.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this press release specifically include statements, estimates and projections regarding the Company’s future business strategy and prospects for growth, cash flows and liquidity, financial strategy, budget, projections and operating results, the amount, nature and timing of capital expenditures, the availability and terms of capital, the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, volatility of oil and gas prices, which have declined significantly in recent periods, unique risks associated with offshore operations, political, economic and regulatory uncertainties in international operations, the ability to develop new technologies and products, the ability to protect intellectual property rights, the ability to employ and retain skilled and qualified workers, the level of competition in the Company’s industry and other guidance. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management’s experience, expectations and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. These include the factors discussed or referenced in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 that will be filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law, and we caution you not to rely on them unduly.\nAbout Frank’s International\nFrank’s International N.V. is a global oil services company that provides a broad and comprehensive range of highly engineered tubular running services, tubular fabrication, and specialty well construction and well intervention solutions with a focus on complex and technically demanding wells. Founded in 1938, Frank’s has approximately 2,900 employees and provides services to leading exploration and production companies in both onshore and offshore environments in approximately 50 countries on six continents. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “FI.” Additional information is available on the Company’s website, www.franksinternational.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release and the accompanying schedules include the non-GAAP financial measures of free cash flow, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin, which may be used periodically by management when discussing the Company’s financial results with investors and analysts. The accompanying schedules of this press release provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin are presented because management believes these metrics provide additional information relative to the performance of the Company’s business. These metrics are commonly employed by financial analysts and investors to evaluate the operating and financial performance of the Company from period to period and to compare it with the performance of other publicly traded companies within the industry. You should not consider free cash flow, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Because free cash flow, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin may be defined differently by other companies in the Company’s industry, the Company’s presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus proceeds from sale of assets less capital expenditures. The Company defines adjusted net income (loss) as diluted net income (loss) available to common shareholders before severance and other charges, net of tax, merger and acquisition costs, net of tax, doubtful receivables related to Venezuela operations and net impacts of tax receivable agreement liability derecognition. The Company defines adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share as diluted net income (loss) available to common shareholders before severance and other charges, net of tax, merger and acquisition costs, net of tax, doubtful receivables related to Venezuela operations and net impacts of tax receivable agreement liability derecognition divided by diluted weighted average common shares. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income, net, depreciation and amortization, income tax benefit or expense, asset impairments, gain or loss on disposal of assets, foreign currency gain or loss, equity-based compensation, tax receivable agreement liability derecognition, unrealized and realized gains or losses and other non-cash adjustments and other charges or credits. The Company uses free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows the Company to compare its operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of its capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of the Company’s management team (such as income tax and foreign currency exchange rates). The Company defines adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\nPlease see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nContact:\nBlake Holcomb – Director, Investor Relations and Communications\nblake.holcomb@franksintl.com\n713-231-2463\nFRANK'S INTERNATIONAL N.V.
