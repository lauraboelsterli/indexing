    "text": "A magnitude-6.4 earthquake off the the coast of Taiwan has killed at least two people, and may have left some trapped inside a building.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says the quake struck late Tuesday about 13 miles northeast of Hualien, on the island's east coast.\nBuilding tweet \nAt least two people have been killed and more than 100 have been injured, Reuters reported from a government official.\nTaiwan's official Central News Agency reported that the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a building in Hualien district, had caved in and people were believed to be trapped inside. The agency posted photos showing a road fractured in several parts.\nHualien tweet \nTaiwanese media reported that aside from the cave in on the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a separate hotel known as the Beautiful Life Hotel, is tilting.\nTuesday night's quake follows one over the weekend off the coast of Hualien on the east of Taiwan, which lies along the famed \"Pacific Rim of Fire\" known for seismic activity from Alaska to Southeast Asia.\nTawian tweet \nThe agency quoted a spokesman of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, the governing cabinet's office, as saying that search teams from other areas were headed to Hualien.\nThe preliminary information suggests the quake was about 6 miles deep.\n--Reuters contributed to this report.",
