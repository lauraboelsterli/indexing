    "text": "fall@\n* U.S. crude inventories fall - EIA\n* But exports surge, while net imports drop to record low\n* U.S. crude output above 10 million bpd\n* The U.S. shale revolution: http://tmsnrt.rs/2EtJgen (Adds comment, updates prices)\nSINGAPORE, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Friday as high U.S. crude exports outweighed lower crude inventories in the world's biggest consumer of the fuel.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.70 a barrel at 0602 GMT, down 7 cents from their last settlement. Brent crude futures were down 11 cents at $66.28 a barrel.\nWTI was still on track to rise about 1.7 percent for the week, and Brent was up 2.2 percent, with both contracts set for a second weekly gain after falling steeply early in the month.\nFriday's dips followed bigger price rises the previous day when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said U.S. crude stockpiles <C-STK-T-EIA> fell by 1.6 million barrels in the week to Feb. 16, to 420.48 million barrels, despite a seasonal slowdown in demand at the end of the northern hemisphere winter season.\n\"A counter-seasonal draw should always be taken bullishly -as it has been - but this week's net crude imports were very low,\" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.\nU.S. crude exports jumped to just above 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, EIA data showed, close to a record high of 2.1 million hit in October. That helped pull down net imports to below 5 million bpd, the lowest level since the EIA started recording the data in 2001.\nU.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> was virtually unchanged last week at 10.27 million bpd, close to levels of top producer Russia and more than OPEC-kingpin Saudi Arabia pumps.\nGlobally, however, oil markets remain well supported due to demand-growth coinciding with production restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Richard Pullin)",
