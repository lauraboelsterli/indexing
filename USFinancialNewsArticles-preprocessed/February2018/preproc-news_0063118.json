    "text": "SINGAPORE, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SpaceChain ( spacechain.com ) announced today that it has joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) , the world's largest open-source blockchain initiative with over 250 member companies. SpaceChain joined EEA to connect with the EEA members and support the adoption of Ethereum in the enterprise.\nSpaceChain co-founder Zee Zheng said: \"We are very excited to become a member of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. SpaceChain is building an open-source operation system that will enable developers to make applications by applying smart contract and blockchain sandbox designed by our CTO Jeff Garzik. We look forward to connecting with all the EEA members and discussing opportunities for collaboration.\"\nSpaceChain is actively building the world's first open-source satellite network to enable a next-generation infrastructure for blockchain industry. This non-terrestrial, decentralized satellite network will become an alternative for data transmission, storage and application development.\nThe SpaceChain open-source operating system, SpaceChainOS, provides a \"blockchain sandbox\" that any developer can utilize for rapid development, testing, and deployment of decentralized applications.\nSpaceChain will be meeting with Ron Resnick, Executive Director of Ethernet Enterprise Alliance, to discuss the details of their cooperation.\nAbout The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance\nThe EEA is an industry-supported, not-for-profit established to build, promote, and broadly support Ethereum-based technology best practices, open standards and open-source reference architectures. The EEA is helping to evolve Ethereum into an enterprise-grade technology, providing research and development in a range of areas including privacy, confidentiality, scalability and security. The EEA is also investigating hybrid architectures that span both permissioned and public Ethereum networks as well as industry-specific application layer working groups.\nEEA will collectively develop open industry standards and facilitate collaboration with its member base. It is also open to any members of the Ethereum community who wish to participate. This open-source framework will enable the mass adoption at a depth and breadth otherwise unachievable in individual corporate silos and provide insight to the future of scalability, privacy and confidentiality of the public Ethereum permissionless network.\nFor additional information about joining EEA, please reach out to membership@entethalliance.org .\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spacechain-joins-the-enterprise-ethereum-alliance-300605496.html\nSOURCE SpaceChain",
