The S&P has risen 18% since the start of 2017. The average traditional initial offering on the major U.S. exchanges in 2017 have climbed roughly 22% since their IPOs through Friday’s close, Dealogic said.\nThe poor showing is the latest episode to raise questions about the JOBS Act, a 2012 law that aimed to bolster employment by removing some IPO hurdles for so-called emerging-growth companies with less than $1 billion in annual sales. After final amendments were adopted in 2015, last year marked the first time companies used the rules to list shares on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market.\nRead More SEC Warns Celebrities Against Endorsing Stock and Coin Offerings (Nov. 1, 2017) Want to Buy an IPO from Ashton Kutcher? Small Firms Turn to Star Power for IPOs (Oct. 10, 2017) Here’s How to Go Public Without Wall Street (June 1, 2017) Few Small Businesses Take Advantage of Mini-IPOs (July 6, 2016) Many investors questioned the rationale for the rule at the time of its adoption, and some say the poor performance of the listings shows investors haven’t always recognized the need to scrutinize firms coming public under the liberalized rules.\n“Investors have been insufficiently skeptical,” said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida who studies IPOs. Mr. Ritter said his research shows IPOs of small, unprofitable companies don’t generally do well in public markets.\nUnder Reg A+, companies can raise up to $50 million by pitching their IPOs to all investors , not just those with a certain net worth or income, as in traditional IPOs. Qualifying firms can initially file for IPOs confidentially and aren’t subject to all of the accounting and disclosure standards that apply to larger companies.\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has advocated cutting red tape across industries as a way to improve business efficiency. Executives at firms that have used the Reg A+ process say it is a valuable tool for small firms to reach investors.\nRisky Business Most companies that used an IPO shortcut known as Reg A+ to list on U.S. exchanges in 2017 are trading well-below their IPO price.

Executives at clean transportation company Arcimoto Inc. and gourmet hamburger chain FAT Brands Inc. said restocking the IPO pipeline requires patience and short-term stock performance may not be indicative of a newly listed company’s long-term prospects.\nArcimoto went public in September and has since seen a roughly 50% drop in its shares, while FAT Brands is down 29% from its October IPO.\nEven those involved in some recent offerings warn that the surge of markets in the past year has made investors less skeptical, enabling some firms to sell shares that carry risks that aren’t necessarily suitable for many investors’ portfolios.\n“Some of the deals that have come out shouldn’t be public companies, and unfortunately have given Reg A+ a taint,” said Mark Elenowitz, chief executive officer of TriPoint Global Equities.\nTriPoint, a longtime advocate of Reg A+, underwrote the stock offering by medical-robotics maker Myomo Inc. , which is trading 43% below its offer price, as well as the listing of FAT Brands.\nEven the rare success story among Reg A+ listings raises caution flags. Longfin’s stock languished near its $5 offer price on its first day of trading in December, but two days later, it announced the acquisition of a company focused on blockchain, the technology underpinning the bitcoin digital currency.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators have raised concerns about the risks facing retail investors in the lightly regulated cryptocurrencies market. Longfin’s stock trades above $30 a share.\nSome short sellers, who seek to profit from the decline of shares they deem overvalued or otherwise troubled, are viewing this market as a potential gold mine, though the thin trading in these shares has complicated efforts to bet against Reg A+ offerings. Their average float, or shares available for public trading relative to the number outstanding, is 15%, compared with roughly 34% for all U.S.-listed IPOs, according to Dealogic.\nKingsford Capital Management LLC, a $225 million Bay Area hedge fund that focuses on betting against companies, in December described the Reg A+ companies as “the gift that keeps on grifting.” Kingsford didn’t say whether it bet against such companies; its fund gained 4.2% in 2017, said a person familiar with the matter.\nReg A+ offerings aren’t the only area of light-touch-regulation to raise some investors’ eyebrows.\nLast month, maniaTV Inc. launched a stock sale using new loosened SEC social media rules. The offering is operating under Regulation D, which lets companies sell securities to accredited investors, or those with a high net worth, while exempting the company from going through the SEC’s registration and reporting requirements for public offerings.\nmaniaTV, which won’t be listed on an exchange, is advertising its connection with Scott “Lord” Disick, a regular on reality television show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” The JOBS Act lifted a ban for general solicitations, such as those done via Mr. Disick’s Twitter account.\nMr. Disick tweeted to his 6.9 million followers Jan. 24 about the IPO, encouraging them to “live large & own the next MTV with me.” Also in the tweet: “NO RISK! NO REWARD!”\nIn describing its use of Regulation D for the maniaTV offering, CEO Drew Massey said he views the rules as a way to sidestep venture capitalists and bankers, while enriching individual investors.\n“We almost called it a baller stock offering because Scott is a baller,” he said.\nBarbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said it is important for companies in all stages of development to have access to capital, but the latest wave of deregulation hasn’t served investors well.\n“Most early-stage companies fail, or they perform poorly for investors,” Ms. Roper said, adding raising capital “shouldn’t just be focused on attracting investors who are too unwary to know what risk they’re taking on.”\nWrite to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com and Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.com",
