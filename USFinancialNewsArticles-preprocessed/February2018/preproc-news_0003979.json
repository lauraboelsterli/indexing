These forward-looking statements, which you can identify by the Company’s use of words such as “expects,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “intends,” “believes,” “outlook” and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters, are based on the Company’s expectations, forecasts and assumptions at the time of this release, which may not be realized and involve risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted accurately or that might not be anticipated. These could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that might cause such differences include the following, among others: we may abandon development or redevelopment opportunities for which we have already incurred costs; adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our access to various sources of capital and/or cost of capital, which may affect our business activities, earnings and common stock price, among other things; changes in local employment conditions, demand for apartment homes, supply of competitive housing products, and other economic conditions may result in lower than expected occupancy and/or rental rates and adversely affect the profitability of our communities; delays in completing development, redevelopment and/or lease-up may result in increased financing and construction costs and may delay and/or reduce the profitability of a community; debt and/or equity financing for development, redevelopment or acquisitions of communities may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms; we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary governmental permits and authorizations; expenses may result in communities that we develop or redevelop failing to achieve expected profitability; our assumptions concerning risks relating to our lack of control of joint ventures and our abilities to successfully dispose of certain assets may not be realized; our assumptions and expectations in our financial outlook may prove to be too optimistic; and the Company's expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release regarding potential uninsured loss amounts and on-going investigations resulting from the casualty loss at Avalon at Edgewater (\"Edgewater\") are subject to change and could materially affect the Company's current expectations regarding the impact of the casualty loss. Additional discussions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements appear in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 under the heading “Risk Factors” and under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forward-Looking Statements” and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nThe Company does not undertake a duty to update forward-looking statements, including its expected 2018 operating results and other financial data forecasts contained in this release. The Company may, in its discretion, provide information in future public announcements regarding its outlook that may be of interest to the investment community. The format and extent of future outlooks may be different from the format and extent of the information contained in this release.\nDefinitions and Reconciliations\nNon-GAAP financial measures and other capitalized terms, as used in this earnings release, are defined and further explained on Attachment 15, Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms. Attachment 15 is included in the full earnings release available at the Company’s website at http://www.avalonbay.com/earnings . This wire distribution includes only definitions and reconciliations of the following non-GAAP financial measures:\nAverage Rental Rates are calculated by the Company as rental revenue in accordance with GAAP, divided by the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes.\nEconomic Gain (Loss) is calculated by the Company as the gain (loss) on sale in accordance with GAAP, less accumulated depreciation through the date of sale and any other non-cash adjustments that may be required under GAAP accounting. Management generally considers Economic Gain (Loss) to be an appropriate supplemental measure to gain (loss) on sale in accordance with GAAP because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold community. The Economic Gain (Loss) for each of the communities presented is based on their respective final settlement statements. A reconciliation of Economic Gain (Loss) to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as prior years’ activities is presented elsewhere in the full release.\nEconomic Occupancy (“Ec Occ”) is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue (also known as “gross potential”) is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at market rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. By measuring vacant apartments at their market rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue.\nEstablished Communities are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the respective prior year period. Therefore, for 2017 operating results, Established Communities are consolidated communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2016, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year.\nFFO and Core FFO are considered by management to be supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance. FFO is calculated by the Company in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO is calculated by the Company as Net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets, write-downs of investments in affiliates which are driven by a decrease in the value of depreciable real estate assets held by the affiliate and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. By excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating communities and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating and financial performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Core FFO is the Company's FFO as adjusted for non-core items outlined in the table below. By further adjusting for items that are not considered part of our core business operations, Core FFO can help one compare the core operating and financial performance of the Company between periods. A reconciliation of common stockholders to FFO and to Core FFO is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nQ4 Q4 Full Year Full Year 2017 2016 2017 2016 common stockholders $ 237,573 $ 242,235 $ 876,921 $ 1,034,002 Depreciation - real estate assets, including joint venture adjustments 156,413 140,773 582,907 538,606 Distributions to noncontrolling interests 10 10 42 41 Gain on sale of unconsolidated entities holding previously depreciated real estate 57 (4,897 ) (40,053 ) (58,069 ) Gain on sale of previously depreciated real estate (92,845 ) (90,041 ) (252,599 ) (374,623 ) Casualty and impairment (recovery) loss, net on real estate (1)(6) — — — (4,195 ) FFO attributable to common stockholders 301,208 288,080 1,167,218 1,135,762 Adjusting items: Joint venture losses (2) 139 268 950 6,031 Joint venture promote (3) — (4,538 ) (26,742 ) (7,985 ) Impairment loss on real estate (4)(6) — — 9,350 10,500 Casualty (gain) loss, net on real estate (5)(6)\n(5,438\n)\n— (3,100\n)\n(10,239 ) Business interruption insurance proceeds (7) — (143 ) (3,495 ) (20,565 ) Lost NOI from casualty losses covered by business interruption insurance (8) 1,662 1,786 7,904 7,366 Loss on extinguishment of consolidated debt 1,310 4,614 25,472 7,075 Hedge ineffectiveness — — (753 ) — Severance related costs (66\n) (55 ) 87 852 Development pursuit and other write-offs 232 (107 ) 1,406 3,662 Loss (gain) on other real estate transactions (9) 11,153 697 10,907 (10,224 ) Acquisition costs 92 959 92 3,523 Legal settlements\n589\n(417 ) 680\n(417 ) Core FFO attributable to common stockholders $ 310,881 $ 291,144 $ 1,189,976 $ 1,125,341 Average shares outstanding - diluted 138,245,981 137,519,045 138,066,686 137,461,637 Earnings per share - diluted $ 1.72 $ 1.76 $ 6.35 $ 7.52 FFO per common share - diluted $ 2.18 $ 2.09 $ 8.45 $ 8.26 Core FFO per common share - diluted $ 2.25 $ 2.12 $ 8.62 $ 8.19 (1) In 2016, the Company received insurance proceeds, net of additional costs incurred, of $5,732 related to the severe winter storms that occurred in the Company’s Northeast markets in 2015. For full year 2016, the Company recognized $4,195 of this recovery as an offset to the impairment on depreciable real estate of $4,195 recognized in the prior year period. The balance of the net insurance proceeds received in 2016 of $1,537 is recognized as a casualty gain and is included in the reconciliation of FFO to Core FFO. (2) Amounts for 2016 and 2017 are primarily composed of (i) the Company's portion of yield maintenance charges incurred for the early repayment of debt associated with joint venture disposition activity, (ii) the write-off of asset management fee intangibles primarily associated with the disposition of communities in the U.S. Fund and (iii) the Company's proportionate share of operating results for joint ventures formed with Equity Residential as part of the Archstone acquisition. (3) Amounts for 2017 and 2016 are composed of the Company's recognition of its promoted interest in Fund II. (4) Amount for full year 2017 includes an impairment charge for a land parcel the Company had acquired for development and sold in July 2017. Amount for full year 2016 includes impairment charges relating to ancillary land parcels. (5) Amounts for 2017 include $5,438 in legal settlement proceeds relating to construction defects at a community acquired as part of the Archstone acquisition. Amount for full year 2017 also includes $19,481 for the Maplewood casualty loss, partially offset by $17,143 of property damage insurance proceeds. Amount for full year 2016 includes $8,702 in property damage insurance proceeds for the Edgewater casualty loss, and $1,537 in insurance proceeds in excess of the total recognized loss related to severe winter storms in the Company's Northeast markets that occurred in 2015.\n(6) Aggregate impact of (i) Casualty and impairment (recovery) loss, net on real estate, (ii) Impairment loss on real estate, and (iii) Casualty (gain) loss, net on real estate, is a gain of $5,438 for Q4 2017 and a loss of $6,250 for full year 2017, and a gain of $3,935 for full year 2016.\n(7) Amount for full year 2017 is composed of business interruption insurance proceeds resulting from the final insurance settlement of the Maplewood casualty loss. Amount for full year 2016 is primarily composed of business interruption insurance proceeds resulting from the final insurance settlement of the Edgewater casualty loss. (8) Amounts for 2016 and 2017 primarily relate to a casualty event at Edgewater in Q1 2015, for which the Company received $20,306 in business interruption insurance proceeds in Q1 2016. Amounts for 2017 also include amounts related to the Maplewood casualty loss in Q1 2017, for which the Company recognized $3,495 in business interruption insurance proceeds in Q3 2017. (9) Amounts for 2017 are primarily composed of a loss resulting from the non-cash write-off of prepaid rent associated with the purchase of land previously under a ground lease. Amount for the full year 2016 includes a gain of $10,621 for the land contributed by the Company to the AVA North Point joint venture. Gross Levered IRR is calculated as the internal rate of return on the Company's equity investment in Fund II considering the timing and amounts of capital contributions and distributions, including promoted interest earned on the Company’s general partnership interest.\nGross Levered Cash Flow Multiple is calculated as the ratio of the Company’s share of distributions from Fund II, including promoted interest earned, to the Company’s share of contributions in Fund II.\nThe calculation of Gross Levered IRR and Gross Levered Cash Flow Multiple excludes all management fees earned by the Company during the investment period.\nInitial Year Market Cap Rate is defined by the Company as Projected NOI of a single community for the first 12 months of operations (assuming no repositioning), less estimates for non-routine allowance of approximately $300 - $500 per apartment home, divided by the gross sales price for the community. Projected NOI, as referred to above, represents management’s estimate of projected rental revenue minus projected operating expenses before interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation and amortization. For this purpose, management’s projection of operating expenses for the community includes a management fee of 2.5% - 3.5%. The Initial Year Market Cap Rate, which may be determined in a different manner by others, is a measure frequently used in the real estate industry when determining the appropriate purchase price for a property or estimating the value for a property. Buyers may assign different Initial Year Market Cap Rates to different communities when determining the appropriate value because they (i) may project different rates of change in operating expenses and capital expenditure estimates and (ii) may project different rates of change in future rental revenue due to different estimates for changes in rent and occupancy levels. The weighted average Initial Year Market Cap Rate is weighted based on the gross sales price of each community.\nInterest Coverage is calculated by the Company as Core EBITDA divided by the sum of interest expense, net, and preferred dividends, if applicable. Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income or loss attributable to the Company before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nA reconciliation of Core EBITDA and a calculation of Interest Coverage for the three months ended December 31, 2017 are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n common stockholders $ 237,573 Interest expense, net, inclusive of loss on extinguishment of debt, net 53,833 Income tax expense 39 Depreciation expense 157,100 EBITDA $ 448,545 NOI from real estate assets sold or held for sale (1,369 ) Gain on sale of communities (92,845 ) Loss on other real estate transactions 11,153 Joint venture income (358 ) Consolidated EBITDA after disposition activity $ 365,126 Casualty and impairment gain\n(5,438\n)\nLost NOI from casualty losses covered by business interruption insurance 1,662 Acquisition costs 92 Severance related costs (66 ) Development pursuit and other write-offs 232 Legal settlements 589\nCore EBITDA $ 362,197 Interest expense, net $ 52,523 Interest Coverage 6.9 times Net Debt-to-Core EBITDA is calculated by the Company as total debt that is consolidated for financial reporting purposes, less consolidated cash and cash in escrow, divided by annualized fourth quarter 2017 Core EBITDA, as adjusted. For a calculation of Core EBITDA, see \"Interest Coverage\" above. A calculation of Net Debt-to-Core EBITDA is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTotal debt principal (1) $ 7,404,313 Cash and cash in escrow (201,906 ) Net debt $ 7,202,407 Core EBITDA $ 362,197 Core EBITDA, annualized $ 1,448,788 Net Debt-to-Core EBITDA 5.0 times (1) Balance at December 31, 2017 excludes $10,850 of debt discount and $36,386 of deferred financing costs as reflected in unsecured notes, net, and $16,351 of debt discount and $11,256 of deferred financing costs as reflected in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NOI is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses, expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, joint venture income, depreciation expense, corporate income tax expense, casualty and impairment loss (gain), net, gain on sale of communities, loss (gain) on other real estate transactions and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale. The Company considers NOI to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to Net Income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.\nA reconciliation of NOI to Net Income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nQ4 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Full Year Full Year 2017 2016 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Net income $ 237,486 $ 242,183 $ 238,199 $ 165,194 $ 235,781 $ 876,660 $ 1,033,708 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 16,926 14,443 15,752 16,423 16,297 65,398 61,403 Investments and investment management expense 1,659 1,277 1,501 1,455 1,321 5,936 4,822 Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries 649 1,220 789 570 728 2,736 9,922 Interest expense, net 52,523 49,648 47,741 50,102 49,295 199,661 187,510 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 1,310 4,614 — 24,162 — 25,472 7,075 General and administrative expense 11,904 10,638 11,679 14,005 13,226 50,814 46,076 Joint venture income (358 ) (10,184 ) (52,568 ) (1,146 ) (16,672 ) (70,744 ) (64,962 ) Depreciation expense 157,100 140,020 144,990 141,439 140,621 584,150 531,434 Casualty and impairment (gain) loss, net (5,438 ) — — — 11,688 6,250 (3,935 ) Gain on sale of communities (92,845 ) (90,041 ) (27,738 ) (44,067 ) (87,949 ) (252,599 ) (374,623 ) Loss (gain) on other real estate transactions 11,153 697 120 — (366 ) 10,907 (10,224 ) NOI from real estate assets sold or held for sale (1,369 ) (7,474 ) (3,072 ) (4,241 ) (5,891 ) (14,573 ) (44,263 ) NOI $ 390,700 $ 357,041 $ 377,393 $ 363,896 $ 358,079 $ 1,490,068 $ 1,383,943 Established: New England $ 38,322 $ 38,074 $ 38,055 $ 36,820 $ 37,056 $ 150,253 $ 147,219 Metro NY/NJ 63,286 61,857 61,932 61,538 60,964 247,720 242,600 Mid-Atlantic 39,071 38,791 38,242 37,829 38,608 153,750 151,441 Pacific NW 16,008 14,674 15,687 15,017 14,815 61,527 57,857 No. California 64,812 64,237 64,557 64,587 63,717 257,673 253,582 So.

(2) NOI for Q3 and Full Year 2017 Development includes $3,495 of business interruption insurance proceeds related to the Maplewood casualty loss. NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from assets sold or classified as held for sale. A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold or classified as held for sale is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nQ4 Q4 Full Year Full Year 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue from real estate assets sold or held for sale $ 2,245 $ 11,021 $ 23,457 $ 70,273 Operating expenses from real estate assets sold or held for sale (876 ) (3,547 ) (8,884 ) (26,010 ) NOI from real estate assets sold or held for sale $ 1,369 $ 7,474 $ 14,573 $ 44,263 Other Stabilized Communities are completed consolidated communities that the Company owns, which have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2017. Other Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities.\nProjected FFO and Projected Core FFO, as provided within this release in the Company’s outlook, are calculated on a basis consistent with historical FFO and Core FFO, and are therefore considered to be appropriate supplemental measures to projected Net Income from projected operating performance. A reconciliation of the ranges provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the first quarter and full year 2018 to the ranges provided for projected EPS (diluted) and corresponding reconciliation of the ranges for Projected FFO per share to the ranges for Projected Core FFO per share are as follows:\nLow\nRange\nHigh\nRange\nProjected EPS (diluted) - Q1 2018 $ 0.99 $ 1.05 Depreciation (real estate related) 1.14 1.14 Projected FFO per share (diluted) - Q1 2018 2.13 2.19 Lost NOI from casualty losses covered by business interruption insurance 0.01 0.01 Projected Core FFO per share (diluted) - Q1 2018 $ 2.14 $ 2.20 Projected EPS (diluted) - Full Year 2018 $ 5.83 $ 6.23 Depreciation (real estate related) 4.40 4.60 Gain on sale of communities (1.56 ) (1.76 ) Projected FFO per share (diluted) - Full Year 2018 8.67 9.07 Joint venture promote and other income, development pursuit, other write-offs and other 0.03 0.03 Lost NOI from casualty losses covered by business interruption insurance 0.01 0.01 Loss on extinguishment of consolidated debt 0.02 0.02 Projected Core FFO per share (diluted) - Full Year 2018 $ 8.73 $ 9.13 Projected NOI, as used within this release for certain development communities and in calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents management’s estimate, as of the date of this release (or as of the date of the buyer’s valuation in the case of dispositions), of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For development communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first twelve months of Stabilized Operations following the completion of construction. In calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyer’s valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents management’s estimate of projected gross potential minus projected stabilized economic vacancy and adjusted for projected stabilized concessions plus projected stabilized other rental revenue. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. In addition, projected stabilized operating expenses for development communities do not include property management fee expense. Projected gross potential for development communities and dispositions is based on leased rents for occupied homes and management’s best estimate of rental levels for homes which are currently unleased, as well as those homes which will become available for lease during the twelve month forward period used to develop Projected NOI. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost is weighted based on the Company’s share of the Total Capital Cost of each community, based on its percentage ownership.\nManagement believes that Projected NOI of the development communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the development communities when the assets are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense). However, in this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis. Given the different dates and fiscal years for which NOI is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development is complex, impractical to develop, and may not be meaningful. Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's overall financial performance or cash flow. There can be no assurance that the communities under development will achieve the Projected NOI as described in this release.\nProjected Stabilized Yield (also expressed as “weighted average initial stabilized yield” or words of similar meaning) means Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost.\nRental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP-based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. In addition, Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions.\nA reconciliation of rental revenue from Established Communities in conformity with GAAP to Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nQ4 Q4 Full Year Full Year 2017 2016 2017 2016 Rental revenue (GAAP basis) $ 396,735 $ 388,245 $ 1,574,395 $ 1,535,747 Concessions amortized 305 469 1,670 2,449 Concessions granted (330 ) (816 ) (1,118 ) (1,902 ) Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis $ 396,710 $ 387,898 $ 1,574,947 $ 1,536,294 % change -- GAAP revenue 2.2 % 2.5 % % change -- cash revenue 2.3 % 2.5 % Stabilized Operations/Restabilized Operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.\nTotal Capital Cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective development or redevelopment community, or development right, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, offset by proceeds from the sale of any associated land or improvements, all as determined in accordance with GAAP. For redevelopment communities, Total Capital Cost excludes costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment when indicated. With respect to communities where development or redevelopment was completed in a prior or the current period, Total Capital Cost reflects the actual cost incurred, plus any contingency estimate made by management. Total Capital Cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount. For joint ventures not in construction, Total Capital Cost is equal to gross real estate cost.\nUnencumbered NOI as calculated by the Company represents NOI generated by real estate assets unencumbered by outstanding secured debt as of December 31, 2017 as a percentage of total NOI generated by real estate assets. The Company believes that current and prospective unsecured creditors of the Company view Unencumbered NOI as one indication of the borrowing capacity of the Company. Therefore, when reviewed together with the Company’s Interest Coverage, EBITDA and cash flow from operations, the Company believes that investors and creditors view Unencumbered NOI as a useful supplemental measure for determining the financial flexibility of an entity. A calculation of Unencumbered NOI for the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nFull Year NOI NOI for Established Communities $ 1,112,472 NOI for Other Stabilized Communities 196,733 NOI for Redevelopment Communities 118,062 NOI for Development Communities (1) 62,801 NOI from real estate assets sold or held for sale 14,573 Total NOI generated by real estate assets 1,504,641 NOI on encumbered assets 168,005 NOI on unencumbered assets $ 1,336,636 Unencumbered NOI 89 % (1) NOI for Development includes $3,495 of business interruption insurance proceeds related to the Maplewood casualty loss. Unleveraged IRR on sold communities refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the Company considering the timing and amounts of (i) total revenue during the period owned by the Company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the communities at the time of sale and (iv) total direct operating expenses during the period owned by the Company. Each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) is calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe calculation of Unleveraged IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company’s general and administrative expense, interest expense, or corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses. Therefore, Unleveraged IRR is not a substitute for Net Income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unleveraged IRR achieved during the period a community is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company’s acquisition, development or redevelopment, management and sale of a community, before the impact of indirect expenses and Company overhead. The Unleveraged IRR achieved on the communities as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other communities owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unleveraged IRRs upon the disposition of other communities. The weighted average Unleveraged IRR for sold communities is weighted based on all cash flows over the investment period for each respective community, including net sales proceeds.\nCopyright © 2018 AvalonBay Communities, Inc.
