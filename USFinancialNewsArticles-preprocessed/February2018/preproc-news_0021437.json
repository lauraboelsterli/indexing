    "text": "ZUG, Switzerland and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CRISPR Therapeutics (Nasdaq:CRSP), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing transformative gene-based medicines for serious diseases, today announced that Bill Lundberg, MD, is stepping down as Chief Scientific Officer of CRISPR. Going forward, Dr. Lundberg will serve as a Senior Advisor to the Company and has been named Head of CRISPR’s Scientific Advisory Board.\n“I have had the privilege of working with a wonderful, talented and dedicated group of people at CRISPR Therapeutics,” said Dr. Lundberg. “We have filed the first company-sponsored clinical trial applications for CRISPR-based therapies, and now is a natural time for me to transition to a Senior Advisor role. I am confident in the success of the CRISPR team to continue to advance important gene-based medicines for patients suffering from devastating diseases.”\n“Bill was instrumental in establishing our research operations and advancing our CRISPR/Cas9 platform from the research phase to clinical evaluation. On behalf of CRISPR Therapeutics, I thank Bill for his leadership and look forward to his continued involvement,” commented Samarth Kulkarni, PhD, CEO of CRISPR Therapeutics. “CRISPR will continue to build on this foundation under the leadership of Dr. Tony Ho, Head of R&D, to advance our mission of translating the CRISPR/Cas9 platform into transformative medicines.”\nAbout CRISPR Therapeutics\nCRISPR Therapeutics is a leading gene-editing company focused on developing transformative gene-based medicines for serious diseases using its proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform. CRISPR/Cas9 is a revolutionary technology that allows for precise, directed changes to genomic DNA. The company's multi-disciplinary team of world-class researchers and drug developers is working to translate this technology into breakthrough human therapeutics in a number of serious diseases. Additionally, CRISPR Therapeutics has established strategic collaborations with Bayer AG and Vertex Pharmaceuticals to develop CRISPR-based therapeutics in diseases with high unmet need. The foundational CRISPR/Cas9 patent estate for human therapeutic use was licensed from the company's scientific founder Emmanuelle Charpentier, Ph.D. CRISPR Therapeutics AG is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, with its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, CRISPR Therapeutics, Inc., and R&D operations based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
