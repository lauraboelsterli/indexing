    "text": "February 1, 2018 / 10:16 AM / Updated 17 minutes ago Brazilian police serve 100 warrants in pension investigations Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nSAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian federal police served 100 search-and-seizure warrants on Thursday as part of an investigation into alleged graft involving a pension fund for post office workers. \nA police statement did not name any targets of the investigation, but said they included managers at the Postalis fund, executives at a foreign financial institution, listed companies and risk-assessment firms. \nPostalis had suffered large losses as a result of embezzlement, police said in the statement. \nPostalis said in an emailed response that it would not comment specifically on Thursday’s warrants, but that it hoped investigators soon bring all facts to light. \nThe pension fund came under federal management last year due to alleged fraud. \nRepresentatives for the Brazilian unit of Bank of New York Mellon Corp confirmed that federal police had visited its offices on Thursday as part of an investigation, adding that the bank was cooperating with authorities. \nLast month, prosecutors asked the local unit of BNY Mellon, which managed part of the assets held by Postalis, to return 8.2 billion reais ($2.6 billion) to the pension fund. According to prosecutors, BNY had failed to monitor risks and did not comply with local asset-allocation rules. At the time, the unit called those accusations “unfounded.” Reporting by Eduardo Simões in São Paulo and Ricardo Brito in Brasília; writing by Bruno Federowski; editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Susan Thomas",
