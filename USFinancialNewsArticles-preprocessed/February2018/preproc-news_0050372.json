    "text": "CNBC.com Eddy Chen | Getty Images \nAfter being tapped as a guest investor for ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" Bethenny Frankel knows what really goes on behind the scenes of the show . \nThe celebrity entrepreneur tells CNBC Make It that she and billionaire tech CEO Mark Cuban both enjoy hip hop, so they jammed out together between shots. \n\"In the breaks, they are playing full-on, old school hip hop,\" says Frankel. \"Mark Cuban and I are rapping and dancing and having the best time.\" \nAdds Frankel, \"Mark tried to shush me a couple times,\" she adds. \"And you will find out how that worked out.\" \n\"We know that they're going to edit [the show] down, so when we get mad, we'll start cursing at each other, yelling at each other, and the entrepreneurs will be like, 'What the hell is going on?'\" Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, the NBA franchise currently embroiled in controversy , told AOL . \nInvestor Robert Herjavec also says things can get heated. \"We have a very powerful relationship with our own money so ya, it gets serious. [The] tension is very real,\" he wrote during a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything.\" \nAnd the pitch process, which reportedly takes hours and is edited down to a few minutes, can be stressful. \nIn fact, there's a psychiatrist on set who talks to entrepreneurs before and after they make their pitch. \n\"People can get very upset when the outcome is not what they anticipated,\" Judge Kevin O'Leary previously told CNBC . \nFor her part, Frankel, star of Bravo show \"Bethenny & Fredrik\" and founder of Skinnygirl Cocktails — which sold to Beam Global in March 2011 for a reported $100 million — proved she has what it takes to swim with the sharks. \n\"Entrepreneurs are all over the place,\" Frankel says. \"Know your idea in a few sentences or less, have a clear cut plan, know exactly what you need [and] what you need the money for. \n\"You don't have a brand just because you have an idea and a product and a prototype,\" she adds. \"You're a brand if you understand exactly what your product is, if you know exactly who's buying it, if you understand the demo, if you can explain it in a few sentences or less, if you can execute your idea, if you are organized and delegate and know how to manage people and are creating an impact.\" \nLike this story?
