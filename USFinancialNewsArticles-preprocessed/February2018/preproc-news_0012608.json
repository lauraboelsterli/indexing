    "text": "South Bend company provides smart water infrastructure solutions\nRYE BROOK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company, today announced that it has acquired EmNet, LLC, a rapidly growing provider of smart solutions that enable municipalities to manage the urban water cycle and wastewater and stormwater systems. This addition further expands Xylem’s growing portfolio of advanced infrastructure analytics solutions and capabilities. Financial terms were not disclosed.\nEmNet’s core technology and expertise in real time decision support systems (RT-DSS) was developed as a multidisciplinary approach to solve the toughest watershed and collection system challenges. Their open architecture platform, called BLU-X, brings the power of big data analytics in real time to water and wastewater systems management.\n“We are very pleased to welcome EmNet to the Xylem family,” said Patrick Decker, Xylem President and Chief Executive Officer. “This is an important addition to our smart infrastructure portfolio because it significantly increases our ability to help customers manage their wastewater network and stormwater systems, areas of growing concern. Cities and utilities around the world are trying to effectively manage the challenges of aging infrastructure with limited resources. EmNet is leveraging technology to provide more effective solutions that actually improve their customers’ overall economics.”\n“We couldn’t be more pleased to be joining Xylem,” said Luis Montestruque, President and Chief Technology Officer of EmNet. “From the beginning, EmNet’s vision has been to solve the most pressing wastewater challenges as cost effectively as possible. Joining Xylem empowers our team to greatly accelerate our progress and expand our mission to a global scale.”\nEmNet was launched in 2004 as a collaborative partnership between the City of South Bend, Indiana, and the University of Notre Dame, led by Luis Montestruque, PhD, and initially funded by the State of Indiana. South Bend served as EmNet’s beta client for many years as the company developed its platform of RT-DSS tools and applications.\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said, “EmNet has been a shining example of city government and tech firms collaborating to find solutions. Our experience with EmNet set a precedent for South Bend’s cultivation of tech talent and entrepreneurship. It has been a true success story for our community, and we are excited as they open this new chapter with Xylem.”\nEmNet is working in cities across the U.S., with projects throughout the Great Lakes and Great Plains regions as well as coastal cities with tide-impacted collection systems such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.\nAbout Xylem\nXylem (XYL) is a leading global water technology company committed to developing innovative technology solutions to the world’s water challenges.
