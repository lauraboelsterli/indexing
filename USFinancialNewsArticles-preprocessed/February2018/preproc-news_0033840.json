Full year 2017 sales of $114.1 million net of $2.9 million attributed to the non-cash impact of warrants deducted from revenues, compared to $108.7 million net of $2.0 million attributed to the non-cash impact of warrants deducted from revenues in the prior year. Fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $0.4 million, or ($0.01) per diluted share; non-GAAP net income of $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Full year GAAP net loss of $2.0 million, or ($0.06) per diluted share; non-GAAP net income of $4.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share.\nROSH-HA`AYIN, Israel, Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kornit Digital Ltd. (NASDAQ:KRNT), a leading provider of digital printing solutions for the global printed textile industry, today reported results and fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP figures in today’s press release are presented using a different methodology compared to previous periods as a result of comments from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. These changes also impact the Company's guidance methodology.\nThe Company will provide additional information in today's earnings call, details of which can be found at the end of today's press release.\nRevenues of 2017 were $30.0 million, which represents a decrease of $2.0 million compared to the prior year. The non-cash impact of the warrants deducted from revenues amounted to $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Lower revenues were driven by a large customer who, as previously disclosed, was unable to take a scheduled delivery of a large number of systems due to unforeseen protracted delays in the receipt of regulatory permits.\nGAAP net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.4 million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $0.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis net income was $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to prior-year non-GAAP net income of $3.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share.\nGabi Seligsohn, Kornit Digital’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “The second half of 2017 was challenging as the previously announced order delay negatively impacted our results for the year. Customer timing issues notwithstanding, we believe consumer behavior affecting retail business models reached a tipping point in 2017, forcing the supply chain to react and positioning Kornit exceptionally well to capture large scale volume with screen printers. To that end, we generated meaningful interest from high volume printers at our recent trade shows, which underscores the capability of our newest technologies that offer a materially lower cost per print.”\nSeligsohn added, “We expect a meaningful uptick in our growth rate in 2018 driven by higher adoption rates of our products by screen printers, incremental deliveries on key customer programs and the success of new product introductions including our recently announced Avalanche HD6, which is currently being installed at multiple customer sites. These new systems and upgrade kits offer significant savings on cost per print in conjunction with high definition imaging and improved hand-feel. These growth drivers are supported by improving trends in European and Asian markets and a revamped North America sales team, all of which contribute to our optimism in the year ahead.”\nFourth Quarter Results of Operations\nKornit reported fourth quarter revenues which are net of the non-cash impact of warrants deducted from revenues, of $30.0 million, compared with the prior-year level of $32.0 million. The total non-cash impact of the warrants deducted from revenues was $0.4 million in 2017, and $2.0 million in 2016. Lower sales were the result of previously disclosed program delays associated with permitting at a large customer site.\nOn a GAAP basis, fourth quarter gross profit was $14.5 million, compared with $13.6 million, in the prior-year. Non-GAAP gross profit in the fourth quarter was $14.6 million, or 48.9% of sales, compared with $14.9 million, or 46.6% of sales in the prior-year. Higher gross margins primarily reflected a seasonally stronger contribution from ink and consumables.\nOn a GAAP basis, total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $15 million, compared to $12.8 million in the prior period. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased to $13.5 million, or 45.1% of sales, compared to $11.8 million, or 36.9% of sales in the prior year. The increase in total operating expenses was consistent with the previously stated growth strategy, as the Company continues to execute to its global infrastructure build out and was particularly impacted by costs associated with increased headcount expenses.\nFourth quarter GAAP research and development expenses were $5.6 million, compared to the prior-year period of $5.1 million. Fourth quarter non-GAAP research and development expenses were $5.4 million, or 18.2% of sales, compared to $4.9 million, or 15.5% of sales in the prior-year.\nOn a GAAP basis, fourth quarter operating loss was $0.5 million, compared to the prior year period operating income of $0.8 million. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter decreased to $1.1 million, compared to $3.1 million in the prior year. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating margin was 3.8% of sales, compared with 9.7% of sales in the prior year.\nOn a GAAP basis, the Company reported a net loss of $0.4 million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, compared to a net income of $0.8 million, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income of 2017 was $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to $3.0 million in the prior year period.\nFull Year 2017 Results of Operations\nFull year 2017 GAAP revenues which are net of the non-cash impact of the warrants deducted from revenues were $114.1 million, compared to revenues of $108.7 million in the prior year. The full year impact from warrants was $2.9 million in 2017, and $2.0 million in 2016. Higher sales compared to the prior year were primarily related to higher volume of products sold, the success of new product introductions and incremental sales from services. For the full-year, the Company recorded 89.4% of revenue from products, and 10.6% of revenue from services.\nFull year GAAP gross profit was $54.1 million, compared to $49.4 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP gross profit for the full year 2017 was $54.8 million, or 48.1% of sales, compared to $52.6 million, or 48.4% of sales for the full year 2016.\nFull year 2017 operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $56.2 million, compared to $48 million for the full year of 2016. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year of 2017 were $50.7 million, or 44.4% of sales, compared to the prior year level of $44 million, or 40.5% of sales. The increase in total operating expenses was consistent with the previously stated growth strategy, as the Company continues to execute to its global infrastructure build out.\nFull year 2017 research and development expenses on a GAAP basis were $20.8 million, compared to the prior year of $17.4 million. Full year non-GAAP research and development expenses were $20.1 million, or 17.6% of sales, compared to $17.0 million, or 15.6% of sales in the prior year.\nFull year 2017 GAAP operating loss decreased to $2.1 million, compared to operating income of $1.4 million in the year ago period. Non-GAAP operating income in the full year 2017 decreased to $4.1 million, compared to the prior year period of $8.6 million.\nOn a GAAP basis, full year 2017 net losses were $2.0 million, or ($0.06) per diluted share, compared to $0.8 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP full year 2017 net income was $4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $7.8 million in the prior year.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalent, short term deposits and marketable securities of $97.5 million. Cash flow from operating activity for fourth quarter 2017 was $12.0 million. Cash flow from operations for the full-year of 2017 were $6.0 million.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance\nThe Company will discuss the details of its guidance live during its earnings conference call, which will be available for replay via webcast at ir.kornit.com .\nConference Call Information\nGabi Seligsohn, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and Guy Avidan, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET, or 0:00 a.m. Israel time, to discuss the results, followed by a question and answer session for the investment community.
