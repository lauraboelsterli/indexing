    "text": "MIDLAND PARK, N.J., Stewardship Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:SSFN), parent company of Atlantic Stewardship Bank, reported results for fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. Net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 was reported at $48,000 and $3.9 million, respectively. Both the three months and the year ended December 31, 2017 were impacted by a charge of $1.4 million as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) in December 2017. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 net income was $1.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted which reduced the Federal statutory tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% effective in 2018. While the Tax Act will lower the Corporation’s future tax rate, it also required the Corporation to revalue its net deferred tax assets to account for the future impact of the lower corporate tax rates. As a result, the Corporation recognized a charge of $1.4 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 related to the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively. (Please refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation table at the end of this document for details on the earnings impact of the Tax Act).\nIn reflecting on the Corporation's 2017 accomplishments, Paul Van Ostenbridge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Stewardship Financial Corporation, highlighted the following:\n$133.2 million of growth in assets; Asset growth was driven by 18% of loan growth; 16% of deposit growth provided the funding needs; Net interest income increased 17%; A successful capital raise was completed in April 2017; Our newest location opened in Morristown, NJ in June 2017; The formation of a Small Business Administration (SBA) Department occurred in the fall of 2017 - improving our ability to provide lending solutions for small businesses that do not meet traditional lending requirements; Expenses were maintained, even with the growth in the balance sheet.\n\"The Corporation remains committed to building on the successes of the year just ended, including prudently growing the loan portfolio to further improve our strong core earnings.”\nOperating Results\nNet interest income of $6.8 million and $26.4 million was reported for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Current net interest income levels reflect improvement over the $5.9 million and $22.6 million reported in the comparable prior year periods, with the current year increases primarily driven by growth in the loan portfolio. Average loan balances increased $133.4 million and $131.4 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, over the comparable prior year periods. The net interest margins for the current three month period and the year were 3.09% and 3.13%, respectively, compared to 3.18% for both the three months and year ended December 31, 2016. The margins continue to reflect an environment with a flattened yield curve.\nDue in a large part to growth in the loan portfolio, the Corporation recorded provisions for loan losses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 of $75,000 and $655,000, respectively. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 negative provisions for loan losses were $300,000 and $1.35 million, respectively. With relatively stable credit quality, the allowance for loan losses to total gross loans declined to 1.23% at December 31, 2017 compared to 1.31% at December 31, 2016.\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest income was $850,000 and $3.3 million, respectively, compared to $937,000 and $3.4 million in the equivalent prior year periods. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest income included $55,000 and $178,000 of gains on sales of mortgage loans, respectively, compared to $94,000 and $164,000 for the comparable prior year periods. For the year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest income included $1,000 of gains on calls and sales of securities compared to $63,000 for the comparable prior year period.\nNoninterest expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.1 million and $20.3 million, respectively, compared to $5.0 million and $19.9 million in the comparable prior year periods. Van Ostenbridge stated, “We have been committed to managing our infrastructure and containing costs while growing the balance sheet and are encouraged by the efficiencies realized.”\nBalance Sheet / Financial Condition\nTotal assets of $928.8 million at December 31, 2017 reflected a $133.2 million increase, or 17%, since December 31, 2016. The asset growth continues to be driven by organic loan originations which resulted in a $107.6 million year-over-year increase in the gross loan portfolio.\nDeposit balances totaled $764.1 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting $105.2 million of net growth when compared to $658.9 million a year earlier. A mix of organic growth and the retention / expansion of existing relationships has resulted in solid increases in deposits. Van Ostenbridge noted, “Essentially, we have demonstrated our ability to fund the increase in loans with deposit growth.\" Other borrowings were $63.8 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $59.2 million at December 31, 2016. Approximately $20 million of the growth in other borrowings can be attributed to a leverage strategy undertaken in conjunction with the capital raise in April 2017.\nAll regulatory capital levels at December 31, 2017 continue to reflect a strong capital position with ratios in excess of the levels to be considered \"well capitalized\" under the applicable regulations. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.88% and 7.65% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total risk based capital ratio was 14.29% at December 31, 2017 compared to 13.10% at December 31, 2016.\nAbout Stewardship Financial Corporation\nStewardship Financial Corporation’s subsidiary, the Atlantic Stewardship Bank, is a full-service community bank serving both individuals and businesses.
