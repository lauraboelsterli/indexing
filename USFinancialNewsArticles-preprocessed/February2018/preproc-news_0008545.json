LOUIS, Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, reporting diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30 and $4.69, respectively, and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.97 and $5.03, respectively.\nIn summary, the 2017 fourth quarter and full year results were as follows:\n2017 Results\nQ4\nFull Year\nTotal revenues (in millions)\n$\n12,806\n$\n48,382\nHealth benefits ratio\n87.3\n%\n87.3\n%\nSG&A expense ratio\n10.9\n%\n9.7\n%\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$\n1.30\n$\n4.69\nAdjusted Diluted EPS (1)\n$\n0.97\n$\n5.03\nTotal cash flow provided by operations (in millions)\n$\n450\n$\n1,489\n(1) A full reconciliation of Adjusted Diluted EPS is shown on page eight of this release.\nMichael F. Neidorff, Centene's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"The strong fourth quarter and full year results for 2017 provide positive momentum heading into 2018 as we continue to focus on revenue growth and margin expansion.\"\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Income Tax Reform), the Company's fourth quarter and full year results include a nonrecurring benefit associated with the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities. The benefit of Income Tax Reform has been partially offset by a contribution to the Company's charitable foundation and additional expense due to the lack of cost sharing reduction (CSR) subsidy funding by the Federal Government in the fourth quarter and full year 2017. These items, among others, have been excluded from Adjusted Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter and full year results. A full reconciliation of Adjusted Diluted EPS is shown on page eight of this release.\nThe following discussions, with the exception of cash flow information, are in the context of continuing operations.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Highlights\nDecember 31, 2017 managed care membership of 12.2 million, an increase of 765,300 members, or 7% over 2016.

The increase over prior year was primarily a result of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017. This was partially offset by the fourth quarter of 2016 benefiting from $195 million of additional revenue associated with the minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) amendment in California, as well as the moratorium of the health insurer fee in 2017 and lower 2017 membership in the commercial business in California as a result of margin improvement actions taken in 2016. Sequentially, total revenues increased 8% over the third quarter of 2017 mainly due to approximately $700 million associated with pass through payments from the State of California being received in the fourth quarter that were recorded in premium tax revenue and premium tax expense. HBR of 87.3% for the fourth quarter of 2017 represents an increase from 84.8% in the comparable period in 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016, relating to the minimum MLR amendment in California, which reduced the fourth quarter of 2016 HBR by 170 basis points. In addition, the year-over-year increase was attributable to new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR, a premium rate reduction for California Medicaid Expansion effective July 1, 2017, an increase in flu related costs over the fourth quarter of 2016, and the additional expense recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the lack of funding of CSR subsidy payments by the Federal Government. HBR decreased sequentially from 88.0% in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to improved performance in Medicaid, including the impacts of rate adjustments, as well as performance in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. These HBR improvements were partially offset by the increase in flu related costs over the third quarter of 2017 and additional expense recognized in the fourth quarter due to the lack of funding of CSR subsidy payments by the Federal Government. The SG&A expense ratio was 10.9% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 10.0% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 9.0% for the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily a result of increased business expansion costs over the fourth quarter of 2016, and revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016, relating to the minimum MLR amendment in California, which reduced the fourth quarter of 2016 SG&A expense ratio. Sequentially, the SG&A expense ratio increased primarily due to increased selling costs associated with open enrollment and the $40 million contribution to our charitable foundation in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 10.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 9.4% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 8.9% for the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily a result of increased business expansion costs over the fourth quarter of 2016, and revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016, relating to the minimum MLR amendment in California, which reduced the fourth quarter of 2016 Adjusted SG&A expense ratio. Sequentially, the Adjusted SG&A expense ratio increased primarily due to increased selling costs associated with open enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nStatement of Operations: Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the full year 2017, total revenues increased 19% to $48.4 billion from $40.6 billion in the comparable period of 2016. The increase over prior year was primarily a result of a full year of Health Net's results, as well as the impact of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017. This was partially offset by the moratorium of the health insurer fee in 2017, lower membership in the commercial business in California as a result of margin improvement actions taken in 2016, and lower specialty pharmacy revenues. HBR of 87.3% for the full year 2017 represents an increase from 86.5% in the comparable period in 2016. The increase compared to last year was primarily a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum MLR change in California, which reduced the 2016 HBR by 50 basis points, a premium rate reduction for California Medicaid Expansion effective July 1, 2017, an increase in flu related costs over 2016, and the impact of new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR. These increases were partially offset by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, which operates at a lower HBR. The SG&A expense ratio was 9.7% for the full year 2017, compared to 9.8% for the full year 2016. The decrease in the SG&A expense ratio was primarily attributable to lower acquisition related expenses, partially offset by higher business expansion costs over 2016, the Penn Treaty assessment and our results including a full year of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and Medicare business. The Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 9.5% for the full year 2017, compared to 9.0% for the full year 2016. The increase in the Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was primarily attributable to higher business expansion costs over 2016 and a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and Medicare business.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, investments and restricted deposits of $10.1 billion, including $310 million held by unregulated entities. Medical claims liabilities totaled $4.3 billion. The Company's days in claims payable was 41. Total debt was $4.7 billion, which includes $150 million of borrowings on the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at quarter-end. The debt to capitalization ratio was 40.3% at December 31, 2017, excluding the $61 million non-recourse mortgage note.\nCash flow provided by operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $450 million, primarily due to net earnings and a decrease in premium and trade receivables, partially offset by a decrease in unearned revenue.\nOutlook\nThe Company's annual guidance for 2018 has been updated for the following items:\nThe benefit of Income Tax Reform that was signed into law in December 2017, partially offset by additional costs associated with the reinvestment of a portion of the tax reform benefit; An increase in total revenues and earnings associated with higher membership expectations for the Health Insurance Marketplace business; and A change in the timing of the equity issuance from February 1, 2018 to March 1, 2018 for the $2.3 billion of equity to finance the acquisition of New York State Catholic Health Plan, Inc. d/b/a Fidelis Care New York (Fidelis Care) (Proposed Fidelis Acquisition), which reduces diluted shares outstanding.

The Company uses the presented non-GAAP financial measures internally to allow management to focus on period-to-period changes in the Company's core business operations. Therefore, the Company believes that this information is meaningful in addition to the information contained in the GAAP presentation of financial information. The presentation of this additional non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nSpecifically, the Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial information that excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related expenses, as well as other items, allows investors to develop a more meaningful understanding of the Company's performance over time.

We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in PSLRA. A number of factors, variables or events could cause actual plans and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, Centene's ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health benefits and other operating expenses and reserves; competition; membership and revenue declines or unexpected trends; changes in healthcare practices, new technologies and advances in medicine; increased healthcare costs; changes in economic, political or market conditions; changes in federal or state laws or regulations, including changes with respect to government healthcare programs as well as changes with respect to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act and any regulations enacted thereunder that may result from changing political conditions; rate cuts or other payment reductions or delays by governmental payors and other risks and uncertainties affecting Centene's government businesses; Centene's ability to adequately price products on federally facilitated and state based Health Insurance Marketplaces; tax matters; disasters or major epidemics; the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings; changes in expected contract start dates; provider, state, federal and other contract changes and timing of regulatory approval of contracts; the expiration, suspension or termination of Centene or Fidelis Care's contracts with federal or state governments (including but not limited to Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE); the difficulty of predicting the timing or outcome of pending or future litigation or government investigations; challenges to Centene or Fidelis Care's contract awards; cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents; the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation from acquired businesses, including, without limitation, the Health Net Acquisition and the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition, will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period, including, but not limited to, as a result of any failure to obtain any regulatory, governmental or third party consents or approvals in connection with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition (including any such approvals under the New York Non-For-Profit Corporation Law) or any conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed in connection with the receipt of such consents or approvals; the exertion of management's time and Centene's resources, and other expenses incurred and business changes required in connection with complying with the undertakings in connection with any regulatory, governmental or third party consents or approvals for the Health Net Acquisition; disruption caused by significant completed and pending acquisitions, including the Health Net Acquisition and the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition, making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred in connection with the completion and/or integration of acquisition transactions, including among others, the Health Net Acquisition and the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition; changes in expected closing dates, estimated purchase price and accretion for acquisitions; the risk that acquired businesses, including Health Net and Fidelis Care, will not be integrated successfully; the risk that the conditions to the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, or at all; failure to obtain or receive any required regulatory approvals, consents or clearances for the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition, and the risk that, even if so obtained or received, regulatory authorities impose conditions on the completion of the transaction that could require the exertion of management's time and Centene's resources or otherwise have an adverse effect on Centene; business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition is pending, which could adversely affect Centene's business and operations; change of control provisions or other provisions in certain agreements to which Fidelis Care is a party, which may be triggered by the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition; loss of management personnel and other key employees due to uncertainties associated with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition; the risk that, following completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition, the combined company may not be able to effectively manage its expanded operations; restrictions and limitations that may stem from the financing arrangements that the combined company will enter into in connection with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition; Centene's ability to achieve improvement in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Star ratings and maintain or achieve improvement in other quality scores in each case that can impact revenue and future growth; availability of debt and equity financing, on terms that are favorable to Centene; inflation; foreign currency fluctuations; and risks and uncertainties discussed in the reports that Centene has filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements reflect Centene's current views with respect to future events and are based on numerous assumptions and assessments made by Centene in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, business strategies, operating environments, future developments and other factors it believes appropriate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are subject to change because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this press release could cause Centene's plans with respect to the Health Net Acquisition, actual results, performance or achievements, industry results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although it is currently believed that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this press release are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this press release. Centene does not assume any obligation to update the information contained in this press release (whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise), except as required by applicable law. This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain other risk factors that may affect Centene's business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in Centene's filings with the SEC, including the annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\n[Tables Follow]\nCENTENE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE

consistent actuarial methodology to estimate Centene's ultimate liability. Any reduction in the \"Incurred related to: Prior period\" amount may be offset as Centene actuarially determines \"Incurred related to: Current period.\" As such, only in the absence of a consistent reserving methodology would favorable development of prior period claims liability estimates reduce medical costs. Centene believes it has consistently applied its claims reserving methodology. Additionally, approximately $1 million was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues resulting from development within \"Incurred related to: Prior period\" due to minimum HBR and other return of premium programs.\nThe amount of the \"Incurred related to: Prior period\" above represents favorable development and includes the effects of reserving under moderately adverse conditions, new markets where we use a conservative approach in setting reserves during the initial periods of operations, receipts from other third party payors related to coordination of benefits and lower medical utilization and cost trends for dates of service December 31, 2016, and prior.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/centene-corporation-reports-2017-results-and-increases-2018-guidance-300593868.html\nSOURCE Centene Corporation",
