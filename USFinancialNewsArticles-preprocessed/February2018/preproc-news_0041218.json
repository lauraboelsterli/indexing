    "text": "February 17, 2018 / 5:00 PM / Updated an hour ago Bayern snatch win with late penalty but Cologne foiled by VAR Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - Robert Lewandowski converted a 90th-minute penalty as runaway Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich beat VfL Wolfsburg 2-1 on Saturday while bottom club Cologne were denied a rare win by a video replay. Bayern clocked up a 10th successive Bundesliga win despite falling behind to an early Daniel Didavi goal and missing a penalty when Arjen Robbenâ€™s effort was saved by Koen Casteels just after halftime. Soccer Football - Bundesliga - VfL Wolfsburg vs Bayern Munich - Volkswagen Arena, Wolfsburg, Germany - February 17, 2018 Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski celebrates scoring their second goal with David Alaba REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer Sandro Wagner equalised for the Bavarians and then Robert Lewandowski converted their second penalty of the afternoon following a bizarre foul on Robben by teenager Gian-Luca Itter as Bayern went 21 points clear. At the other end of the table, Cologne thought they had snatched an injury-time win over Hannover 96 when veteran Peruvian forward Claudio Pizarro scored. But it was disallowed for offside after the referee consulted the video assistant (VAR) and the game ended 1-1, leaving Cologne three points adrift at the bottom.
