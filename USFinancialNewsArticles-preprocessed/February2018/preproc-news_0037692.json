Still, it could pursue a final rate cut next month if inflation continues to underwhelm, the bank said.\n“Some members expressed a preference for a high level of flexibility, favoring more symmetric communication about the next step, while others proposed to signal more strongly the possible interruption of the monetary easing cycle and to maintain freedom of action, but to a lesser extent,” the minutes said.\nLast week, the central bank cut the benchmark Selic interest rate by 25 basis points, as widely expected, to an all-time low of 6.75 percent, and it strongly hinted at the end of the easing cycle.\nThe cut came despite a selloff in global stock markets as a jump in U.S. wages raised questions about the pace of rate hikes there, sending shock waves through developed and emerging markets alike.\nStill, consumer price figures released since then came in sharply below economist forecasts, raising doubt over the bank’s plans as inflation remains stubbornly below the bottom-end of the official target.\nYields on interest rate futures suggested a sizeable minority of traders expected a final rate cut at the bank’s March meeting, though bets on the bank standing pat remained dominant.\nThe minutes stressed that the central bank has the leeway to adjust policy both to slower-than-expected inflation and to a worsening of global financial conditions.\nEconomists agree, however, that keeping interest rates at low levels will hinge on policymakers’ ability to curb government spending, a task that looks increasingly difficult as this year’s presidential elections approach.
