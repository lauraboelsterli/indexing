    "text": "GREELEY, Colo., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- JBS USA Lux S.A. (formerly known as JBS USA, LLC) (“JBS USA”) and JBS USA Finance, Inc. today announced that they successfully closed their previously announced offering of US$900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due February 15, 2028 (the “Notes”).\nJBS USA intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to pay for a previously announced redemption for all of its US$700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”), with the remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, including to repay a portion of the outstanding amount under its senior secured revolving credit facility. The redemption of the 2020 Notes will take place on March 5, 2018.\nThis press release does not constitute a notice of redemption for purposes of the redemption provisions of the indenture governing the 2020 Notes. A conditional notice of redemption was previously given in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2020 Notes.\nThis press release is neither an offer to purchase or sell nor a solicitation of an offer to sell or buy the 2020 Notes or the Notes. There shall not be any sale of the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.\nThe Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to any U.S. persons absent registration under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Notes will be offered only to “qualified institutional buyers” under Rule 144A of the Securities Act or, outside the United States, to persons other than “U.S. persons” in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nImportant Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements.
