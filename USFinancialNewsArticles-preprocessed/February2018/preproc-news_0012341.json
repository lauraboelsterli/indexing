    "text": "0 COMMENTS Scary Mommy has connected with audiences with humorous series like “Madge the Vag.” Photo: Some Spider Studios Snapchat is starting to hang out with an older crowd.\nThe traditionally teen-focused social media app is adding its first parenting channel, with child-rearing humor and advice site Scary Mommy joining Snapchat Discover on Tuesday.\nHelping Snapchat connect with an older audience is just one of several recent developments for Scary Mommy’s parent company, Some Spider Studios.\nSome Spider, which was founded in late 2014, also just closed a $10 million funding round led by New Enterprise Associates. Red and Blue Ventures and Graph Ventures also participated.\n“These investments are in furtherance of our overriding mission, which has remained the same since day one—creating multiple national, iconic brands around big identities and values that make deep emotional connections,” said Some Spider’s founder, Vinit Bharara.\nLate last year, the company soft-launched The Dad as a companion site to Scary Mommy. Mr. Bharara’s brother, Preet Bharara, the high-profile former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York who was abruptly fired by President Trump in March, joined the company in June. He’s hosting a podcast on its political humor site, Cafe.com.\nThe company plans to use proceeds from the investment to finance Scary Mommy’s Snapchat channel as well as develop a slate of podcasts and additional video content with the hopes of an eventual over-the-top streaming channel, Vinit Bharara said.\nAlthough The Dad just soft-launched in November, it already scored a recent viral hit with a mashup spoof on big pharma commercials and the parenting blues, which racked up more than 6 million Facebook views in a week. Photo: Some Spider Studios They also plan to build a fuller team for The Dad and further orient Cafe.com around Preet Bharara’s personality and political views, with a slate of additional podcasts and events.\nThe company’s most developed project is Scary Mommy, which it acquired in 2015. Since then the site has grown steadily. It brought in $13.2 million in revenue in 2017—mostly from advertising, a person familiar with the matter said. That’s up from $6 million in 2016 and $1 million in 2015, the person said.\nLast year, Scary Mommy averaged 13.2 million unique U.S. visitors to its site a month, according to comScore Inc. It has 3.5 million followers on Facebook and 828,000 followers on Instagram.\nVinit Bharara made his name as co-creator of e-commerce startup Quidsi Inc.—the parent company of Diapers.com and Soap.com—and then selling it to Amazon.com Inc. in 2010 for about $550 million.\nAt the same time Mr. Bharara began building Some Spider, his partner in Quidsi, childhood friend Marc Lore, sold his next venture, Jet.com, to Walmart for $3.3 billion. Mr. Lore has also invested in Some Spider.\n“I have tried to apply the lessons I have learned through e-commerce and see if we could make it work with things dealing with human emotions and expression,” Mr. Bharara said.\nWrite to Lukas I.
