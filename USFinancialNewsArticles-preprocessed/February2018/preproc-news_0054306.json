    "text": "Published: Feb 24, 2018 9:03 a.m. ET Share \nBerkshire’s mounting cash pile, mostly invested in Treasury bills, grew to $116 billion at year-end Getty Images Warren Buffet, shown here in 2015, said in his annual letter out Saturday that steep prices for “decent but far from spectacular” businesses have kept him from deal making. \nBy Nicole Friedman \nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. said Saturday it posted a $29 billion gain in 2017 related to changes in U.S. tax law, a boost that inflated annual profits for the Omaha conglomerate. \nIn a letter to shareholders also released Saturday, Berkshire BRK.A,   Chairman Warren Buffett lamented the lack of well-priced acquisition opportunities and reiterated his advice that individuals should avoid debt and invest passively. \nRecent changes to the tax law lowered Berkshire’s deferred tax obligations for stock investments that it currently holds. Berkshire’s net earnings rose to $44.94 billion in 2017 from $24.07 billion the prior year. \nBerkshire’s operating earnings fell 24% in the fourth quarter, hurt by losses in the company’s insurance operations. \nThe company’s book value per share rose 23% in 2017, the company said, compared with a 22% total return in the S&P 500, including dividends. \nBerkshire’s mounting cash pile, which is mostly invested in Treasury bills, grew to $116 billion at year-end.",
