    "text": "(Adds natural gas, coal and renewables used to generate power and carbon emissions, paragraphs 5-12)\nFeb 6 (Reuters) - U.S. dry natural gas production was forecast to rise to an all-time high of 80.30 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2018 from 73.57 bcfd in 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration’s Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO) on Tuesday.\nThe latest February output projection for 2018 was down from the EIA’s 80.42-bcfd forecast in January but would easily top the current annual record high of 74.15 bcfd produced on average in 2015.\nEIA also projected U.S. gas consumption would rise to an all-time high of 77.44 bcfd in 2018 from 74.29 bcfd in 2017.\nThat 2018 demand projection in the February STEO report was down from EIA’s 77.53-bcfd forecast for the year in its January report but would easily top the current annual record high of 75.10 bcfd consumed on average in 2016.\nBoth production and consumption would jump to record highs in 2019 with output hitting 82.86 bcfd and usage reaching 79.20 bcfd, the EIA forecast.\nIn electric generation, the EIA projected gas would remain the primary U.S. power plant fuel in 2018 and 2019 after taking that title from coal for the first time ever in 2016. Coal had been the primary fuel for U.S. generators for the last century.\nThe EIA projected gas’ share of generation would rise to 33.0 percent in 2018 and 33.9 percent in 2019 from 31.7 percent in 2017.\nCoal’s share of generation was forecast to slide to 29.7 percent in 2018 and 28.8 percent in 2019 from 30.2 percent in 2017.\nWind power capacity was expected to rise to about 95 gigawatts by the end of 2018 and 104 GW by the end of 2019, from about 87 GW in 2017.\nThe EIA said it expected solar power capacity to rise to 50 GW by the end of 2018 and 65 GW by the end of 2019 from 42 GW in 2017.\nOne gigawatt is enough to power about 1 million U.S. homes.\nAfter declining to 5,143 million tonnes in 2017, the least since 1992, the EIA projected U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would rise to 5,237 million tonnes in 2018 and 5,259 million tonnes in 2019 due to changes in weather, economic growth, and energy prices, the EIA said.
