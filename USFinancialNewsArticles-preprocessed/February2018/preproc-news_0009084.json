    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MLI) announced today operating income of $22.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $29.3 million in the same quarter of 2016. Net income for the quarter was $5.7 million, or 10 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $523.5 million, compared with net income of $17.3 million, or 30 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $472.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOn a full year basis, the Company reported operating income of $152.0 million, compared with $152.7 million in fiscal year 2016. Net income for the year was $85.6 million, or $1.49 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.3 billion, compared with net income of $99.7 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2016.\nFinancial and Operating Highlights:\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, copper prices rose 4 percent and averaged $3.10 per pound. During the fourth quarter of 2016, copper prices rose 20 percent and averaged $2.39 per pound. The effect of changes in copper prices during the quarter on inventory valuations and hedging positions compared with the prior year quarter, along with physical inventory adjustments, resulted in a $12.0 million negative swing in operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Both the Piping Systems and Industrial Metals segments were impacted. A casting outage in our brass rod mill impaired our ability to melt scrap returns in the fourth quarter of 2017 causing an excess build of $38.9 million in inventory. The line is now operating, and inventory levels are expected to normalize in 2018. A $6.5 million pre-tax environmental charge was recorded in the quarter related to ongoing remediation activities at U.S.S. Lead, a non-operating property. Interest expense for the quarter was $5.3 million, compared with $2.0 million in the same quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to interest on the Company’s 6% Subordinated Debentures. The effective tax rate for the quarter of 42 percent reflects the net impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nRegarding the business, Greg Christopher, Mueller CEO, said, “Our fourth quarter earnings were adversely affected by inventory impacts and, to a lesser but still important degree, the ongoing challenges in our U.S. copper tube business as previously reported. The modernization of our Fulton, Mississippi copper tube mill, combined with the costs associated with the startup of our new Cedar City, Utah mill, hampered our fourth quarter results. On a full year basis, cost overruns, start-up costs, throughput constraints, quality and yield challenges, along with an associated decline in market share, impacted our copper tube earnings by over $25.0 million.”\nIn conclusion, he added “The international markets we serve remained stable and better than anticipated in 2017, and demand in the U.S. markets continued to remain positive. We anticipate these conditions will continue in 2018. We will be aggressive in regaining our market share positions and avoiding the same operational issues experienced in 2017, as we remain steadfast in our commitment to grow.”\nMueller Industries, Inc. is an industrial manufacturer that specializes in copper and copper alloy manufacturing while also producing goods made from aluminum, steel, and plastics.
