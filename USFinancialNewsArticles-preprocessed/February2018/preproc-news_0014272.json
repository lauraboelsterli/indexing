    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Talonvest Capital, Inc. successfully negotiated and structured an $18 million acquisition-bridge loan secured by Eden Landing, a 195,044 square foot, 10-building business park in Hayward, CA on behalf of CIP Real Estate. The non-recourse bridge loan was funded by a national banking institution and priced at LIBOR plus 2.50% with interest only payments during the initial three-year term. Prepayment flexibility and extension options were also negotiated for the borrower. Bob Strom, Principal of CIP Real Estate, commented, “Based on experience, we know Talonvest tenaciously protects our time and money throughout the lender competition, underwriting, due diligence, and closing processes.
