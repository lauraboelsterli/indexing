    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sigma Designs, Inc.® (NASDAQ:SIGM) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc. (“ISSI”) to sell to ISSI its Wired Connectivity Business Unit, which includes Sigma Designs Israel, S.D.I. Ltd., a Sigma Designs subsidiary which is the operating entity for the wired connectivity business. Subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, ISSI has agreed to pay $28.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments based on the amount of working capital delivered at closing and a holdback of $4.2 million to secure indemnification obligations of Sigma. Sigma will continue to provide certain support services during a transition period. The parties expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of Sigma’s fiscal 2019, ending April 28, 2018. Sigma currently expects that it will not pay any taxes associated with the receipt of the transaction consideration.\nSigma Designs’ Media Connectivity Business Unit is engaged with specialty networking technology, which includes the G.hn, Home Plug and HPNA standards, which provide communications to set-top boxes, smart appliances, and other applications.\n“Following the recently announced sale of Sigma’s Z-Wave business to Silicon Labs for $240.0 million, we are pleased to have found a buyer for our Wired Connectivity Business Unit that will work to move this technology forward and leverage the work accomplished at Sigma Designs. We will continue to explore alternatives to increase the available cash for distribution to shareholders through the previously reported plan to wind down or divest its remaining businesses over the next 12 months,” said Elias Nader, Interim President and CEO of Sigma Designs.\nSigma Designs\nSigma Designs, Inc.® (NASDAQ:SIGM) is a world leader in enabling smart home convergence.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements that address the benefits to Sigma of the proposed transaction, the anticipated timing of the closing of the proposed transaction, the expected tax consequences to Sigma of the proposed transaction, the statement that Sigma will continue to explore alternatives to increase the available cash for distribution to shareholders through the previously reported plan to wind down or divest its remaining businesses over the next 12 months, and other statements identified by words such as “will”, “expect”, “intends”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “should”, “intend”, “plan”, “potential”, “predict” “project”, “aim”, and similar words, phrases or expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs of the management of Sigma Designs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, such management, and involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are Sigma’s and its management’s control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements.
