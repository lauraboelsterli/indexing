    "text": "OLD GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ellington Financial LLC (NYSE:EFC) (the \"Company\") today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.41 per share, payable on March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2018. (1) Subject to the ultimate discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company's management expects to continue to recommend quarterly dividends of $0.41 per share until conditions warrant otherwise. At the end of each year, the Board of Directors takes into account the Company's earnings and other factors to consider whether to declare a special dividend. Periodically, management may adjust its quarterly dividend recommendation based on the Company's actual earnings, management's assessment of the Company's long-term earnings prospects, and other factors. The declaration and amount of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\n(1) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the fourth quarter 2017 dividend will be treated as a capital distribution to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2018. In computing their 2018 U.S. federal taxable income, U.S. shareholders will generally be required to take into account their allocable share of the Company's taxable income as reported to them on their 2018 Schedules K-1.\nFor tax withholding purposes, the distribution consists of the following components:\nAmount of Dividend Interest Income (U.S.) that Qualifies for the Portfolio Interest Exception (1) $ 0.1847\nOther Interest Income (2) $ 0.0027\nU.S. Dividend Income (2) $ 0.2226\nTotal Distribution Per Unit (3) $ 0.4100 (1)\nAs described in §871 (h) of the Internal Revenue Code (“the Code”).\n(2)\nSubject to withholding under §1441 of the Code.\n(3)\nNo portion of this distribution represents income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some portion of future dividends may represent income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.\nThe Company does not provide advice on tax matters to its shareholders or to broker/nominees who hold the Company's shares on behalf of their customers. The information above is provided for informational purposes only, is subject to change as more definitive information is obtained by the Company, and does not constitute tax advice. Non-U.S. holders of the Company's common shares and broker/nominees who hold shares on behalf of such holders are strongly urged to consult with their own tax advisors with regard to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the dividends paid by the Company. This information is not intended to, and cannot, be used by any taxpayer to avoid penalties that may be imposed under U.S. federal income tax law.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
