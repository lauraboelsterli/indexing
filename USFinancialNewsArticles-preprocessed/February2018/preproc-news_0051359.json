    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nAs previously announced, TDS will hold a teleconference February 23, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. CST. Listen to the call live via the Events & Presentations page of investors.tdsinc.com .\nTelephone and Data Systems, Inc. (NYSE:TDS) reported total operating revenues of $1,308 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, versus $1,293 million for the same period one year ago and Net income available to TDS common shareholders and related diluted earnings per share were $287 million and $2.54, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding a benefit of $327 million ($282 million, non-GAAP, net of noncontrolling interests impacts) related to the enactment of new tax legislation, Net income available to TDS common shareholders and related diluted earnings per share excluding adjustments (non-GAAP) were $6 million and $0.05, respectively for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a Net loss available to TDS common shareholders and related diluted loss per share of $5 million and $0.05, respectively, in the same period one year ago.\nTDS reported total operating revenues of $5,044 million and $5,155 million for the years ended 2017 and 2016, respectively, and Net income available to TDS common shareholders and related diluted earnings per share were $153 million and $1.37, respectively, for the year ended 2017. Excluding the benefit of $327 million ($282 million, non-GAAP, net of noncontrolling interests impacts) related to the enactment of new tax legislation and a loss on goodwill impairment of $262 million ($188 million, non-GAAP, net of tax and noncontrolling interest impacts) in the third quarter of 2017, Net income available to TDS common shareholders and related diluted earnings per share excluding adjustments (non-GAAP) were $59 million and $0.53, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to Net income available to TDS common shareholders and related diluted earnings per share of $43 million and $0.39, respectively, for the year ended 2016.\n\"In 2017, the TDS family of companies continued to act on our long-term strategic goals,\" said LeRoy T. Carlson, Jr., TDS President and CEO. \"U.S. Cellular successfully balanced customer growth with profitability, while TDS Telecom implemented its broadband strategy of driving broadband revenue and margin growth in its wireline and cable segments.\n\"U.S. Cellular protected and grew its customer base through an award winning network and the successful marketing and sales of Total Plans, which include no hidden fees and an unlimited data option. With record low churn, the company achieved postpaid handset growth for the year. We continued to invest in U.S. Cellular's high-quality network by increasing capacity and launching VoLTE, which is now fully operational in Iowa and Wisconsin. Tower rental revenues, accessories sales and device protection plan sales, along with effective cost management all worked to partially offset competitive pricing pressures.\n\"TDS Telecom continued to grow broadband services, bundling these with video and voice services. Several years of fiber investments led to growth in IPTV connections and to increased demand for higher broadband speeds, generating residential wireline revenue growth. Network investments in our cable properties also continue to see success, driving strong increases in broadband connections and cable revenues. This quarter we accomplished our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit broadband cable connections growth. We also signed several small cable acquisitions to strengthen our existing markets, and are continuing to seek attractive cable properties.\n\"At OneNeck IT Solutions, lower spending by existing customers impacted equipment revenues, and associated hardware maintenance and service revenues. OneNeck remains focused on growing recurring revenues from high-margin services through a full portfolio of offerings. In 2017, our Colocation and Relia Cloud revenues grew nicely.\"\n2018 Estimated Results\nCurrent estimates of full-year 2018 results for U.S. Cellular, TDS Telecom, and TDS are shown below. Such estimates represent management's view as of February 23, 2018. Such forward-looking statements should not be assumed to be current as of any future date. TDS undertakes no duty to update such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. There can be no assurance that final results will not differ materially from such estimated results.\n2018 Estimated Results and Actual Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nU.S. Cellular\nWireline and Cable (1)\nTDS (1)(2)\nEstimate\nActual\nEstimate\nActual\nEstimate\nActual\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal operating revenues\n$3,850-$4,050\n$\n3,890\n$900-$950\n$\n919\n$5,015-$5,265\n$\n5,044\nAdjusted OIBDA (3)(4)\n$625-$775\n$\n675\n$290-$320\n$\n317\n$925-$1,105\n$\n999\nAdjusted EBITDA (3)\n$765-$915\n$\n820\n$300-$330\n$\n323\n$1,075-$1,255\n$\n1,152\nCapital expenditures\n$500-$550\n$\n469\n$270\n$\n201\n$795-$845\n$\n694\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of Net income to Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 estimated results and actual results for the year ended December 31, 2017. In providing 2018 estimated results, TDS has not completed the below reconciliation to Net income because it does not provide guidance for income taxes. Although potentially significant, TDS believes that the impact of income taxes cannot be reasonably predicted; therefore, TDS is unable to provide such guidance.\nU.S. Cellular\nWireline and Cable (1)\nTDS (1)(2)\nEstimate\nActual\nEstimate\nActual\nEstimate\nActual\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet income (GAAP)\nN/A\n15\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n157\nAdd back:\nIncome tax benefit\nN/A\n(287)\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n(279)\nIncome (loss) before income\ntaxes (GAAP)\n$\n10-160\n$\n(272)\n$\n80-110\n$\n125\n$\n5-185\n$\n(122)\nAdd back:\nInterest expense\n110\n113\n–\n–\n170\n170\nDepreciation, amortization and\naccretion expense\n625\n615\n220\n195\n880\n844\nEBITDA (Non-GAAP) (3)\n$\n745-895\n$\n456\n$\n300-330\n$\n319\n$\n1,055-1,235\n$\n892\nAdd back:\nLoss on impairment of goodwill\n–\n370\n–\n–\n–\n262\n(Gain) loss on sale of business\nand other exit costs, net\n–\n(1)\n–\n–\n–\n(1)\n(Gain) loss on license sales and\nexchanges, net\n–\n(22)\n–\n–\n–\n(22)\n(Gain) loss on asset\ndisposals, net\n20\n17\n–\n3\n20\n21\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) (3)\n$\n765-915\n$\n820\n$\n300-330\n$\n323\n$\n1,075-1,255\n$\n1,152\nDeduct:\nEquity in earnings of\nunconsolidated entities\n130\n137\n–\n–\n130\n137\nInterest and dividend income\n10\n8\n5\n5\n15\n15\nOther, net\n–\n–\n5\n–\n5\n1\nAdjusted OIBDA (Non-GAAP) (3)(4)\n$\n625-775\n$\n675\n$\n290-320\n$\n317\n$\n925-1,105\n$\n999\nNote: Totals may not foot due to rounding differences.\n(1)\nEffective January 1, 2018, HMS will be considered a non-reportable segment and will no longer be reported under TDS Telecom. To be comparable with the 2018 estimated results, HMS actual results for the year ended 2017 have been included as part of TDS. A reconciliation of Cable and Wireline actual results to TDS Telecom as reported for full year 2017 can be found on TDS' website at investors.tdsinc.com .\n(2)\nThe TDS column includes U.S. Cellular, Cable and Wireline, HMS and also the impacts of consolidating eliminations, corporate operations and non-reportable segments, all of which are not presented above.\n(3)\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are defined as net income adjusted for the items set forth in the reconciliation above. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are not measures of financial performance under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP) and should not be considered as alternatives to Net income or Cash flows from operating activities, as indicators of cash flows or as measures of liquidity. TDS does not intend to imply that any such items set forth in the reconciliation above are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual; such items may occur in the future. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA as measurements of profitability, and therefore reconciliations to Net income are deemed appropriate. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are useful measures of TDS' operating results before significant recurring non-cash charges, gains and losses, and other items as presented above as they provide additional relevant and useful information to investors and other users of TDS' financial data in evaluating the effectiveness of its operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. Adjusted EBITDA shows adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, and gains and losses, while Adjusted OIBDA reduces this measure further to exclude Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and Interest and dividend income in order to more effectively show the performance of operating activities excluding investment activities. The table above reconciles EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA flow to the corresponding GAAP measure, Net income or Income (loss) before income taxes.\n(4)\nA reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA (Non-GAAP) to Operating income (GAAP) for full year 2017 actual results can be found on TDS' website at investors.tdsinc.com .\nConference Call Information\nTDS will hold a conference call on February 23, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. Central Time.\nAccess the live call on the Events & Presentations page of investors.tdsinc.com or at https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1145/24672 .

Prior to 2009, TDS accounted for U.S. Cellular's share repurchases as step acquisitions, allocating a portion of the share repurchase value to TDS' Goodwill. Further, goodwill was impaired at the TDS level in 2003 but not at the U.S. Cellular level, effectively resulting in a lower basis of goodwill attributable to the U.S. Cellular reporting unit rather than at U.S. Cellular itself. Consequently, U.S. Cellular's Goodwill on a stand-alone basis and any resulting impairment of Goodwill does not equal the TDS consolidated Goodwill related to U.S. Cellular.\nTelephone and Data Systems, Inc.\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n(Unaudited)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in millions)\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet income\n$\n157\n$\n52\nAdd (deduct) adjustments to reconcile net income to net\ncash flows from operating activities\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion\n844\n850\nBad debts expense\n95\n102\nStock-based compensation expense\n46\n42\nDeferred income taxes, net\n(369)\n22\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated entities\n(137)\n(140)\nDistributions from unconsolidated entities\n136\n93\nLoss on impairment of goodwill\n262\n–\n(Gain) loss on asset disposals, net\n21\n27\n(Gain) loss on sale of business and other exit costs, net\n(1)\n(1)\n(Gain) loss on license sales and exchanges, net\n(22)\n(20)\nNoncash interest\n3\n3\nOther operating activities\n–\n(3)\nChanges in assets and liabilities from operations\nAccounts receivable\n(61)\n(23)\nEquipment installment plans receivable\n(261)\n(246)\nInventory\n6\n4\nAccounts payable\n(7)\n36\nCustomer deposits and deferred revenues\n(4)\n(52)\nAccrued taxes\n37\n60\nAccrued interest\n–\n(1)\nOther assets and liabilities\n31\n(23)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n776\n782\nCash flows from investing activities\nCash paid for additions to property, plant and equipment\n(685)\n(636)\nCash paid for acquisitions and licenses\n(218)\n(53)\nCash paid for investments\n(100)\n–\nCash received from divestitures and exchanges\n21\n21\nFederal Communications Commission deposit\n–\n(143)\nOther investing activities\n1\n3\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(981)\n(808)\nCash flows from financing activities\nIssuance of long-term debt\n–\n2\nRepayment of long-term debt\n(17)\n(12)\nTDS Common Shares reissued for benefit plans, net of tax payments\n4\n9\nU.S. Cellular Common Shares reissued for benefit plans, net of tax payments\n1\n6\nRepurchase of TDS Common Shares\n–\n(3)\nRepurchase of U.S. Cellular Common Shares\n–\n(5)\nRepurchase of TDS Preferred Shares\n(1)\n–\nDividends paid to TDS shareholders\n(69)\n(65)\nPayment of debt issuance costs\n(2)\n(4)\nDistributions to noncontrolling interests\n(4)\n(1)\nOther financing activities\n11\n14\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(77)\n(59)\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(282)\n(85)\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (1)\nBeginning of period\n904\n989\nEnd of period\n$\n622\n$\n904\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2017, TDS early adopted ASU 2016-18 on a retrospective basis which requires that restricted cash be presented with Cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Cash Flows.

The goodwill impairment charge, which occurred in the third quarter of 2017, and the deferred tax benefit are being excluded in this presentation, as they cause current operations of TDS not to be comparable with prior periods. TDS believes these measures may be useful to investors and other users of its financial information when comparing the current period financial results with periods that were not impacted by such items.\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nYear ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income (loss) available to TDS common shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n287\n$\n(5)\n$\n153\n$\n43\nAdjustments:\nLoss on impairment of goodwill\n–\n–\n262\n–\nTax benefit on impairment of goodwill (1)\n–\n–\n(22)\n–\nNoncontrolling interests impact (2)\n–\n–\n(52)\n–\nSubtotal of Non-GAAP goodwill adjustments\n–\n–\n188\n–\nEffect of the Tax Act\n(327)\n–\n(327)\n–\nNoncontrolling interests impact (2)\n45\n–\n45\n–\nSubtotal of Non-GAAP tax reform adjustments\n(282)\n–\n(282)\n–\nSubtotal of Non-GAAP adjustments\n(282)\n–\n(94)\n–\nNet income (loss) available to TDS common shareholders excluding adjustments (Non-GAAP)\n$\n6\n$\n(5)\n$\n59\n$\n43\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share available to TDS common shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n2.54\n$\n(0.05)\n$\n1.37\n$\n0.39\nAdjustments:\nLoss on impairment of goodwill\n–\n–\n2.34\n–\nTax benefit on impairment of goodwill (1)\n–\n–\n(0.20)\n–\nNoncontrolling interests impact on goodwill impairment (2)\n–\n–\n(0.46)\n–\nEffect of the Tax Act\n(2.91)\n–\n(2.92)\n–\nNoncontrolling interests impact on tax reform (2)\n0.42\n–\n0.40\n–\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share available to TDS common shareholders excluding adjustments (Non-GAAP)\n$\n0.05\n$\n(0.05)\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.39\nNote: Totals may not foot due to rounding differences.\n(1)\nTax benefit represents the amount associated with the tax-amortizable portion of the loss on goodwill impairment.\n(2)\nNoncontrolling interests, net of tax, includes noncontrolling public shareholders' share in U.S. Cellular for similar adjustments recorded on U.S. Cellular's consolidated financial statements.\nPostpaid ABPU and Postpaid ABPA\nU.S. Cellular presents Postpaid ABPU and Postpaid ABPA to reflect the revenue shift from Service revenues to Equipment and product sales resulting from the increased adoption of equipment installment plans. Postpaid ABPU and Postpaid ABPA, as previously defined herein, are non-GAAP financial measures which U.S. Cellular believes are useful to investors and other users of its financial information in showing trends in both service and equipment and product sales revenues received from customers.\nFor the Quarter Ended\n12/31/2017\n9/30/2017\n6/30/2017\n3/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n(Dollars and connection counts in millions)\nCalculation of Postpaid ARPU\nPostpaid service revenues\n$\n598\n$\n586\n$\n597\n$\n608\n$\n607\nAverage number of postpaid connections\n4.52\n4.50\n4.47\n4.46\n4.48\nNumber of months in period\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nPostpaid ARPU (GAAP metric)\n$\n44.12\n$\n43.41\n$\n44.60\n$\n45.42\n$\n45.19\nCalculation of Postpaid ABPU\nPostpaid service revenues\n$\n598\n$\n586\n$\n597\n$\n608\n$\n607\nEquipment installment plan billings\n170\n152\n142\n139\n138\nTotal billings to postpaid connections\n$\n768\n$\n738\n$\n739\n$\n747\n$\n745\nAverage number of postpaid connections\n4.52\n4.50\n4.47\n4.46\n4.48\nNumber of months in period\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nPostpaid ABPU (Non-GAAP metric)\n$\n56.69\n$\n54.71\n$\n55.19\n$\n55.82\n$\n55.43\nCalculation of Postpaid ARPA\nPostpaid service revenues\n$\n598\n$\n586\n$\n597\n$\n608\n$\n607\nAverage number of postpaid accounts\n1.69\n1.68\n1.66\n1.66\n1.68\nNumber of months in period\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nPostpaid ARPA (GAAP metric)\n$\n118.05\n$\n116.36\n$\n119.73\n$\n121.88\n$\n120.67\nCalculation of Postpaid ABPA\nPostpaid service revenues\n$\n598\n$\n586\n$\n597\n$\n608\n$\n607\nEquipment installment plan billings\n170\n152\n142\n139\n138\nTotal billings to postpaid accounts\n$\n768\n$\n738\n$\n739\n$\n747\n$\n745\nAverage number of postpaid accounts\n1.69\n1.68\n1.66\n1.66\n1.68\nNumber of months in period\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nPostpaid ABPA (Non-GAAP metric)\n$\n151.68\n$\n146.65\n$\n148.15\n$\n149.78\n$\n148.02\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tds-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300603347.html\nSOURCE Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.",
