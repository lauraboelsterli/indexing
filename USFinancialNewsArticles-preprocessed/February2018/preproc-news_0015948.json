    "text": "Operating Results Meet Guidance Despite $11 Million Theft Loss in December\nU.S. Turnaround on Track as Full-Year Profits More Than Triple Versus 2016\n2019 Adjusted EBITDA Target Raised to $625 Million\nRICHMOND, Va., Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Brink’s Company (NYSE:BCO), the global leader in cash management, secure logistics and security solutions, today announced fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2017. Highlights include:\nGAAP\nFourth-quarter revenue up 12%, operating profit up 28%, margin 9.8% vs 8.6%, EPS ($1.02) vs $.28 Full-year revenue up 11%, operating profit up 48%, margin 8.2% vs 6.1%, EPS $.33 vs $.72 Results include $92 million non-cash charge related to tax reform legislation (see below)\nNon-GAAP\nFourth-quarter revenue up 13%, operating profit up 15%, margin 10.5% vs 10.3%, EPS $.95 vs $.88 Full-year revenue up 10%, operating profit up 30%, margin 8.8% vs 7.4%, EPS $3.03 vs $2.28 Results include theft-related loss of $11 million or $.14 per share\nDoug Pertz, president and chief executive officer, said: “The strong improvement in fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings was driven by profit growth of 43% in South America and 27% in North America. Despite a previously disclosed theft charge of $11 million, total non-GAAP operating profit rose 15% to $91 million in the fourth quarter and 30% to $281 million for the year, reflecting a full-year margin rate increase of 140 basis points to 8.8%. We were particularly pleased with the improved results in the U.S., where fourth-quarter profits rose 43% and full-year profits more than tripled versus 2016.\n“Our plans to drive organic profit growth through our global ‘breakthrough initiatives’ continue to gain traction, and we are building a new layer of profitable growth through core acquisitions, six of which were completed in 2017, with a seventh expected to close in the second quarter of this year. Our acquisition pipeline is strong and we are well-positioned, both strategically and financially, to continue making acquisitions that offer compelling synergies with our existing business.”\nThe company’s 2018 non-GAAP guidance includes revenue growth of 8% to approximately $3.45 billion, operating profit growth of at least 30% to a range between $365 million and $385 million, earnings growth of more than 20% to a range between $3.65 and $3.85 per share, and adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately $100 million to a range between $515 million and $535 million. Brink’s also increased its target for 2019 adjusted EBITDA to $625 million, up from its prior target of $560 million.\nThe company’s 2018 guidance and 2019 adjusted EBITDA target assume annual organic revenue growth of approximately 5%, supplemented by contributions from the six acquisitions closed in 2017 and the previously announced acquisition of Rodoban in Brazil, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. Upon completion of the Rodoban acquisition, total expenditures on acquisitions since March 2017 will be approximately $510 million. These acquisitions are expected to generate adjusted EBITDA of $60 million to $70 million in 2018 and approximately $90 million in 2019, reflecting an average post-synergy purchase multiple of less than six.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform Act”) reduced the federal tax rate for corporations, beginning January 1, 2018, from 35% to 21%. As a result, Brink’s remeasured its deferred tax asset (“DTA”) considering the new rate and other changes in the law and recorded a non-cash charge to fourth-quarter and full-year GAAP earnings of $92 million or $1.78 per share. This charge will continue to be adjusted during the year ending December 31, 2018.\nBrink’s expects the new law to have an unfavorable impact related to the broadening of the company’s U.S. tax base that will more than offset the favorable impact of the new 21% rate. The company’s near-term effective non-GAAP tax rate is expected to increase to approximately 37% versus the 2017 rate of 34.2%. Due to the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax, Brink’s expects to receive cash tax refunds totaling approximately $32 million between 2019 and 2022. Importantly, due to the availability of credits, elections and deductions, Brink’s does not expect to pay any U.S. cash taxes for at least five years.\nConference Call\nBrink’s will host a conference call on February 7 at 8:30 a.m. ET to review fourth-quarter results. Interested parties can listen by calling 888-349-0094 (in the U.S.) or 412-902-0124 (international).

The 2018 Non-GAAP outlook amounts for operating profit and nonoperating expense exclude the impact of other items not allocated to segments and certain retirement plan costs. The 2018 Non-GAAP outlook amounts for provision for income taxes, income (loss) from continuing operations, EPS from continuing operations, effective income tax rate and Adjusted EBITDA cannot be reconciled to GAAP without unreasonable effort. We cannot reconcile these amounts to GAAP because we are unable to accurately forecast the tax impact of Venezuela operations and the related exchange rates used to measure those operations.\n(b) 2018 GAAP outlook does not include any forecasted amounts from Venezuela operations. The 2018 GAAP outlook excludes future restructuring actions for which the timing and amount are currently under review.\n(c) Non-GAAP amounts include the impact of prior year comparable period results for acquired and disposed businesses.

A summary of the other items not allocated to segment results is below.\nVenezuela operations We have excluded from our segment results all of our Venezuela operating results, due to the Venezuelan government's restrictions that have prevented us from repatriating funds. As a result, the Chief Executive Officer, the Company's Chief Operating Decision maker (\"CODM\"), assesses segment performance and makes resource decisions by segment excluding Venezuela operating results.\nReorganization and Restructuring\n2016 Restructuring\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions. As a result of these actions, we recognized $18.1 million in related 2016 costs and we recognized an additional $17.3 million in 2017 related to this restructuring. We expect to incur additional costs between $10 and $12 million in future periods, primarily severance costs.\nExecutive Leadership and Board of Directors\nIn 2015, we recognized $1.8 million in charges related to Executive Leadership and Board of Directors restructuring actions, which were announced in January 2016. We recognized $4.3 million in charges in 2016 related to the Executive Leadership and Board of Directors restructuring actions.\n2015 Restructuring\nBrink's initiated a restructuring of its business in the third quarter of 2015. We recognized $11.6 million in related 2015 costs and an additional $6.5 million in 2016 related to this restructuring. The actions under this program were substantially completed by the end of 2016, with cumulative pretax charges of approximately $18 million.\nOther Restructurings\nManagement continuously implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business. As a result of these actions, we recognized related severance costs of $4.6 million in 2017. The majority of these restructuring actions were completed in 2017. For the remaining restructuring actions, we expect to incur additional costs less than $1 million in future periods. These estimates will be updated as management targets additional sections of our business.\nDue to the unique circumstances around these charges, they have not been allocated to segment results and are excluded from non-GAAP results.\nAcquisitions and dispositions Certain acquisition and disposition items that are not considered part of the ongoing activities of the business and are special in nature are consistently excluded from non-GAAP results. These items are described below:\n2017 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nAmortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets was $8.4 million in 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 gain of $7.8 million related to the sale of real estate in Mexico. Severance costs of $4.0 million related to our recent acquisitions in Argentina and Brazil. Transaction costs of $2.6 million related to acquisitions of new businesses in 2017. Currency transaction gains of $1.8 million related to acquisition activity.\n2016 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nDue to management's decision in the first quarter of 2016 to exit the Republic of Ireland, the prospective impacts of shutting down this operation were included in items not allocated to segments and were excluded from the operating segments effective March 1, 2016. This activity is also excluded from the consolidated non-GAAP results. Beginning May 1, 2016, due to management's decision to also exit Northern Ireland, the results of shutting down these operations were treated similarly to the Republic of Ireland. Amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets was $3.6 million in 2016. Brink's recognized a $2.0 million loss related to the sale of corporate assets in the second quarter of 2016.\nThe Brink’s Company and subsidiaries\nNon-GAAP Results Reconciled to GAAP (Unaudited)\n(In millions, except for percentages and per share amounts)\nNon-GAAP results described in this press release are financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The purpose of the Non-GAAP results is to report financial information from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain income and expenses that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. The specific items excluded have not been allocated to segments, are described in detail on pages 8-9 and in more detail in our Form 10-K, and are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures below.\nNon-GAAP results adjust the quarterly Non-GAAP tax rates so that the Non-GAAP tax rate in each of the quarters is equal to the full-year estimated Non-GAAP tax rate. The full-year Non-GAAP tax rate in both years excludes certain pretax and income tax amounts. Amounts reported for prior periods have been updated in this report to present information consistently for all periods presented.\nThe 2018 Non-GAAP outlook amounts for provision for income taxes, income (loss) from continuing operations, EPS from continuing operations, effective income tax rate and Adjusted EBITDA cannot be reconciled to GAAP without unreasonable effort. We cannot reconcile these amounts to GAAP because we are unable to accurately forecast the tax impact of Venezuela operations and the related exchange rates used to measure those operations. The impact of Venezuela operations and related exchange rates during 2018 could be significant to our full-year GAAP provision for income taxes, and, therefore, to income (loss) from continuing operations, EPS from continuing operations, effective income tax rate and Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. Additionally, non-GAAP results are utilized as performance measures in certain management incentive compensation plans.\nNon-GAAP Results Reconciled to GAAP\n2016 2017 Pre-tax Tax Effective tax\nrate Pre-tax Tax Effective tax\nrate Effective Income Tax Rate GAAP $ 125.0 78.5 62.8 % $ 181.5 157.7 86.9 % Retirement plans (d) 31.5 11.3 34.9 12.6 Venezuela operations (a) (15.9 ) (14.1 ) (13.5 ) (12.7 ) Reorganization and Restructuring (a) 30.3 7.4 22.6 7.6 Acquisitions and dispositions (a) 20.0 1.8 12.7 4.5 Prepayment penalties (e) — — 8.3 0.2 Deferred tax valuation allowance (c) — (14.7 ) — — Interest on Brazil tax claim (f) — — 1.6 0.5 Tax reform (g) — — — (86.0 ) Tax on accelerated income (h) — — — 0.4 Non-GAAP $ 190.9 70.2 36.8 % $ 248.1 84.8 34.2 % Amounts may not add due to rounding.\n(a) See “Other Items Not Allocated To Segments” on pages 8-9 for details. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance.\n(b) Non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP EPS have been adjusted to reflect an effective income tax rate in each interim period equal to the full-year non-GAAP effective income tax rate. The full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.2% for 2017 and 36.8% for 2016.\n(c) There was a change in judgment resulting in a valuation allowance against certain tax attributes with a limited statutory carryforward period that are no longer more-likely-than-not to be realized due to lower than expected U.S. operating results, certain non-GAAP pre-tax items, and other timing of tax deductions related to executive leadership transition.\n(d) Our U.S. retirement plans are frozen and costs related to these plans are excluded from non-GAAP results. Certain non-U.S. operations also have retirement plans. Settlement charges related to these non-U.S. plans are also excluded from non-GAAP results.\n(e) Penalties upon prepayment of Private Placement notes in September 2017 and a term loan in October 2017.\n(f) Related to an unfavorable court ruling in the third quarter of 2017 on a non-income tax claim in Brazil. The court ruled that Brink's must pay interest accruing from the initial claim filing in 1994 to the current date. The principal amount of the claim was approximately $1 million and was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2017.\n(g) Represents the estimated impact of tax legislation enacted into law in the fourth quarter of 2017. This primarily relates to the U.S. Tax Reform expense from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets.\n(h) The non-GAAP tax rate excludes the 2017 foreign tax benefit that resulted from the transaction that accelerated U.S. tax in 2015.\n(i) There is no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP share-based compensation amounts for the periods presented.\n(j) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as non-GAAP income from continuing operations excluding the impact of non-GAAP interest expense, non-GAAP income tax provision, non-GAAP depreciation and amortization and non-GAAP share-based compensation. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations is reconciled to net income on page 12.\n(k) Because we reported a loss from continuing operations on a GAAP basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP EPS was calculated using basic shares. However, as we reported income from continuing operations on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, non-GAAP EPS was calculated using diluted shares.\nThe Brink’s Company and subsidiaries\nNon-GAAP Results Reconciled to GAAP (Unaudited)\n(In millions, except for percentages and per share amounts)\n2016 2017 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Full\nYear 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Full\nYear Revenues: GAAP $ 721.8 739.5 755.8 803.5 3,020.6 $ 788.4 805.9 849.5 903.2 3,347.0 Venezuela operations (a) (32.1 ) (21.5 ) (20.4 ) (35.4 ) (109.4 ) (48.1 ) (46.3 ) (20.8 ) (38.9 ) (154.1 ) Acquisitions and dispositions (a) (0.8 ) (1.5 ) (0.5 ) — (2.8 ) — — — — — Non-GAAP $ 688.9 716.5 734.9 768.1 2,908.4 $ 740.3 759.6 828.7 864.3 3,192.9 Operating profit (loss): GAAP $ 23.5 32.2 59.7 69.1 184.5 $ 70.9 48.3 66.4 88.3 273.9 Venezuela operations (a) (2.7 ) (1.6 ) (2.2 ) (12.0 ) (18.5 ) (21.1 ) 4.5 (2.5 ) (1.3 ) (20.4 ) Reorganization and Restructuring (a) 6.0 2.1 2.3 19.9 30.3 4.1 5.6 6.4 6.5 22.6 Acquisitions and dispositions (a) 6.8 7.4 3.2 2.1 19.5 (0.4 ) 2.4 6.1 (2.8 ) 5.3 Non-GAAP $ 33.6 40.1 63.0 79.1 215.8 $ 53.5 60.8 76.4 90.7 281.4 Interest expense: GAAP $ (4.9 ) (4.9 ) (5.1 ) (5.5 ) (20.4 ) $ (4.8 ) (6.0 ) (7.7 ) (13.7 ) (32.2 ) Venezuela operations (a) 0.1 — — — 0.1 — — — 0.1 0.1 Acquisitions and dispositions (a) — — — — — — — 0.8 0.3 1.1 Non-GAAP $ (4.8 ) (4.9 ) (5.1 ) (5.5 ) (20.3 ) $ (4.8 ) (6.0 ) (6.9 ) (13.3 ) (31.0 ) Interest and other income (expense): GAAP $ (9.7 ) (9.4 ) (9.2 ) (10.8 ) (39.1 ) $ (11.2 ) (11.4 ) (21.2 ) (16.4 ) (60.2 ) Retirement plans (d) 7.3 8.1 7.9 8.2 31.5 7.3 8.6 9.0 10.0 34.9 Venezuela operations (a) 0.7 0.7 0.5 0.6 2.5 2.9 2.2 0.9 0.8 6.8 Acquisitions and dispositions (a) — — (0.1 ) 0.6 0.5 — — — 6.3 6.3 Prepayment penalties (e) — — — — — — — 6.5 1.8 8.3 Interest on Brazil tax claim (f) — — — — — — — 4.1 (2.5 ) 1.6 Non-GAAP $ (1.7 ) (0.6 ) (0.9 ) (1.4 ) (4.6 ) $ (1.0 ) (0.6 ) (0.7 ) — (2.3 ) Taxes: GAAP $ 9.4 14.5 19.5 35.1 78.5 $ 14.4 17.3 16.4 109.6 157.7 Retirement plans (d) 2.6 2.9 2.9 2.9 11.3 2.7 3.1 3.2 3.6 12.6 Venezuela operations (a) (2.5 ) (4.7 ) (2.4 ) (4.5 ) (14.1 ) (4.9 ) (3.8 ) (3.1 ) (0.9 ) (12.7 ) Reorganization and Restructuring (a) 1.9 0.6 0.7 4.2 7.4 1.4 1.9 2.2 2.1 7.6 Acquisitions and dispositions (a) 0.3 0.9 0.2 0.4 1.8 0.2 0.3 2.5 1.5 4.5 Prepayment penalties (e) — — — — — — — 2.4 (2.2 ) 0.2 Deferred tax valuation allowance (c) — — — (14.7 ) (14.7 ) — — — — — Interest on Brazil tax claim (f) — — — — — — — 1.4 (0.9 ) 0.5 Tax reform (g) — — — — — — — — (86.0 ) (86.0 ) Tax on accelerated income (h) — — — — — — — — 0.4 0.4 Income tax rate adjustment (b) (1.7 ) (1.5 ) 0.1 3.1 — 2.5 (0.3 ) (1.5 ) (0.7 ) — Non-GAAP $ 10.0 12.7 21.0 26.5 70.2 $ 16.3 18.5 23.5 26.5 84.8 Non-GAAP margin 4.9 % 5.6 % 8.6 % 10.3 % 7.4 % 7.2 % 8.0 % 9.2 % 10.5 % 8.8 % Amounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee page 10 for footnote explanations.\n2016 2017 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Full\nYear 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Full\nYear Noncontrolling interests: GAAP $ 2.6 3.1 1.4 3.2 10.3 $ 5.8 (0.7 ) 1.2 0.6 6.9 Venezuela operations (a) (1.1 ) (1.2 ) 0.3 (2.4 ) (4.4 ) (4.9 ) 2.2 0.6 0.5 (1.6 ) Reorganization and Restructuring (a) — — (0.1 ) (0.7 ) (0.8 ) 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.8 Income tax rate adjustment (b) (0.4 ) (0.3 ) 0.1 0.6 — 0.2 — (0.2 ) — — Non-GAAP $ 1.1 1.6 1.7 0.7 5.1 $ 1.4 1.6 1.8 1.3 6.1 Reconciliation to net income (loss): Net income (loss) attributable to Brink's $ (3.1 ) 0.3 24.5 12.8 34.5 $ 34.7 14.2 19.9 (52.1 ) 16.7 Discontinued operations — — — 1.7 1.7 — 0.1 — 0.1 0.2 Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Brink's -
