    "text": "Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with state and local officials to unveil his administration's long-awaited infrastructure plan in the State Dining Room at the White House February 12, 2018 in Washington, DC. President Trump will attend this year's Gridiron Dinner, the exclusive white-tie event hosted by a group he loves to criticize: the media.\nThe annual dinner, put on by the Gridiron Club and Foundation, will give some of the biggest names in the Washington political journalism world the opportunity to dish it back at him, as part of the tradition is to roast politicians.\nAnd in turn, Trump will be able to crack some jokes of his own.\nSince the dinner began in 1885, nearly every president has spoken at the event at some point during their administration. (The only exception: President Grover Cleveland.) President Obama spoke at the dinner three times: 2011, 2013 and 2015.\nLast year, Trump skipped the event and instead headed down to Mar-a-Lago. Vice President Pence attended the Gridiron, as did then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway. Pence made jokes at his own expense and called for journalists to \"do better.\"\nTrump also skipped last year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner, opting instead to host a rally in Pennsylvania.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said there has been no decision about whether he'll attend the correspondents' dinner this year.",
