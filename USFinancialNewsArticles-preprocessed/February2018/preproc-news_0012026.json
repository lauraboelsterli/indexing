    "text": "OTTAWA, Ill., Feb. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ottawa Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq:OTTW), the holding company for Ottawa Savings Bank, FSB (the “Bank”), announced a net loss of $0.5 million, or $0.14 per basic and diluted common share for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $0.2 million, or $0.06 per basic and diluted common share for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $0.8 million, or $0.25 per basic and diluted common share, compared to net income of $1.3 million, or $0.43 per basic common share and $0.42 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016. The fourth quarter and annual 2017 results were negatively impacted by a reduction in value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets which resulted in a charge of approximately $0.8 million, or $0.25 per basic and diluted common share, to income tax expense. This income tax adjustment resulted from the December 22, 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), which lowered the corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 21 percent. Prior to the enactment of TCJA, the Company’s net deferred tax assets were valued based upon the projection of a 34 percent future tax benefit.\nDuring the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, the Company experienced increased loan demand and a continued decrease in non-performing loans. Non-performing loans decreased from $5.0 million at December 31, 2016 to $2.0 million at September 30, 2017 and $1.6 million at December 31, 2017, which in addition to loan growth, improved the ratio of non-performing loans to gross loans from 3.00% at December 31, 2016 to 1.00% at September 30, 2017 and 0.73% at December 31, 2017.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $0.5 million compared to net income of $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in income of $0.7 million or 323.3%, was primarily attributed to an increase in income tax expense of $0.9 million, of which approximately $0.8 million resulted from the re-valuation of net deferred tax assets, and an increase in total other expenses of $0.1 million. The increases in expenses were partially off-set by increases in net interest income after provision for loan losses of $0.4 million and an approximately $35,000 increase in total other income.\nNet interest income increased by $0.3 million, or 17.3%, to $2.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $1.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Interest and dividend income increased $0.4 million, or 20.9%, primarily due to an increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets of $18.4 million. The increase in net interest income was partially off-set by an increase in interest expense as the average cost of funds increased 19 basis points to 0.72% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The net interest margin increased 8.2% during the three months ended December 31, 2017 to 3.82% from 3.53%.\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses of approximately $0.1 million for both of the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The allowance for loan losses was $2.5 million, or 1.15% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017 compared to $2.2 million, or 1.35% of gross loans at December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs during the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.1 million compared to $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. General reserves were higher at December 31, 2017, when compared to December 31, 2016, as the balances in all loan categories increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. These increases to the allowance were partially off-set by improvements in historical loss levels and changes in qualitative factors during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. Additionally, specific reserves as of December 31, 2017 were lower than they were as of December 31, 2016, due to several credits being resolved during 2017 that had reserves as of December 31, 2016.\nTotal other income was approximately $0.5 million for both of the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTotal other expense increased $0.1 million, or 7.1%, to $2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to losses on the sale of securities during the fourth quarter of 2017, higher legal and professional expenses, higher data processing expense, higher deposit insurance premium, and increased loan expense. The increases were partially off-set by lower other expenses during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWe recorded income tax expense of $1.0 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $0.9 million increase in income tax expense includes approximately $0.8 million from the re-valuation of net deferred tax assets and approximately $0.1 million resulting from the increase in net income before taxes of approximately $0.2 million.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $0.5 million, or 35.5%, to $0.8 million compared to net income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributed to an increase in income tax expense of $0.9 million, of which approximately $0.8 million resulted from the re-valuation of net deferred tax assets, and an increase in total other expenses of $0.9 million. The increases in expenses were partially off-set by increases in net interest income after provision for loan losses of $0.9 million and a $0.5 million increase in total other income.\nNet interest income increased by $1.0 million, or 13.5%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest and dividend income increased $1.2 million, or 14.4%, primarily due to an increase in the average balances of interest-earning assets of $16.4 million. The increase in net interest income was partially off-set by an increase in interest expense as the average cost of funds increased 11 basis points to 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net interest margin increased 5.2% during the year ended December 31, 2017 to 3.84% from 3.65%.\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses of $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in provision expense was primarily due to increases in the loan portfolio, and therefore the need to increase the provision for loan losses. Additionally, net charge-offs were approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses was $2.5 million, or 1.15% of total gross loans at December 31, 2017 compared to $2.2 million, or 1.35% of gross loans at December 31, 2016. General reserves were higher at December 31, 2017, when compared to December 31, 2016, as the balances in all loan categories increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. These increases to the allowance were partially off-set by improvements in historical loss levels and changes in qualitative factors during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. Additionally, specific reserves as of December 31, 2017 were lower than they were as of December 31, 2016, due to several credits being resolved during 2017 that had reserves as of December 31, 2016.\nTotal other income increased $0.5 million, to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period for 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues related to mortgage banking activity, as gain on sale of loans, loan origination and servicing income increased.\nTotal other expense increased $0.9 million, or 12.7%, to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits as additional mortgage loan originators and staff were added to support loan growth. Loan expense increased due to the increase in loan originations.\nWe recorded income tax expense of $1.5 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The $0.9 million increase in income tax expense includes approximately $0.8 million from the re-valuation of net deferred tax assets and approximately $0.1 million resulting from the increase in net income before taxes of approximately $0.5 million.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nTotal consolidated assets as of December 31, 2017 were $255.5 million, an increase of $25.3 million, or 11.0%, from $230.2 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $46.4 million in the net loan portfolio, off-set by decreases in securities available for sale of $18.5 million and decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 million.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $2.1 million, or 35.2%, to $3.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $5.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily a result of cash used in investing activities of $28.6 million exceeding cash provided by financing activities of $23.4 million and cash provided by operating activities of $3.1 million.\nSecurities available for sale decreased $18.5 million, or 41.6%, to $26.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $44.6 million at December 31, 2016, as paydowns, sales, calls, and maturities exceeded new securities purchases. Cash proceeds from the sale of securities were used to fund the loan growth, as the yield earned on the loan originations was higher than those earned in the security portfolio.\nNet loans increased by $46.4 million to $207.0 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $160.6 million at December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of a $20.2 million increase in one-to-four family loans, a $8.5 million increase in non-residential real estate loans, and a $8.8 million increase in purchased auto loans. The Company also experienced growth in all other loan categories during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits increased $10.2 million, or 5.9%, to $182.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $172.5 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017 checking/money market accounts increased by $0.8 million, savings accounts increased by $2.0 million and certificates of deposit increased by $7.4 million as compared to December 31, 2016.\nFHLB advances increased $14.0 million, to $15.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2016 to fund the loan growth experienced during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal stockholders’ equity decreased approximately $35,000, but remained constant at $51.9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease reflects net income of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and an increase in other comprehensive income of $0.1 million related to an increase in the fair value of securities available for sale, partially off-set by dividends of $0.5 million paid to shareholders, $0.3 million to re-purchase and cancel outstanding shares and an approximately $0.2 million net decrease related to ESOP shares.\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders\nOn February 5, 2018, the Company also announced that its annual meeting of stockholders will be held on Wednesday, May 16, 2018.\nAbout Ottawa Bancorp, Inc.\nOttawa Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for Ottawa Savings Bank, FSB which provides various financial services to individual and corporate customers in the United States.
