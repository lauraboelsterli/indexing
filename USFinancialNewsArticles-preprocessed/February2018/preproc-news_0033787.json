These results included a $33.5 million charge related to recent tax reform legislation in the United States. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $131.2 million.

The Company's adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter 2017 was 14.0 percent compared to 11.9 percent in the fourth quarter 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 net income excluding restructuring and other special items (\"adjusted net income\") totaled $63.6 million, or $3.42 per diluted share, compared to $48.1 million, or $2.56 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2016.\nFor the full year 2017, the Company reported net income of $135.3 million, or $7.21 per diluted share on sales of $3.62 billion. These results included the $33.5 million charge in the fourth quarter related to recent tax reform legislation in the United States. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $452.0 million.

Commercialized innovation products include: MagAlloy™; ArmorHose™; ArmorHose™ TPV; Gen III Posi-Lock TM ; TP Microdense; and Fortrex™.\nFourth Quarter Operational Overview\nConsolidated\nFourth quarter 2017 sales increased by $62.5 million or 7.1 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase is largely attributable to favorable volume and mix, favorable foreign exchange and the net positive impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by customer price adjustments.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased by $27.4 million or 26.4 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year variance is primarily attributable to favorable volume and mix, lower compensation related expense, restructuring savings and net material cost savings. These favorable items were partially offset by customer price adjustments and inflation.\nNorth America\nCooper Standard's North America segment reported sales of $479.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 5.3 percent when compared to $455.3 million in sales recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to improved volume and mix, and the acquisition of AMI, partially offset by customer price adjustments.\nNorth America segment profit was $65.2 million, or 13.6 percent of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2017. This compared to segment profit of $49.9 million, or 11.0 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to lower compensation related expense, favorable volume and mix, improved supply chain performance and net material costs, the acquisition of AMI and foreign exchange. These favorable items were partially offset by customer price adjustments, investments in innovation, and inflation.\nEurope\nCooper Standard's Europe segment reported sales of $267.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $237.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was attributable to favorable volume and mix, and foreign exchange, partially offset by customer price adjustments.\nThe Europe segment reported a segment profit of $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a segment loss of $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year improvement was largely attributable to favorable volume and mix, and cost reductions related to restructuring, partially offset by customer price adjustments, commodity price pressure and inflation.\nAsia Pacific\nCooper Standard's Asia Pacific segment reported sales of $163.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 1.9 percent compared to $160.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Asia Pacific segment reported segment loss of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to segment profit of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter 2016. The year-over-year change was primarily attributable to fixed asset impairment charges, wage inflation and customer price adjustments, partially offset by improved supply chain performance and net material costs.\nSouth America\nCooper Standard's South America segment reported sales of $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $22.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to favorable volume and mix.\nThe South America segment incurred a segment loss of $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a loss of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year change is primarily attributable to expenses related to a tax amnesty program and foreign exchange, partially offset by improved operating efficiency and favorable volume and mix.\nLiquidity and Cash Flow\nAt December 31, 2017, Cooper Standard had cash and cash equivalents totaling $516.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter 2017 was $208.9 million compared to $181.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures) improved to $159.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $134.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $313.5 million compared to $363.7 million in 2016. Free cash flow for the full year 2017 was $126.7 million compared to $199.3 million in 2016.\nIn addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Company had $198.4 million available under its senior amended asset-based revolving credit facility (\"ABL facility\") for total liquidity of $714.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2017 was $758.2 million compared to $762.9 million at December 31, 2016. Net debt (defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) at December 31, 2017 was $242.3 million compared to $282.8 million at December 31, 2016. Cooper Standard's net leverage ratio (defined as net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA) at December 31, 2017 was 0.5 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.\nOutlook\nThe Company has issued 2018 full year guidance as follows:\nCurrent Guidance\nSales\n$3.55 - $3.60 billion\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 1\n12.7% - 13.3%\nCapital Expenditures as a percent of sales\n5.5% - 5.9%\nCash Restructuring\n$25 - $35 million\nEffective Tax Rate\n20% - 24%\n1\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure.

adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow are measures not recognized under U.S. GAAP and which exclude certain non-cash and special items that may obscure trends and operating performance not indicative of the Company's core financial activities. Management considers EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow to be key indicators of the Company's operating performance and believes that these and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the Company's performance. In addition, similar measures are utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants and ratios contained in the Company's financing arrangements and management uses these measures for developing internal budgets and forecasting purposes. EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted to reflect income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to reflect certain items that management does not consider to be reflective of the Company's core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA presented as percentage of sales. Adjusted net income is defined as net income adjusted to reflect certain items that management does not consider to be reflective of the Company's core operating performance. Adjusted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and is useful to both management and investors in evaluating the Company's ability to service and repay its debt.\nWhen analyzing the Company's operating performance, investors should use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow as supplements to, and not as alternatives for, net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and not as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company's results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. Other companies may report EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow differently and therefore the Company's results may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
