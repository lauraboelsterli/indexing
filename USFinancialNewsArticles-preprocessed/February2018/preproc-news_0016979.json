    "text": "DARIEN, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W) (NYSE:GWR)\nFourth Quarter Consolidated Highlights\nOperating revenues increased 10.7% to $571.6 million from $516.5 million. Reported operating income increased 101.9% to $108.2 million; Adjusted operating income increased 2.2% to $105.7 million. (1) Reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $6.81 with 62.7 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with reported diluted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $0.15 with 58.8 million weighted average shares outstanding; Adjusted diluted EPS decreased 8.3% to $0.77. (1) Reported net income and diluted EPS included a $371.9 million, or $5.94 per share, income tax benefit associated with the United States Tax Cuts & Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased 17.7% to $479.2 million; Adjusted free cash flow attributable to G&W increased 3.6% to $250.2 million. (1)\nFourth Quarter Segment Highlights\nNorth America: Operating revenues from G&W's North American Operations decreased 0.6% to $320.2 million from $322.2 million, primarily due to an $11.5 million decrease in freight-related revenues, partially offset by an increase of $9.3 million in freight revenues. Freight-related revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 included the recognition of $10.0 million of revenues from a multi-year take-or-pay volume shortfall under a crude-by-rail contract. Reported operating income from G&W's North American Operations decreased 10.5% to $74.6 million; Adjusted operating income from G&W's North American Operations decreased 13.6% to $75.5 million. (1) Australia: Operating revenues from G&W's Australian Operations increased 23.1% to $75.5 million from $61.4 million, primarily due to new operations. Reported operating income from G&W's Australian Operations increased from $2.8 million to $17.6 million. Adjusted operating income from G&W's Australian Operations increased 66.1% to $22.5 million. (1) U.K./Europe: Operating revenues from G&W's U.K./European Operations increased 32.3% to $175.8 million from $133.0 million, primarily due to new operations. Fourth quarter revenues also included a $10.5 million favorable impact from foreign currency appreciation. Reported operating income from G&W's U.K./European Operations was $16.0 million, compared with an operating loss of $32.6 million in 2016; Adjusted operating income from G&W's U.K./European Operations increased from $2.4 million to $7.6 million. (1)(2)\nComments on Fourth Quarter\nJack Hellmann, President and CEO of G&W, commented, “Our reported diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $6.81, of which a significant portion was a $372 million benefit from new tax legislation in the United States. Excluding the tax benefit and certain other items, our adjusted diluted EPS were $0.77 in the fourth quarter, as revenues in each of our geographic segments, North America, Australia and the U.K./Europe, finished the year in-line with our expectations. (1)\n“In 2017, we generated adjusted free cash flow attributable to G&W of $250 million, a 3.6% increase over 2016, as we effectively managed both expenses and capital expenditures to more than offset flat revenue. In 2018, with an improving business outlook in each of our operating regions, we expect double digit growth in both adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow attributable to G&W. At the same time, we continue to evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities across G&W’s global footprint and have approximately $400 million of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.” (1)\nFinancial Results\nG&W's operating revenues increased $55.0 million, or 10.7%, to $571.6 million, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $516.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. G&W's operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $108.2 million, compared with $53.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. G&W's adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $105.7 million, compared with $103.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. (1)\nReported net income attributable to G&W in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $426.6 million, compared with $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the net impact of certain items affecting comparability between periods as discussed below, adjusted net income attributable to G&W in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $48.6 million, compared with $49.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. (1)\nReported diluted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $6.81 with 62.7 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with reported diluted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $0.15 with 58.8 million weighted average shares outstanding. Excluding the net impact of certain items affecting comparability discussed below, adjusted diluted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.77 with 62.7 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with adjusted diluted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $0.84 with 58.8 million weighted average shares outstanding. (1)\nImpact of Glencore Rail (NSW) Pty Limited (GRail) Acquisition on G&W Financial Presentation\nIn conjunction with the December 1, 2016 acquisition of GRail, G&W issued a 48.9% equity stake in G&W’s Australian subsidiary, G&W Australia Holdings LP (GWA), the holding company for all of G&W's Australian businesses, to Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA). G&W retained a 51.1% interest in GWA and continues to consolidate 100% of GWA in its financial statements and reports a noncontrolling interest for MIRA’s 48.9% equity ownership. As a result, G&W’s 2017 operating income includes 100% of the Australian business, while net income attributable to G&W reflects its 51.1% ownership position in the Australian business.\nPrior to the GRail acquisition, G&W's Australian Operations provided rail operator services to GRail, which were recorded as freight-related revenues. These freight-related services continued post acquisition, but are eliminated in consolidation. Revenues from the GRail acquisition are now included in G&W’s consolidated freight revenues from new operations.\nItems Affecting Comparability\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, G&W’s results included certain items affecting comparability between the periods that are set forth in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts).\nIncome/(Loss)\nBefore Taxes\nImpact\nAfter-Tax Net\nIncome/(Loss)\nAttributable\nto G&W\nImpact\nDiluted EPS Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nBuyout of Freightliner deferred consideration agreements $ 8.9 $ 8.9 $ 0.14 Australia impairment and related costs $ (4.9 ) $ (1.8 ) $ (0.03 ) Restructuring costs $ (1.4 ) $ (1.2 ) $ (0.02 ) Corporate development and related costs $ (1.1 ) $ (0.7 ) $ (0.01 ) U.K. coal restructuring and related charges $ 1.1 $ 0.9 $ 0.01 Impact of United States Tax Cuts & Jobs Act $ — $ 371.9 $ 5.94 Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\nRestructuring costs $ (1.9 ) $ (1.4 ) $ (0.02 ) Corporate development and related costs $ (19.2 ) $ (15.9 ) $ (0.27 ) U.K. coal railcar leases $ (10.5 ) $ (8.6 ) $ (0.15 ) ERS impairment and related charges $ (21.5 ) $ (21.5 ) $ (0.37 ) Write-off of debt issuance costs $ (1.3 ) $ (0.5 ) $ (0.01 ) Q4 2016 Short Line Tax Credit $ — $ 7.5 $ 0.13 In the fourth quarter of 2017, G&W’s results included an $8.9 million reduction to other expenses as a result of the buyout of the Freightliner acquisition deferred consideration agreements with certain former Freightliner management holders, Australia impairment and related charges of $4.9 million, which included $5.9 million related to the write down of track assets on idle branch lines in South Australia, partially offset by a $0.9 million recovery of prior year impairment and related costs associated with Arrium Limited's voluntary administration, $1.4 million of restructuring costs, $1.1 million of corporate development and related costs and a $1.1 million reduction to expense associated with a prior year accrual established for the restructuring of our U.K. coal business. The fourth quarter of 2017 also included a $371.9 million estimated income tax benefit primarily as a result of reducing the value of our net deferred tax liabilities from a 35% U.S. federal income tax rate to the newly enacted rate of 21% associated with the United States Tax Cuts & Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, G&W’s results included U.K./Europe impairment and related charges of $32.0 million, which included $21.5 million of charges related to ERS Railways, B.V. (ERS) and $10.5 million of charges related to leases of idle coal railcars in the U.K. The fourth quarter of 2016 also included corporate development and related costs of $19.2 million, primarily related to the GRail, Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (P&W) and Pentalver Transportation Limited (Pentalver) transactions, write-off of debt issuance costs of $1.3 million related to the termination of Australia's term loan as a result of the entry into a new Australian credit facility in conjunction with the GRail acquisition, and restructuring costs of $1.9 million. The fourth quarter of 2016 also included an income tax benefit of $7.5 million associated with the United States Short Line Tax Credit, which expired on December 31, 2016.\nFourth Quarter Results by Segment\nOperating revenues from G&W's North American Operations decreased $2.0 million, or 0.6%, to $320.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $322.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding $4.0 million of revenues from new operations, North American Operations same railroad revenues decreased by $7.2 million, or 2.2%, primarily due to a decrease in freight-related revenues. The decrease in freight-related revenues was primarily due to $10.0 million of revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 associated with a four-year take-or-pay volume commitment contract.\nNorth American Operations traffic decreased 7,517 carloads, or 1.9%, to 395,422 carloads in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding 5,246 carloads from new operations, same railroad traffic decreased 12,763 carloads, or 3.2%, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The same railroad traffic decrease was principally due to decreases of 9,444 carloads of coal and coke traffic (primarily in the Midwest, Western and Northeast regions) and 6,239 carloads of agricultural products traffic (primarily in the Midwest and Central regions), partially offset by increases of 3,481 carloads of minerals and stone traffic (primarily in the Central and Western regions). All remaining traffic decreased by a net 561 carloads.\nOperating income from G&W's North American Operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $74.6 million, compared with $83.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating ratio for North American Operations was 76.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with an operating ratio of 74.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating income from G&W's North American Operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $75.5 million, compared with $87.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adjusted operating ratio for North American Operations was 76.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 72.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income and adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 included $10.0 million of income associated with a four-year take-or-pay volume commitment contract. (1)\nOperating revenues from G&W's Australian Operations increased $14.2 million, or 23.1%, to $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $61.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding $11.6 million of revenues from new operations and a $1.7 million increase due to the impact of foreign currency appreciation, Australian Operations same railroad revenues increased by $0.8 million, or 1.3%. (2)\nAustralian Operations traffic increased 50,610 carloads, or 61.4%, to 132,999 carloads in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding 56,366 carloads from new operations, same railroad traffic decreased 5,756 carloads, or 7.0%, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The carload decrease was principally due to decreases of 3,263 carloads of coal and coke traffic and 2,556 carloads of agricultural products traffic. All remaining traffic increased by a net 63 carloads.\nOperating income from G&W's Australian Operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $17.6 million, compared with $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating ratio for Australian Operations was 76.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with an operating ratio of 95.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating income from G&W's Australian Operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $22.5 million, compared with $13.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adjusted operating ratio for Australian Operations was 70.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 77.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016. (1)\nOperating revenues from G&W's U.K./European Operations increased $42.9 million, or 32.3%, to $175.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $133.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding $37.8 million from new operations and a $10.5 million increase due to the impact of foreign currency appreciation, U.K./European Operations same railroad revenues decreased $5.4 million, or 3.8%, primarily due to a decrease in Continental Europe intermodal revenues following the discontinuation of certain intermodal train services as part of the restructuring of ERS, partially offset by stronger U.K. intermodal and aggregates in Poland and the U.K.. (2)\nU.K./European Operations traffic decreased 7,215 carloads, or 2.6%, to 274,007 carloads in the fourth quarter of 2017. The traffic decrease was principally due to decreases of 9,458 carloads of coal and coke traffic (primarily in the U.K. and Poland) and 4,209 carloads of intermodal traffic (primarily in Continental Europe), partially offset by an increase of 6,453 carloads of minerals and stone traffic (primarily in the U.K. and Poland).\nOperating income from G&W's U.K./European Operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $16.0 million, compared with an operating loss of $32.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating ratio for U.K./European Operations was 90.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 124.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating income from G&W's U.K./European Operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.6 million, compared with $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the restructuring of ERS, improvements in the U.K. intermodal operations and the contribution from the Pentalver acquisition. The adjusted operating ratio for U.K./European Operations was 95.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 98.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016.

In accordance with these rules, G&W has reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nManagement views these non-GAAP financial measures as important measures of G&W’s operating performance or, in the case of the adjusted free cash flow measures, a useful indicator of cash flow that may be available for discretionary use by G&W. Management also views these non-GAAP financial measures as a way to assess comparability between periods. Key limitations of the adjusted free cash flow measures include the assumptions that G&W will be able to refinance its existing debt when it matures and meet other cash flow obligations from financing activities, such as principal payments on debt.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to represent, and should not be considered more meaningful than, or as an alternative to, their most directly comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe following tables set forth reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure (in millions, except percentages and per share amounts).\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Operating Income\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 North\nAmerican\nOperations\nAustralian\nOperations\nU.K./\nEuropean\nOperations\nTotal\nOperations\nOperating revenues $ 320.2 $ 75.5 $ 175.8 $ 571.6 Operating expenses 245.6 58.0 159.8 463.4 Operating income (a) $ 74.6 $ 17.6 $ 16.0 $ 108.2 Operating ratio (b) 76.7 % 76.7 % 90.9 % 81.1 % Operating expenses $ 245.6 $ 58.0 $ 159.8 $ 463.4 Corporate development and related costs (0.9 ) — (0.3 ) (1.1 ) Restructuring costs (0.1 ) — (1.3 ) (1.4 ) Australia impairment and related costs — (4.9 ) — (4.9 ) Buyout of Freightliner deferred consideration agreements — — 8.9 8.9 U.K. coal restructuring and related charges — — 1.1 1.1 Adjusted operating expenses $ 244.7 $ 53.0 $ 168.2 $ 465.9 Adjusted operating income $ 75.5 $ 22.5 $ 7.6 $ 105.7 Adjusted operating ratio 76.4 % 70.2 % 95.7 % 81.5 % Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\nNorth\nAmerican\nOperations\nAustralian\nOperations\nU.K./\nEuropean\nOperations\nTotal\nOperations\nOperating revenues $ 322.2 $ 61.4 $ 133.0 $ 516.5 Operating expenses 238.8 58.5 165.6 463.0 Operating income/(loss) (a) $ 83.4 $ 2.8 $ (32.6 ) $ 53.6 Operating ratio (b) 74.1 % 95.4 % 124.5 % 89.6 % Operating expenses $ 238.8 $ 58.5 $ 165.6 $ 463.0 ERS impairment and related costs — — (21.5 ) (21.5 ) U.K. coal railcar leases — — (10.5 ) (10.5 ) Corporate development and related costs (4.0 ) (10.7 ) (1.3 ) (16.0 ) Restructuring costs (0.1 ) — (1.8 ) (1.9 ) Adjusted operating expenses $ 234.8 $ 47.8 $ 130.6 $ 413.1 Adjusted operating income $ 87.4 $ 13.5 $ 2.4 $ 103.4 Adjusted operating ratio 72.9 % 77.9 % 98.2 % 80.0 % Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 North\nAmerican\nOperations\nAustralian\nOperations\nU.K./\nEuropean\nOperations\nTotal\nOperations\nOperating revenues $ 1,274.3 $ 307.5 $ 626.2 $ 2,208.0 Operating expenses 970.4 230.3 608.9 1,809.6 Operating income (a) $ 303.9 $ 77.3 $ 17.3 $ 398.5 Operating ratio (b) 76.2 % 74.9 % 97.2 % 82.0 % Operating expenses $ 970.4 $ 230.3 $ 608.9 $ 1,809.6 Corporate development and related costs (8.2 ) 0.3 (4.0 ) (11.9 ) Restructuring costs (0.5 ) (0.3 ) (9.4 ) (10.2 ) Australia impairment and related costs —\n(4.9 ) —\n(4.9 ) Buyout of Freightliner deferred consideration agreements —\n—\n8.9 8.9 U.K. coal restructuring and related charges — — 1.1 1.1 Adjusted operating expenses $ 961.7 $ 225.3 $ 605.5 $ 1,792.5 Adjusted operating income $ 312.6 $ 82.2 $ 20.7 $ 415.5 Adjusted operating ratio 75.5 % 73.3 % 96.7 % 81.2 % Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 North\nAmerican\nOperations\nAustralian\nOperations\nU.K./\nEuropean\nOperations\nTotal\nOperations\nOperating revenues $ 1,236.8 $ 222.6 $ 542.2 $ 2,001.5 Operating expenses 917.2 217.8 576.9 1,711.9 Operating income/(loss) (a) $ 319.6 $ 4.8 $ (34.7 ) $ 289.6 Operating ratio (b) 74.2 % 97.8 % 106.4 % 85.5 % Operating expenses $ 917.2 $ 217.8 $ 576.9 $ 1,711.9 Corporate development and related costs (7.2 ) (14.7 ) (1.5 ) (23.3 ) Australia impairment and related costs — (21.1 ) — (21.1 ) ERS impairment and related costs — — (21.5 ) (21.5 ) U.K. coal railcar leases — — (10.5 ) (10.5 ) Restructuring costs (0.9 ) (0.8 ) (6.5 ) (8.2 ) Adjusted operating expenses $ 909.1 $ 181.2 $ 537.0 $ 1,627.3 Adjusted operating income $ 327.6 $ 41.4 $ 5.2 $ 374.2 Adjusted operating ratio (b) 73.5 % 81.4 % 99.0 % 81.3 % (a) Operating income/(loss) is calculated as operating revenues less operating expenses.
