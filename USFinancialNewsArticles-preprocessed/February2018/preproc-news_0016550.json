    "text": "ATHENS, Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. investor Calamos Family Partners said on Wednesday it sued Dutch EXIN Financial Services Holdings for defaulting on loans, casting doubts on whether a deal between the two companies to buy Greek National Bankâ€™s insurance unit can go ahead.\nIn an e-mailed statement, Calamos Family Partners (CFP) said it was seeking immediate repayment of more than $41 million in principal, plus interest, owed to them by EXIN under a series of loan agreements.\nNational Bank (NBG) had put its insurance subsidiary up for sale as part of a restructuring plan approved by the European Union to exit non-banking operations and focus on core banking.\nU.S.-based Calamos Investments, which has $20 billion under management, and EXIN Partners, a Netherlands-based investor focused on insurance, reinsurance and asset management, had agreed to acquire 75 percent of the unit - National Insurance - for 718 million euros ($889.53 million).
