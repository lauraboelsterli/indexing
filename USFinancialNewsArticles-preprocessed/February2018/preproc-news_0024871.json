    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Life360 , the world's largest network for families, today announced the addition of Brit Morin, the CEO and founder of the digital media giant Brit + Co to the company’s board. In addition, Life360 hired Ariana Hellebuyck, who formerly drove the brand strategy and marketing at NerdWallet and the University of Phoenix, as the company’s first VP of Brand Marketing.\n“Brit is a digital pioneer with a proven track record when it comes to building out a brand and diversifying revenue streams,” said Chris Hulls, co-founder and CEO of Life360. “ As both a mom and brand builder, she understands our end user and how Life360 can become the center of a family and give them peace of mind.”\nMorin founded Brit + Co in 2011 with the mission to inspire women and enable them to use creativity to shape their lives. She quickly established Brit + Co as one of the largest digital media companies for women. The company reaches an engaged community of over 175 million online and across its platforms. Her leadership and Brit + Co’s rapid rise has garnered awards and accolades that include Forbes’ 30 Under 30, Marie Claire’s The New Guard, Glamour’s Female Entrepreneur Innovator, and Fortune’s 10 Most Promising Entrepreneurs, among others.\n“Life360 is an incredibly valuable tool for moms like myself all around the country,” said Morin. “Leveraging user data is invaluable in any digital business, but the scale and uniqueness of Life360's data -- paired with their target demo of women -- makes me incredibly excited to join the team.”\nMorin joins board chairman John Coghlan, formerly CEO of Visa USA and Vice Chairman at Charles Schwab, and members Chris Cheever, Partner at Fontinalis Partners, Alex Haro, President of Life360, Chris Hulls, CEO of Life360, and Ryan Swagar, Partner at Venture51.\nPrior to joining Life360, Hellebuyck drove the brand strategy and advertising efforts for NerdWallet, the go-to resource for all of life’s financial decisions. She also served as the VP of Brand Marketing at University of Phoenix, a subsidiary of Apollo Education Group, where she launched the “I am a Phoenix” campaign, transforming the University of Phoenix into a household name.\n“Ariana has deep experience building brands that consumers turn to for making important personal decisions - be it financial or education,” said Hulls. “She understands the central role Life360 plays in the lives of families and understands what it takes to grow a trusted, family-centric brand.”\n“I’m excited to help grow Life360’s brand and to establish it as a household name,” said Hellebuyck. “When it comes to the family, no one has more credibility or insight than Life360, and I’m looking forward to building on their successes.”\nAbout Life360\nLife360 is the world’s leading location and driving safety service for families available for Android and iPhone in a convenient and secure mobile app. A leader in family tech, Life360 gives families peace of mind when they are not together.
