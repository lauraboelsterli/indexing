    "text": "DENVER, Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) today announced results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was $156 million, or $0.85 per share, and $901 million, or $4.71 per share, respectively. Net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 was $143 million, or $0.73 per share, and $1.032 billion, or $5.04 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was $170 million, or $0.92 per share, and $635 million, or $3.32 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 was $177 million, or $0.90 per share, and $692 million, or $3.38 per share, respectively.\nFor the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc., see the note titled \"Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nFinancial and operating highlights include:\nOn December 5, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell our DMG division to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc. This transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. As a result, the DMG business has been reclassified as held for sale and the results of operations are reported as discontinued operations. In addition, prior periods have been revised to conform to the current period presentation.\nCash flow: For the year ended December 31, 2017, consolidated operating cash flow was $1.907 billion, of which $1.556 billion was from continuing operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, consolidated operating cash flow was $343 million, of which $287 million was from continuing operations. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $150 million and $1.042 billion for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOperating income and adjusted operating income: Operating income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $150 million, and adjusted operating income for the same period was $430 million. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.813 billion, and adjusted operating income for the same period was $1.616 billion.\nOperating income for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $363 million, and adjusted operating income for the same period was $423 million. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.030 billion, and adjusted operating income for the same period was $1.715 billion.\nVolume: Total U.S. dialysis treatments for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 7,244,555, or 92,287 treatments per day, representing a per day increase of 5.8% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Normalized non-acquired treatment growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was 3.5%.\nImpairment charges: During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a non-cash other-than-temporary impairment charge of $280 million on our investment in our Asia Pacific joint venture (APAC JV). This charge resulted from changes in expectations for the joint venture based on the APAC JV's continuing market research and assessments concerning the available market opportunities.\nEffective income tax rate: Our effective income tax rate attributable to continuing operations was (320.9)% and 23.1% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. was (2,590.5)% and 26.4% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nAs a result of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation, we recorded a reduction in tax expense of $252 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities to the new federal tax rate. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was also impacted by the non-deductible portion of impairment charges on our investment in our APAC JV and the amount of third-party owners' income attributable to non-tax paying entities.\nThe adjusted effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 excluding these items was 40.4% and 39.1%, respectively.\nCenter activity: As of December 31, 2017, we provided dialysis services to a total of approximately 220,600 patients at 2,747 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,510 centers were located in the United States and 237 centers were located in 11 countries outside of the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we acquired nine dialysis centers, opened a total of 36 new dialysis centers, and closed four centers in the United States. We also acquired six dialysis centers, opened two dialysis centers and closed one dialysis center outside of the United States.\nShare repurchases: We repurchased a total of 12,966,672 shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2017 for a total of $811 million at an average price of $62.54 per share. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased a total of 7,409,849 shares of our common stock for approximately $462 million at an average price of $62.37 per share. We have also repurchased 857,234 shares of our common stock for $65 million at an average price of $75.58 per share from January 1, 2018 through February 12, 2018.\nOn October 10, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization in the amount of approximately $1.253 billion. This recently approved authorization was in addition to the amounts remaining at that time under our Board of Directors' prior share repurchase authorization announced in July 2016. As of February 12, 2018, we have a total of approximately $1.054 billion in outstanding Board repurchase authorizations remaining under our stock repurchase program. These share repurchase authorizations have no expiration dates.\nOutlook\nThe following forward-looking measures and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those described herein, and actual results may vary significantly from these current forward-looking measures. The guidance below does not include the impact of currency fluctuations.\nWe still expect our Kidney Care consolidated operating income for 2018 to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. We expect our operating cash flow from continuing operations for 2018 to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We are updating our 2018 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. to be approximately 26.5% to 27.5%.\nOur previous guidance for 2018 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. was approximately 26.0% to 27.5%.\nWe will be holding a conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 on February 13, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. To join the conference call, please dial (877) 918-6630 from the U.S. or (517) 308-9087 from outside the U.S., and provide the operator the password 'Earnings'. A replay of the conference call will be available on our website at investors.davita.com , for the following 30 days.\nNote on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs used in this press release the term \"adjusted\" refers to non-GAAP measures as follows, each as reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure in the non-GAAP reconciliations in the notes to this press release: (i) for income measures, the term \"adjusted\" refers to operating performance measures that exclude certain items such as impairment charges, gains (losses) on ownership changes, restructuring charges, accruals for legal matters, recent federal tax reform legislation, and gains and charges associated with settlements; and (ii) the term \"adjusted effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc.\" represents the Company's effective tax rate excluding applicable non-GAAP items and noncontrolling owners' income that primarily relates to non-tax paying entities.\nThese non-GAAP or \"adjusted\" measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. Non-GAAP or \"adjusted\" measures should not be considered an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business.\nThe Company's adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc., adjusted diluted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. per share, adjusted operating income, effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc., adjusted effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc., and free cash flow from continuing operations discussed in this press release are reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures at Notes 2, 3, 4, and 5 at the end of this press release.\nDaVita Inc. and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"), including statements in this release, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), reports to stockholders and in meetings with investors and analysts. All such statements in this release, during the related presentation or other meetings, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements and as such are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for \"forward-looking statements\" provided by the PSLRA. Without limiting the foregoing, statements including the words \"expect,\" \"will,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"forecast,\" \"guidance,\" \"outlook,\" \"goals,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements in this release are based on information available to us on the date of this presentation. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our guidance, the assessment of the underlying assumptions or other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changed circumstances, new information, future events or otherwise.\nThese forward-looking statements could include but are not limited to statements related to our guidance and expectations for our 2018 Kidney Care consolidated operating income, our 2018 operating cash flows from continuing operations and our 2018 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc., and uncertainties associated with the other risk factors set forth in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, and the other risks discussed in our subsequent periodic and current reports filed with the SEC from time to time.\nOur actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of those risk factors in our SEC filings relating to:\nthe concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number of patients under such plans, including as a result of restrictions or prohibitions on the use and/or availability of charitable premium assistance, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients, or our making incorrect assumptions about how our patients will respond to any change in financial assistance from charitable organizations; the extent to which the ongoing implementation of healthcare exchanges or changes in or new legislation, regulations or guidance, or enforcement thereof, including among other things those regarding the exchanges, results in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our services from and/or the number of patients enrolled in higher-paying commercial plans; a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare End Stage Renal Disease program or other government-based programs; the impact of the Medicare Advantage benchmark structure; risks arising from potential and proposed federal and/or state legislation or regulation, including healthcare-related and labor-related legislation or regulation, that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability; the impact of the changing political environment and related developments on the current health care marketplace and on our business, including with respect to the future of the Affordable Care Act, the exchanges and many other core aspects of the current health care marketplace; uncertainties related to the impact of federal tax reform legislation; changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies, or pharmaceutical pricing; legal compliance risks, including, without limitation, our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the provisions of our current corporate integrity agreement and current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private-party proceedings, and restrictions on our business and operations required by our corporate integrity agreement and other current or potential settlement terms, and the financial impact thereof and our ability to recover any losses related to such legal matters from third parties; continued increased competition from large- and medium-sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us; our ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance, including our ability to achieve anticipated savings from our recent restructurings; our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates, such as accountable care organizations, independent practice associations and integrated delivery systems; our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might announce or be considering, on terms favorable to us or at all, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, or to successfully expand our operations and services to markets outside the United States, or to businesses outside of dialysis; noncompliance by us or our business associates with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information; the variability of our cash flows; factors that may impact our ability to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and the timing of any such stock repurchases, including market conditions, the price of our common stock, our cash flow position and leverage ratios, and legal, regulatory and contractual requirements; the risk that we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, yet we might not be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at all; risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements; impairment of our goodwill or other assets; the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing, conditions and receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions of the DMG sale transaction, potential disruption in connection with the DMG sale transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, and uncertainties related to our use of proceeds from the DMG sale transaction, including our ability to repurchase stock; the risk that laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which DMG conducts its business; the risk that the cost of providing services under DMG's agreements may exceed our compensation; the risk that reductions in reimbursement rates, including Medicare Advantage rates, and future regulations may negatively impact DMG's business, revenue and profitability; the risk that DMG may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions or successfully address competitive threats that could reduce its profitability; the risk that a disruption in DMG's healthcare provider networks could have an adverse effect on DMG's business operations and profitability; the risk that reductions in the quality ratings of health maintenance organization plan customers of DMG could have an adverse effect on DMG's business; and the risk that health plans that acquire health maintenance organizations may not be willing to contract with DMG or may be willing to contract only on less favorable terms.\nContact:\nJim Gustafson\nInvestor Relations\nDaVita Inc.\n(310) 536-2585\nDAVITA INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its Term Loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following leverage ratio was calculated using \"Consolidated EBITDA\" as defined in the Credit Agreement. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of \"Consolidated EBITDA\", pro forma for routine acquisitions that occurred during the period. The Company's management believes the presentation of \"Consolidated EBITDA\" is useful to users to enhance their understanding of the Company's leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement. The leverage ratio calculated by the Company is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a substitute for debt to net income attributable to DaVita Inc., net income attributable to DaVita Inc. or total debt as determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company's calculation of its leverage ratio might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.\nRolling twelve\nmonths ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet income attributable to DaVita Inc.\n$\n663,618\nIncome taxes\n(40,998)\nInterest expense\n395,215\nDepreciation and amortization\n777,485\nImpairment charges\n981,589\nNoncontrolling interests and equity investment income, net\n196,309\nStock-settled stock-based compensation\n34,981\nGain on changes in ownership interest, net\n(23,402)\nGain on settlement, net\n(529,504)\nOther\n4,673\n\"Consolidated EBITDA\"\n$\n2,459,966\nDecember 31, 2017\nTotal debt, excluding debt discount and other deferred financing costs of $64.0 million\n$\n9,438,029\nLetters of credit issued\n104,679\n9,542,708\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents including short-term investments (excluding DMG's physician owned entities cash)\n(619,343)\nConsolidated net debt\n$\n8,923,365\nLast twelve months \"Consolidated EBITDA\"\n$\n2,459,966\nLeverage ratio\n3.63x\nIn accordance with the Credit Agreement, the Company's leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.50 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017.

In addition, the calculation of adjusted operating income is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, and the amounts presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted operating income may not be indicative of historical operating results, and we do not intend these calculations to be predictive of future results of operations or cash flows.\nThree months ended\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nConsolidated:\nOperating income\n$\n150,337\n$\n395,294\n$\n363,445\n$\n1,812,755\n$\n2,029,710\nGoodwill impairment charges\n—\n—\n28,415\n34,696\n28,415\nEquity investment loss related to APAC JV goodwill impairment\n—\n6,293\n—\n6,293\n—\nImpairment of investments\n280,066\n—\n14,993\n280,066\n14,993\nImpairment of other assets\n—\n—\n—\n15,168\n—\nRestructuring charges\n—\n1,700\n—\n1,700\n—\nEquity investment loss related to restructuring charges\n—\n1,000\n—\n1,000\n—\nGain on settlement, net\n—\n—\n—\n(526,827)\n—\nEquity investment income related to gain on settlement\n—\n—\n—\n(2,677)\n—\nGain on APAC JV ownership changes\n—\n—\n—\n(6,273)\n(374,374)\nAccruals for legal matters\n—\n—\n15,770\n—\n15,770\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n430,403\n$\n404,287\n$\n422,623\n$\n1,615,901\n$\n1,714,514\nCertain columns or rows may not sum or recalculate due to the use of rounded numbers.\nDAVITA INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS FOR NON-GAAP MEASURES - continued\n(unaudited)\n(dollars in thousands)\nThree months ended\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nKidney Care:\nU.S. dialysis and related lab services:\nSegment operating income\n$\n459,210\n$\n442,777\n$\n435,581\n$\n2,297,198\n$\n1,777,014\nGain on settlement, net\n—\n—\n—\n(526,827)\n—\nEquity investment income related to gain on settlement\n—\n—\n—\n(2,677)\n—\nAdjusted U.S. dialysis and related lab services operating income\n459,210\n442,777\n435,581\n1,767,694\n1,777,014\nOther - Ancillary services and strategic initiatives:\nU.S. ancillary services and strategic initiatives\nSegment operating loss\n(2,452)\n(19,245)\n(58,562)\n(110,269)\n(65,586)\nGoodwill impairment charges\n—\n—\n28,415\n34,696\n28,415\nImpairment of other assets\n—\n—\n—\n15,168\n—\nAccruals for legal matters\n—\n—\n15,770\n—\n15,770\nAdjusted operating loss\n(2,452)\n(19,245)\n(14,377)\n(60,405)\n(21,401)\nInternational dialysis\nSegment operating (loss) income\n(294,043)\n(17,273)\n(13,273)\n(329,209)\n331,910\nImpairment of investments\n280,066\n—\n14,993\n280,066\n14,993\nEquity investment loss related to APAC JV goodwill impairment\n—\n6,293\n—\n6,293\n—\nRestructuring charges\n—\n1,700\n—\n1,700\n—\nEquity investment loss related to restructuring charges\n—\n1,000\n—\n1,000\n—\nGain on APAC JV ownership changes\n—\n—\n—\n(6,273)\n(374,374)\nAdjusted operating (loss) income\n(13,977)\n(8,279)\n1,720\n(46,422)\n(27,471)\nAdjusted Other - Ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating loss\n(16,428)\n(27,524)\n(12,657)\n(106,827)\n(48,872)\nCorporate administrative support:\nSegment operating loss\n(12,378)\n(10,965)\n(301)\n(44,966)\n(13,628)\nAdjusted Kidney Care operating income\n$\n430,403\n$\n404,287\n$\n422,623\n$\n1,615,901\n$\n1,714,514\nCertain columns or rows may not sum or recalculate due to the use of rounded numbers.\nDAVITA INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS FOR NON-GAAP MEASURES - continued\n(unaudited)\n(dollars in thousands)\nNote 4: Effective income tax rates and adjusted effective income tax rates.\nWe believe that reporting the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc. as well as the adjusted effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita Inc., excluding the impact of recent federal tax reform legislation, goodwill impairment charges, investment and other asset impairment charges, restructuring charges, a net settlement gain, gain on the APAC JV ownership changes, and estimated accruals for certain legal matters, net of tax, enhances a user's understanding of DaVita Inc.'s effective income tax rate and DaVita Inc.'s adjusted effective income tax rate for the periods presented because it excludes noncontrolling owners' income that primarily relates to non-tax paying entities and certain non-deductible charges which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results, and, therefore, these adjusted measures are meaningful to a user to fully understand the related income tax effects on DaVita Inc.'s operating results.

We believe free cash flow from continuing operations is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations and other measurements under GAAP, since free cash flow from continuing operations is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions and development activities and meet our debt service requirements. In addition, free cash flow from continuing operations excluding distributions to noncontrolling interests provides a user with an understanding of free cash flows from continuing operations that are attributable to DaVita Inc.
