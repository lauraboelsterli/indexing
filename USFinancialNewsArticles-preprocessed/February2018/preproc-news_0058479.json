    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French rail workers will no longer enjoy special employment perks, with new hires to fall under France’s national labor law when the government pushes through reform of the state-run SNCF train company by decree, the prime minister said on Monday.\nThe government will start a process of sweeping reforms with a debate in parliament in mid-March but, in the event of wide opposition, the assembly will not have a final vote, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said.\nThe prime minister’s comments will anger labor unions who have already threatened protests in March over the planned reforms.\nReporting By Brian Love; editing by Richard Lough\n ",
