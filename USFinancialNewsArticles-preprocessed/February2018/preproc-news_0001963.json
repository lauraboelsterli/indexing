    "text": "IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BOOT) today announced its financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nHighlights for the quarter ended December 30, 2017, were as follows:\nNet sales increased 12.7% to $224.7 million. Same store sales increased 5.2%, with stores outperforming e-commerce sales. Net income per diluted share was $0.73 based on 27.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Excluding the impact of the change in federal tax law, net income per diluted share was $0.46 compared to guidance of $0.40 to $0.43, which was based on 27.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company opened four new stores during the quarter.\nJim Conroy, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We experienced solid sales growth during the third quarter and through January driven by the combination of a healthier consumer environment and solid execution across the company. Our retail stores led our growth with improvements in our marketing, merchandising, and in-store initiatives. I am very pleased with our holiday performance as we drove sales growth without relying on outsized sales promotion, resulting in an increase to merchandise margin. At the same time, we continue to build out our multi-brand e-commerce strategy, having advanced some important capital projects in our fulfillment center. While these investments resulted in some temporary disruption to e-commerce revenue and unanticipated labor and freight costs during the peak holiday season, I believe we are well positioned to build our market share on this platform going forward. I am pleased with the current tone of business and believe we can continue to further expand our market share as we reaccelerate new store openings and capitalize on our advanced omni-channel capabilities.”\nOperating Results for the Third Quarter Ended December 30, 2017\nNet sales increased 12.7% to $224.7 million from $199.4 million in the prior-year period. Net sales increased due to an increase of 5.2% in same store sales, the sales contribution from seven new stores opened over the past twelve months and the four stores acquired from Wood’s Boots, and sales from the Country Outfitter site that was acquired in February 2017. Gross profit was $71.9 million, or 32.0% of net sales, compared to $63.4 million, or 31.8% of net sales, in the prior-year period. Gross profit increased primarily due to increased sales. As a percentage of net sales, consolidated gross profit increased primarily as a result of a 10 basis point increase in merchandise margin rate and a 10 basis point decrease in buying and occupancy costs. The higher merchandise margin rate was driven by more full-price selling, less clearance and increased exclusive brand penetration, partially offset by higher freight due to the temporary challenges in our e-commerce fulfillment center. The improvement in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales resulted from leveraging fixed occupancy costs on increased sales, partially offset by increased labor costs in the Company’s fulfillment center to meet holiday e-commerce demand. Selling, general and administrative expense was $47.5 million, or 21.2% of net sales, compared to $42.5 million, or 21.3% of net sales, in the prior-year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of increased sales and additional costs for both new and acquired stores. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased as a result of expense leverage on higher sales. A net pre-tax gain from insurance and other settlements related primarily to losses suffered in the second quarter from Hurricane Harvey was offset by incentive compensation expense in the third quarter. Income from operations increased 16.9%, to $24.4 million, or 10.9% of net sales, compared to $20.9 million, or 10.5% of net sales, in the prior-year period. The Company opened four new stores, ending the quarter with 226 stores in 31 states. Net income was $20.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of the change in federal tax law that generated approximately $0.24 per share of tax benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $0.03 of tax benefit from a lower effective tax rate, net income per diluted share was $0.46, compared to $0.39 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\nOperating Results for the Nine 30, 2017\nNet sales increased 8.6% to $507.2 million from $466.8 million in the prior-year period. Net sales increased due to the sales contribution from seven new stores opened over the past twelve months and the four stores acquired from Wood’s Boots, a 3.1% increase in same store sales, and sales from the Country Outfitter site that was acquired in February 2017. Gross profit was $155.0 million, or 30.6% of net sales, compared to $140.6 million, or 30.1% of net sales, in the prior-year period. Gross profit increased primarily due to increased sales. As a percentage of sales, consolidated gross profit increased as a result of a 40 basis point increase in merchandise margin rate and 10 basis points of occupancy leverage. Selling, general and administrative expense was $120.0 million, or 23.7% of net sales, compared to $110.8 million, or 23.7% of net sales, in the prior-year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of additional costs associated with the opening of new and acquired stores over the last twelve months and incremental operational costs associated with the growth in the business. Income from operations increased 17.5%, to $35.0 million, or 6.9% of net sales, compared to $29.8 million, or 6.4% of net sales, in the prior-year period. The Company opened five new stores, acquired four stores from Wood’s Boots and closed two Boot Barn stores, ending the period with 226 stores in 31 states. Net income was $22.0 million, or $0.81 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of the change in federal tax law, net income per diluted share was $0.54, compared to $0.43 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\nBalance Sheet Highlights as of December 30, 2017\nCash of $19.1 million. Average inventory per store was flat on a comp store basis compared to December 24, 2016. Total net debt of $182.9 million, including a zero balance under the revolving credit facility.\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2018 the Company expects:\nSame store sales growth of 4.0% to 5.0%. Income from operations between $8.3 million and $8.6 million, which includes an estimated $0.3 million of secondary offering costs. Net income of $4.2 million to $4.5 million, which is based on a blended tax rate of 5.8% for the quarter. The Company’s effective tax rate of 36.2% is expected to be further reduced by an estimated tax benefit of $1.4 million, or $0.05 per share, related to stock option exercises made primarily in conjunction with the secondary offering that closed on January 22, 2018. Net income also includes the estimated pre-tax secondary offering costs of $0.3 million, or approximately $0.01 per share. Net income per diluted share of $0.15 to $0.16 based on 28.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nFor the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, the Company now expects:\nTo open 10 new stores, including the acquisition of the four Wood’s Boots stores. Income from operations between $43.2 million and $43.5 million, which includes an estimated $0.3 million of secondary offering costs. Net income between $26.2 million and $26.5 million, which includes a $6.8 million tax benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and an updated annual tax rate pursuant to tax reform. Net income per diluted share of $0.95 to $0.96 based on 27.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding compared to the Company’s November 2, 2017 outlook of $0.57 to $0.61 which assumed 27.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss the financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 is scheduled for today, January 31, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET (1:30 p.m. PT).

These non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. The Company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with transparency and help illustrate financial results by excluding items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the Company’s core operating results, thereby providing a better baseline for analyzing trends in the underlying business. See the table at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to income from operations, adjusted net income to net income, and adjusted net income per diluted share to net income per diluted share. Additionally, see the table at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, as well as Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Company’s loan agreements, to net income.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements. refer to our current expectations and projections relating to, by way of example and without limitation, our financial condition, liquidity, profitability, results of operations, margins, plans, objectives, strategies, future performance, business and industry.

These statements may include words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “project”, “plan”, “intend”, “believe”, “may”, “might”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “can have”, “likely”, “outlook” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events, but not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that the Company’s management has made in light of their industry experience and on their perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe are appropriate under the circumstances.

They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company’s control) and assumptions.

The Company discusses the foregoing risks and other risks in greater detail under the heading “Risk factors” in the periodic reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
