    "text": "Karl-Anthony Towns’ 22-footer broke a late tie Sunday night, and the Minnesota Timberwolves went onto beat the Sacramento Kings 111-106 in Minneapolis for their 13th consecutive home win.\nTowns led all scorers with 29 points for the Timberwolves, who snapped a two-game losing streak.\nRookie De‘Aaron Fox had 23 points for the Kings, who lost for the fourth time in five games.\nThe Timberwolves led 56-54 at halftime, but the Kings ran off from a 69-all tie to go up 80-75 by the end of the third period. Vince Carter contributed a 3-pointer to Sacramento’s 11-6, quarter-ending run.\nMinnesota got even again at 81-all on a hoop by Jimmy Butler with 9:34 to go, and the clubs battled on even terms until Towns’ tiebreaking basket put the Timberwolves ahead for good at 98-96 with 3:18 remaining.\nJeff Teague hit a key basket as Minnesota led by as many as five in the late going, but a 3-pointer by Buddy Hield allowed the Kings to close within 108-106 with 11.1 seconds to play.\nButler then assured the home winning streak would continue with a pair of free throws with 7.5 seconds to go, and Teague completed the scoring with one foul shot after a Sacramento turnover.\nButler finished with 18 points and Andrew Wiggins added 16 points to go with eight rebounds for the Timberwolves, who haven’t lost at home since Dec. 16 against Phoenix.\nTowns matched Wiggins’ team-high rebound total with eight, and he also had six assists.\nTaj Gibson added 15 points and Jamal Crawford 12, while Teague completed a double-double with 12 points and a game-high 10 assists for the Timberwolves.\nHield backed Fox’s 23 points with 16 off the bench for the Kings, who were tipping off a three-game trip.\nBogdan Bogdanovic chipped in with 13 points and a team-high eight assists, and Kosta Koufos registered a double-double with 12 points and a game-high 10 rebounds for Sacramento.\nZach Randolph (12 points) and Willie Cauley-Stein (10) made it six players in double figures for the Kings.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
