    "text": " 34 AM / Updated 8 minutes ago Relief bounce for European shares after turbulent week Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMILAN (Reuters) - European shares rebounded from six-month lows on Monday as jitters over a sudden spike in volatility that wiped off 1 trillion euros in market capitalisation last week appeared to ease. \nGains in all sectors helped the pan-European STOXX 600 index rise 1.2 percent by 0812 GMT, after ending at its lowest level since August on Friday. The UK’s FTSE and Germany’s DAX also rose more than 1 percent. \nUpbeat broker notes pushed shares in Victrex and Delivery Hero to the top of the STOXX, sending both shares up more than 4 percent. \nAkzo Nobel rose 1.4 percent after a source-based Financial Times report said that U.S. private equity giant Apollo had teamed up with the biggest Dutch pension fund to buy the group’s 10 billion-euro speciality chemicals unit. \nHeineken however fell 3.4 percent after the world’s second largest brewer lowered its margin growth target, blaming a volatile market environment and an acquisition in Brazil. \nTelecoms firm SES fell 7 percent after it announced management changes.
