The companies agreed not to disclose the purchase price.

Besides focusing on R&D, Anton Paar's growth is based on strategic acquisitions.\nThe Anton Paar Group (2900 employees) is active in more than 110 countries with 29 international sales subsidiaries and seven producing firms in Europe and the USA.\nThis press release was issued through 24-7PressRelease.com .
