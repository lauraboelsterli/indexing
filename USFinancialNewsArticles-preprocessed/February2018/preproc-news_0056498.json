    "text": "AMSTERDAM, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The fixed networks of the two largest Dutch telecommunications companies, KPN and VodafoneZiggo, should be opened for use by competitors, consumer watchdog ACM said on Tuesday.\nOpening the networks would ensure that there is sufficient competition in the concentrated Dutch market, where the third and fourth players, Deutsche Telekom and Tele2 , are set to merge operations, the watchdog said in a statement.\nZiggo owner Liberty Global and Vodafone operate as a joint venture in the Netherlands combining the countryâ€™s largest cable network with its second-largest mobile network.
