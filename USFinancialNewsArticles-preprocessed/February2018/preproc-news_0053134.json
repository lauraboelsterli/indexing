    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- W. P. Carey Inc. (NYSE: WPC) (W. P. Carey or the Company), an internally-managed net lease real estate investment trust, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal Company\nNet income attributable to W. P. Carey of $75.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter and $277.3 million, or $2.56 per diluted share, for 2017\nAFFO of $142.1 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter and $573.0 million, or $5.30 per diluted share, for 2017\nQuarterly cash dividend raised to $1.01 per share, equivalent to an annualized dividend rate of $4.04 per share\n2018 full year AFFO guidance range of $5.30 to $5.50 per diluted share announced\nBusiness Segments\nOwned Real Estate\nSegment net income attributable to W. P. Carey of $54.1 million for the fourth quarter and $192.1 million for 2017\nSegment AFFO of $111.3 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter and $456.9 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, for 2017\nAcquisitions and completed capital investment projects totaling $32.3 million during the fourth quarter, bringing total investment volume for 2017 to $95.9 million\nEight active capital investment projects for a total commitment of $148.1 million at year end\nGross disposition proceeds totaling $59.1 million during the fourth quarter, bringing total dispositions for 2017 to $191.6 million\nPortfolio occupancy of 99.8%\nWeighted-average lease term of 9.6 years\nInvestment Management\nSegment net income attributable to W. P. Carey of $21.1 million for the fourth quarter and $85.2 million for 2017\nSegment AFFO of $30.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter and $116.1 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, for 2017\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\n\"Our fourth quarter and full year results reflect the continuing positive effects of the advancements we've made in recent years, with AFFO per diluted share up 7.4% and 3.5%, respectively, over the prior-year periods,\" said Jason Fox, Chief Executive Officer of W. P. Carey. \"Reductions in our cost base and an improved cost of debt outweighed the near-term impacts of our decisions to be a net seller and refocus our business, which have improved the quality of our portfolio and the composition of our revenue streams.\"\n\"Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to create long-term value for shareholders by driving earnings growth through accretive acquisitions and same-store growth, supported by proactive asset management, a resilient and flexible balance sheet and constant attention to our cost of capital.\"\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nAs previously announced, as a result of its decision to exit non-traded retail fundraising activities in June 2017, the Company revised its segment presentation recognizing equity income earned through its ownership interests in the Managed REITs and its special member interests in the operating partnerships of the Managed REITs within its Investment Management segment. Prior to the 2017 second quarter, these items were recognized within its Owned Real Estate segment. For purposes of comparability, segment financial statements for all periods presented have been revised to reflect this change.\nQUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenues\nTotal Company: Revenues excluding reimbursable costs (net revenues) for the 2017 fourth quarter totaled $185.3 million, down 8.5% from $202.5 million for the 2016 fourth quarter.\nOwned Real Estate: Owned Real Estate net revenues for the 2017 fourth quarter were $162.3 million, down 1.8% from $165.3 million for the 2016 fourth quarter, due primarily to lower lease revenues resulting from the non-cash acceleration of amortization of certain lease intangible assets during the current-year period, which more than offset the positive impact of a stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar on lease revenues.\nInvestment Management: Investment Management net revenues for the 2017 fourth quarter were $23.1 million, down 37.9% from $37.2 million for the 2016 fourth quarter, due primarily to lower structuring revenues and the cessation of dealer manager fees resulting from the Company's strategic decision to exit non-traded retail fundraising.\nNet Income Attributable to W. P. Carey\nNet income attributable to W. P. Carey for the 2017 fourth quarter was $75.2 million, up 57.7% compared to $47.7 million for the 2016 fourth quarter, due primarily to a higher aggregate gain on sale of real estate, lower general and administrative expenses resulting primarily from the Company's strategic decision to exit non-traded retail fundraising and lower impairment charges recorded during the current-year period.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)\nAFFO for the 2017 fourth quarter was $1.31 per diluted share, up 7.4% from $1.22 per diluted share for the 2016 fourth quarter, due primarily to lower general and administrative expenses, the positive impact of a stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar on lease revenues and lower interest expense, which more than offset lower structuring revenues.\nNote: Further information concerning AFFO, a non-GAAP supplemental performance metric, is presented in the accompanying tables and related notes.\nDividend\nAs previously announced, on December 6, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.01 per share, equivalent to an annualized dividend rate of $4.04 per share. The dividend was paid on January 16, 2018 to stockholders of record as of December 29, 2017.\nFULL YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenues\nTotal Company: Net revenues for the 2017 full year totaled $775.3 million, down 8.8% from $849.7 million for the 2016 full year.\nOwned Real Estate: Net revenues from Owned Real Estate for the 2017 full year totaled $665.7 million, down 8.8% from $729.9 million for the 2016 full year, due primarily to $32.2 million of lease termination income and $16.7 million of lease revenues from the non-cash acceleration of amortization of lease intangible liabilities, both recognized and related to a property sold in 2016. Furthermore, additional lease revenues from acquisitions and capital investment projects completed during 2017 were more than offset by a reduction in lease revenues due to property dispositions.\nInvestment Management: Net revenues from Investment Management for the 2017 full year totaled $109.6 million, down 8.4% from $119.7 million for the 2016 full year, due primarily to lower structuring revenues and the cessation of dealer manager fees during 2017 resulting from the Company's strategic decision to exit non-traded retail fundraising, which more than offset higher asset management fees.\nNet Income Attributable to W. P. Carey\nNet income attributable to W. P. Carey for the 2017 full year totaled $277.3 million, up 3.6% compared to $267.7 million for the 2016 full year, due primarily to lower impairment charges recorded during the current year, lower interest expense and lower general and administrative expenses, which more than offset a lower aggregate gain on sale of real estate.\nAFFO\nAFFO for the 2017 full year totaled $5.30 per diluted share, up 3.5% compared to $5.12 per diluted share for the 2016 full year, due primarily to lower interest expense, lower general and administrative expenses, a lower provision for income taxes and higher asset management fees, which more than offset lower lease revenues and lower structuring revenues.\nNote: Further information concerning AFFO, a non-GAAP supplemental performance metric, is presented in the accompanying tables and related notes.\nDividends\nDividends declared during 2017 totaled $4.01 per share, an increase of 2.0% compared to total dividends declared during 2016 of $3.93 per share.\nAFFO GUIDANCE\nFor the 2018 full year, the Company expects to report AFFO of between $5.30 and $5.50 per diluted share, based on the following key assumptions:\n(i) acquisitions for the Company's Owned Real Estate portfolio of between $500 million and $1 billion;\n(ii) dispositions from the Company's Owned Real Estate portfolio of between $300 million and $500 million; and\n(iii) total general and administrative expenses of between $65 million and $70 million.\nNote: The Company does not provide guidance on net income. The Company only provides guidance on AFFO and does not provide a reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP guidance to net income due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain items necessary to provide such reconciliation as a result of their unknown effect, timing and potential significance. Examples of such items include impairments of assets, gains and losses from sales of assets and depreciation and amortization from new acquisitions.\nOWNED REAL ESTATE\nInvestments\nDuring the 2017 fourth quarter, the Company completed investments totaling $32.3 million, comprised of one acquisition for $25.9 million and one build-to-suit project placed into service at a total cost of $6.4 million, bringing total investment activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $95.9 million, including transaction-related costs and fees.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had eight active capital investment projects for an expected total investment of approximately $148.1 million, of which $100.4 million is expected to be completed during 2018.\nDispositions\nDuring the 2017 fourth quarter, the Company disposed of five properties for total gross proceeds of $59.1 million, bringing total dispositions for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $191.6 million.\nComposition\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's Owned Real Estate portfolio consisted of 887 net lease properties, comprising 84.9 million square feet leased to 210 tenants, and two hotel operating properties. As of that date, the weighted-average lease term of the net lease portfolio was 9.6 years and the occupancy rate was 99.8%.\nINVESTMENT MANAGEMENT\nW. P.

In connection with the acquisitions of multi-family properties on behalf of CPA:18 – Global, we entered into agreements with third-party advisors for the day-to-day management of the properties for which we pay 100% of asset management fees paid to us by CPA:18 – Global. Pursuant to the terms of the subadvisory agreement we had with the subadvisor in connection with Carey Credit Income Fund (CCIF) (prior to our resignation as the advisor to CCIF in the third quarter of 2017), we paid a subadvisory fee equal to 50% of the asset management fees and organization and offering costs paid to us by CCIF.\n(b)\nAmounts for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and year ended December 31, 2017 represent restructuring expenses resulting from our exit from non-traded retail fundraising activities, which we announced in June 2017. Amount for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents restructuring and other compensation-related expenses resulting from a reduction in headcount and employee severance arrangements, primarily in connection with the reduction in force that we completed in March 2016.\n(c)\nAmount for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $32.2 million of lease termination income related to a domestic property sold during that year.\n(d)\nAmount for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily comprised of an accrual for estimated one-time legal settlement expenses.\n(e)\nAmount for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects expenses related to our formal strategic review of $5.2 million, which was completed in May 2016.\nW.
