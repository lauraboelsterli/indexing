Under the terms of the deal, Infinity stockholders will receive $51.60 in cash and 1.2019 Kemper common shares for each share of Infinity stock they own.\nThe investigation concerns whether the Infinity’s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties to Infinity stockholders by failing to adequately shop the Company before entering into this transaction and whether Kemper Corporation is underpaying for Infinity shares, thus unlawfully harming Infinity stockholders.\nIf you own common stock in Infinity and wish to obtain additional information, please contact Vincent Wong, Esq. either via email vw@wongesq.com , by telephone at 212.425.1140, or http://docs.wongesq.com/IPCC-Info-Request-Form-1832 .\nVincent Wong, Esq. is an experienced attorney that has represented investors in securities litigations involving financial fraud and violations of shareholder rights.
