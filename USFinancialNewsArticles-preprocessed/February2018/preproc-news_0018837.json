Acquired net sales contributed a total of 11.7% in the quarter. Organic net sales grew 7.6% (organic net sales are defined as net sales excluding both sales from acquisitions within the last twelve months and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar). Foreign exchange had a positive impact of 0.7%.\nFourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS improved due to the positive direct and indirect impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This increase was offset by lower operating results related to lower sales and margin in the Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (CIT) segment, rising raw material costs in the Carlisle Construction Materials (CCM) segment, and increased costs related to restructuring, facility rationalization, and acquisition related costs at CCM, CIT, Carlisle Fluid Technologies (CFT) and the Carlisle Brake & Friction (CBF) segments. Partially offsetting the lower operating results were higher net sales volume at CCM and CBF, acquired operating earnings at Carlisle FoodService Products (CFS), and savings from the Carlisle Operating System (COS).\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 YTD 2017 YTD 2016 Net sales $ 1,071.8 $ 893.5 $ 4,089.9 $ 3,675.4 Operating income $ 104.0 $ 114.7 $ 505.7 $ 438.1 Adjusted operating income (1) $ 104.0 $ 114.7 $ 505.7 $ 579.6 Income from continuing operations, net of tax $ 115.1 $ 76.5 $ 365.3 $ 250.8 Adjusted income from continuing operations, net of tax (1) $ 115.1 $ 86.6 $ 365.3 $ 383.5 Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 1.82 $ 1.17 $ 5.71 $ 3.83 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (1) $ 1.82 $ 1.32 $ 5.71 $ 5.86 Items affecting comparability after tax impact on EPS (2) $ (0.65 ) $ 0.16 $ (0.18 ) $ 0.26 (1) Adjusted to exclude goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling $141.5 million pre-tax, $132.7 million after-tax or $2.03 per share for 2016 YTD period.

Christian “Chris” Koch, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “As we close Carlisle's 100th year, we reflect one final time on a century of innovation and growth; a century of continuous improvement; and a century of outstanding shareholder returns. 2017 marked a year of transition in portfolio realignment, rationalization/restructuring, and a new strategic vision for Carlisle. As we embark on the next one hundred years, our nearly 14,000 dedicated employees are committed to achieving superior shareholder returns by driving above market organic growth, operational excellence, continuous improvement, and deploying capital through synergistic acquisitions to the portfolio.\n2017 was another year of milestones. Our revenue surpassed $4 billion for the first time, driven by a strong U.S. Commercial Roofing market, off-highway vehicle markets recovering from market lows, and strategic acquisitions. We further returned a record $360.5 million to shareholders in the form of $92.1 million of dividends and $268.4 million of share repurchases. We successfully executed on our commitment to deploy capital in support of our growth strategy as evidenced nearly $1 billion deployed into acquisitions, a Carlisle record amount. These acquisitions included San Jamar, Arbo, Drexel Metals, and Accella Performance Materials (\"Accella\"), the largest acquisition in Carlisle's history. Finally, we issued $1 billion of senior notes to optimize our capital structure. This debt issue was the largest in Carlisle's history and was favorably received by the capital markets.\nWith a recently increased $1 billion of availability on our credit revolver, and with our strong cash generation, we expect to have ample liquidity to make further investments in our businesses and continue to return capital to our shareholders.\nWhile we are still evaluating the long-term impact of the recent change to U.S. tax policy, our fourth quarter 2017 results include $52.6 million of estimated positive direct and indirect impact due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, consisting of a benefit of remeasuring deferred taxes of $90 million, one-time toll charges for foreign earnings of $32 million, and expense from the change in assertion related to reinvestment of foreign earnings of $5 million.\nThe Carlisle Operating System (COS), based on lean sigma principles and the cornerstone of Carlisle's culture of operational excellence, continued to drive improvements throughout the organization in 2017. Savings from COS were in excess of $50 million and were a significant contributor to our solid operating income performance. As the next phase of COS is deployed, we will move from a factory based system to a focus on consistent application of COS in our business processes.\nCarlisle Construction Materials (CCM) achieved record fourth quarter organic net sales, reflecting strong U.S. non-residential roofing markets. The year-over-year operating income decline was primarily due to rising raw material costs and acquisition related costs, partially offset by higher net sales volume and COS savings.\nOn November 1st, we completed the $670 million purchase of Accella, a premier specialty polyurethane growth platform with approximately $430 million of annual net sales and expected synergies of over $30 million by 2021. The acquisition of Accella is part of our well-established strategy of providing customers with high quality, innovative solutions for building envelope applications.\n(in millions) Three Months Ended December 31, Acquisition\nEffect\nPrice / Volume\nEffect\nExchange Rate\nEffect\n2017 2016 Change % Net sales $ 618.7 $ 488.2 26.7% 16.7% 9.5% 0.5% Operating income $ 87.7 $ 93.0 (5.7)%\nOperating margin 14.2 % 19.0 % Items affecting comparability $ 5.8 $ — The outlook for commercial construction in the U.S. remains positive. In 2018, we expect CCM to achieve mid-single digit organic net sales growth. Contributions from acquisitions will result in a mid-teens segment sales increase. We expect CCM to continue operating with price discipline in their markets.\nCarlisle Interconnect Technologies (CIT) net sales in the fourth quarter met our expectations. Year-over-year operating income decline was primarily related to unfavorable product mix and continued facility rationalization and plant restructuring costs.\n(in millions) Three Months Ended December 31, Acquisition\nEffect\nPrice / Volume\nEffect\nExchange Rate\nEffect\n2017 2016 Change % Net sales $ 208.5 $ 210.3 (0.9)% 0.5% (1.6)% 0.2% Operating income $ 21.9 $ 25.9 (15.4)% Operating margin 10.5 % 12.3 % Items affecting comparability $ 3.9 $ 10.4 In 2018, we expect CIT to achieve mid-single digit net sales growth, with growth driven by In-Flight Connectivity, Medical, and Test & Measurement products.\nCarlisle FoodService Products (CFS) net sales and operating income in the fourth quarter 2017 reflected growth related to the January 2017 acquisition of San Jamar, which contributed $21.5 million to net sales and $2.3 million to operating income. We expect the sale of FoodService Products to close in the first quarter of 2018.\n(in millions) Three Months Ended December 31, Acquisition\nEffect\nPrice / Volume\nEffect\nExchange Rate\nEffect\n2017 2016 Change % Net sales $ 81.3 $ 63.3 28.4% 33.9% (5.5)% —% Operating income $ 9.8 $ 7.2 36.1% Operating margin 12.1 % 11.4 % Items affecting comparability $ — $ 1.3 Carlisle Fluid Technologies (CFT) underwent a leadership change and finished 2017 with three consecutive months of strong revenue performance, reflecting growth in EMEA and APAC. Transportation, General Industrial, and Automotive Refinish markets all grew. Accelerated restructuring and facility rationalization costs, and continuation of investments to position the business for future growth and margin improvement contributed to Operating Margin decline.\n(in millions) Three Months Ended December 31, Acquisition\nEffect\nPrice / Volume\nEffect\nExchange Rate\nEffect\n2017 2016 Change % Net sales $ 79.0 $ 71.0 11.3% —% 8.9% 2.4% Operating income $ 3.7 $ 9.3 (60.2)% Operating margin 4.7 % 13.1 % Items affecting comparability $ 3.5 $ 0.4 In 2018, we expect CFT to achieve mid-single digit net sales growth, with growth expected in General Industrial and Automotive Refinish markets.\nCarlisle Brake & Friction (CBF) continued the strong net sales growth that began early in the second quarter, reflecting share gains and growth in their key end markets of construction, agriculture, and mining. The improvement in operating margin, driven by higher sales volume, was negatively impacted by unfavorable mix, and costs related to the Tulsa, Oklahoma plant consolidation.\n(in millions) Three Months Ended December 31, Acquisition\nEffect\nPrice / Volume\nEffect\nExchange Rate\nEffect\n2017 2016 Change % Net sales $ 84.3 $ 60.7 38.9% —% 36.4% 2.5% Operating income $ (1.2 ) $ (3.0 ) 60.0% Operating margin (1.4 )% (4.9 )% Items affecting comparability $ 2.1 $ — In 2018, we expect CBF to continue to achieve low teens sales growth, with growth expected in core markets of Agriculture, Mining, and Construction.\nKoch concluded by stating, “We are pleased with our significant accomplishments and solid performance at Carlisle in 2017. As we roll out our Vision 2025 strategic plan, we expect our core operating philosophies will continue to drive increased value for Carlisle shareholders. For 2018 on a continuing operations basis, we expect total net sales growth in the mid-teens. We expect capital expenditures will be approximately $135 to $160 million. We expect a positive impact from tax reform in 2018, with an effective tax rate of approximately 25-27%. We plan to actively pursue synergistic acquisitions and continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With COS continuing to gain momentum enterprise wide, we expect 2018 will be another year of record performance for Carlisle.\"\nCash Flow\nFree cash flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, and comprised of continuing and discontinued operations) was $298.8 million in the 2017, a decrease of $123.6 million versus the prior year. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily attributable to a greater usage of cash for working capital to support expected organic sales growth and higher capital expenditures versus the prior year.\nDuring 2017, we utilized net proceeds from our $1.0 billion bond offering to repay all outstanding amounts on our revolving credit facility, including borrowings used to fund the acquisition of Accella. We redeployed our free cash flow to acquire San Jamar, Arbo, and Drexel Metals, and to repurchase approximately 2.7 million shares of Carlisle common stock.\nAs announced on February 6th, we have increased our share repurchase program by an additional 5 million shares. This authorization is in addition to approximately 2.1 million shares remaining, as of December 31, 2017, under the existing share repurchase authorization announced in September 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $379.6 million cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will discuss fourth quarter 2017 results on a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET today. The call may be accessed live by going to the Investor Relations section of the Carlisle website ( http://www.carlisle.com/investor-relations/events-and-webcasts/default.aspx ) , or the taped call may be listened to shortly following the live call at the same website location. A PowerPoint presentation will accompany the call and can be found on the Carlisle website as well.\nOperating Income and Non-GAAP Measures\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company revised (1) the Consolidated Statement of Earnings to include a subtotal of operating income, with non-operating expense (income) reflected as a separate line item below interest expense, net and (2) its segment measure of performance to operating income (previously earnings before interest and taxes). See our form 10-K to be filed for 2017 for further information regarding this change.\nAll financial and percentage comparisons in the Company's fourth quarter 2017 reporting are made to the same quarter of the previous year, unless otherwise stated.

This selected Non-GAAP financial information for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 are presented to exclude the impairment charges at Carlisle Brake & Friction. Management believes adjusted results provide meaningful supplemental information about the ongoing operational performance and fundamentals of the underlying business and present a useful comparison between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management also uses the non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208006372/en/\nCarlisle Companies Incorporated\nRobert M.
