    "text": "A robot helped ring the opening bell at the NYSE Tuesday — and it was scarily tough to pick from the others on the podium. \nBINA48, developed by the same firm behind the more outspoken Sophia , opened the stock exchange alongside UBS executives.\n\"She\" stands a little shorter than her neighbors and appears considerably less enthusiastic. But otherwise, the robot blends right in — to an uncomfortable degree for some. \n\"We invited Bina48, one of the world's most advanced social robots, to join us at the bell ringing to show a physical representation of the concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence that are transforming financial markets and investment strategies,\" said a UBS spokesperson in an email to CNBC.\nfreaked out tweet \nnot a lady tweet \nBINA48 is actually just a head and bust mounted on a frame, and is modeled after Bina Aspen, the wife of technology entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt, according to the website for the humanoid's creators, Hanson Robotics. \nSource: Hanson Robotics Hanson Robotics BINA48 robot. \"BINA48 engages in conversation with other humans, such as offering an emotional account of her brother's personality changes after returning home from the Vietnam War,\" the site says. \nIt's not the robot's first shot at the limelight. BINA48 was interviewed by a New York Times reporter in 2010 and has appeared at several TED events.\nBINA48's sister-of-sorts, Sophia, has captured the headlines more recently, though, poking fun at Elon Musk and discussing artificial intelligence with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin. \nSpokespeople for the NYSE and Hanson Robotics were not immediately available for comment.",
