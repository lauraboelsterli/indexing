Shares of many companies valued at $100 billion or more changed hands at more than 200 percent the usual volume.\nThe S&P 500 Information Technology Index dropped 4 percent, almost matching the decline in the overall S&P 500. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted over 1,000 points, closing down 4.6 percent. Among technology companies in the Dow, Cisco was the worst performer, dropping 5.3 percent.\nThe result was $194 billion slashed from the market capitalization of top tech stocks, according to data collected by FactSet and analyzed by CNBC. About $90 billion of that was in just four stocks: Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet and Netflix .\nMarket cap Monday Market cap Friday Apple 796.07 816.47 Alphabet 738.7 777.54 Microsoft 677.58 706.69 Amazon 672.91 692.25 Facebook 524.53 550.63 Intel 208.35 215.98 Verizon 205.99 216.11 Oracle 199.07 207.52 Cisco 191.52 202.34 IBM 141.21 147.23 NVIDIA 129.5 141.51 Netflix 110.34 116.05 Total loss (billions USD): $194.55 billion Source: FactSet",
