    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Calif., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, it was announced that Keely Colcleugh, founder and CEO of Kilograph , has joined the board of the American Society of Architectural Illustrators ( ASAI ) as their new Vice President. She succeeds Lon Grohs, Chief Commercial Officer of Chaos Group, who will now be the organization’s acting President.\n“Keely is a visionary who is helping propel architectural illustration to the next level, making her a perfect ambassador for our board and core missions of community growth and collaboration,” said Lon Grohs, President of ASAI. “As an artist, teacher and entrepreneur, Keely brings a versatile background and perspective to the organization. We look forward to seeing where she takes us, and our members, in the years ahead.”\nSince 2010, Colcleugh has run Kilograph, one of Los Angeles’ leading visual communications and VR/AR technology studios. She draws on over 20 years of experience in the fields of architecture, feature film visual effects, and communications design, which prior to starting her own company led to positions at Bruce Mau Design in Toronto, Canada, The Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), AMO, and Atelier Jean Nouvel in Paris. Colcleugh is also a frequent guest lecturer, whose history includes architectural speaking engagements at California State Polytechnic University, Woodbury University, the University of Kentucky, and USC School of Architecture.\nColcleugh will help the board raise awareness for its programs and benefits via direct outreach to the architectural community, including the students riding at the forefront of the industry’s next wave. Colcleugh will also judge student submissions for one of ASAI’s biggest events, the 33rd annual Architecture in Perspective contest, which presides over the most prestigious award in architectural illustration (the Hugh Ferriss Memorial Prize).\n“It’s exciting to join the board when so many passionate people are in the same place. As common practices like sketching, photography and 3D designs continue to blend with emerging technologies like VR and AR, there’s going to be an interesting story to tell about what illustrators are doing,” said Keely Colcleugh. “The ASAI is the perfect organization to help amplify that story, as our programs are geared to their particular needs and interests. I look forward to spreading the word.”\nThe American Society of Architectural Illustrators was founded in 1986 to represent the business and artistic interests of architectural illustrators throughout the world. Through events, meet-ups and lectures, ASAI helps foster communication among its members to raise the standards of the medium, and acquaint the broader public with the importance of this work. Membership is currently open to professional illustrators, architects, designers, teachers, students, and anyone engaged in the serious pursuit of architectural illustration.\nAbout Kilograph\nKilograph is a creative collective of architects, game developers and 3D artists based in LA. Through experiments in narrative, movement and aesthetics, Kilograph is cracking the code on how to make viewers deeply engage with a design.
