    "text": "February 24, 2018 / 6:34 AM / Updated an hour ago Olympics: Snowboarding - Galmarini upgrades to men's PGS gold in Pyeongchang Jack Tarrant 2 Min Read PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Switzerland’s Nevin Galmarini upgraded his silver medal from four years ago when he held off the challenge of South Korea’s Lee Sang-ho to win gold in the men’s snowboard parallel giant slalom on Saturday. Galmarini claimed victory by 0.43 seconds from local favorite Lee, who claimed his country’s first ever medal in a snowboard event, as Slovenia’s Zan Kosir defeated Sylvain Dufour of France in the small final to complete the podium. Slideshow (4 Images) Galmarini finished second to Russia’s Vic Wild in Sochi four years ago but the Swiss had enough in the tank this time to overcome a local rider when he defeated Lee in the final. Lee’s semi-final win over Kosir, guaranteeing the hosts a first ever Olympic snowboarding medal, was greeted by huge cheers from the crowd, who had turned up in huge numbers for the last day of action at Phoenix Snow Park. Kosir matched his bronze medal from Sochi with victory over Dufour, who struggled to maintain the speed that had carried him into the semi-finals. Reporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by John O'Brien",
