    "text": "PARIS, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The French government said on Monday it will back Renault boss Carlos Ghosn’s nominee for chief operating officer but wants an agreement to transform the Renault-Nissan alliance into an “integrated” automotive group.\nThe French state, Renault’s biggest shareholder, sees Chief Performance Officer Thierry Bollore’s promotion to second-in-command “in a positive light”, a finance ministry source told Reuters. But support for Ghosn’s own contract renewal may hinge on plans for a deeper tie-up with partner Nissan.\nThe ministry statement follows the surprise resignations of senior Renault director Thierry Desmarest and executive Stefan Mueller, days before a Feb. 15 board meeting at which Bollore’s appointment is expected to be discussed.\nThe departures came amid concerns raised by other independent board members about the recruitment process that led to the nomination of Bollore, a loyal Ghosn lieutenant, and the elimination of other internal and external candidates including Mueller, Reuters and Les Echos have reported.
