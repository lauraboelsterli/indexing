    "text": "William Karlsson scored his Western Conference leading 30th goal of the season to help lead the Vegas Golden Knights to a 4-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday night at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\nJonathan Marchessault, Ryan Carpenter and Erik Haula also scored goals, and David Perron added a pair of assists for the Golden Knights. Vegas became the first team in the Western Conference to reach 80 points this season.\nMarc-Andre Fleury finished with 28 saves for Vegas, which improved to 14-1-1 in games against Pacific Division opponents. It was the first win in three games against the Oilers for the Golden Knights, who improved to 21-4-2 at home.\nLeon Draisaitl scored a goal and Cam Talbot had 24 saves for Edmonton, which took its fifth straight loss. The Oilers have been outscored 25-14 during the losing streak.\nCarpenter, claimed off waivers from the San Jose Sharks on Dec. 13, gave Vegas a 1-0 lead at the 13:04 mark of the first period when he hammered in a rebound of a Deryk Engelland shot from the slot for his fourth goal in six games.\nMarchessault extended the lead to 2-0 at 4:18 of the second period, deflecting a wrist shot from the blue line by defenseman Nate Schmidt for his 21st goal of the season. Karlsson followed 8 1/2 minutes later, streaking in from the right wing on a power play and jamming a shot under Talbot’s left arm.\nHaula scored his 22nd goal early in the third period, redirecting a James Neal pass through Talbot’s pads. The puck caromed off Haula’s skate, but the goal was upheld after an Edmonton challenge when it was determined Haula didn’t intentionally kick at the puck.\nDraisaitl spoiled Fleury’s bid for his 47th career shutout when he one-timed a shot off a pass from Oscar Klefbom from the left side of the net with 7:29 to go. It was Draisaitl’s 17th goal of the season and third in three games.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
