    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey still has diplomatic relations with the Netherlands, Turkish Government Spokesman Bekir Bozdag said on Monday, after the Dutch government said it had formally withdrawn its ambassador to Ankara over a dispute in 2017.\n“This does not mean that diplomatic ties between Turkey and the Netherlands are cut off... There are charges d‘affaires carrying out the relations between the two countries,” Bozdag told reporters after a cabinet meeting.\nHe said he hoped the issue would be resolved soon.\nThe two governments originally fell out over the Netherlands’ decision to bar Turkish officials from campaigning among the Turkish diaspora in the Netherlands in favor of Turkey’s constitutional referendum last April -- at the exact time the Netherlands was holding its own national elections.\nReporting by Ece Toksabay and Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ",
