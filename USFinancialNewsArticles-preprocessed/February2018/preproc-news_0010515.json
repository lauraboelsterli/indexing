    "text": "Edward Middleton Joins Firm as a Managing Director in Hong Kong\nHONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI), the global investment bank, today announced that Edward Middleton has joined the firm as a Managing Director and Co-Head of Financial Restructuring, Asia alongside Brandon Gale. He is based in Hong Kong.\nMr. Middleton enjoys an excellent reputation in the international restructuring community, having been a partner at KPMG, where for 10 years he was Head of its Restructuring Services practice in China and the Asia-Pacific region. In this role, Mr. Middleton oversaw formal insolvency and regulatory appointments, out-of-court financial restructuring, crisis management appointments, and operational turnarounds for stressed and distressed assets. Mr. Middleton has spent more than 20 years in Asia, and his experience spans nearly every major industry sector, including banking and financial services, securities, energy and natural resources, transport and distribution, construction, hotels and leisure, electronics, manufacturing, technology, retail, and luxury goods. He began his restructuring career in the U.K. in 1989.\n“We are looking to selectively expand our restructuring teams in Hong Kong and Singapore in line with growth in the Asian debt capital markets and with a focus on developing expertise outside our core market segment,” said Joseph Swanson, Senior Managing Director and Co-Head of Houlihan Lokey’s European Financial Restructuring Group, who also oversees the firm’s Financial Restructuring business in Asia. “As a practice leader with an outstanding track record of advising on nearly every type of restructuring engagement, Eddie is the perfect candidate to join our team in Hong Kong. I’m confident he will be tremendously beneficial both to our clients and to Houlihan Lokey’s continued growth in the region,” he continued.\n“With a decades-long reputation as a global leader in financial restructuring and recent expansion of its Financial Restructuring efforts in Sydney and Dubai, Houlihan Lokey is an incredibly exciting opportunity for me. I look forward to partnering with Brandon and leveraging my experience, relationships, and expertise to provide our clients with the superior advice and solutions they have come to expect,” said Mr. Middleton.\nMr. Middleton holds a B.A. in Economics & Politics from the University of Manchester. He is a fellow of INSOL International and a member of the International Insolvency Institute, as well as holds fellowship status of both the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\nHoulihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) is a global investment bank with expertise in mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, financial restructuring, valuation, and strategic consulting. The firm serves corporations, institutions, and governments worldwide with offices in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.
