    "text": " 08 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Rugby-England rack up seven tries in emphatic win over Italy Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nROME, Feb 4 (Reuters) - England scored seven tries on the way to an emphatic 46-15 win away to Italy as they began the defence of their Six Nations title in style on Sunday. \nWinger Anthony Watson got England off to a flying start with two early tries and number eight Sam Simmonds also bagged two. Owen Farrell, George Ford and Jack Nowell added one apiece and Farrell kicked four conversions and a penalty. \nDespite the scoreline, Italy, who took the wooden spoon in the last two years, were refreshingly positive and replied with two tries of their own from Tommaso Benvenuti and Mattia Bellini with Tommaso Allan kicking a conversion and penalty. \nEngland lost scrumhalf Ben Youngs in the first half when he suffered a knee injury.
