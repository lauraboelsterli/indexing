    "text": "EVANSVILLE, Ind., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Escalade, Incorporated (NASDAQ: ESCA) - \"We finished 2017 with a solid fourth quarter. With revenue up 4%, gross margins improved by 280 bps, and operating income increased by 36%,\" stated Dave Fetherman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Escalade, Inc. \"I could not be more proud of the Escalade team, as we have shown the ability to stay ahead of the changing retail market, with the evolution from brick and mortar to ecommerce.
