    "text": "HONG KONG, Feb 23 (IFR) - Asian credits were firmer on Friday as the spike in U.S. Treasury yields took a breather after St Louis Fed President James Bullard warned that a “bunch of hikes” could turn Fed policy restrictive.\nInvestment-grade credits in general tightened by 1bp-2bp, with long-dated bonds from the financial leasing and TMT sectors seeing strong buying interest, a Hong Kong-based trader said.\nLong-dated bonds from ICBC Leasing and CCB Leasing, which were heavily sold off in the weeks preceding Lunar New Year, have tightened 8bp-9bp since the start of this week.\n“The stabilisation of US Treasury yields, at least in the short-term, has boosted market sentiment,” the trader said.\nThe iTraxx Asia ex-Japan investment-grade index tightened marginally at 69.7bp/70.8bp.\nNew issues priced overnight generally traded well.\nIndonesia’s US$1.25bn 3.75% 5-year Green sukuk and US$1.75bn 10-year 4.40% sukuk, both priced at par, were Quote: d slightly above par at 100.10.\nThe Green sukuk is the world’s first Islamic Green bond from a sovereign issuer.\nRedco Properties’ US$300m 364-day notes, priced at par to yield 6.375%, traded up to 100.30/100.35.\nFar East Horizon’s 4.375% US$200m 5-year dollar bonds, priced at 99.827 to yield 4.414%, or Treasuries plus 175bp, were hovering at reoffer.\nIts Rmb630m (US$99.4m) 3-year Dim Sum bonds, priced at par to yield 4.90%, were Quote: d at 100.10/100.15.\nBank of East Asia’s bonds traded up slightly after the Hong Kong-based lender reported significantly improved 2017 annual results.\nNomura said BEA’s strong results demonstrated that much of its China-related woes are now behind it and that it would overweigh the bank’s 5.5% AT1s and maintain a small overweight position on its 4% T2s.
