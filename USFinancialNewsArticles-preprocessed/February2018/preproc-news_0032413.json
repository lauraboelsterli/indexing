    "text": "- David J. Galluzzo and Steven D. Roth Join the Firm as Partners, Dr. Irving Feit as Of Counsel, Bringing Practical Scientific and Engineering Experience to the Firm’s Growing Intellectual Property Litigation Practice -\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- David J. Galluzzo and Steven D. Roth have joined Lucas & Mercanti, LLP, a boutique intellectual property law firm based in New York City, as partners. Irv Feit, Ph.D., has joined as Of Counsel. The exciting expansion speaks directly to their growing pharmaceutical litigation practice.\n“We are delighted to bring on board three extremely talented individuals who bring unique experience to our firm,” says Michael Mercanti, Senior Partner. “The industry is shifting. Clients want big law experience without paying the price big law demands. These attorneys can challenge the biggest firms,” he says. “In addition to their trial experience, they have decades of in-house experience.” David was a research scientist at Pfizer, Steven was general counsel at Hi-Tech Pharmacal, and Irv was a vice president at ImClone Systems.\n“This practical corporate experience provides perspective that most lawyers do not have,” adds Mercanti. “The ability to switch hats between scientists, in house personnel and litigators enables us to understand our clients’ legal and business issues from their viewpoints. It is truly a powerful combination of skills allowing us to efficiently perform at the highest level.”\nDavid Galluzzo joined the firm as a partner in January. He is a trial and transactional attorney whose legal, business, and scientific careers span two decades. David’s diverse practice includes representing both branded and generic pharmaceutical companies in Hatch-Waxman and other patent infringement actions; representing clients in Inter Partes Review (IPR) proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board; drafting trademark and patent applications; and providing freedom-to-operate, invalidity and non-infringement opinions. David’s clients include those in the fields of data science, arts and entertainment, and manufacturing.\nGalluzzo is also the author of legal treatise \" Qualifying and Attacking Expert Witnesses ”. Before his legal career, David was a research scientist at Pfizer, Inc. where he synthesized pharmaceutical compounds for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.\nSteven Roth joined as a partner in February. His practice focuses on patent litigation and prosecution in the pharmaceutical, biotech, chemical and mechanical arts. Previously he was Associate General Counsel and sole in-house attorney at Hi-Tech Pharmacal where he oversaw and participated in the company’s lawsuits and pre-suit investigations, including patent, trademark, class action, fraud, and contract litigation. Steve was also responsible for regulatory compliance.\nRoth has considerable trial experience, particularly in patent cases. He has litigated multiple cases for Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, Hi-Tech/ Akorn, winning multiple favorable judgments or settlements. Prior to law school, Mr. Roth was a software engineer in the Aerospace industry at Singer-Kearfott.\nIrv Feit, Ph.D. joined the firm as Of Counsel in January. He specializes in chemical and biotech patent law, including drafting and prosecuting patent applications; post-patent procedures; providing opinions in matters relating to portfolio strength, infringement, and validity for a variety of large and small chemical and biotechnology companies, as well as for investment bankers. He also has extensive experience negotiating and drafting patent licenses and related agreements. He has appeared as an expert witness during litigation.\nFeit has served as in-house counsel Lever Brothers, Ciba-Geigy Corporation, and was Vice President for Intellectual Property and Licensing at ImClone Systems. He has a Ph.D. in organic chemistry, and was among the first biotechnology patent practitioners in the United States. Before attending law school, he was a research fellow at the University of California and Associate Professor of Chemistry at LIU – Post. He is the author or co-author of ten peer-reviewed papers in organic chemistry and gave numerous presentations at professional chemistry conferences.\nAbout Lucas & Mercanti, LLP\nLucas & Mercanti, LLP is a boutique intellectual property law firm based in New York City.
