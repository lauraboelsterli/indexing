Two-times grand slam winner Muguruza, who defeated Venus Williams to claim her maiden Wimbledon title, will join British number one Johanna Konta and twice Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in the field at Edgbaston Priory Club. “Winning my first Wimbledon title was so special and I can’t wait to play in front of British crowds again,” the world number three, who reached the semifinals in Birmingham last year, said in a statement. Kvitova is the defending champion at the WTA Premier tournament, which will be played from June 16-24. The event precedes the Eastbourne International, which is a last chance for players to fine-tune their grasscourt game before Wimbledon.
