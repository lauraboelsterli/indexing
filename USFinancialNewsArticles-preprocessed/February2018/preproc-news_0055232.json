Excluding these effects on EBITDA, the Net Debt/EBITDA ratio came to 2.6x (2.5x in proforma figures) in December 2017.\nConference Calls/Webcast\nAccess to the conference calls/webcasts:\nConference call in Portuguese:\nFriday, February 23, 2018\n11:00 a.m. São Paulo / 09:00 a.m. New York\nParticipants calling from Brazil: (11) 3193-1001 or (11) 2820-4001\nAccess code: CCR\nReplay: (11) 3193-1012 or (11) 2820-4012\nCode: 2211008#\nConference call in English:\nFriday, February 23, 2018\n12:00 p.m. São Paulo / 10:00 a.m. New York\nParticipants calling from Brazil: (55 11) 3193-1001 or (55 11) 2820-4001\nParticipants calling from the United States: 1-800-492-3904 or (+1) 646 828-8246\nAccess code: CCR\nReplay: (11) 3193-1012 or (11) 2820-4012\nCode: 6282781#\nThe instructions to participate in these events are available on CCR's website: www.ccr.com.br/ir .\nIR Contacts\nMarcus Macedo (+55 11) 3048-5941\nFlávia Godoy: (+55 11) 3048-5955\nDaniel Kuratomi: (+55 11) 3048-6353\nMarcela Dias (+55 11) 3048-2108\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ccr---results-for-the-4th-quarter-of-2017-300603164.html\nSOURCE CCR S.A.",
