    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose to more than three-week highs on Monday, with major indexes rising over 1 percent, as a decline in Treasury debt yields assuaged investorsâ€™ concerns about rising interest rates and refocused attention on economic growth.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 399.01 points, or 1.58 percent, to 25,709, the S&P 500 gained 32.3 points, or 1.18 percent, to 2,779.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 84.07 points, or 1.15 percent, to 7,421.46.
