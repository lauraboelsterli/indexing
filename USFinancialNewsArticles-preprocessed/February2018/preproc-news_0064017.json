    "text": "ORLEANS, France (Reuters) - U.S company Tupperware ( TUP.N ) has decided to shut down a French factory employing 235 staff, unions said on Wednesday, highlighting challenges faced by the French government over tackling unemployment even as the countryâ€™s economy improves.\nThe factory being closed down is located at Joue-les-Tours, a town toward the west of France, south of Paris.\nBoosted by low interest rates, a global economic rebound and high business confidence, France has only in the last year managed to emerge from a decade of low growth and weak job creation that has left nearly 3.5 million people out of work.\nLast month, Tupperware took a big charge in its fourth quarter that wiped out profits and forecast weak demand in the current quarter, causing its shares to slump.\nReporting by Mourad Guichard; Writing by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by John Irish\n ",
