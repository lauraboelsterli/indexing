    "text": "LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Britain’s government is ready to push for a mutual recognition system to regulate financial services after it leaves the EU in order to preserve the City of London’s access to the bloc, the Financial Times reported on Friday.\nUnder the proposal, Britain and the European Union would recognise each other’s regulatory and supervisory regimes, an option long favoured by the financial services industry, the FT said.\nBritish finance minister Philip Hammond was expected to back the proposal in a speech in coming days.\nNo one was immediately available to comment at the ministry.\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney has previously said Britain and the EU should adopt a system of mutual recognition or run the risk of a damaging hit to financial services across Europe.\nA dispute resolution mechanism would be part of the plan, the FT said.\nSuch a proposal is likely to be challenged by the European Commission which has said Britain cannot pick and choose which parts of the EU’s single market it can retain.
