    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French tire maker Michelin ( MICP.PA ) reported higher profits for 2017 while warning of a likely hit from foreign exchange movements.\nNet income rose 1.6 percent last year to 1.693 billion euros (1.52 billion pounds), the company said on Monday. Analysts polled by Inquiry Financial for Reuters had given a median net income forecast of 1.67 billion euros.\nMichelin said foreign exchange movements - based on January 2018 rates - would reduce its annual operating income from recurring activities by about 300 million euros.\nThe French company added it would raise prices to offset higher raw material costs.\nEarlier this month, Goodyear ( GT.O ) cut its 2020 forecast for combined earnings of its three units amid higher prices for raw materials, overshadowing better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.\nMichelin said it would consider further acquisitions, and on Monday announced the purchase of a 20 percent stake in German automotive services provider ATU.\nReporting by Gilles Guillaume and Sudip Kar-GuptaEditing by Laurence Frost\n ",
