    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nHIGHLIGHTS\nCompany achieved fourth-quarter global box office of $278 million, up 13% over the prior year. IMAX domestic box office increased 17% in the second half of 2017, compared to an industry decline of 6%. Installed 165 new IMAX® theater systems during 2017, bringing the Company's total commercial multiplex network to 1,272 theaters, 68% of which are in international markets. Company signed agreements for 170 new theater systems in 2017, resulting in year-end backlog of 494 new systems, plus five upgrades. SG&A, excluding stock-based compensation, was down 5% year-over-year to $90 million, following the Company's cost-reduction initiative. Over the four-day Presidents' Day and Chinese New Year weekend, the Company achieved record February box office of $53 million, led by the release of Marvel Studios' Black Panther and three local-language titles released in China.\nIMAX Corporation (NYSE:IMAX) today reported fourth-quarter 2017 revenue of $125.6 million and net income attributable to common shareholders of $4.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, which includes a one-time tax charge of $9.3 million ($0.14 per diluted share) associated with the recent U.S. tax reform and a $2.5 million ($0.04 per diluted share) charge associated with the Company's cost reduction exercise announced in June. Full-year 2017 revenue was $380.8 million and net income attributable to common shareholders was $2.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, which includes the one-time tax charge of $9.3 million ($0.14 per diluted share) and total restructuring charge of $16.2 million ($0.25 per diluted share).\nAdjusted net income attributable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter was $21.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. Full-year 2017 adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders was $40.5 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. For reconciliations of reported results to non-GAAP financial results, and for the definition and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility, please see the end of this press release.\n\"We saw tangible improvements to box office performance and operating leverage in the second half last year, largely the result of our implementing several initiatives aimed at refining our programming strategy and containing costs,\" said Richard L. Gelfond, IMAX CEO. \"IMAX domestic box office increased 17% in the second half, compared to an exhibitor industry decline of 6%. In international markets, we grew box office 14% over the same period. We believe this underscores the IMAX consumer value proposition for compelling content and highlights the importance of analyzing our results separately from the overall industry's. Moreover, our growing international presence in markets such as Japan—a market that housed our single strongest-performing theater last year—continued to contribute meaningfully to our overall results.\"\nFourth-Quarter 2017 Results\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, IMAX incurred a discrete tax expense of $9.3 million, related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Dec. 22, 2017. This non-recurring charge relates to the provisional re-measurement and write-down of the Company's U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, given the changes enacted by the Tax Act.\nNetwork Update\nDuring the quarter, the Company installed 70 theaters, of which 69 were for new theater locations and one was an upgrade. The total IMAX theater network consisted of 1,370 systems as of Dec. 31, 2017, of which 1,272 were in commercial multiplexes. There were 499 theaters in backlog as of Dec. 31, 2017, compared to the 498 in backlog as of Dec. 31, 2016.\nIMAX signed contracts for 23 new theaters across 12 countries in the fourth quarter of 2017. For a breakdown of theater system signings, installations, network and backlog by type for the fourth quarter of 2017, please see the end of this press release.\nBox Office Update\nGross box office from IMAX DMR® films increased by 13% to $278.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $246.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in higher DMR revenues. Gross box office per-screen for the fourth quarter of 2017 averaged $227,000 in comparison to $233,300 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross box office was generated primarily by the exhibition of 45 films (20 new and 25 carryovers), as compared to 24 films (17 new and 7 carryovers) exhibited in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPlease reference the chart below for a breakout of box office and per-screen averages on a regional basis:\nBox Office (M's)\nPer Screen Average (000's)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nGlobal\n$ 278.1\n$ 246.5\n$ 227.0\n$ 233.3\nDomestic\n116.9\n101.0\n286.1\n255.4\nGreater China\n63.3\n60.0\n131.1\n168.4\nOther Intl.\n97.9\n85.5\n290.2\n280.5\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nGlobal\n$ 976.5\n$ 965.7\n$ 838.4\n$ 963.8\nDomestic\n357.8\n368.5\n883.4\n934.9\nGreater China\n290.8\n295.7\n666.1\n932.3\nOther Intl.\n327.9\n301.5\n1,014.7\n1,037.2\nFourth-Quarter Segment Results\nNetwork Business\nNetwork business revenue was $53.8 million in the quarter, compared with $47.6 million in the prior-year period.

The Company expects to install approximately 145 new IMAX theater systems in 2018.\nFourth-Quarter Consolidated Results\nThe gross margin across all segments in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $60.1 million, or 48.0% of total revenue, compared to $55.3 million, or 51.7% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating expenses (which include SG&A and R&D, and exclude stock-based compensation) were $27.3 million in the quarter, down 5% compared to $28.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull-Year 2017 Results\nFull-year 2017 revenue was $380.8 million as compared to 2016 revenue of $377.3 million. Reported net income attributable to common shareholders was $2.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, as compared to $28.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share in 2016. Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders was $40.5 million as compared to $50.0 million in 2016, or $0.62 per diluted share as compared to $0.73 per diluted share in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA per the Credit Facility, excluding the Company's investment in the television series Marvel's Inhumans, was $126.2 million in 2017 as compared to $121.9 million in 2016.

Continuing to build upon the Company's record signings momentum from 2016, IMAX signed contracts for 177 theaters in 2017, across 35 countries, resulting in 499 theater systems in backlog as of Dec. 31, 2017, compared to 498 theater systems in backlog as of Dec. 31, 2016. The Company's top three markets for signings during 2017 were China, Germany and India. For a breakdown of theater system signings, installations, network and backlog by type, please see the end of this press release.\n\"As we look to 2018, our primary focus is on expanding the earnings power of our core business,\" said Gelfond. \"We believe the combination of the initiatives we implemented last year, coupled with a growing international presence and reduced spend on non-core businesses and R&D, should help facilitate operating leverage in the future. Our overarching efforts this year are aimed at growing the network, controlling costs and generating more box office across our theaters. And I am pleased to say that 2018 is off to a solid start. We recently achieved record box office in February, led by Black Panther, which did $35 million in IMAX box office over the four-day opening weekend. In China, we exhibited three local-language titles during the Chinese New Year period and grew box office 60%, compared to the prior years' holiday.\"\nSupplemental Materials\nFor more information about the Company's results, please refer to the IMAX Investor Relations website located at investors.imax.com .\nInvestor Relations Website and Social Media\nOn a weekly basis, the Company posts quarter-to-date box office results on the IMAX Investor Relations website located at www.imax.com/content/investor-relations .

In addition, the Company presents adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders per diluted share because it believes that they are important supplemental measures of its comparable financial results. Without the presentation of these adjusted presentation measures the Company believes it could potentially distort the analysis of trends in business performance, and it wants to ensure that its investors fully understand the impact of net income attributable to non-controlling interests, its stock-based and non-recurring charges in determining net income attributable to common shareholders. Management uses these measures to review operating performance on a comparable basis from period to period. However, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders per diluted share should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income and net income attributable to common shareholders and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company is required to maintain a minimum level of \"EBITDA\", as such term is defined in the Company's credit agreement (and which is referred to herein as \"Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility\" or \"Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility excluding Marvel's Inhumans\", as the credit agreement includes additional adjustments beyond interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility and Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility excluding \"Marvel's Inhumans\" (each as defined below) should not be construed as substitutes for net income, operating income or other operating performance measures that are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility and Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility excluding Marvel's Inhumans are relevant and useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the Company's industry.\nQuarter Ended\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2017\n(1)\nDecember 31, 2016\n(In thousands of U.S. Dollars)\nNet income\n$\n8,698\n$\n12,518\n$\n39,320\nAdd (subtract):\nProvision for income taxes\n15,905\n16,790\n16,212\nInterest expense, net of interest income\n258\n915\n315\nDepreciation and amortization, including film asset amortization\n26,900\n66,245\n45,953\nEBITDA\n51,761\n96,468\n101,800\nExit costs, restructuring charges and associated impairments\n2,479\n16,174\nStock and other non-cash compensation\n4,802\n23,718\n31,586\nWrite-downs, net of recoveries including asset impairments and\nreceivable provisions\n3,948\n24,015\n5,940\n(Gain) loss from equity accounted investments\n(134)\n703\n2,321\nAdjusted EBITDA before non-controlling interests\n62,856\n161,078\n141,647\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests (2)\n(7,055)\n(22,927)\n(19,743)\nAdjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility\n$\n55,801\n$\n138,151*\n$\n121,904\nAdjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility, excluding impact from \"Marvel's Inhumans\"\n$\n42,361\n$\n126,158*\n$\n121,904\nAdjusted revenues attributable to common shareholders (3)\n$\n113,285\n$\n340,460\n$\n339,868\nAdjusted EBITDA margin, excluding impact from \"Marvel's Inhumans\"\n37.4\n%\n37.1\n%\n35.9\n%\n*\nAdjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility of $138.2 million includes the impact of the Company's investment in \"Marvel's Inhumans\", which resulted in a $13.0 million loss. However, as permitted by the Credit Facility, this loss was offset by addbacks of $13.3 million and $11.7 million for amortization and impairment charges, respectively, relating to the investment, the net effect of which was to increase Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility by $12.0 million. This investment represents the Company's first foray into a commercial television property, and therefore the Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility metric presented above may not be reflective of the Company's typical operational activity. Further, the Company does not yet know whether it will make similar investments in the future. As a result, the Company is also presenting Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility excluding the impact of \"Marvel's Inhumans\" to better facilitate comparisons to prior and future periods.",
