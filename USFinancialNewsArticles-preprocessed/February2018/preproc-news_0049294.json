    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Envestnet (NYSE:ENV), a leading provider of intelligent systems for wealth management and financial wellness, today reported financial results for its quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended Key Financial Metrics (unaudited)\nDecember 31, % December 31, % (in millions except per share data) 2017\n2016 Change 2017 2016 Change GAAP: Total Revenues $ 182.9 $ 155.5 18 % $ 683.7 $ 578.2 18 % Net Income (Loss) 17.6 (32.6 ) n/m (3.3 )\n(55.6 ) (94 %) Net Income (loss) per Diluted Share $ 0.38 $ (0.75 ) n/m $ (0.08 ) $ (1.30 ) (94 %) Non-GAAP: Adjusted Revenues (1) $ 182.9 $ 156.0 17 % $ 683.8 $ 579.4 18 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) 38.7 30.4 27 % 128.9 99.4 30 % Adjusted Net Income (1) 18.7 14.2 32 % 60.6 43.6 39 % Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share (1) $ 0.40 $ 0.32 25 % $ 1.31 $ 0.98 34 %\nn/m – Not meaningful\n“The fourth quarter completed a year of solid organic growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and earnings for Envestnet, driven by strong execution and a healthy market environment,” said Jud Bergman, Chairman and CEO. “As we begin 2018, we are focused on integrating FolioDynamix’s customers and employees. And, we continue to pursue our advice- and data- centric strategy to drive adoption of our wealth management and financial wellness platforms.”\n“We see significant growth opportunities to establish Envestnet as the premier operating system for financial wellness, enabling better outcomes for a network of enterprises, advisors and clients,” concluded Mr. Bergman.\nFinancial Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2017 Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2016:\nTotal revenues increased 18% to $182.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $155.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. Asset-based revenues, which were 61% and 60% of total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively, increased 18% from the prior year period. Subscription and licensing revenues increased 17% from the prior year period.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7% to $170.2 million from $158.5 million in the prior year period. Cost of revenues increased 20% to $58.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $48.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Compensation and benefits increased 7% to $65.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $61.0 million for the prior year period. Compensation and benefits were 36% of total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 39% for the prior year period. General and administration expenses decreased 12% to $30.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $35.2 million for the prior year period. General and administrative expenses were 17% of total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 23% for the prior year period.\nIncome from operations was $12.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a loss of $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income attributable to Envestnet, Inc. was $17.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a loss of $32.6 million, or a loss of $0.75 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted Revenues (1) for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 17% to $182.9 million from $156.0 million for the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA (1) for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 27% to $38.7 million from $30.4 million for the prior year period. Adjusted Net Income (1) increased 32% for the fourth quarter of 2017 to $18.7 million from $14.2 million for the prior year period. Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share (1) for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 25% to $0.40 from $0.32 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe above results are unaudited and could change in connection with the completion of the audit of our full year financial statements.\nFolioDynamix Acquisition\nOn January 2, 2018, Envestnet (“the Company”) completed its acquisition of FolioDynamix. In connection with the acquisition, Envestnet paid $195 million in cash for all the outstanding shares of FolioDynamix, subject to certain closing and post-closing adjustments, using a combination of cash on the Company’s balance sheet and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. As a standalone firm, the FolioDynamix platform supported approximately 28,000 advisors, 3.2 million accounts and $899 billion in assets as of December 31, 2017. FolioDynamix’s expected contribution to Envestnet’s 2018 financial results is included in the Outlook section below.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nEffective January 1, 2018, Envestnet adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” using the modified retrospective method. The new rules impact the accounting for revenue, as well as the costs to obtain customer contracts. While most of the changes in revenue and expense recognition will be immaterial to Envestnet’s financial results, revenues and cost of revenues will be lower under the new rules, beginning in the first quarter of 2018, due to the treatment of certain third party fees. The expected financial impact from these changes in accounting principles is included in the Outlook section below.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law in the U.S. The provisions of the new tax law that are effective during 2017 do not have a material impact on Envestnet’s financial statements due to a valuation allowance on our U.S. temporary differences. From a cash tax perspective, we also do not anticipate a material impact as a result of the new tax law due to the use of foreign tax credits and net operating losses. For 2017, we will pay foreign income tax and in the U.S. alternative minimum tax and state income tax.\nFor purposes of calculating and reporting adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, we are reducing our estimated normalized effective tax rate from 40% to 27% beginning in 2018. This reflects the new 21% federal statutory rate and an incremental 6% for state taxes. The expected financial impact of this change in assumption is included in the Outlook section below.\nOutlook\nThe Company provided the following outlook for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and full year ending December 31, 2018. This outlook is based on the market value of assets on December 31, 2017. As noted above, it also includes the anticipated contribution from FolioDynamix, the change in accounting for certain revenues and expenses under ASU 2014-09, and a lower normalized effective tax rate.\nIn Millions Except Adjusted EPS 1Q 2018 FY 2018 GAAP: AUM/A revenue $118.0 - $120.0 - Subscription and licensing revenue 69.5 - 70.0 - Professional services and other revenue 4.5 - 5.0 - Revenues $192.0 - $195.0 $808.0\n- $823.0\nCost of revenues $63.0 - $64.5 - Net Income - - Diluted shares outstanding 47 - Net Income per Diluted Share - - Non-GAAP: Adjusted Revenues(1) $192.0\n- $195.0\n$808.0\n- $823.0\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) $30.5 - $31.5 $151.0 - $155.0 Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share(1) $0.36 $1.78 - $ 1.83 The above outlook for adjusted revenues is equal to GAAP revenues, as the Company currently expects immaterial deferred revenue fair value adjustments in 2018. The Company does not forecast net income and net income per share due to the unpredictable nature of various items adjusted for non-GAAP disclosure purposes, including the periodic GAAP income tax provision.\nAs noted above, various items have been incorporated into the Company’s outlook for 2018. Estimates of the impact on growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA are noted in the table below.\nApproximate Impact on Growth vs. 2017 Full Year 2018 Revenues Adjusted EBITDA Core Business 12-14% 15-17% Adoption of ASU 2014-09 (2-3%) - FolioDynamix 9-10% 5-6% Growth Initiatives - (2-3%) Guidance Range 18-20% 17-20% Conference Call\nEnvestnet will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2017 financial results today at 5:00 p.m. ET.

Under United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we record at fair value the acquired deferred revenue for contracts in effect at the time the entities were acquired. Consequently, revenue related to acquired entities for periods subsequent to the acquisition does not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been recorded by these entities had they remained stand-alone entities.\n“Adjusted EBITDA” represents net income (loss) before deferred revenue fair value adjustment, interest income, interest expense, accretion on contingent consideration and purchase liability, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization, non-cash compensation expense, restructuring charges and transaction costs, severance, fair market value adjustment on contingent consideration, litigation related expense, foreign currency and related hedging activity, other income, non-income tax expense adjustment, impairment of equity method investment, loss allocation from equity method investment and loss attributable to non-controlling interest.\n“Adjusted net income” represents net income (loss) before deferred revenue fair value adjustment, accretion on contingent consideration and purchase liability, non-cash interest expense, non-cash compensation expense, restructuring charges and transaction costs, severance, amortization of acquired intangibles, fair market value adjustment on contingent consideration, litigation related expense, foreign currency and related hedging activity, other income, non-income tax expense adjustment, impairment of equity method investment, loss allocation from equity method investment and loss attributable to non-controlling interest. Reconciling items are presented gross of tax, and a normalized tax rate is applied to the total of all reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net income.\n“Adjusted net income per diluted share” represents adjusted net income divided by the diluted number of weighted-average shares outstanding.\nSee reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 9-11 of this press release. Reconciliations are not provided for guidance on such measures as the Company is unable to predict the amounts to be adjusted, such as the GAAP tax provision. The Company’s Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be viewed as a substitute for revenues, net income or net income per share determined in accordance with GAAP.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe forward-looking statements made in this press release and its attachments concerning, among other things, Envestnet, Inc.’s expected financial performance and outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2018, its strategic operational plans and growth strategy are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
