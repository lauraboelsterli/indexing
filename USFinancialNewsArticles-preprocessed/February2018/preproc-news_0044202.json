    "text": "Published: Feb 21, 2018 11:32 a.m. ET Share \nStores to stay open during bankruptcy restructuring Getty Images/iStockphoto \nBy Katy Stech Ferek \nSupermarket chain Tops Markets LLC filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday, the latest regional grocery chain to look to restructure its balance sheet as consumers move to nontraditional food retailers. \nIn court papers, Chief Restructuring Officer Michael Buenzow said the 2007 purchase of the company and subsequent transactions by Morgan Stanley’s private equity arm “saddled the company with an unsustainable amount of debt on its balance sheet.” \nIn addition, he said the grocery store chain has also battled a Teamsters pension fund for more than four years over $180 million the union says Tops owes related to its purchase of a food wholesaler and a logistics business. \nThe company, which operates roughly 170 supermarkets in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont under the Tops banner, will stay open during the bankruptcy case, the company said. \nTops, based in Williamsville, N.Y., said it is “working cooperatively” with bondholders and is continuing constructive discussions. The company, which employs more than 14,000 people -- most of whom belong to unions -- has lined up $265 million in loans to fund its business during chapter 11.",
