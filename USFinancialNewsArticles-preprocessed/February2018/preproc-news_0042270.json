Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $216.5 million on sales of 2,985,115 tons of frac sand. This compares to $167.6 million of revenues on sales of 2,456,195 tons of frac sand in the third quarter of 2017. The limited partners' interest in net income was $43.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in $0.48 basic and $0.47 diluted earnings per limited partner unit.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $54.9 million, compared to $41.8 million for the third quarter of 2017. EBITDA adjusted for earnings from equity method investments and a loss on extinguishment of debt (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") was $59.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $41.7 million for the third quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow attributable to the limited partners for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $52.6 million compared to $37.5 million for the third quarter of 2017.\n\"Hi-Crush’s performance in the fourth quarter is the result of a year of strategic planning and focused execution,\" said Robert E. Rasmus, Chief Executive Officer of Hi-Crush. \"We acted quickly, proactively, and also took advantage of an improved environment in the frac sand space. From the first quarter, with our purchase of Whitehall and the development of our Permian Basin Kermit facility, to the fourth quarter, when we achieved full utilization at our Kermit facility, while placing into service our Pecos terminal and our tenth PropStream TM crew, our team worked tirelessly to get us where we are today. I am confident that with our asset base, personnel, and financial strength, we are best positioned for sustainable success in 2018 and over the long-term.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $216.5 million increased by 29% sequentially, driven by improvement in sales volumes, combined with generally higher pricing. Average sales price was $71 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $68 per ton in the third quarter of 2017 and $49 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016, as sales prices generally improved due to continued increases in frac sand demand in excess of available supply, particularly for fine mesh sand. Approximately 42% of sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2017 were sold at the mine, 43% of the volumes were sold at the terminals and 15% of the volumes were sold at the wellsite. Approximately 39% of sales volumes for the third quarter of 2017 were sold at the mine, 51% of the volumes were sold at the terminals and 10% of the volumes were sold at the wellsite. The percentage of volumes sold at each delivery point varies quarter to quarter due to customer mix; however, the percentage of volumes sold at the terminal or the wellsite is expected generally to increase over time as customers prefer landing sand closer to, or at, the wellsite.\nContribution margin was $23.46 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $19.39 per ton in the third quarter of 2017. The 21% improvement in contribution margin per ton was primarily the result of higher pricing as well as increased volumes sold from the Kermit facility.\nVolumes and contribution margin per ton for the fourth quarter of 2017 included temporary negative impacts from Class-1 rail issues and winter weather. These factors resulted in lower sales volumes in the final weeks of the fourth quarter of 2017 and extended into 2018. Weather issues impacting industry-wide completions activity abated in mid-January 2018, while rail issues impacting the industry remain ongoing, but continue to be addressed proactively by Hi-Crush. The Partnership expects these rail issues gradually to improve through the remainder of the quarter and be largely resolved by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Impacts to our customers in the Permian are somewhat mitigated by supply from the Kermit facility.\n\"During the fourth quarter, we benefited from continued growth in pricing and contribution margin, full utilization at our Permian Basin Kermit facility since mid-October, and ongoing strength in demand for Northern White frac sand, offset somewhat by operational issues experienced by Class-1 railroads,\" said Laura C. Fulton, Chief Financial Officer of Hi-Crush. \"Sales volumes grew by more than 20% sequentially, which, combined with pricing gains and per ton margin expansion, drove increases in our Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow by approximately 40%. Our strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017 was the direct result of successful execution of our Mine. Move. Manage. operating strategy. This includes a focus on efficient production across a diversity of mesh sizes and mine locations, and industry-leading logistics through our owned and operated terminal network, supplemented with our unique last mile capabilities.\"\nFull Year 2017 Results\nFor the full year 2017, the limited partners' interest in net income was $84.0 million, resulting in $0.97 basic and $0.96 diluted earnings per limited partner unit. EBITDA for the full year 2017 was $124.9 million, compared to $(52.1) million for the full year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 was $129.2 million, compared to $(18.4) million for the full year 2016. Distributable cash flow attributable to the limited partners for 2017 was $113.0 million.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $602.6 million on sales of 8,938,713 tons of frac sand, compared to revenues of $204.4 million on sales of 4,253,746 tons of frac sand for the year ended December 31, 2016. Contribution margin averaged $18.38 per ton for the full year 2017, compared to $3.79 per ton for the full year 2016. The volume increase for the full year 2017 compared to 2016 is a result of dramatically improved market conditions, in addition to increased production capacity availability following the resumption of operations at the Whitehall facility in March 2017 and commencement of operations at the Kermit facility in July 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, volumes sold at the mine were 38% and 46%, respectively, while volumes sold at the wellsite grew to 11% in 2017 from 1% in 2016.\nAverage sales price per ton was $67 and $48 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in average sales price experienced in 2017 was driven by changes in industry market conditions, including generally short supply of frac sand and increasing demand in 2017 compared to excess supply of frac sand with declining demand in 2016, and the resulting sales price trends, as well as the impact of the mix in pricing of volumes sold at the mine, at the terminal or at the wellsite.\nOperational Update\nHi-Crush commenced operations at its Permian Basin Kermit production facility in July 2017. Kermit completed its utilization ramp in mid-October 2017, achieving full utilization on its annualized run rate of 3.0 million tons per year. Kermit has contracted approximately 90% of its nameplate capacity under long-term, fixed-price arrangements with high-quality customers, including large E&P companies.\nIn October 2017, Hi-Crush commenced operations at its Pecos terminal, the industry’s first unit train capable terminal with silo storage in the Southern Delaware Basin. The facility includes 20,000 tons of vertical storage, is unit train capable and offers direct access to Class-1 rail.\nAt the end of 2017, Hi-Crush had 10 PropStream crews in the Permian Basin and Marcellus and Utica plays.\n\"We are proud to be the industry’s first mover in the Permian, expanding our service offerings to customers through the start-up of our Kermit facility and Pecos terminal, as well as growth in PropStream crews,\" said Mr. Rasmus. \"Since commencing operations at Kermit in July 2017, more than two months ahead of schedule, our team successfully and efficiently ramped production to full utilization in October, adding attractive contribution margin and representing 22% of our total volumes sold during the fourth quarter. Feedback on the industry’s first Permian sand from our Kermit facility has been positive. Our customers appreciate the value, quality, and effectiveness of the product we are delivering. Also, we are pleased to have completed our Pecos terminal, which complements our Kermit facility, and allows us to deliver Northern White volumes efficiently and cost-effectively to where they are most demanded.\n\"Our PropStream last mile logistics service adds safe and efficient wellsite delivery capabilities and further enhances the value and optionality we offer customers by controlling the supply chain from the mine to the blender hopper. The investments we have made to date, in addition to our plans for future growth and our expertise, will continue to benefit us throughout 2018 and over the long-term. Along with our leading portfolio of Northern White mines and our owned and operated terminals, we provide the full range of products and services that our customers desire, where and when they need them.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Expenditures\nIn December 2017, the Partnership entered into a new seven-year $200 million Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility (\"Term Loan\"), and a new five-year Revolving Credit Agreement. The new $200 million Term Loan replaces the Partnership’s previous $200 million Term Loan Credit Facility, extending maturity to December 2024. The new five-year $125 million Revolving Credit Agreement replaces the company’s previous $75 million revolving credit agreement, extending the maturity to December 2022. The new Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement provide the financial flexibility in return of capital, including unit repurchases, sought by the Partnership.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had $197.4 million of long-term debt outstanding, and was in compliance with the covenants defined in its Revolving Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, Hi-Crush had $110.0 million in cash and available capacity under its Revolving Credit Agreement.\nCapital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $122.0 million related to costs associated with the construction of the Kermit facility, the Pecos terminal facility, additional equipment to support PropStream growth, and overburden removal, among other projects.\nThe Partnership previously announced total capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be in the range of $35 to $45 million, related to continued investment in equipment for PropStream, normal maintenance capital expenditures, including overburden removal, and discretionary investments in logistics assets.\nDistribution and Unit Buyback Program\nOn January 17, 2018, Hi-Crush declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.20 per unit on all common units, or $0.80 on an annualized basis, for the fourth quarter of 2017. The distribution was paid on February 13, 2018 to unitholders of record on February 1, 2018. Hi-Crush expects to increase the quarterly cash distribution by approximately 10% per quarter for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic review and market conditions.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Hi-Crush repurchased 2,030,163 common units for a total cost of $20.0 million under the authorized $100 million unit buyback program. The Partnership's new Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement allow for unlimited repurchases of our common units, and the Partnership remains committed to executing up to the remaining $80 million of repurchases allowed under the program. The repurchase program does not obligate the Partnership to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of units and may be suspended, modified or discontinued by the Board of Directors at any time, in its sole discretion and without notice.\nOutlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Partnership expects total sales volumes to be 2.7 to 2.9 million tons. The sequential decline in forecasted volumes is the result of the temporary impacts from extreme winter weather and ongoing Class-1 railroad service issues. These issues have escalated in February, reflecting the broader challenges faced by the national rail network, which today are impacting all railroads and all sectors that transport goods by rail. The Partnership currently expects Class-1 railroad service to improve gradually through the remainder of the quarter and be largely resolved by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Pricing has continued to improve in the first quarter of 2018 and is expected to further increase over the coming months, driven by ongoing tightness in frac sand supply and demand, particularly for fine mesh sand.\n\"The successes Hi-Crush achieved in 2017 were the result of executing our plan and moving proactively, decisively and quickly as the industry evolved,\" said Mr. Rasmus. \"We set company records in volumes produced, and pushed pricing and margins consistently higher over the course of the year. Our execution, major project development and positioning over the last year reflect our successful anticipation of structural market shifts and serve as a springboard for growth and profitability in 2018 and beyond. We are engaged with our partners to help them resolve the Class-1 railroad issues, while actively working on other creative solutions to limit the impact on our customers and our business. Looking ahead, we expect frac sand demand to continue to rise throughout 2018, totaling approximately 100 million tons. This level of demand, coupled with potential ongoing bottlenecks and dislocations will amplify the importance of investments we have made in the production, logistics and last mile components of our service offering.\"\nConference Call\nOn Tuesday, February 20, 2018, Hi-Crush will hold a conference call for investors at 7:30 a.m. Central Time (8:30 a.m. Eastern Time) to discuss Hi-Crush’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.

The accompanying schedules of this news release provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").\nWe define EBITDA as net income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization and interest expense, net of interest income. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for any non-cash impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, earnings (loss) from equity method investments and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less cash paid for interest expense and maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, including accrual for reserve replacement, plus accretion of asset retirement obligations and non-cash unit-based compensation. We use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare cash generating performance of the Partnership from period to period and to compare the cash generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to our unitholders. Distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances. We define adjusted earnings per limited partner unit as earnings per limited partner unit, adjusted for the impact of non-recurring items.\nWe use contribution margin, which we define as total revenues less costs of goods sold excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization, to measure our financial and operating performance. Contribution margin excludes other operating expenses and income, including costs not directly associated with the operations of our business such as accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, sales and other administrative activities.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, adjusted earnings per limited partner unit and contribution margin are presented as management believes the data provides a measure of operating performance that is unaffected by historical cost basis and provides additional information and metrics relative to the performance of our business.\nAbout Hi-Crush\nHi-Crush is a premier provider of proppant and logistics solutions to the North American energy industry.
