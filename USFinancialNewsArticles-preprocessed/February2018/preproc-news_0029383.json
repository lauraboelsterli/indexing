(the \"Companies\") announce in compliance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation that they will implement an irrevocable, non-discretionary programme to repurchase their respective ordinary shares up to the value of £225 million in total between 15 February 2018 and 17 April 2018 (the \"Programme\").
