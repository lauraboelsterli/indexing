    "text": "TORONTO, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Sun Life Financial Inc. (\"Sun Life\") (TSX: SLF) (NYSE: SLF) announced today that it intends to purchase common shares for cancellation pursuant to a share repurchase program (the \"Program\"). The Program will form part of Sun Life's normal course issuer bid announced on August 9, 2017, which provides authorization for the purchase of up to 11,500,000 common shares during the 12-month period beginning on August 14, 2017 and ending on August 13, 2018 (the \"NCIB\").\nSun Life has entered into a program agreement (the \"Agreement\") with a third party to repurchase common shares through daily purchases that will take place between February 20, 2018 and the earlier of August 13, 2018 and the date on which Sun Life will have purchased 3,230,000 common shares from the third party under the Program. The purchases will be made pursuant to an issuer bid exemption order issued by the Ontario Securities Commission (the \"Order\"). The price that Sun Life will pay for any common shares purchased by it from the third party will be negotiated by Sun Life and the third party, and will be at a discount to the volume weighted average trading price of the common shares on the Canadian markets on the date of the purchase.\nSun Life currently intends to purchase the maximum of 3,230,000 common shares under the Program. However, the number of common shares actually purchased may be less than the Program maximum if, among other things, it is not possible to purchase common shares within the price range established by Sun Life during the term of the Program, if trading is suspended, or as a result of other market factors. A news release setting out the number of common shares acquired by Sun Life under the Program and the aggregate dollar amount paid for such common shares will be issued and filed immediately following the completion of the Program.\nPursuant to the terms of the Agreement and the Order, all common shares purchased by Sun Life from the third party will be cancelled. Sun Life will be prohibited from purchasing any other common shares during the term of the Program.\nForward-Looking Statements\nFrom time to time, Sun Life makes written or oral forward-looking statements within the meaning of certain securities laws, including the \"safe harbour\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities legislation.
