Their arrival follows a number of high-profile additions to the Firm’s private investment fund and real estate offerings globally, including private equity real estate partners Joanne Owen and Vikki McKay, real estate finance partner Paul Lucas in London, and private investments funds partner Monica Arora in New York.\n“We are delighted to welcome Don and Al to the Firm. Proskauer has been a trusted advisor to the real estate and private investment fund industries for decades, and we continue to develop our offering to meet the strategic needs of our clients,” said Jeffrey A.

He also has an expertise in incentive arrangements, co-investment transactions, spin-outs and all other matters related to the formation and operation of asset management businesses. In addition, he advises institutional investors and family offices in connection with both primary and secondary transactions across the asset class. He received his J.D. from Loyola Law School and his B.A. from the University of California, Irvine. He joins the Firm from O’Melveny & Myers. Mr. Stemp advises clients in a broad array of real estate transactions, including private equity funds, REITs, institutional capital sources and hospitality companies.
