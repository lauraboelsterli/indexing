(NYSE: MTW), a leading global manufacturer of cranes and lifting solutions, today reported fourth-quarter net sales of $481.5 million, diluted earnings per share (“DEPS”) on a GAAP basis of $0.97 and a loss of $(0.15) on an adjusted basis.\nFourth-quarter orders of $620.2 million increased 78% from the comparable period in 2016. Backlog totaled $606.6 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of 87%, from the prior year ending backlog of $323.8 million.\nFourth-quarter 2017 net sales were $481.5 million versus $378.2 million in the comparable period in 2016. The majority of the year-over-year increase was attributable to increased demand, primarily in the U.S. and European markets. More than 40% of unit revenue in the fourth-quarter came from new products introduced since becoming a stand-alone crane company.\nThe Company reported net income from continuing operations of $35.6 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in the fourth-quarter 2017 versus a net loss from continuing operations of $(32.0) million, or $(0.92) per diluted share, in the fourth-quarter 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss from continuing operations (1) was $(5.3) million, or $(0.15) per diluted share, in the fourth-quarter 2017 versus a net loss of $(32.6) million, or $(0.94) per diluted share, in the comparable period of 2016. GAAP net income benefited from discrete tax items in the period totaling $46.4 million or $1.28 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (1) for the fourth-quarter 2017 was $22.2 million compared to a loss of $(5.7) million in the same period last year.\nFull-year 2017 results included orders of $1,864.2 million, which was an increase of 32% year-over-year. Full-year revenue decreased $31.8 million year-over-year to $1,581.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $67.4 million, and represented a year-over-year increase of 313-basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin.\n“2017 was a pivotal year for Manitowoc. Despite a two percent decline in revenue vs the prior year, we delivered a 313-basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin, and operating cash flow improvement of over $200 million. Our net debt improved over $55 million vs prior-year due to prudent cash management. These results clearly demonstrate strong operational improvements in the core business through the continued implementation of the principles of The Manitowoc Way,” said Barry L. Pennypacker, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Manitowoc Company, Inc.\n“During the fourth-quarter of 2017, we saw an increase of 78% year-over-year in orders primarily driven by increasing customer sentiment in the North American market, coupled with continued market share gains in our key areas of focus. Looking ahead, as reflected in our guidance provided above, we expect profitability to continue to increase as we execute our strategic priorities,” concluded Pennypacker.\nFull-Year 2018 Guidance\n• Adjusted EBITDA - approximately $96 to $116 million;\n• Depreciation - approximately $39 million; and\n• Capital expenditures - approximately $25 to $30 million.\nThe Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as there is uncertainty in the timing and magnitude of future charges that would be included in the reported GAAP results.\nInvestor Conference Call\nOn Friday, February 9th, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. ET (9:00 a.m. CT), The Manitowoc Company’s senior management will discuss its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results and full-year 2018 outlook during a live conference call for security analysts and institutional investors. A live audio webcast of the call, along with the related presentation, can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of Manitowoc’s website at www.manitowoc.com . A replay of the conference call will also be available at the same location on the website.\nAbout The Manitowoc Company, Inc.\nFounded in 1902, The Manitowoc Company, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of cranes and lifting solutions with manufacturing, distribution, and service facilities in 20 countries. Manitowoc is recognized as one of the premier innovators and providers of crawler cranes, tower cranes, and mobile cranes for the heavy construction industry, which are complemented by a slate of industry-leading aftermarket product support services. In 2017, Manitowoc’s net sales totaled $1.6 billion, with over half generated outside the United States.\nFootnote\n(1) Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (“adjusted EBITDA”) are financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP numbers please see schedule of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release. Manitowoc believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends used in assessing its results of operations. Manitowoc believes excluding specified items provides a more meaningful comparison to the corresponding reporting periods and internal budgets and forecasts, assists investors in performing analysis that is consistent with financial models developed by investors and research analysts, provides management with a more relevant measure of operating performance and is more useful in assessing management performance.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release includes \"” ” intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
