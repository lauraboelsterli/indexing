    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- John S. Watson, retired chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Chevron Corporation, has been elected to the Cargill Board of Directors, effective today.\n\"We are delighted to welcome John to the Cargill board,\" said David MacLennan, Cargill's chairman and chief executive officer. \"John brings a wealth of experience from his long career at Chevron. He has a global perspective, with deep understandings of manufacturing economics, performance through technology, sectoral change and market volatility, geopolitical risk and more. John's knowledge and insights will be invaluable for Cargill and our board.\"\nWatson retired from Chevron and its board after a distinguished 37-year career at the company. Joining Chevron in 1980 as a financial analyst, he went on to hold financial, analytical and supervisory positions before being appointed president of Chevron Canada Limited in 1996. In 1998, he was named a corporate vice president with responsibility for strategic planning and mergers and acquisitions. In 2000, Watson led the integration following the Chevron-Texaco merger and became the company's chief financial officer. In 2005, he was elected president of Chevron's international exploration and production company, and, in 2008, elected executive vice president for strategy and development. Watson served as vice chairman of the board before being elected chairman and CEO in 2010. His retirement from the company and its board on Feb. 1 was announced by Chevron on Sept. 28, 2017.\nWatson earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural economics from the University of California, Davis in 1978 and a master's degree in business administration from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 1980. He now serves on the University of California, Davis Chancellor's Board of Advisors.\nWatson joins six other independent directors on Cargill's board: Richard H. Anderson, president and chief executive officer of Amtrak; Louis R. Chênevert, retired chairman and chief executive officer of United Technologies Corporation; Arthur D. Collins, Jr., retired chairman and chief executive officer of Medtronic, Inc.; Stephen Hemsley, executive chairman of UnitedHealth Group; Bernard Poussot, retired chairman, chief executive officer and president of Wyeth; and Trudy Rautio, retired president and chief executive officer of Carlson.\nCargill provides food, agriculture, financial and industrial products and services to the world. Together with farmers, customers, governments and communities, we help people thrive by applying our insights and 150 years of experience. We have 155,000 employees in 70 countries who are committed to feeding the world in a responsible way, reducing environmental impact and improving the communities where we live and work.
