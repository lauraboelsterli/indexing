    "text": "SAN MATEO, Calif., Feb. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Franklin Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE:BEN) announced a special cash dividend in the amount of $3.00 per share, along with a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.23 per share.\nThe recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly increased the Company’s financial strength and capital flexibility.\n“Given our strong balance sheet and projected financial performance, we believe it is appropriate to return capital in the form of a special cash dividend to our stockholders,” said Greg Johnson, Chairman and CEO of Franklin Resources, Inc. “This dividend is consistent with our long-term capital management policies and our commitment to our stockholders. We will continue to prudently invest in our business, actively pursue strategic and accretive acquisitions, buyback our stock when it makes economic sense, and distribute the rewards of those investments to our stockholders over time.”\nAs part of the capital management plan, today’s announcement of a $3.00 per share special dividend represents almost $1.7 billion based on 551.7 million shares outstanding as of January 23, 2018. The Company anticipates that remaining capital will be allocated to share repurchases, mergers and acquisitions, and retiring outstanding debt. In addition, the Company plans to make investments in people, research and development, and technology to enhance the performance of our core business of asset management. Management will have flexibility to thoughtfully execute the plan, and continue in the firm’s tradition of maximizing shareholder value.\nThe special and regular dividends are payable on April 12, 2018 to stockholders of record holding shares of common stock at the close of business on March 29, 2018. The quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share is equivalent to the dividend paid for the prior quarter and represents a 15% increase over the quarterly dividend paid for the same quarter last year.\nFranklin Resources, Inc. (NYSE:BEN) is a global investment management organization operating as Franklin Templeton Investments. Franklin Templeton Investments provides global and domestic investment management to retail, institutional and sovereign wealth clients in over 170 countries.
