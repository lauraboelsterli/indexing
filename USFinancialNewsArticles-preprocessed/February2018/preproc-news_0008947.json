If you're months away from an upgrade, or just don't really care enough to go out and spend money on a new iPhone, then follow these tips to keep things running as smoothly as possible.\nDon't update iOS Todd Haselton | CNBC Downloading iOS 11.2.5 Apple's going to chase us down for this one, but it's true. Apple adds new features to iOS, including often performance enhancements, but newer software can also put new strain on your processor. One of the biggest complaints I hear is that \"the new iOS slowed my phone down!\" If it ain't broke, don't fix it, just know that you might not have the latest security updates -- which is important to most folks.\nGet a new battery Getty Images An Apple store employee with a customer in Chicago. Older iPhones have aging battery packs that can't store a charge as well as they did when they were new. To fully refresh this, take your iPhone in and pay for a new battery. If you have an iPhone 6, iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, you can visit an Apple Store and swap out your battery for a new one for just $29, otherwise you can expect to pay about $79.\nFree up storage Todd Haselton | CNBC Get rid of unused apps automatically As iPhones become more powerful and powerful, the processors are able to handle much larger and complicated applications. Unfortunately, this means that apps that might have been small in size are now much larger. Free up storage and remove old apps and photos (consider using iCloud Photos, for example.)\nDo this by going to Settings > General and selecting iPhone Storage. Your iPhone will show you the largest apps, and you can delete the ones you no longer use. If you ignored step one and already installed iOS 11, select the option to automatically uninstall apps you don't use.\nClean your charging port Image source: Apple Apple's iPhone 5S I can't tell you how many times I've talked to people who have problems with charging only to find out that their charging port has lint in it. Double check that and use either a canned air duster or, gently, a pin or paperclip to clear out any dust build-up. Seriously -- be gentle -- you don't want to scratch any of the metal pins inside.",
