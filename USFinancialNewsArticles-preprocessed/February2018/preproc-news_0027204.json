    "text": " 14 AM / Updated 4 minutes ago UK wage pick-up bolsters case for rate rise - BoE's Vlieghe Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Signs that British wages are beginning to grow more quickly, along with ongoing global economic strength, have bolstered the case for higher interest rates, Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said on Monday. \nVlieghe said there was “increased evidence that tight labour markets are finally starting to have some upward effect on wages”. \nBritons’ greater willingness to borrow should also act as an indication to the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee that rates may need to go higher, he said during an event hosted by the Resolution Foundation think-tank. \nThe BoE said last week that interest rates were likely to need to rise somewhat faster and to a somewhat greater extent than it had previously thought.
