    "text": "Expands Gross Margin Sequentially to 35.9%; Ends Year with Record Revenue, Gross Profit and Cash Flow from Operations\nPLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Diodes Incorporated (Nasdaq: DIOD), a leading global manufacturer and supplier of high-quality application specific standard products within the broad discrete, logic, analog and mixed-signal semiconductor markets, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe impact on Diodes Incorporated of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, is estimated to be an approximately $46 million increase in GAAP tax expense, which has been excluded from the fourth quarter and full year 2017 non-GAAP results. The Company does not anticipate this increased tax expense, as a result of the tax law reform, will have a cash impact.\nYear 2017 Highlights\nRevenue grew to a record $1.05 billion, an increase of 11.9 percent over the $942.2 million in 2016 due to continued market share gains in all regions; GAAP gross profit was a record $356.8 million, compared to $286.9 million in 2016, and non-GAAP gross profit for 2017 was $359.5 million; GAAP gross margin improved 330 basis points to 33.8 percent from 30.5 percent in 2016, and non-GAAP gross margin for 2017 was 34.1 percent; GAAP net loss was ($1.8) million, or ($0.04) per diluted share, compared to net income of $15.9 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in 2016; Non-GAAP adjusted net income increased 80.1 percent to $69.1 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, compared to $38.4 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in 2016; Excluding $12.1 million, net of tax, non-cash share-based compensation expense, both GAAP net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income would have increased by $0.24 per diluted share; and Achieved $181.1 million cash flow from operations and $70.0 million free cash flow, including $111.2 million of capital expenditures, or 10.5 percent of revenue. Net cash flow was negative ($44.0) million, which includes the pay down of $159.9 million of long-term debt and $8.7 million for the stock buyback.\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nRevenue was $268.4 million, a decrease of 5.9 percent from the $285.2 million in the third quarter 2017 and an increase of 15.7 percent from the $232.1 million in the fourth quarter 2016; GAAP gross profit was a record $96.4 million, which compares to $96.3 million in the third quarter 2017 and $67.3 million in the fourth quarter 2016; GAAP gross profit margin was 35.9 percent, compared to 33.8 percent in the third quarter 2017 and 29.0 percent in the fourth quarter 2016; GAAP net loss was ($30.7) million, or ($0.62) per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the third quarter 2017 and net income of $1.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2016; Non-GAAP adjusted net income was $21.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $22.6 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the third quarter 2017 and $7.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2016; Excluding $3.0 million, net of tax, of non-cash share-based compensation expense, both GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have increased by $0.06 per diluted share; Repurchased 300,000 shares of common stock totaling approximately $8.7 million; and Achieved record cash flow from operations of $74.8 million, and $45.5 million free cash flow, including $29.3 million of capital expenditures. Net cash flow was a positive $2.6 million, which includes the pay down of $57.8 million of long-term debt.\nCommenting on the results, Dr. Keh-Shew Lu, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “2017 marked a milestone year for Diodes in which we reached our goal of achieving $1 billion in annual revenue combined with the achievement of record revenue and gross profit as well as increased market share. Our solid results reflect continued strength across all of our geographies and target end markets as well as growth from our Pericom products. In fact, we reached record revenue levels in our automotive, industrial and communications end markets, which served as the primary growth drivers in 2017.\n“We also ended the fourth quarter achieving a 210 basis point sequential increase in GAAP gross margin to 35.9%, demonstrating the ability to expand margins above our prior model of 35% and toward our next target of 40%. For the past several years, we have been highlighting our continued investment and focus on new products as well as process and packaging technologies to expand our customer content and gross margin opportunities. Today, we continue to accelerate the pace at which we are transitioning older generation products to new higher margin products that provide higher value to our customers.\n“With this achievement of $1 billion in annual revenue, we recently established our next long-term goal of $1 billion in gross profit. In support of this objective, we are increasingly focused on key end market opportunities that include automotive, industrial, high-end smartphones, IoT and high-end computing with our Pericom products. Further, we continue to expand market share with our higher value new products and remain committed to increasing profitability as we benefit from our solid operating leverage to drive earnings expansion and cash flow for the Company and our shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter 2017\nRevenue for fourth quarter 2017 was $268.4 million, a decrease of 5.9 percent from the $285.2 million in the third quarter 2017 and an increase of 15.7 percent from $232.1 million in fourth quarter 2016. Revenue in the quarter decreased sequentially reflecting typical seasonality and increased year-over-year due to continued strength across all of the Company’s geographies and target end markets.\nGAAP gross profit for the fourth quarter 2017 was $96.4 million, or 35.9 percent of revenue, compared to third quarter 2017 of $96.3 million, or 33.8 percent of revenue, and the fourth quarter 2016 of $67.3 million, or 29.0 percent of revenue. The 210 basis point sequential increase in gross profit margin was due primarily to continued improvements in product mix combined with strong margin contribution from the Pericom products as well as reduced impact from the closure of its wafer fabrication facility located in Lee’s Summit, MO (“KFAB”).\nGAAP operating expenses for fourth quarter 2017 were $72.9 million, or 27.2 percent of revenue, and $64.3 million, or 24.0 percent of revenue, on a non-GAAP basis, which excluded $4.7 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible asset expenses and $4.0 million for restructuring. GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter 2017 were $72.6 million, or 25.5 percent of revenue, and $63.9 million, or 22.4 percent of revenue, on a non-GAAP basis.\nFourth quarter 2017 GAAP net loss was ($30.7) million, or ($0.62) per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in third quarter 2017 and net income of $1.3 million, or $0.03 per share, in fourth quarter 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP adjusted net income was $21.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, which excluded, net of tax, $3.8 million of non-cash acquisition-related intangible asset amortization costs, $2.6 million of restructuring charges, as well as $45.9 million tax expense due to the new tax law reform impact. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $22.6 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in third quarter 2017 and $7.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2016.\nThe following is an unaudited summary reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income and per share data, net of tax (in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 GAAP net loss $ (30,651 ) GAAP diluted loss per share $ (0.62 ) Adjustments to reconcile net loss to non-GAAP net income: M&A Pericom 2,530 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n2,530 KFAB 2,554 Restructuring 2,619 Impairment of fixed assets (81 ) Loss on sale of assets 16 Others 47,177 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 1,269 Impact of Tax Cuts And Jobs Act 45,908 Non-GAAP net income $ 21,610 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.42 (See the reconciliation tables of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income near the end of this release for further details.)\nIncluded in fourth quarter 2017 GAAP net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income was approximately $3.0 million, net of tax, of non-cash share-based compensation expense. Excluding share-based compensation expense, both GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) and non-GAAP adjusted EPS would have increased by $0.06 per share for fourth quarter 2017, $0.06 for third quarter 2017 and $0.02 for fourth quarter 2016.\nEBITDA (a non-GAAP measure), which represents earnings before net interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, for fourth quarter 2017, was $47.0 million, compared to $46.8 million for third quarter 2017 and $29.2 million for fourth quarter 2016. For a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, see the table near the end of this release for further details.\nFor fourth quarter 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was a record $74.8 million. Net cash flow was a positive $2.6 million, including the $57.8 million long-term debt pay down and $8.7 million stock repurchase. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) was $45.5 million, which includes $29.3 million of capital expenditures.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $208.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, long-term debt (including the current portion) totaled approximately $268.1 million, and working capital was approximately $415.2 million.\nThe results announced today are preliminary, as they are subject to the Company finalizing its closing procedures and completion of the annual audit by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. As such, these results are subject to revision until the Company files its Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nDr. Lu concluded, “For the first quarter of 2018, we expect better than typical seasonal results due to continued strength in our target end markets. Revenue is expected to range between $261 million and $277 million, or down 2.8 percent to up 3.2 percent. At the midpoint, this is flat sequentially and represents a 13.8 percent increase year-over-year. We expect GAAP gross margin to be 36.0 percent, plus or minus 1 percent. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which are GAAP operating expenses adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, are expected to be approximately 23.2 percent of revenue, plus or minus 1 percent. We expect interest expense to be approximately $3.0 million. Our income tax rate is expected to be 31.0 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, and shares used to calculate diluted EPS for the first quarter are anticipated to be approximately 51 million.” Please note that purchase accounting adjustments of $3.8 million, after tax, for Pericom and previous acquisitions are not included in these non-GAAP estimates.\nConference Call\nDiodes will host a conference call on Wednesday, February 7, 2018 at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.

Excluding share-based compensation expense, both GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share would have improved by $0.18 per share. ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Company adjusts United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) net income and earnings per share attributable to common stockholders to provide investors a better depiction of the Company’s operating results, allow for a more accurate comparison between the Company’s current and historical operating results and provide a baseline for more informed modeling of future earnings. The Company makes adjustments for inventory acquired, transaction costs, retention costs, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring costs. The Company also excludes these items to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, develop budgets, determine incentive compensation awards and manage cash expenditure. The presentation of the above non-GAAP measures allows investors to review the Company’s results of operations from the same viewpoint as the Company’s management and Board of Directors. The Company has historically provided similar non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors an enhanced understanding of its operations, facilitate investors’ analyses and comparisons of its current and past results of operations and provide insight into the prospects of its future performance. The Company also believes the non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide additional information that research analysts use to evaluate semiconductor companies. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results and may differ from measures used by other companies. For example, we do not adjust for any amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest except for one-time non-cash items outside the course of ordinary business, such as impairment of goodwill . The Company recommends a review of net income on both a GAAP basis and non-GAAP basis be performed to get a comprehensive view of the Company’s results and provides a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income.\nDetail of non-GAAP adjustments\nRetention costs – The Company excluded costs related to employee retention in connection with the Pericom acquisition. Although these retention costs will be recurring every quarter until the final retention payment has been made, they are not part of the employees’ normal annual salaries and therefore are being excluded. The Company believes the exclusion of retention costs related to acquisitions provides investors with a more accurate reflection of costs likely to be incurred in the absence of an unusual event such as an acquisition and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods that may not reflect such costs.\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets – The Company excluded this item, including amortization of developed technologies and customer relationships. The fair value of the acquisition-related intangible assets, which was recognized through purchase accounting, is amortized using straight-line methods which approximate the proportion of future cash flows estimated to be generated each period over the estimated useful life of the applicable assets. The Company believes that exclusion of this item is appropriate because a significant portion of the purchase price for its acquisitions was allocated to the intangible assets that have short lives and exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both the Company’s newly acquired and long-held businesses. In addition, the Company excluded this item because there is significant variability and unpredictability among companies with respect to this expense.\nKFAB restructuring - The Company has recorded restructuring charges related to the shutdown and relocation of its wafer fabrication facility located in Lee’s Summit, MO (“KFAB”). These restructuring charges are excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the exclusion of the restructuring charges provides investors an enhanced view of the cost structure of the Company’s operations and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods that may not reflect such charges or may reflect different levels of such charges.\nKFAB shut-down related costs – The Company has recorded shut-down related costs due to the shutdown and relocation of KFAB. These shut-down related costs are excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the exclusion of the shut-down related costs provides investors with a more accurate reflection of the continuing operations of the Company and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods which may not reflect such costs.\nImpairment of fixed assets - The Company has recorded impairment charges related to the shutdown and relocation of KFAB. These impairment charges are excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the exclusion of the impairment charges provides investors with a more accurate reflection of the continuing operations of the Company and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods which may not reflect such costs.\nTax Cuts and Job Act – The Company has recorded increased tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Job Act (“TCJA”) law that was enacted during December 2017. The TCJA expense has been excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s current period operating performance in order to facilitate comparisons with previously presented periods that do not reflect such expense.\nCASH FLOW ITEMS\nFree cash flow (FCF) (Non-GAAP)\nFCF for the fourth quarter of 2017 is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations. For the fourth quarter of 2017, FCF was a $45.5 million ($74.8 million less $29.3 million). FCF represents the cash and cash equivalents that we are able to generate after taking into account cash outlays required to maintain or expand property, plant and equipment. FCF is important because it allows us to pursue opportunities to develop new products, make acquisitions and reduce debt.\nCONSOLIDATED RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO EBITDA\nEBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization. Management believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, such as financial institutions in extending credit, in evaluating companies in our industry and provides further clarity on our profitability. In addition, management uses EBITDA, along with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures, in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry. The calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing, operating in different income tax jurisdictions, and accounting effects of capital spending, including the impact of our asset base, which can differ depending on the book value of assets and the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income from operations and net income, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. For example, our EBITDA takes into account all net interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization without taking into account any amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest . Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in thousands, unaudited):\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income (per-GAAP) $ (30,651 ) $ 1,268 $ (1,805 ) $ 15,935 Plus: Interest expense, net 2,472 3,095 11,973 11,900 Income tax provision 50,674 617 62,325 6,558 Depreciation and amortization 24,485 24,229 95,680 98,960 EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 46,980 $ 29,209 $ 168,173 $ 133,353 DIODES INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 (unaudited) (audited) CURRENT ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ 203,820 $ 247,802 Short-term investments 4,558 29,842 Accounts receivable, net 200,112 217,217 Inventories 216,506 193,483 Prepaid expenses and other 37,328 44,438 Total current assets 662,324 732,782 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, net 459,169 401,988 DEFERRED INCOME TAXES 40,580 56,047 OTHER ASSETS Goodwill 134,187 129,412 Intangible assets, net 156,445 174,876 Other 35,968 33,447 Total assets $ 1,488,673 $ 1,528,552 CURRENT LIABILITIES Line of Credit $ 1,008 $ - Accounts payable 108,001 87,600 Accrued liabilities and other 99,301 71,562 Income tax payable 18,216 11,855 Current portion of long-term debt 20,636 14,356 Total current liabilities 247,162 185,373 LONG-TERM DEBT, net of current portion 247,492 413,126 DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES - non current 25,176 28,213 OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 94,925 81,373 Total liabilities 614,755 708,085 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES EQUITY Diodes Incorporated stockholders' equity Preferred stock - par value $1.00 per share; 1,000,000 shares authorized; no shares issued or outstanding — — Common stock - par value $0.66 2/3 per share; 70,000,000 shares authorized; 49,130,090 and 48,219,376, issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively 33,727 32,919 Additional paid-in capital 386,338 354,574 Retained earnings 532,687 530,215 Treasury stock, at cost, 1,457,206 and 1,157,206 shares held at December 31, 2017 and December 31,2016, respectively (37,768 ) (29,023 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (83,480 ) (112,666 ) Total Diodes Incorporated stockholders' equity 831,504 776,019 Noncontrolling interest 42,414 44,448 Total equity 873,918 820,467 Total liabilities and equity $ 1,488,673 $ 1,528,552\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006144/en/\nCompany Contact:\nDiodes Incorporated\nLaura Mehrl\nDirector of Investor Relations\nP: 972-987-3959\nE: laura_mehrl@diodes.com\nor\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nShelton Group\nLeanne Sievers\nPresident, Investor Relations\nP: 949-224-3874\nE: lsievers@sheltongroup.com\nSource: Diodes Incorporated",
