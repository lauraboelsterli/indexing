    "text": "JERSEY, Channel Islands, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quotient Limited (NASDAQ:QTNT), a commercial-stage diagnostics company, today announced the appointment of Franz Walt to its board of directors effective February 19, 2018\nMr. Walt joins Quotient’s board of directors with over 29 years of experience in leadership roles at two of the largest, most influential healthcare companies, Siemens Healthineers and Roche, and serves as an expert advisor on the in-vitro diagnostics industry to manufacturing companies and private equity firms. His career has focused on business turnaround and market expansion, emphasizing innovation, strategic alliances, quality and commercialization. In December 2017 Mr. Walt retired as President of Siemens Healthineers, Laboratory Diagnostics, where he served a President since 2014. While at Roche, Mr. Walt served 8 years as a member of the Roche Diagnostics Executive Committee. His executive positions included CEO at Roche Diagnostics GmbH in Mannheim, Germany and positions of increasing responsibility in pharma and IVD. Mr. Walt served as a board member of the AdvaMed DX industry association, where he actively contributed to shape healthcare policy in diagnostic testing to improve patient health. Mr. Walt holds an M.B.A. from the City University of Bellevue (Washington).\n“We are excited to have Franz join us during such a critical period as we work towards the commercial launch of MosaiQ,” said Paul Cowan, Quotient’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “His vast experience in leading laboratory diagnostic companies through periods of high growth, including the launch of major new diagnostics platforms, will be invaluable. This expertise will also be invaluable as we seek to broaden the diagnostics applications addressed by MosaiQ.”\n“I am excited to be joining the Board of Quotient at this important time in its progression towards the commercial launch of MosaiQ,” said Franz Walt. “For some time now I have been monitoring the progress of MosaiQ, which is clearly a ground-breaking technology that will deliver major work flow efficiencies to transfusion laboratories worldwide while improving patient care. I also believe MosaiQ has a very interesting future as a diagnostics platform beyond the field of transfusion diagnostics.”\nAbout Quotient Limited\nQuotient is a commercial-stage diagnostics company committed to reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care through the provision of innovative tests within established markets.
