This brings the total investment in Moltin to $10 million USD to date. The company also announced that former Demandware executive Jamus Driscoll has joined as CEO.\nDriscoll is an accomplished software executive with a 20-year track record of taking high-performing startup companies to market. Most recently, he held a number of executive roles at Demandware, a commerce platform company, including leading marketing, product management and business operations in the US and EMEA. He played an integral role in the company’s initial public offering in 2012 and $2.8 billion acquisition by Salesforce in 2016. Prior to Demandware, he held a variety of leadership roles at Oracle, ProfitLogic and Ascential Software.\nDriscoll joins Moltin co-founders Adam Sturrock, Chris Roach and Jamie Holdroyd. As developers, the founders recognized that ecommerce platforms, while optimized for traditional channels, often hinder a brand’s creative freedom due to the limitations of rigid templates, programming languages and steep learning curves. They built a microservices-based solution that provides organizations ultimate flexibility to take an experience-first approach to commerce, and gives developers the simplest, most powerful APIs available. Moltin has a rapidly growing community of more than 17,000 developers, and is used to power some of the most distinctive commerce experiences in the retail industry.\n“The future of commerce is where brand inspiration and consumer transactions meet,” said Driscoll. “Moltin has cracked the code on a true, API-first solution that allows brand owners to dream of new experiences, and enables developers to quickly build them and easily embed them into any channel.”\nWith Moltin, retailers can leverage best-of-breed content and design technologies to build emotive brand experiences. Also known as “headless commerce,” Moltin’s APIs connect all the components of a commerce system and enable retailers to deliver holistic experiences to consumers wherever they interact with the brand, including interactive digital displays, social media, smart televisions, video games or any other touchpoint. Moltin combines an extremely flexible set of APIs, developer toolkits and pre-built applications to make commerce development fast and easy.\n“We are entering a new era of commerce and you won’t even see it,” said Michael Skok, co-founder of Underscore VC. “It will be invisibly embedded into our daily lives, without technology obscuring the brand experience. It will be completely seamless and just an API call for the developer. It’s this level of transformation that Moltin enables. With Jamus at the helm and Adam, Chris and Jamie driving developer success and product roadmap, Moltin is well positioned to take advantage of this $4 trillion market opportunity.”\nMoltin is headquartered in Boston, Mass., and has offices in Newcastle, UK.\nAbout Moltin\nMoltin is an API-first digital commerce solution that enables retailers to build distinctive shopping experiences and embed them into any consumer touchpoint. It combines an extremely flexible set of APIs, developer toolkits, pre-built applications and cloud infrastructure to make commerce development simple, lightweight and fast.
