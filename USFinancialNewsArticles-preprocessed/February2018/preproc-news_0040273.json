    "text": "All-Star forward Anthony Davis had 42 points and 15 rebounds as the New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 139-117, on Wednesday night in New Orleans.\nDavis, who left the game briefly in the first quarter because of a minor groin injury, led New Orleans to its third consecutive victory heading into the All-Star break. The Pelicans had their highest point total of the season, which also was the most allowed by the Lakers in a regulation game this season.\nJrue Holiday added 24 points and 11 assists, Darius Miller and Nikola Mirotic came off the bench to score 19 and 16, respectively, and E‘Twaun Moore added 14 for the Pelicans.\nKyle Kuzma came off the bench to lead the Lakers with 23 points, Brandon Ingram scored 21, Julius Randle had 20 and Josh Hart scored 15.\nNew Orleans led by 13 at halftime, but Brook Lopez made two 3-pointers and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope made one during an 11-0 run that pulled Los Angeles within 81-79.\nMirotic scored nine points as the Pelicans extended the lead to 96-83. He finished with 11 points in the quarter, which ended with New Orleans holding a 103-91 lead.\nDavis scored three baskets before Mirotic’s 3-pointer gave the Pelicans a 120-100 lead with seven minutes remaining.\nThe Pelicans raced to a 15-2 lead as Holiday scored seven points. He finished the period with 11 as New Orleans set a franchise record for first-quarter points in taking a 46-33 lead after one.\nPelicans guard Rajon Rondo and Lakers guard Isaiah Thomas were ejected late in the first quarter after a brief altercation.\nAfter scoring the final eight points of the first quarter, the Lakers began the second quarter on a 10-2 run that pulled them within 48-43.\nDavis, who missed the last three minutes of the first quarter after suffering a minor groin injury, scored 10 points as New Orleans extended the lead to 63-49.\nLos Angeles cut the deficit to 67-62 before New Orleans finished with a push that gave it a 79-66 halftime lead, leaving it one point short of the franchise record for first-half points.\nLakers coach Luke Walton was ejected late in the second quarter after arguing a technical foul call against Kuzma.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
