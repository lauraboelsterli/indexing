As of December 31, 2017, the new program had approximately $229.0 million of remaining capacity.\nGuidance\nThe Company is introducing its full year 2018 guidance as follows:\nNet income attributable to common stockholders within a range of $0.20 to $0.23 per diluted share Company share of Core FFO within a range of $1.01 to $1.04 per diluted share Year-end Same Property Portfolio occupancy within a range of 95.0% to 97.0% Year-end Stabilized Same Property Portfolio occupancy within a range of 96.5% to 98.0% Same Property Portfolio NOI growth for the year of 6.0% to 8.0% Stabilized Same Property Portfolio NOI growth for the year of 4.0% to 5.5% General and administrative expenses of $24.0 million to $25.0 million\nThe Core FFO guidance refers only to the Company's in-place portfolio as of February 13, 2018, and does not include any assumptions for acquisitions, dispositions or balance sheet activities that may or may not occur later during the year. The Company's in-place portfolio as of February 13, 2018, reflects the acquisition of one property containing 103,208 rentable square feet and the disposition of two properties totaling 113,184 rentable square feet, subsequent to December 31, 2017. A number of factors could impact the Company's ability to deliver results in line with its guidance, including, but not limited to, interest rates, the economy, the supply and demand of industrial real estate, the availability and terms of financing to potential acquirers of real estate and the timing and yields for divestment and investment. There can be no assurance that the Company can achieve such results.\nDividends:\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.16 per share for the first quarter of 2018, payable in cash on April 16, 2018, to common stockholders and common unit holders of record as of March 30, 2018.\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.367188 per share of its Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, payable in cash on March 30, 2018, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2018. On February 12, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors also declared a pro-rata dividend, for the period beginning on November 13, 2017 to March 31, 2018, of $0.563021 per share of its Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, payable in cash on March 30, 2018, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2018.\nSupplemental Information:\nDetails regarding these results can be found in the Company's supplemental financial package available on the Company's investor relations website at www.ir.rexfordindustrial.com .\nEarnings Release, Investor Conference Webcast and Conference Call:\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call on Wednesday, February 14, 2018, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time to review fourth quarter results and discuss recent events.

Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" or \"potential\" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. While reflect the Company's good faith beliefs, assumptions and expectations, they are not guarantees of future performance. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Company's future results to differ materially from any , see the reports and other filings by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, of new information, data or methods, future events or other changes.\nDefinitions / Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nFunds from Operations (FFO): We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, other than temporary impairments of unconsolidated real estate entities, and impairment on our investment in real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other REITs, FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate or interpret FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. A reconciliation of net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent, to FFO is set forth below.\nCore Funds from Operations (Core FFO): We calculate Core FFO by adjusting FFO to exclude the impact of certain items that we do not consider reflective of our core revenue or expense streams. These adjustments consist of acquisition expenses and legal fee reimbursements related to prior litigation. For more information on prior litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that Core FFO is a useful supplemental measure as it provides a more meaningful and consistent comparison of operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the Company's operating results. Because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of Core FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate Core FFO in a consistent manner. Accordingly, our Core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' Core FFO. Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. A reconciliation of FFO to Core FFO is set forth below.\nReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders per Diluted Share Guidance to Company share of Core FFO per Diluted Share Guidance: The following is a reconciliation of the Company's guidance range of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure, to Company share of Core FFO per diluted share.\n2018 Estimate\nLow\nHigh\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n0.20\n$\n0.23\nCompany share of depreciation and amortization\n$\n0.92\n$\n0.92\nCompany share of gains on sale of real estate\n$\n(0.11)\n$\n(0.11)\nCompany share of Core FFO\n$\n1.01\n$\n1.04\nNet Operating Income (NOI): NOI is a non-GAAP measure, which includes the revenue and expense directly attributable to our real estate properties. NOI is calculated as total revenue from real estate operations including i) rental income, ii) tenant reimbursements and iii) other income less property expenses (before interest expense, depreciation and amortization). We use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization expense and gains (or losses) from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that NOI will be useful to investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because NOI excludes depreciation and amortization expense and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties (all of which have a real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations), the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate NOI in a similar manner and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs' NOI. Accordingly, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs.\nNOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. We use NOI to help evaluate the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the performance of our Same Property Portfolio. A calculation of NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, as well as a reconciliation of net income to NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, is set forth below.\nCash NOI: Cash NOI is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate by adding or subtracting from NOI i) fair value lease revenue and ii) straight-line rent adjustments. We use Cash NOI, together with NOI, as a supplemental performance measure. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. We use Cash NOI to help evaluate the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the performance of our Same Property Portfolio. A calculation of Cash NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, as well as a reconciliation of net income to Cash NOI for our Same Property Portfolio, is set forth below.\nSame Property Portfolio: Our Same Property Portfolio is a subset of our consolidated portfolio and includes properties that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2016, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2017. Therefore, we excluded from our Same Properties Portfolio any properties that were acquired or sold during the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The Company's computation of same property performance may not be comparable to other REITs.\nStabilized Same Property Portfolio: Our Stabilized Same Property Portfolio represents the properties included in our Same Property Portfolio, adjusted to exclude the properties listed in the tables below that were under repositioning/lease-up during comparable years.\nStabilized Same Property Portfolio occupancy/leasing statistics, excludes vacant/unleased repositioning space at each of these properties as of the end of each reporting period. Stabilized Same Property Portfolio NOI, excludes the NOI for the entire property for all comparable periods.\nOur 2017 Stabilized Same Property Portfolio excludes the following Same Property Portfolio properties that were in various stages of repositioning or lease-up during 2016 and 2017:\n12247 Lakeland Road\n24105 Frampton Avenue\n151040 & 15148 Bledsoe Street\n2610 & 2701 South Birch Street\n1601 Alton Parkway\n3880 Valley Boulevard\n18118-18120 Broadway Street\n679-691 South Anderson Street\n228th Street\n9615 Norwalk Boulevard\nAs of December 31, 2017, the difference between our Same Property Portfolio and our Stabilized Same Property Portfolio is 15,874 rentable square feet of space at one of our properties that was classified as repositioning or lease-up. As of December 31, 2016, the difference between our Same Property Portfolio and our Stabilized Same Property Portfolio is space aggregating 73,367 rentable square feet at four of our properties that were in various stages of repositioning or lease-up.\nOur 2018 Stabilized Same Property Portfolio will exclude the following 2018 Same Property Portfolio properties that were or will be in various stages of repositioning or lease-up during 2017 and 2018:\n12131 Western Avenue\n301-445 Figueroa Street\n14742-14750 Nelson Avenue\n3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard\n1601 Alton Parkway\n3880 Valley Boulevard\n18118-18120 Broadway Street\n679-691 South Anderson Street\n228th Street\n9615 Norwalk Boulevard\n2700-2722 Fairview Street\nProperties and Space Under Repositioning: Typically defined as properties or units where a significant amount of space is held vacant in order to implement capital improvements that improve the functionality (not including basic refurbishments, i.e., paint and carpet), cash flow and value of that space. We define a significant amount of space in a building as the lower of (i) 20,000 square feet of space or (ii) 50% of a building's square footage. Typically, we would include properties or space where the repositioning and lease-up time frame is estimated to be greater than six months. A repositioning is considered complete once the investment is fully or nearly fully deployed and the property is marketable for leasing. We consider a repositioning property to be stabilized at the earlier of the following: (i) upon reaching 90% occupancy or (ii) one year from the date of completion of repositioning construction work.\nContact:\nInvestor Relations:\nStephen Swett\n424-256-2153 ext 401\ninvestorrelations@rexfordindustrial.com\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands except
