    "text": "Amy Poehler and \"Parks and Recreation\" co-creator Michael Schur are not amused by the NRA invoking Leslie Knope.\n\"Thank you for being the voice of over 5 Million #NRA members,\" the association tweeted at a follower on Wednesday night, using a GIF of Poehler as her \"Parks\" character Knope.\nIn response, Schur asked the NRA to delete the tweet and passed on a message from the Twitter-less Poehler.\nRead more from USA Today: \nMeryl Streep: Weinstein's use of my words is 'pathetic and exploitive' \nOprah responds to Trump's '60 Minutes' tweet: 'I don't like giving negativity power' \n'Generation Columbine' has never known a world without school shootings \n\"Hi, please take this down,\" Schur wrote on Twitter. \"I would prefer you not use a GIF from a show I worked on to promote your pro-slaughter agenda. Also, Amy isn't on Twitter, but she texted me a message: 'Can you tweet the NRA for me and tell them I said (expletive) off?'\"\nPoehler's former Parks co-star Nick Offerman (who does not share Ron Swanson's archconservative political views) also had words for the NRA using a Leslie Knope GIF of his own. \"Our good-hearted show and especially our Leslie Knope represent the opposite of your pro-slaughter agenda,\" he tweeted on Thursday. \"Take it down and also please eat (expletive).\"\nNRA tweet \nOfferman tweet",
