    "text": "Darren Helm had a goal and two assists, Petr Mrazek made 36 saves, and the Detroit Red Wings topped the Carolina Hurricanes 4-1 on Friday at PNC Arena in Raleigh, N.C.\nHelm was playing in just his second game since missing six straight with a lower body injury. The Red Wings won their second straight after dropping six of eight and also collected their third consecutive road victory.\nMrazek has been in goal during all of those victories and is 4-0-1 in his last five starts.\nDanny DeKeyser, Trevor Daley and Gustav Nyquist also scored for Detroit while Tomas Tatar, Henrik Zetterberg and Luke Glendening each added an assist. The Wings had a 38-37 edge in shots on goal and blocked 18 shots, compared to 12 by the Hurricanes.\nSebastian Aho scored the lone Carolina goal. Scott Darling made 34 saves.\nAho scored a power-play goal 8:16 into the game. He snuck in behind Mrazek and tipped in Justin Faulk’s shot from near the blue line.\nDeKeyser’s second goal of the season tied it at the 16:21 mark of the period. Helm passed the puck from behind the Carolina goal to DeKeyser, whose slapshot from the left point zipped past Darling.\nDaley scored his second goal in as many games at 5:06 of the second period to give the Red Wings a 2-1 lead. Helm dropped off a pass to Daley, who whistled a shot from the slot beyond Darling’s grasp.\nNyquist provided some insurance at 7:45 of the third. Zetterberg made a steal in his own zone and fed the puck to Nyquist, who skated in on the right side. Nyquist then lifted a shot over Darling’s shoulder.\nHelm notched his three-point night when he came out of the penalty box and scored on a breakaway at 13:48.\nThe Hurricanes defeated the Red Wings 3-1 on Jan. 20. They square off once more on Feb. 24 in Detroit.\nCarolina continues its eight-game homestand against San Jose on Sunday afternoon, while Detroit plays at Florida on Saturday\n--Field Level Media\n ",
