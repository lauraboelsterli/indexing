The tech sector was the biggest gainer with a 0.62 percent rise.\nAt 10:49 a.m. ET (1549 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14.92 points, or 0.06 percent, at 25,506.04, the S&P 500 was down 0.24 points, or 0.008 percent, at 2,761.89.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was up 22.22 points, or 0.31 percent, at 7,263.16.\nFriday’s U.S. payrolls report showed wages growing at their fastest pace in more than eight years, fueling concerns that both inflation and interest rates would rise faster than expected.\nCurrently, traders are pricing in three rate hikes for 2018, but if the economy and corporate earnings continue to improve, the chances of a fourth increase becomes more likely.\n“I think we could see four rate hikes in 2018 but at the same time you have to look at why they’re raising rates. They’re doing that in response to faster economic growth,” McMillan said.\nSeven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index’s 0.89 percent fall leading the decliners.\nWells Fargo fell 7.2 percent after the Fed imposed new regulatory restrictions over compliance issues.\nQualcomm fell 2.3 percent after KGI Securities said Apple might drop the chipmaker in favor of Intel as the supplier for modem chips in its next generation of iPhones. Shares of Intel rose 2.3 percent.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,766 to 1,077. On the Nasdaq, 1,648 issues fell and 1,163 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 1 new 52-week high and 7 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 15 new highs and 87 new lows.
