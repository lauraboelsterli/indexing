    "text": "GADSDEN, Ala., Feb. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nThe Southern Banc Company, Inc. (OTCBB:SRNN), the holding company for The Southern Bank Company announced a net loss of approximately $560,000, or ($0.72) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a net loss of approximately $177,000, or ($0.23) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the six-month period ended December 31, 2017 the Company recorded a net loss of approximately $737,000, which included an income tax expense of approximately $606,000 due to the recent tax law changes, as compared to a net loss of approximately $283,000 for the six-month period ended December 31, 2016.\nGates Little, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company stated that the Company’s net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the recent change in the statutory corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017 the Company’s net interest margins improved as compared to the same period in 2016. Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $1.1 million as compared to approximately $820,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $253,000 or 30.9%. The improvement in the net interest margin for the quarter was primarily attributable to an increase in total interest income of approximately $270,000 or 26.8%, offset in part by an increase in total interest expense of approximately $16,000. Provision for loan and lease losses decreased approximately $222,000 during the quarter as compared to the same period in 2016. Net interest income after provision for loan and lease losses increased approximately $475,000 or 81.0% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same quarter in 2016. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, total non-interest income increased approximately $10,000 or 29.9% while total non-interest expense increased approximately $48,000 or 5.4% as compared to the same three month period in 2016. The increase in non-interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in miscellaneous income of approximately $7,000. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits of approximately $13,000, other operating expenses of approximately $41,000, offset in part by decreases in professional service expenses of approximately $1,000, data processing expenses of approximately $1,000, office building and equipment expenses of approximately $4,000.\nFor the six-months ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased approximately $532,000 or 31.8%. Provision for loan and lease losses increased approximately $261,000 during the six-month period as compared to the same period in 2016. Net interest income after provision for loan and lease losses increased approximately $271,000 or 20.0% for the six-months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. For the six-months ended December 31, 2017, total non-interest income increased approximately $5,000 or 5.3% while total non-interest expense decreased approximately $46,000 or 2.5% as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in non-interest income was primarily attributable to increases in customer service fees of approximately $8,000, miscellaneous income of approximately $20,000 offset in part by a decrease in the net gain on sales of securities of approximately $23,000. The decrease in non-interest expense was primarily attributable to decreases in salaries and benefits of approximately $26,000, occupancy expenses of approximately $9,000, professional fees of approximately $17,000, data processing fees of approximately $7,000 offset in part by an increase other operating expenses of approximately $13,000.\nThe Company’s total assets at December 31, 2017 were approximately $98.3 million, as compared to $96.5 million at June 30, 2017. Total stockholders’ equity was approximately $11.0 million at December 31, 2017 or 11.2% of total assets as compared to approximately $11.8 million at June 30, 2017 or approximately 12.3% of total assets.\nThe Bank has four offices located in Gadsden, Albertville, Guntersville, and Centre, Alabama.
