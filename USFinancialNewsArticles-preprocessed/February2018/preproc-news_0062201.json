We shipped 221 megawatts DC and 755,000 microinverters. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 24.2%, an increase of 240 basis points from 21.8% in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to the IQ 6 transition in North America, supply chain optimization and pricing management. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $18.0 million, an increase of 6% compared to the prior quarter, due to investments in IQ 8 platform development. We are very pleased to report non-GAAP operating income of $1.3 million and net income of $683,000, which resulted in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.01. This return to profitability represents a significant milestone for the company.\nWe exited the quarter with approximately $29.1 million in cash. Inventory was $26 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $25.3 million in the third quarter, and down from $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn summary, we are well on track towards achieving our 30-20-10 target operating model by the end of 2018. We are targeting 30% gross margin, 20% operating expenses and 10% operating income, all by the fourth quarter of 2018.\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n+ Enphase opened an R&D center in Bangalore, India to establish a best-in-class technology development center.
