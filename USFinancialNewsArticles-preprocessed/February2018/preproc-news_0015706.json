    "text": "Robert Alexander | Getty Images A Spirit Airlines Airbus A320 passenger jet. \nA college student flushed her pet hamster down the toilet on the suggestion of an employee of Spirit Airlines , which denied boarding to the rodent, the traveler's attorney said. \nBelen Aldecosea checked with Spirit to see whether she would be allowed to bring her hamster, Pebbles, on board with her. The airline gave her a green light, her attorney, Adam Goodman, told CNBC. \nBut when she arrived at Baltimore Washington International airport in late November, the airline wouldn't let her bring Pebbles with her. Goodman said an employee suggested flushing the dwarf hamster down the toilet, which Aldecosea did. \nShe is considering filing a lawsuit, Goodman said. Spirit did not immediately return CNBC's request for comment, but The Miami Herald, which first reported the incident, said the airline denies that one of its employees made that suggestion to Aldecosea. \nA Spirit representative acknowledged that the airline told Aldecosea that her hamster would be allowed, according to a Nov. 29 email that was seen by CNBC. \n\"Belen, I can't begin to enough apologize that our agent was unable to provide you with the correct information regarding animals allowed on-board our aircraft,\" the Spirit representative wrote. \nAldecosea, 21, wanted to get home because she was dealing with health problems at school, but she was too young to rent a car, Goodman said. \nAldecosea considered letting the dwarf hamster run free but thought it would be more humane to quickly end Pebbles' life, The Miami Herald reported. \n\"I didn't have any other options,\" she told the paper. \nThe news comes as airlines are introducing stricter rules for emotional support animals after crew and passengers complained about allergies, soiled cabins and biting. Starting next month, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines will require written confirmation that travelers' emotional support animals are trained. \nLast month, United denied boarding to a peacock a passenger wanted to bring on a cross-country flight for emotional support. The airline said the animal did not meet size and weight standards. WATCH: Airlines are rethinking their emotional-support animal policies show chapters",
