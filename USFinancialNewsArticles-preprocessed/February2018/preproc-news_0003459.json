    "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Feb. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlueJeans Network, Inc. ( https://www.bluejeans.com ), the first cloud service to connect desktops, mobile devices and room systems in one video meeting, today announced a number of key hires. Matthew Collier joins BlueJeans as SVP of Strategic Business Development, George Mogannam has been named Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) and Walt Weisner is BlueJeans’ Chief Customer Officer (CCO).\n“We have assembled an incredible leadership team with the pedigree and proven expertise to scale the company and take advantage of our $40 billion addressable market,” said Quentin Gallivan, CEO of BlueJeans. “Matt, George and Walt have seen this movie before – they have the right experience and know-how to lead sales, customer success, and business development during an important market inflection point.”\nCollier’s career has been devoted to identifying partnerships and alliances required to drive brand awareness and new revenue opportunities. Early on at Verizon, he focused on the video and collaboration market followed by a role as VP of business development at Polycom. Collier then expanded relationships with technology, distribution and resale partners at Lifesize Communications. At BlueJeans, he will work closely with product management, marketing, sales and engineering to develop effective relationships with key partners worldwide.\nMogannam is recognized for his expertise in successfully scaling out sales teams globally. After spending a number of years as a sales leader at IBM, Mogannam has led sales teams at Crossbeam Systems (acquired by Blue Coat) and Avid Technology. He comes to BlueJeans from Actiance, where he served as SVP of worldwide sales and service. Mogannam’s successful track record prepares BlueJeans for continued revenue acceleration and market leadership.\nWeisner is highly regarded as one of the most seasoned leaders in the evolving field of customer success and has been at the forefront of driving adoption and revenue in high-growth markets. He has transformed customer success organizations for companies such as RingCentral, WebEx, ShoreTel, GoodTechnology, and ServiceNow throughout his distinguished career. Weisner is building a market-leading post-sales experience to delight customers, accelerate adoption, and drive customer engagement to ensure customer success.\nThe new additions to the management team arrive at BlueJeans under the direction of Quentin Gallivan , who was named BlueJeans’ CEO in August 2017 as BlueJeans experienced a significant spike in the size, scope and diversity of customer deployments. Gallivan and the executive team will continue the growth trajectory to further accelerate customer and partner engagement, driving BlueJeans’ market leadership and success.\n“I think I speak for George and Matt in saying that BlueJeans is poised to take advantage of an exciting time in our industry where technical innovation, strategic partnerships and customer demand will propel the company and bring our meeting platform to new customers in every market and region. With Krish Ramakrishnan, the father of cloud-based video communications, driving the vision and Quentin leading strategy and execution, all of the pieces are in place for BlueJeans to fundamentally transform enterprise business communications and collaboration,” said Weisner.\nTo learn more about the BlueJeans meeting platform and product suites, please visit www.bluejeans.com .\nAbout BlueJeans Network\nBlueJeans is the meetings platform for the modern workplace and the first cloud service to connect desktops, mobile devices and room systems in one video meeting.
