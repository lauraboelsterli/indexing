    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CME) today reported revenue of $900 million and operating income of $537 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth-quarter 2017 net income included a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit due to recognition of a reduction in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. Resulting net income was $2.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $8.63. On an adjusted basis, net income was $383 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.12. Financial results presented on an adjusted basis for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 exclude the net income tax benefit noted above and certain other items, which are detailed in the reconciliation of non-GAAP results. 1\nTotal revenue for full-year 2017 was $3.6 billion and operating income was $2.3 billion. Net Income was $4.1 billion and diluted earnings per share were $11.94. On an adjusted basis, net income of $1.6 billion, was up 6 percent compared with 2016, and diluted earnings per share of $4.77, was up 5 percent. This was due to 1 percent year-over-year growth in revenue, coupled with relatively flat operating expenses.\n\"Our primary goals in 2017 were to expand our global customer base, continue to innovate across our diverse product set and focus on operational efficiency,\" said CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy. \"In a year of historically low volatility, we set annual volume records in three of our six asset classes as well as in total options. We launched successful new products and saw growth in Europe and Asia out-pace that in the U.S. We kept expenses relatively flat for the third straight year, and paid out more than $2 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2017. Looking ahead, 2018 is starting out strong, with average daily volume up more than 15 percent to date, driven by broad-based strength across our asset classes.\"\n1. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial results mentioned to the respective GAAP figures can be found within the Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Measures chart at the end of the financial statements and earnings presentation materials.\nFourth-quarter 2017 average daily volume was 15.9 million contracts, down 2 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2016. Clearing and transaction fee revenue was $758 million, down 1 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 total average rate per contract was $0.736, compared with $0.749 in third-quarter 2017, driven by a lower proportion of commodity volume as well as higher member trading. Market data revenue was $102 million, up 2 percent compared with the fourth quarter last year and up 5 percent from third-quarter 2017.\nFull-year 2017 record average daily volume was 16.3 million contracts, up 4 percent from 2016, and included annual records for energy, agricultural commodities, metals, total options and electronic options. Clearing and transaction fee revenue was $3.1 billion up 2 percent compared with 2016. The average rate per contract in 2017 was $0.741, down 2 percent from $0.754 in 2016. Market data revenue was $392 million, down 4 percent compared with the prior year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the company had $2.0 billion of cash and marketable securities and $2.2 billion of long-term debt. The company declared dividends during 2017 of $2.1 billion, including the annual variable dividend for 2017 of $1.2 billion, which was paid in January 2018. The company has returned more than $9.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends since the implementation of the variable dividend policy in early 2012.\nCME Group will hold a Q&A conference call to discuss fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.
