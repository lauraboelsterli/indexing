    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has picked the western city of Osaka to host next year’s G20 summit, the first such gathering to be held in Japan, a government source said.\nThe choice of Osaka, Japan’s second-largest city after Tokyo, was first reported by public broadcaster NHK.\nThis year’s summit is to be held in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, next month.\nThe source asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media.\nGovernments around the world are grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrency trading, and policymakers are expected to discuss the matter at next month’s summit.\nReporting by Takashi Umekawa and Tim Kelly; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ",
