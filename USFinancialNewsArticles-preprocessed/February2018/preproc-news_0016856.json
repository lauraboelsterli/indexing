    "text": "$62 Million in Cash From Operations in Q4\nDivested Lower-Margin Timing Device Business for $130 Million\nReduced net debt by over $150 Million in 2017\nITASCA, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Knowles Corporation (NYSE: KN), a market leader and global supplier of advanced micro-acoustic, audio processing, and precision device solutions, today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“We delivered Q4 revenue of $216 million, with gross margin and EPS that were positively impacted by the settlement of a royalty dispute,” said Jeffrey Niew, president and CEO of Knowles. “In our Audio segment, sales were up sequentially driven by increased shipments to our largest customer and strong demand in our IoT end market. Sales into the China handset market were weaker than expected. In the Precision Devices segment, sales were consistent with expectations which excluded the timing device business that was divested during the quarter, and up 25% from the year ago period due to stronger demand for capacitor devices driven by our defense, medical, and industrial markets.”\n“As we enter 2018, I anticipate higher microphone sales into the IoT and headset markets, coupled with strong growth in Precision Devices, will drive favorable results. In addition, our full product line of open, DSP-based solutions is gaining traction across our mobile, ear, and IoT markets as we continue our transition to an audio solutions provider. I believe that the number and quality of engagements we are seeing serves as a confirmation of our intelligent audio strategy. We continue to believe that we are uniquely positioned across our end markets to deliver best-in-class audio input solutions for our customers that leverage our leading-edge acoustics with digital signal processing and algorithms,” continued Niew.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe following table highlights the Company’s financial performance on both a GAAP and supplemental non-GAAP basis for continuing operations* (in millions except for per share data):\nQ4FY17** Q3FY17 Q4FY16 Sequential\nChange\nYear Ago Period\nChange\nRevenue $215.5 $196.0 $212.9 10% 1% Gross Profit $89.6 $74.2 $85.2 21%\n6%\n(as % of revenue)\n41.6%\n37.9%\n40.0%\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit $92.2 $76.4 $85.5 21%\n8%\n(as % of revenue)\n42.8%\n39.0%\n40.2%\nDiluted Earnings per share*** $0.35 $0.12 $0.18 292% 194% Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share $0.40 $0.26 $0.32 154% 125% * Continuing operations excludes the results of our speaker and receiver product line which was sold on July 7, 2016 and our timing device business which was sold on November 28, 2017.\n** Current period results include $13.6 million in revenue and $5.6 million related to recovered legal expenses associated with the settlement of a royalty dispute. Management estimates that $13.0 million of the settlement proceeds relate to years prior to 2017.\n*** Current period results include $6.5 million in stock-based compensation, $2.1 million in restructuring charges, $2.1 million in production transfer costs and $1.4 million from amortization of intangibles.\nThe Company recorded a preliminary provisional charge of $2.3 million in the fourth quarter that includes the estimated impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, including the U.S. tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, the write-down of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at lower enacted corporate tax rates and the reversal of existing valuation allowances. The taxes payable, net of tax attributes, on deemed repatriation of historical foreign earnings is approximately $18 million, payable over 8 years starting in 2018. The final impacts of the legislation may differ materially from this estimate and the amount of the preliminary provisional charge may accordingly be adjusted due to changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the tax legislation.\nIn addition to the GAAP results included in this press release, Knowles has presented supplemental non-GAAP gross profit, earnings before interest and income taxes, adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes, non-GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share, as well as other metrics on a non-GAAP basis that exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure to facilitate evaluation of Knowles’ operating performance. Non-GAAP results are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP information should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release do not have standard meanings and may vary from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Knowles believes that non-GAAP measures are useful as supplements to its GAAP results of operations to evaluate certain aspects of its operations and financial performance, and its management team primarily focuses on non-GAAP items in evaluating Knowles’ performance for business planning purposes. Knowles also believes that these measures assist it with comparing its performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in Knowles’ opinion, do not reflect its core operating performance including, for example, stock-based compensation, certain intangibles amortization expense, fixed asset impairment charges, restructuring, production transfer costs, and other charges which management considers to be outside our core operating results. Knowles believes that its presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that Knowles uses internally for purposes of assessing its core operating performance. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the reconciliation table accompanying this release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Outlook\nThe following forward looking guidance for the quarter ending March 31, 2018 is on a continuing operations basis:\nGAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP Revenue $170 to $190 million - $170 to $190 million Gross Profit Margin 36 to 38% 1% 37 to 39% EPS $0.00 to $0.04 $0.10 $0.10 to $0.14 Q1 2018 GAAP results for continuing operations are expected to include approximately $0.04 per share in stock-based compensation, $0.04 per share from a higher effective tax rate, $0.01 per share in amortization of debt discount, and $0.01 per share in amortization of intangibles. Expected Q1 2018 GAAP results exclude potential restructuring items.\nDue to the impact of U.S. tax reform, the Company now expects that its non-GAAP 2018 effective tax rate will be between 15 percent and 19 percent.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nInvestors can listen to a live or replay webcast of the Company’s quarterly financial conference call at http://investor.knowles.com .

Knowles believes that non-GAAP measures are useful as supplements to its GAAP results of operations to evaluate certain aspects of its operations and financial performance, and its management team primarily focuses on non-GAAP items in evaluating Knowles' performance for business planning purposes. Knowles also believes that these measures assist it with comparing its performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in Knowles' opinion, do not reflect its core operating performance. Knowles believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that Knowles uses internally for purposes of assessing its core operating performance. (2) Production transfer costs represent duplicate costs incurred to migrate manufacturing to facilities primarily in Asia. These amounts are included in the corresponding Gross profit and Earnings from continuing operations before interest and income taxes for each period presented. (3) In 2017, Other loss (gain) primarily represents expenses related to the acquisition of certain assets of a capacitors manufacturer. In 2016, Other loss (gain) primarily represents a gain on the sale of investment related to a non-controlling interest in a MEMs timing device company partially offset by expenses related to the Audience Inc. acquisition. (4) Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Company’s $172.5 million of convertible senior notes due 2021 that were issued in a private placement in May 2016. The imputed interest rate is 8.12% for the convertible notes due 2021, while the actual coupon interest rate of the notes was 3.25%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense is excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of its core, ongoing operating performance. (5) The Non-GAAP reconciling adjustments are those adjustments made to reconcile Earnings from continuing operations before interest and income taxes to Adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest and income taxes. (6) The number of shares used in the diluted per share calculations on a non-GAAP basis excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods and not yet recognized in the financial statements, which would otherwise be assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method.
