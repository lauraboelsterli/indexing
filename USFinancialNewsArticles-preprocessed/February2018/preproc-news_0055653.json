    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Turning Point Brands, Inc. (NYSE:TPB), a leading provider of Other Tobacco Products (“OTP”), today announced that it will retain ownership of seven Vapor Shark branded stores by purchasing and canceling the option granted to the former Vapor Shark owner. The action keeps those seven stores under TPB ownership.\nTPB agreed to pay the former Vapor Shark owner $1.5 million to purchase and cancel the option to acquire the stores, with $1 million paid in February 2018 and the remaining $0.5 million payable over 24 months.\n“Shortly after acquiring Vapor Shark in June 2017, we implemented a number of process improvements that resulted in stronger sales in the 35 Vapor Shark branded corporate and franchise stores,” said Larry Wexler, TPB President and CEO. \"As a result of the encouraging growth rates and our desire to gain keener insight into consumer purchase behavior, we elected to retain company ownership of these seven stores. We believe that the improved sales trends and insights from data and direct consumer interaction will drive performance across our NewGen segment. Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate the benefits of owning versus franchising those stores.”\nCoincident with the Vapor Shark acquisition earlier in 2017, TPB recorded a $0.6 million liability in the second quarter 2017 in relation to the option granted to the former Vapor Shark owner to buy the Vapor Shark branded stores. As a result of this agreement, TPB expects a one-time fourth quarter 2017 charge of $0.9 million.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Tax Rate\nTPB expects its fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate to be approximately 49% due to a number of factors including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act impact on tax expense as a result of revaluing our deferred taxes.\nAbout Turning Point Brands, Inc.\nLouisville, Kentucky based Turning Point Brands, Inc.
