    "text": "February 22, 2018 / 12:25 PM / Updated 6 hours ago Sangamo in $3 billion gene-editing deal with Gilead Manas Mishra 3 Min Read (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc ( GILD.O ) will use Sangamo Therapeutics Inc’s ( SGMO.O ) gene-editing technology to develop cancer treatments in a deal potentially worth about $3 billion (2.16 billion pounds) to Sangamo, the companies said on Thursday. The deal is the latest by a major drugmaker looking to develop lucrative gene therapies that have the potential to treat ailments by directly targeting disease-causing genes. Shares of California biotech firm Sangamo jumped more than 20 percent to a 17-year high of $27.30 on Thursday morning. “These are indeed exciting times in the field of genome-editing and gene therapy,” Sangamo Chief Executive Officer Sandy Macrae said on a call with analysts. In December, Luxturna, a treatment for a rare disease that causes blindness, became the first gene therapy for an inherited disease to get U.S. regulatory approval. The treatment, developed by Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics Inc ( ONCE.O ), is expected to be priced at $850,000. Gilead subsidiary Kite Pharma will use Sangamo’s platform to target a class of proteins called zinc finger nucleases in order to edit the human genome, helping develop therapies for cancer. Sangamo will receive $150 million upfront and is eligible for up to $3.01 billion in future payments tied to regulatory and other milestones. Gilead snapped up Kite Pharma in a $12 billion deal last year as a way to get access to an emerging class of cancer immunotherapies called CAR-T and to offset slowing sales of its hepatitis C medicines. Other firms specializing in CAR-T such as Juno Therapeutics ( JUNO.O ) have signed deals to use another kind of gene-editing technology called CRISPR. Gilead said earlier this month it would pursue collaborations with companies for gene-editing technology. “(Gilead) scoured the field,” said Curt Herberts, Sangamo’s chief business officer. Companies with gene-editing platforms including Editas Medicine ( EDIT.O ) and CRISPR Therapeutics ( CRSP.O ) saw their shares jump after Gilead signaled interest in the technology.
