With a proven background in change management, working in the bio-economy, hospitality and technology industries, Mr. Weadock brings a history of proven success.

I’m looking forward to leading the Indoor Harvest team as it constructs and completes its technology integration trials in Tempe, Arizona and begins its development in Parachute, Colorado, and ultimately seeks registration under the Controlled Substance Act.”\nAdditionally, the Company would like to extend thanks to Dr. Lang Coleman and Ben Coleman, the prior majority shareholders of Alamo CBD, for their voluntary return and cancellation of a combined 3,280,470 common shares, representing over 12% of the Company’s outstanding common stock at the time of cancellation, in order to prevent dilution to shareholders during the Company’s efforts to secure new senior management, provide additional incentive equity and to form an advisory board.\nAbout Indoor Harvest Corp\nIndoor Harvest Corp (OTCQB:INQD), through its brand name Indoor Harvest®, is a developer of personalized cannabis medicines and a provider of advanced cultivation methods and processes for the cannabis industry.
