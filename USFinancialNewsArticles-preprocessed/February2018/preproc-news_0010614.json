Shin stated, \"We are pleased to have the opportunity to reward employees with salary increases and bonuses thanks to these tax cuts. We are proud of our dedicated and enthusiastic employees who have made Noah Bank a success.\" Mr. Shin added that, \"The new legislation will continue to benefit Noah Bank, our employees, our shareholders, and our customers as we progress and grow.\"\nCongress approved tax reform legislation that reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Noah Bank intends to pay out the bonuses on February 8.\nAbout Noah Bank\nWith its legal headquarters in Elkins Park, PA, Noah Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered bank that was launched in 2004.
