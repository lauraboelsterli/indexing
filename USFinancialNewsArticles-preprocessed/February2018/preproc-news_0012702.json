Fox last week announced a deal to air Thursday Night National Football League games on its broadcast network for the next five seasons. \nTotal revenue rose 4.6 percent to $8.04 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $7.94 billion. \nNet income attributable to shareholders increased to $1.83 billion, or 99 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, from $856 million, or 46   \nThe quarter was helped by a $1.34 billion gain from the recent changes to the U.S. tax law. ( 21.cf/2siO7g9 ) \nExcluding items, Fox earned 42 cents per share, topping analysts’ estimate of 38 cents. \n(This version of the story was refiled to change the phrasing ‘its’ in lead to ‘through’) Reporting by Munsif Vengattil   Sriraj Kalluvila",
