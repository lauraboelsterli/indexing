He is supportive of JQH’s Legacy of Giving, the philanthropic initiative that allows JQH’s more than 4,000 passionate associates the opportunity to personally get involved in a centralized giving program with Convoy of Hope, where $10 a month can feed a child for an entire month internationally or provide $100 in food, goods and services to a family in need in the United States.\n“I am pleased to be in flourishing North Texas overseeing a high quality property within the JQH portfolio,” Cossey said. “I find that JQH truly typifies a family-like culture that provides encouragement, builds on strengths, and fosters trust.”\nAbout Courtyard by Marriott Dallas Allen at the John Q.
