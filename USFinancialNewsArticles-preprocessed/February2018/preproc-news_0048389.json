    "text": "4 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—Pennsylvania Republicans filed a new emergency appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to block a new congressional map imposed by the state’s highest court.\nA similar emergency appeal failed earlier this month when it was turned down by Justice Samuel Alito.\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court last month invalidated the congressional districts drawn by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2011, ruling the map was an unlawful partisan gerrymander. The court said the GOP drew distorted district lines for the purpose of maximizing Republican congressional gains in Pennsylvania, an effort that has been successful.\nAfter the legislature and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf couldn’t agree on a replacement map, the state court on Monday announced a map of its own , one that unwinds an array of Republican advantages under the old map.\nThe redrawn districts are to go into effect right away, for use in the May 15 primary elections and the general election in November.\nDemocrats won only five of Pennsylvania’s 18 seats in Congress under the old map, but could pick up several more under the new district lines. If those pickups materialize, it could boost the party’s effort to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nThe new Republican appeal asks the Supreme Court to put the map on hold, arguing the state court didn’t give the legislature a realistic and meaningful opportunity to draw a new map.\n“The Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s order blatantly usurps the power of the Pennsylvania General Assembly and inflicts confusion on the Commonwealth’s upcoming congressional elections,” state House Speaker Mike Turzai and Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati said in their emergency filing.\nPennsylvania’s high court based its ruling solely on the state’s Constitution, a move that gave the U.S. Supreme Court little room to intervene.\nThe Republican lawmakers say the case does raise a federal constitutional issue because the state court is dictating rules for elections to federal office instead of allowing the legislature to do so, as called for under the federal Constitution.\nDemocrats said there is nothing unusual about a court imposing a new map as a remedy when lawmakers have drawn one that doesn’t comply with the law. They say the new map creates fair and competitive districts.\nA spokesman for Gov. Wolf said the governor “is focused on making sure the Department of State is fully complying with the court’s order by updating their systems and assisting candidates, county election officials and voters.”\nThe latest GOP appeal could face long odds.\nJustice Alito, who oversees emergency applications from Pennsylvania, denied the earlier Republican appeal without formally circulating the request to the full court. Normally, a justice would ask other members of the court to review the appeal if the justice believed it merited strong consideration.\nThe Pennsylvania lawmakers were able to renew their request with Justice Alito by challenging the state court’s announcement of the new map this week. The earlier emergency appeal targeted the state court ruling from January that struck down the old map.\nThe Supreme Court is currently considering two cases on partisan redistricting, from Wisconsin and Maryland, in which voters argue that it is unconstitutional for lawmakers to draw extreme gerrymanders for partisan advantage.\nThe court is expected to rule in those cases by the end of June. The outcome could have major ramifications for how future district lines are drawn for state and federal offices.\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com",
