Slideshow (15 Images) \nBut Brighton’s second-half goals were stunning. First Jose Izquierdo rocketed a shot past West Ham keeper Adrian from the edge of the area after 59 minutes and then Pascal Gross capped a fine display by scoring from 25 metres in the 75th. \nWest Ham’s midweek signing from Preston North End, striker Jordan Hugill, came off the bench but Brighton held on to complete their first league double over West Ham and move level with the 12th placed visitors on 27 points.
