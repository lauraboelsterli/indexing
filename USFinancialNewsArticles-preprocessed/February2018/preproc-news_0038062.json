    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, - Globant (NYSE: GLOB), a digitally-native technology services company focused on creating digital journeys , today announced results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nPlease see highlights below, including certain Non-IFRS measures. Note that reconciliations between Non-IFRS financial measures and IFRS operating results are disclosed at the end of this press release.\nFourth quarter 2017 highlights\nRevenue increased to a record $115.4 million, representing 32.3% year-over-year growth. Non-IFRS Adjusted Gross Profit was $45.0 million (39.0% Non-IFRS Adjusted Gross Profit Margin), an increase of $9.6 million compared to $35.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 (40.5% Non-IFRS Adjusted Gross Profit Margin). Non-IFRS Adjusted Net Income was $14.1 million (12.2% Non-IFRS Adjusted Net Income Margin), compared to a profit of $9.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 (10.9% Non-IFRS Adjusted Net Income Margin). Non-IFRS Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.39 per share (based on an average of 36.3 million diluted shares), compared to Non-IFRS Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.27 for the fourth quarter of 2016 (based on an average of 35.6 million diluted shares).\nFull year ended December 31, 2017 highlights\nRevenue for the period increased to $413.4 million, representing 28.1% year-over-year growth. Non-IFRS Adjusted Gross Profit was $160.3 million (38.8% Non-IFRS Adjusted Gross Profit Margin), an increase of $23.6 million compared to $136.7 million (42.3% Non-IFRS Adjusted Gross Profit Margin) for the full year 2016.

Our revenues for the year increased to $413.4 million, a robust 28.1% year-over-year growth. This strong growth was driven by substantial and expanding demand from organizations looking to digitally transform their businesses. As this trend continues growing, it leverages the power of technologies like Artificial Intelligence and others like IoT, UX and more to enable an Augmented Intelligence approach. Our Studios have proven to be one of the most effective ways to address these trends and engage with our accounts. On the vertical front, Financial Services and Media & Entertainment industries had outstanding performances,\" said Martín Migoya, Globant's CEO and co-founder.\n\"Looking forward to 2018, we continue to have strong demand from companies looking to achieve digital transformations. We believe that our market approach with our Studios and our 50-Squared model positions us as a leader in this area and makes us an ideal partner for companies facing these transformations,\" added Martín Migoya.\n\"I am very satisfied with our overall results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Q4 was another strong period of revenue, closing at $115.4 million, representing 32.3% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Our 50-Squared strategy continues to yield positive results, and we now have nine accounts over $10 million in annual revenues, compared to six accounts for the same period last year. Regarding profitability, we will continue to manage costs carefully in order to keep our gross margins within a stable range while, at the same time, we continue to execute our diversification strategy. We also expect to maintain our focus on dilution of our Adjusted SG&A to keep improving our operating leverage. Finally, hirings during Q4 were also very strong, a positive signal as we enter 2018\", explained Alejandro Scannapieco, Globant's CFO.\nGlobant completed the fourth quarter with 6,753 Globers, 6,279 of whom were IT professionals. The geographic revenue breakdown for the fourth quarter was as follows: 78.6% from North America (top country: US), 14.6% from Latin America and others (top country: Argentina) and 6.8% from Europe (top country: Spain). 82.5% of Globant's revenue for the fourth quarter was denominated in US dollars, and the remaining 17.5% was denominated in other currencies, including Euros, GB pounds and other Latin American currencies.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, Globant served 356 customers, 82 of which accounted for more than $1 million of Globant's revenues. Globant's top customer, top five customers and top ten customers represented 10.4%, 28.5% and 43.2% of fourth quarter revenues, respectively.\nCash and cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2017 increased to $60.7 million from $59.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Current assets as of December 31, 2017 amounted to $156.1 million, accounting for 43.0% of total assets. Finally, as of December 31, 2017, 35.2 million common shares were issued and outstanding.\n2018 First Quarter and Full Year Outlook\nBased on current market conditions, Globant is providing the following estimates for the first quarter and the full year of 2018:\nFirst quarter 2018 Revenue is estimated to be between $113-$115 million, implying 28.5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. First quarter 2018 Non-IFRS Adjusted Diluted EPS is estimated to be in the range of $0.31-$0.35 (assuming an average of 36.4 million diluted shares outstanding during the first quarter). Fiscal year 2018 Revenue is estimated to be in the range of $495-$505 million, implying 20.9% year-over-year revenue growth at the midpoint of the range. Fiscal year 2018 Non-IFRS Adjusted Diluted EPS is estimated to be in the range of $1.52-$1.62 (assuming an average of 36.7 million diluted shares outstanding during 2018).\nConference Call and Webcast\nMartín Migoya and Alejandro Scannapieco will discuss the Q4 2017 results in a conference call today beginning at 4:30pm ET.\nConference call access information is:\nUS +1 (888) 346-2877\nInternational +1 (412) 902-4257\nWebcast http://investors.globant.com/\nAdditionally, a replay will be available via the same dial-in number and on our investor relations website after the call.\nAbout Globant (NYSE: GLOB)\nWe are a digitally native technology services company.

The financial information in this press release has not been audited.\nGlobant provides non-IFRS financial measures to complement reported IFRS results, in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\". Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in the company's business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicated internally and externally, for managing the company's business and evaluating its performance. The company anticipates that it will continue to report both IFRS and certain non-IFRS financial measures in its financial results, including non-IFRS results that exclude share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of tax credits and acquisition-related charges. Because the company's non-IFRS financial measures are not calculated according to IFRS, these measures are not comparable to IFRS and may not necessarily be comparable to similarly described non-IFRS measures reported by other companies within the company's industry. Consequently, Globant's non-IFRS financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable IFRS measures, but, rather, should be considered together with its unaudited interim consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and its unaudited interim consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, prepared in accordance with IAS 34.\nGlobant is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Non-IFRS Adjusted Diluted EPS to the most directly comparable IFRS measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, share-based compensation expense, impairment of tax credits and acquisition-related charges. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on IFRS reported results for the guidance period.\nForward Looking Statements\nIn addition to historical information, this release contains \" \" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These include information about possible or assumed future results of our business and financial condition, as well as the results of operations, Non-IFRS results of operations and Non-IFRS earnings per share, liquidity, plans and objectives. In some cases, you can identify by terminology such as \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: the persistence and intensification of competition in the IT industry; the future growth of spending in IT services outsourcing generally, application outsourcing and custom application development and offshore development services; the level of growth of demand for our services from our clients; the level of increase in revenues from our new clients; the resource utilization rates and productivity levels and the level of attrition of our IT professionals; the pricing structures we use for our client contracts; the general economic and business conditions in the locations in which we operate; the levels of our concentration of revenues by vertical, geography, by client and by type of contract in the future; the continuity of tax incentives available for software companies with operations in Argentina; Argentina's regulations on proceeds from the export of services; our expectation that we will be able to integrate and manage the companies we acquire and that our acquisitions will yield the benefits we envision; the demands we expect our rapid growth to place on our management and infrastructure; the sufficiency of our current cash, cash flow from operations, and lines of credit to meet our anticipated cash needs; the high proportion of our cost of services comprised of personnel salaries; and other factors discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our most recent Form 20-F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThese involve various risks and uncertainties. Although the registrant believes that its expectations expressed in these are reasonable, its expectations may turn out to be incorrect. The registrant's actual results could be materially different from its expectations. In light of the risks and uncertainties described above, the estimates and discussed might not occur, and the registrant's future results and its performance may expressed in these due to, inclusive, but not limited to, the factors mentioned above. Because of these uncertainties, you should not make any investment decision based on these estimates and . Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any for any reason after the date of this press release events or otherwise.\nThese risks and uncertainties include those discussed or identified in the filings with the Luxembourg Stock Market Authority for the Financial Markets (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier).\nGlobant S.A.\nCondensed Interim
