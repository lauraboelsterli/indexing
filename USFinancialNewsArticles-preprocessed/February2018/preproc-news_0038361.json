    "text": "MUNICH (Reuters) - Officials from Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia have dropped plans to hold a four-way meeting on the violence and ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, a diplomatic source said on Saturday.\nA meeting initially scheduled on Friday was scrapped due to scheduling conflicts after German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel unexpectedly had to return to Berlin after the release of a German-Turkish journalist from a Turkish prison.\nThe officials were now conducting bilateral meetings instead of meeting in a larger group, diplomatic sources said.\n“Ukraine was an intense topic of discussion” during one such bilateral meeting between Gabriel and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday, a German diplomatic source said.\nReporting by Sabine Siebold and Andrea Shalal; Writing by Andrea Shalal, editing by Thomas Escritt\n ",
