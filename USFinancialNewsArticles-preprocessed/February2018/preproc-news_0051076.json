The company said it was “aggressively pursuing a larger project” without giving specific details. Energy Transfer Partners said it brought Phase 1 of its Permian Express 3 pipeline online in the fourth quarter, with additional volumes expected to come online later this year. The company said it is also evaluating an additional 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) expansion on the line. Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York Editing by Chizu Nomiyama",
