    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic member of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee expressed concern on Sunday that President Donald Trump could censor the Democratic rebuttal to a Republican memo alleging anti-Trump bias at the FBI and Justice Department.\n“I think he would redact (the Democratic document) in a fit of hypocrisy,” Representative Michael Quigley told Reuters in a phone interview. “I have more concern about the president than I do about my committee. The president is seriously delusional.”\nReporting by Jonathan Landay; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
