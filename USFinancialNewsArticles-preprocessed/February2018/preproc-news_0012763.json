    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 3:45 PM / Updated 37 minutes ago Building world's tallest tower going ahead after Saudi corruption purge Reem Shamseddine 4 Min Read \nJEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Construction of the world’s tallest skyscraper in Jeddah is going ahead, the head of the consortium behind the $1.5 billion project said, despite the detention of some businessmen backing the plan in Saudi Arabia’s crackdown on corruption. \nHis comments were a sign that the government is trying to prevent the purge from disrupting major economic development schemes, even as authorities seize billions of dollars of assets from detainees in settlements of allegations against them. \n“We have faced delays. In projects of this magnitude you always have delays -- I hope we’ll recover the delays we’ve had. We will be open for business by 2020, hopefully,” Mounib Hammoud, chief executive of Jeddah Economic Co (JEC), said in an interview. \nJEC is owned by Saudi investors including Kingdom Holding Co, which has a 33 percent stake, and construction giant Saudi Binladin Group, which has 16.6 percent and is the project’s main contractor. Both those companies were affected by the corruption purge. \nKingdom’s owner, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, was detained for nearly three months before being freed in January. He insisted publicly he was innocent of any wrongdoing, but Saudi officials said he agreed to an undisclosed financial settlement after admitting to unspecified “violations”. \nBinladin chairman Bakr Bin Laden and some family members were also detained, and the firm said last month that part of their shareholdings in it might be transferred to the state in a settlement. Most or all of the men have now been released. \nThe government said last week that financial settlements reached with dozens of people totalled over $100 billion so far, and that assets including real estate, shareholdings, securities and cash were being seized. A model of Jeddah Tower is seen at the office of Jeddah Economic Company, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia February 6, 2018. REUTERS/Reem Baeshen \nHammoud said there had been no changes in ownership of the JEC, however. \nBinladin has been hurt by financial difficulties in the past couple of years as the construction sector has slumped. But Hisham Jomah, chief development officer of the project, said Binladin retained enough manpower and technical capacity to build the record-breaking skyscraper.
