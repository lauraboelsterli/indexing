    "text": "HAYWARD, Calif., Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Dash Robotics, a Silicon Valley hardware startup developing futuristic, app-controlled robots, today announced it has raised an additional $2.7 million in funding, led by Ironfire Ventures.\nDuring the 2017 holiday season, Dash Robotics made the big-box debut of its first product in partnership with Mattel, Inc., Kamigami Robots, currently available at Amazon, Target, Toys\"R\"Us, and other major retail locations. The company plans to use the new funding to partner with large toy and entertainment companies to bring more connected toys to life.\n\"We're excited to be on the cutting edge of the toy industry, helping some of the biggest brands build totally new play experiences,\" said Nick Kohut, co-founder and CEO of Dash Robotics. \"This round of funding is going to supercharge our technology development and let us expand our efforts with new partners and brands.\"\nThe Dash Robotics team consists of PhD roboticists, Stanford University trained engineers, and toy industry veterans. Their technology utilizes Bluetooth, computer vision, and machine learning to create novel and engaging toys and play patterns.\nKamigami, a series of $49 robot kits, was created in partnership with Mattel, Inc. Attributed as one of the most sought-after children's product of the 2017 holiday season, once assembled, the Kamigami robots can be programmed or steered remotely using a mobile device.\nIn late 2017, Dash Robotics acquired another connected toy startup, Bots Alive , right on the heels of their partnership with Mattel. The Austin, TX based company specializes in computer vision and artificial intelligence, giving toy robots the ability to act autonomously, respond to each other, and learn from their environment.\n\"We look forward to unveiling the capabilities of our connected toy platform through partnerships with major toy brands and hit movie franchises. There's going to be some very cool stuff hitting the shelves this year, not to mention 2019,\" continued Kohut.\nAbout Dash Robotics\nDash Robotics is building the backbone of connected toys by creating technology to reimagine what's possible for the world's leading toy and gaming brands. Founded in 2013, Dash has developed multiple connected toy products, including the Kamigami Robots product line. Dash Robotics is based in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dash-robotics-raises-27-million-to-focus-on-building-long-term-partnerships-with-major-toy-and-entertainment-brands-300599278.html\nSOURCE Dash Robotics",
