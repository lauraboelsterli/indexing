    "text": "RUSTON, La., Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Century Next Financial Corporation (OTCQB:CTUY), the holding company of Bank of Ruston with $283.6 million in assets, today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Performance\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Century Next Financial Corporation (the “Company”) had net income after tax of $2.4 million compared to net income of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $126,000 or 5.1%. Earnings per share (EPS) for the full year were $2.26 per basic and $2.18 per diluted share compared to $2.39 per basic and $2.34 per diluted share reported for the full year ended December 31, 2016. Net income for 2017 included a charge of $414,000, or $0.39 per basic and $0.38 per diluted share, related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December of 2017 for the cumulative effect on deferred taxes.\nBalance Sheet\nOverall, total assets increased by $44.2 million or 18.5% to $283.6 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $239.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe largest component of assets, loans, net of deferred fees and costs and the allowance for loan losses, increased $35.9 million or 17.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. Total net loans at December 31, 2017 were $237.4 million compared to $201.5 million at December 31, 2016. Net loan growth year over year was broad based with total loans secured by real estate up $35.7 million and commercial, non-real estate loans and all other loans up $909,000.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2017 increased $36.5 million or 19.1% to $227.9 million compared to $191.4 million at December 31, 2016. Year over year, interest-bearing checking deposits were up $23.7 million, noninterest-bearing deposits were up $6.1 million, time deposits were up $4.2 million, savings deposits were up $3.3 million, and money market deposits were down $796,000.\nTotal short-term borrowings decreased to $3.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $20.0 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $16.7 million, while long-term borrowings increased 22.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $179,000 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $22.0 million. The net decrease in short-term borrowings was primarily due to the maturity of a Federal Home Loan (FHLB) discount note in December for $20.0 million. The increase in long-term borrowings was primarily due to the addition of a new 2-year FHLB discount note for $22.0 million.\nIncome Statement\nNet interest income was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This was an increase of $1.3 million, or 13.8%. The increase for the year was primarily from interest income earned on loans from increased volume.\nThe provision for loan losses amounted to $645,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $480,000 in provision for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $165,000 or 34.4% in loan loss provision year over year was primarily a reflection of loan growth and an increased risk awareness and identification to strengthen the allowance for loan losses.\nTotal non-interest income amounted to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $283,000 or 20.7%. The increase was due to increases of $298,000 in loan servicing release fees, $102,000 in service charges on deposits, $81,000 in other income, offset by a net loss from sales of loans and foreclosed assets of $198,000.\nTotal non-interest expense increased by $1.0 million or 16.0% to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase year over year was primarily due to a $730,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits due to staff additions, compensation increases, and pension expense and health insurance increases, an $87,000 increase in data processing, and a net increase in all other operating expenses of $206,000. The Company efficiency ratio, a measure of expense as a percent of total income, increased to 61.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 60.7% for the same period in 2016.\nOther Financial Information\nNonperforming assets, including loans past due 90 days or more, nonaccrual loans, and other foreclosed assets, decreased from $1.05 million at December 31, 2016 to $750,000 at December 31, 2017. Allowance for loan losses were $1,968,000 or 0.82% of total loans at December 31, 2017 compared to $1,366,000 million or 0.67% of total loans at December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $43,000 compared to net charge-offs of $101,000 during the same period in 2016. The ratios of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding were 0.02% and 0.05% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdditional Information\nCentury Next Financial Corporation is the holding company for Bank of Ruston (the “Bank”) which conducts business from its main office in Ruston, Louisiana and two full-service branch offices.
