    "text": "OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today Netsmart announced it has acquired HomeCare Accounting Solutions (HAS), a cloud-based software company that automates back-office and clinical field operations of home care agencies such as home health, hospice, palliative care and private duty. This acquisition signifies another important piece for the Netsmart platform that will represent a new standard for the post-acute community.\n“Post-acute providers have an opportunity to take the lead when it comes to managing a person’s healthcare journey and coordinating the performance of a variety of providers,” said Netsmart CEO Mike Valentine. “In a value-based world, providers who can prove they can coordinate care across multiple venues and manage the complexities and outcomes will be well positioned for success. The ability to have a seamless connection between clinical and financial will only make reporting easier as providers can show cost savings correlated with clinical outcomes.”\nNetsmart announced its acquisition of DeVero in July 2017 and has been deploying enhanced solutions to home health and hospice clients over the last six months. The addition of HAS to the Netsmart suite of solutions will enable a more integrated workflow for clients who use our DeVero CareRecord.\n“Clients want a SaaS approach where all of the operations are managed for them so they can concentrate on what they do best: patient care,” said HAS CEO Mike DelCollo. “We are looking forward to the deep integration and streamlined processes Netsmart provides and giving our clients one system with a single, simple workflow.”\nAs part of this acquisition, Netsmart will further the innovation of the two solutions to create a single unified solution that can grow and adapt as healthcare shifts to different care and payment models. The go-forward platform will maintain focus on the three principles that have made it one of the fastest growing solutions in home care – simple, scalable and affordable.\n“The addition of HAS to our Netsmart family provides our clients who leverage the DeVero CareRecord with a one-stop-shop for clinical and financial solutions,” said Valentine. “We have a long-standing relationship with HAS in serving a shared client base. With this step forward, we will essentially move out of the interface world with HAS and into the integration world. Our mutual clients will benefit greatly by this step.”\nAbout HomeCare Accounting Solutions\nHomeCare Accounting Solutions cloud-based software is a powerful and easy-to-use system that increases the efficiency and productivity of home health agencies.
