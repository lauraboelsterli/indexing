Operating and financial highlights appear below:\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180226006530/en/\nCoreLogic President & CEO Frank Martell (Photo: Business Wire)\nFourth Quarter\nRevenues of $454 million were down 4% as the benefits of growth in insurance & spatial solutions and international as well as pricing actions, market share gains and new products were offset by the impact of an estimated 15% decline in U.S. mortgage origination unit volumes. Operating income from continuing operations rose 13% to $65 million driven principally by productivity and cost management program benefits. Net income from continuing operations increased $59 million to $65 million fueled by operating upsides and a one-time tax benefit attributable to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”). Diluted EPS from continuing operations was up $0.71 to $0.78. Adjusted EPS totaled $0.55 per share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $117 million, up from $116 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%. Repurchased 1.6 million common shares for $75 million.\nFull-Year 2017\nRevenues of $1,851 million were 5% lower than 2016 as an estimated 20% decrease in U.S. mortgage market unit volumes offset growth in insurance & spatial solutions and international as well as the benefits from pricing actions, market share gains and new products. Operating income from continuing operations was down 14% to $239 million as lower mortgage market volumes and the cost of a third quarter legal settlement more than offset benefits from organic growth, productivity and cost management programs. Net income from continuing operations increased 36% to $150 million primarily due to benefits attributable to the Tax Reform Act, organic growth and cost productivity. Diluted EPS from continuing operations rose $0.52 to $1.75. Adjusted EPS totaled $2.37. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $480 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%. Repurchased 4.6 million shares (5% of outstanding common shares) for $207 million.\n“CoreLogic delivered outstanding results both operationally and financially, in 2017. We achieved the top end of our guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS as we significantly outperformed U.S. mortgage market volume trends for the sixth straight year. Importantly, we continued to aggressively invest in building market-leading solutions that provide our clients with unique insights and connect the totality of the real estate ecosystem. These investments position us to be a long-term strategic partner for our clients and the broader real estate industry as we drive to transform underwriting and property valuation, risk management and ongoing monitoring solutions. In addition, the natural benefits of operating leverage driven by our scale and relentless focus on cost productivity has resulted in higher margins and the creation of a durable and highly cash generative business model. This model allowed us to return $207 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 5% of our outstanding share count in 2017,” said Frank Martell, President and Chief Executive Officer of CoreLogic.\n\"We head into 2018 excited by the prospects offered by a stable and growing purchase-driven mortgage market in the U.S. where we have built strong market leading positions that are poised to capitalize on the benefits of high operating leverage and efficiency. In addition, our expanding footprint in insurance & spatial solutions and international markets provide us with sizable opportunities for high margin non-cyclical growth,” Martell added.\nFourth Quarter Financial Summary\nFourth quarter reported revenues totaled $454 million compared with $475 million in the same 2016 period. During the quarter, pricing-related gains and contributions from new products in both the Property Intelligence and Risk Management (PIRM) and Underwriting & Workflow Solutions (UWS) segments and gains from acquisitions partially offset the impact of lower U.S. mortgage loan origination unit volumes. PIRM revenues rose 5% to $180 million, driven principally by market-share gains in insurance & spatial solutions and the benefits of recent acquisitions focused on property insights. UWS segment revenues totaled $276 million, down 10% from 2016 levels, as benefits from pricing, market-share gains and valuation solutions platform upsides partially offset lower mortgage market volumes and the planned diversification by a significant appraisal management client.\nOperating income from continuing operations totaled $65 million for the fourth quarter compared with $58 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The 13% increase in operating income was principally attributable to cost productivity related gains and growth and margin improvement in insurance & spatial solutions, credit solutions and international operations. Fourth quarter operating income margin was 14% compared with 12% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFourth quarter net income from continuing operations totaled $65 million compared with $6 million in the same 2016 period. This increase was primarily attributable to a one-time net tax benefit of $38 million attributable to the Tax Reform Act and a fourth quarter 2016 non-cash impairment charge associated with the wind down of two investments in affiliates which had no 2017 counterpart. Diluted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.78 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $0.07 in 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.55, essentially in line with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA aggregated $117 million in the fourth quarter compared with $116 million in 2016. The increase was principally driven by organic revenue growth and cost productivity which offset the impact of lower U.S. mortgage market volumes. PIRM segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $50 million compared to $51 million in 2016. UWS segment adjusted EBITDA was $72 million, down from $76 million in 2016, as declines in U.S. mortgage loan activity and lower appraisal volumes attributable to the planned diversification by a significant appraisal management client offset benefits from organic growth and cost management programs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $119 million compared with $72 million at December 31, 2016. Total debt as of December 31, 2017 was $1,777 million compared with $1,619 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had available capacity on its revolving credit facility of $700 million.\nNet operating cash provided by continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $380 million. Free cash flow (FCF) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $304 million, which represented 63% of adjusted EBITDA. FCF is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities less capital expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, capitalized data and other intangible assets.\nDuring 2017, the Company repurchased 4.6 million of its common shares for $207 million. This resulted in a reduction of CoreLogic's fully diluted share count of approximately 5%.\nTax Reform Act Impacts\nIn December 2017, the Tax Reform Act was passed reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective as of January 1, 2018, assessing a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings that were previously tax deferred and creating new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $38 million provisional tax benefit related to the remeasurement of its deferred tax balances. CoreLogic is currently analyzing foreign unremitted earnings to reasonably estimate the effects of the one-time transition tax and expect to record the transition tax during 2018. Based on currently available interpretations and information regarding the likely impacts of the Tax Reform Act, the Company projects its normalized effective tax planning rate for 2018 will be approximately 26%, down from 35% in 2017.\nSegment and Financial Reporting\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company refined its operating segmentation to reflect progress made in its ongoing strategic transformation into a scaled provider of unique property insight, risk management and underwriting solutions. The Company's updated segmentation reflects CoreLogic’s strategic focus on accelerating growth by combining our products and services into unique business solutions, building seamless connections across the real estate ecosystem, driving innovation and enhancing our business processes. Effective as of December 31, 2017, the Company adopted the following operating and reporting segmentation:\nProperty Intelligence and Risk Management Solutions (PIRM) segment includes the Company’s property insights solutions as well as our insurance & spatial solutions and international operations. The Underwriting & Workflow Solutions (UWS) segment comprises the Company’s property tax, credit, flood data and valuation solutions.\nThe Company believes this updated reporting convention more effectively aligns with our market and operating strategies.

Risks and uncertainties exist that may cause the results to differ materially from those set forth in these Factors that could cause the anticipated results to differ from those described in the include the risks and uncertainties set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended or updated by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These additional risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: limitations on access to or increase in prices for data from external sources, including government and public record sources; changes in applicable government legislation, regulations and the level of regulatory scrutiny affecting our customers or us, including with respect to consumer financial services and the use of public records and consumer data; compromises in the security of our data, including the transmission of confidential information or systems interruptions; difficult conditions in the mortgage and consumer lending industries and the economy generally; our ability to protect proprietary rights; our cost reduction program, technology and growth strategies and our ability to effectively and efficiently implement them; risks related to the outsourcing of services and international operations; our indebtedness and the restrictions in our various debt agreements; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of certain acquisitions and/or divestitures and the timing thereof; the inability to control the operations or dividend policies of our partially-owned affiliates; and impairments in our goodwill or other intangible assets. The speak only as of the date they are made. The Company does not undertake to update to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the are made.\nUse of Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) Financial Measures\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures which are provided only as supplemental information. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or a substitute for U.S. GAAP. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA or projected adjusted earnings per share to respective GAAP results due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of special charges or gains.\nThe Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and FCF, provides useful supplemental information to investors and management regarding the Company's financial condition and results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income from continuing operations adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation, non-operating gains/losses and other adjustments. Adjusted EPS is defined as income from continuing operations, net of tax per diluted share, adjusted for stock compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, non-operating gains/losses, and other adjustments; tax affected at an assumed effective tax rate of 35% and 36% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company's projected 2018 effective tax rate of 26%, to be included in adjusted EPS, reflects expected benefits from the Tax Reform Act. FCF is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities less capital expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, capitalized data and other intangible assets. Other firms may calculate non-GAAP measures differently than CoreLogic, which limits comparability between companies.\nCORELOGIC, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nUNAUDITED\nFor the Three
