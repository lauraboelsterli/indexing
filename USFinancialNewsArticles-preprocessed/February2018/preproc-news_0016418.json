The Advisory Board's role will be to provide ongoing counsel and strategic guidance as the company scales its equity crowd-funding platform.\n\"We're honored to have such an esteemed and accomplished group of advisors onboard to help us take the company to the next level of growth,\" said Chris Rawley, Harvest Returns' Founder. \"The depth and breadth of industry and leadership experience each member brings to the team is impressive.\"\nDeborah \"Deb\" Dunie brings over 30 years of senior level business experience to Harvest Returns through her experience at key executive positions with leading technology companies. Deb retired in 2015 as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of CACI International, a worldwide information solutions and services provider. During her tenure at CACI she focused on driving the solutions/services portfolio, and was instrumental in identifying and closing 18 mergers/acquisitions aligned to the corporate growth strategy.\nMike Gumina is Chief Executive Officer of RiceTec, a privately-owned company that develops and produces hybrid rice seed for American and international markets. Mike has been engaged with production agriculture and the seed industry for over 35 years.

Additionally, Adam has been on the Board of Directors at several successful privately held companies, including Crosfield Electronics and Benchmark Technologies in the U.K., Biometric Access Corp. and Apex Interactive and in the U.S. Adam provides board advisory services and is a certified Fellow in the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) where he is a regular speaker on risk management.\nBrigadier General (retired) Stephen Joyce formed Strategic Solutions in 2012 upon retiring after 33 years of service as an U.S. Army Aviator, where he commanded units at all levels from Platoon through Brigade. Strategic Solutions provides strategic planning, consulting, coaching, and business development services to a diverse group of clients, which includes private and publicly held companies, the National Guard Bureau, Departments of Defense, State, and NATO. He is also a Governance and Board Leadership Fellow of the National Association of Corporate Directors and currently sits on a variety of corporate and private boards.\nDavid Stanton serves as president of SUEZ in North America's Utility Operations and Federal Services and is responsible for overseeing the operations and management of regulated water and wastewater businesses across the nation. David has over 25 years of experience in the water industry, in the United States and abroad.
