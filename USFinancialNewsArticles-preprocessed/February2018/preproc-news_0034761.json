M&Q Holdings is an investment portfolio company of Capital Partners ( www.capitalpartners.com ), specializing in low-leverage financing of unique, growth-oriented companies.\nM&Q Holdings was attracted to Flavorseal’s culture of innovation, creativity, and its knowledgeable, customer-focused workforce. In addition to Flavorseal’s flexible packaging, netting, packaging equipment and consumables products, M&Q is especially excited by Flavorseal’s Seasoning Transfer Technology, which incorporates seasonings and bold flavors into various forms of flexible packaging for its food processing customers.\nMichael Schmal, President and CEO of M&Q Holdings stated, “We truly believe that Flavorseal’s Seasoning Transfer Technology will revolutionize the way packaging is utilized in the protein and food industries. Instead of just protecting and extending shelf life of food products, Seasoning Transfer Technology allows the packaging to become an integral part of the product itself, by enhancing the appearance, quality, taste and aroma to food. We think this technology has the potential to dramatically change the food processing industry, and we are fortunate that Chris and Colleen Carroll, who are the owners and founders of Flavorseal, chose M&Q to be their partner to accelerate this transformation.”\nChris Carroll, President and CEO of Flavorseal, agreed, “I’m extremely proud of Flavorseal’s long history of developing cutting-edge packaging products like Seasoning Transfer Technology.
