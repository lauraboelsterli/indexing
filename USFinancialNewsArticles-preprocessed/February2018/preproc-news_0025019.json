TSN 1.29% says the nationwide shortage of trucks and drivers will add $200 million to its costs this year, and the WSJ’s Jacob Bunge reports the largest meat processor says that along with rising wages for its workers will raise prices for U.S. consumers . Tyson Chief Executive Tom Hayes says the company is already talking with grocery stores, restaurants and distributors about raising prices. Tyson’s stance is a sign of the stresses that are spreading across supply chains as consumer-facing companies rush to take advantage of strong demand but find distribution channels squeezed, partly because operators have kept capacity tamped down through a long stretch of lackluster growth. Tyson’s 11% growth in sales in its most recent quarter signals the company is hitting a new, high-growth period, but getting to the market also comes with higher shipping costs.\nThe “Amazon effect” is hitting the shelves at Whole Foods, and that means suppliers will get squeezed. The supermarket chain is asking suppliers of all sizes to pay new rates for prime shelf space, a new step in owner Amazon.com Inc.’s effort to remake the grocery’s supply chain even as Amazon resets the Whole Foods approach to consumers . Many suppliers will see an increase from the average $25,000 fee companies pay to be featured in the stores’ most-visible areas, the WSJ’s Heather Haddon and Sarah Nassauer report, and the company wants suppliers to offer bigger discounts on their products to earn the space. The changes signal that Whole Foods is resetting its supplier relationships after years spent gaining cachet with upscale shoppers by highlighting new, niche brands. Now, the company is matching centralized purchasing decisions, tighter inventory control and new sales-tracking technology to understand whether those consumers are reaching for the goods on the shelves.\nAmazon is updating the demand side at Whole Foods while it works on the supply side. The e-commerce giant plans to start delivering Whole Foods groceries through its fast Prime Now delivery option in four markets, the WSJ’s Laura Stevens reports, in the first significant integration of its e-commerce operations with the brick-and-mortar grocery chain . The operation suggests Amazon is growing more confident that it can mix the inventory demands of online fulfillment and stocking at stores, although the limited rollout—Dallas; Cincinnati; Virginia Beach, Va.; and Austin, Texas—show the company is still testing whether it can manage the daily, often differing needs. Amazon has struggled to make its own grocery delivery business work, and scaled back its AmazonFresh delivery arm last year. Whole Foods brings a big physical presence in big markets, however, and it comes as other grocery chains are working out their own delivery operations.\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS Photo: Bloomberg News Boeing Co. looks to be ready to make another big move to take control of its supply chain. The aircraft maker is in talks to buy aerospace parts maker Woodward Inc. the WSJ’s Dana Mattioli, Bradley Hope and Doug Cameron report, in a deal that would give Boeing a manufacturer of cockpit systems, flight control hydraulics, engine parts and other components that go into military and commercial jets. A deal would extend Boeing’s efforts to bring in-house more of supplier business as it looks to cut costs and avoid the supply-snags that have dogged the jet maker and rival Airbus SE. Buying out suppliers is hardly new in manufacturing, but Boeing has been highly aggressive in pursuing more control of the many parts that go into its aircraft. That’s partly because owning more of the production supply chain will bring the company more of the lucrative after-market for parts and maintenance.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Freight is a tough one, it’s affecting all of our businesses. Ultimately, the consumer’s going to pay for it at some point. ’\n—Tom Hayes, CEO of Tyson Foods.\nNumber of the Day 10.1% Year-over-year decline in U.S. rail shipments of automobiles and car parts in January, according to the Association of American Railroads.\nIN OTHER NEWS Amazon is preparing to launch a delivery service for businesses that would position the company to directly compete with United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp.
