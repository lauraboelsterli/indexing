    "text": "LONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Germanyâ€™s benchmark 10-year government bond yield dipped to a one-month low on Monday, as unease ahead of a national election in Italy on March 4 supported demand for safe-haven bonds.\nThe German 10-year Bund yield fell to a low of 0.644 percent , edging lower with most euro zone bond yields in early trade.\nGerman Bund futures opened 17 ticks higher at 159.65.
