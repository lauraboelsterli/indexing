    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian government air strikes killed 59 civilians, including 15 children, and injured 139 others on Thursday, the fourth day of attacks against a rebel-held region, a war monitor reported.\nWarplanes pounded various parts of eastern Ghouta, a besieged pocket of satellite towns and farms near the Syrian capital of Damascus, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Syrian army.\nThe death toll rose after the bombing of a market in the village of Arbin, where air strikes killed 21, including nine children and three women, the monitor said.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria expressed distress at the deteriorating security and humanitarian conditions in the area.\n“Thousands are struggling to survive without aid, or a safe place from the line of fire” in eastern Ghouta, it said in a tweet.\nThe Syrian government has repeatedly said it only targets militants.\nIn Damascus, shelling of the old city quarter by rebel factions in eastern Ghouta killed two civilians and damaged houses and properties.\nThe United Nations called on Tuesday for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Syria of at least a month.\nReporting by Ellen Francis, Dahlia Nehme in Beirut, Kinda Makieh in Damascus, Tom Miles in Geneva; editing by Larry King\n ",
