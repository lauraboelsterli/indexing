    "text": "Record Quarterly Sales of $533 million and EBITDA 1 of $90 million\nRecord Annual Sales of $2 billion and EBITDA 1 of $288 million\nQuarterly Free Cash Flow from Operations of $83 Million (or $1.19 per Share)\nNet Debt to Invested Capital Ratio of 12%\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- INTERFOR CORPORATION (“Interfor” or the “Company”) (TSX:IFP) recorded net earnings in Q4’17 of $36.2 million, or $0.52 per share, compared to $16.8 million, or $0.24 per share in Q3’17 and $26.6 million, or $0.38 per share in Q4’16. Adjusted net earnings 1 in Q4’17 were $45.1 million or $0.64 per share, compared to $20.0 million, or $0.29 per share in Q3’17 and $17.7 million, or $0.25 per share in Q4’16.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 was a record $89.5 million on sales of $532.8 million in Q4’17 versus $60.5 million on sales of $489.2 million in Q3’17.\nFor the year, net earnings were $97.2 million, or $1.39 per share, compared to $65.6 million or $0.94 per share in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA and sales were both records at $287.8 million and $2.0 billion, respectively.\nNotable items in the quarter included:\n• Strong Lumber Prices\nThe key benchmark prices improved quarter-over-quarter with the SYP Composite, Western SPF Composite and KD H-F Stud 2x4 9’ increasing by US$30, US$35 and US$4 per mfbm, respectively. Interfor’s average lumber selling price increased $39 from Q3’17 to a record $650 per mfbm on 686 million board feet of lumber sales.\n• Increased Production\nTotal lumber production was 655 million board feet or 10 million board feet more than the prior quarter. Production in the U.S. South region increased to 296 million board feet from 281 million board feet in the preceding quarter. The B.C. and U.S. Northwest regions accounted for 219 million board feet and 140 million board feet, respectively, compared to 225 million board feet and 139 million board feet in Q3’17, respectively.\n• Significant Cash Flow\nInterfor generated $83.4 million of cash from operations before changes in working capital, or $1.19 per share, plus a $3.3 million reduction in working capital, for total cash generated from operations of $86.7 million.\nCapital spending was $25.0 million on a mix of high-return discretionary, maintenance and woodlands projects.\nNet debt ended the quarter at $119.3 million, or 12.3% of invested capital.\n• Tax Reform Impact\nThe U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017 reduced the effective tax rate on Interfor’s U.S. operations from approximately 37% to 24%. As a result, Q4’17 deferred tax expense includes a $2.9 million recovery related to the preceding three quarters of 2017. The Company continues to have significant tax loss carry-forwards, with US$132.4 million and $66.7 million available as at December 31, 2017 in the U.S. and Canada, respectively.\n1 Refer to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net earnings in the Non-GAAP Measures section\nStrategic Capital Plan\nInterfor continues to make progress on its multi-year strategic capital plan that involves a number of discretionary projects designed to capture the opportunities within its current operating platform and to pursue opportunities for further growth.\nThe previously announced large scale projects at the Company’s Meldrim and Monticello sawmills, which represent a total investment of approximately US$65 million, are on track for completion in Q1’19. These two projects are designed to add annual lumber production capacity of approximately 150 million board feet and enhance operating margins at these operations. Positive progress on a series of smaller debottlenecking and optimization projects is also being made.\nOther large capital projects to enhance existing operations are continuing to be advanced from an engineering and feasibility standpoint and will be sequenced after the Meldrim and Monticello projects. These projects will be subject to Board approval in the normal course.\nAssessment of the greenfield sawmill opportunity in the Central Region of the U.S. South continues with a decision on the project expected by mid-2018. This sawmill would produce in excess of 200 million board feet of lumber per year for an estimated total cost, including working capital and start-up costs, of approximately US$115 million.\nSoftwood Lumber Duties\nIn Q4’17, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced amended final rates for countervailing and anti-dumping duties of 14.19% and 6.04% on softwood lumber shipments from Canada, down from the preliminary rates set in Q2’17 of 19.88% and 6.87%, respectively. In addition, negative findings were made in respect of critical circumstances for both countervailing and anti-dumping duties. To reflect lower amended final rates set for U.S. countervailing and anti-dumping duties, Interfor recorded a $3.7 million reduction to duties expense in Q4’17 relating to shipments in Q2’17 and Q3’17.\nIn Q4’17, Interfor shipped approximately 109 million board feet from its Canadian operations to the U.S. market, which represented approximately 16% of the Company’s total lumber sales.\nInterfor is of the view that these duties imposed by the U.S. are without merit and are politically driven.﻿ Interfor will continue to work with the B.C. and Canadian governments to vigorously defend Canada’s position through various appeal processes.\nExecutive Appointments Announced\nAt its meeting earlier today, the Company’s Board of Directors confirmed the appointments of Ian Fillinger as Senior Vice-President & Chief Operating Officer, and Marty Juravsky as Senior Vice-President & Chief Financial Officer, effective February 9, 2018. Fillinger, who is 49, joined Interfor in 2005 as General Manager of the Company’s Adams Lake Division and has served in a series of increasingly responsible positions since that time. He was appointed Senior Vice-President & Head of Operations with responsibility for all of the Company’s operations and capital project activities in December 2015. Juravsky, who is 54, and a CPA, CA, joined Interfor in 2012 in a consulting capacity and took formal responsibility for the Company’s corporate development activities in 2013. He has more than twenty years of experience working with some of North America’s largest investment banks including Salomon Brothers/Citigroup and National Bank Financial. Immediately prior to his appointment, Juravsky served as the Company’s Senior Vice-President, Corporate Development & Strategy.\nSummary of Quarterly Results (1)\n2017 2016 Unit Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Financial Performance (2) Total sales $MM 532.8 489.2 511.4 456.8 442.3 457.6 458.8 433.9 Lumber $MM 446.0 410.2 433.7 389.6 363.5 374.8 371.1 348.9 Logs, residual products and other $MM 86.8 79.0 77.7 67.2 78.8 82.8 87.7 85.0 Operating earnings $MM 47.9 28.3 42.7 30.4 22.3 20.1 30.0 3.5 Net earnings $MM 36.2 16.8 24.5 19.7 26.6 15.1 23.2 0.8 Net earnings per share, basic $/share 0.52 0.24 0.35 0.28 0.38 0.22 0.33 0.01 Adjusted net earnings (3) $MM 45.1 20.0 28.7 22.7 17.7 20.7 17.5 2.7 Adjusted net earnings per share, basic (3) $/share 0.64 0.29 0.41 0.32 0.25 0.30 0.25 0.04 Adjusted EBITDA (3) $MM 89.5 60.5 77.4 60.3 51.3 58.1 56.9 33.4 Shares outstanding - end of period million 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 Shares outstanding - weighted average million 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 Operating Performance Lumber production million fbm 655 645 655 640 607 628 637 618 Total lumber sales million fbm 686 671 675 645 619 647 658 637 Lumber sales - Interfor produced million fbm 666 650 654 624 598 627 634 609 Lumber sales - wholesale and commission million fbm 20 21 21 21 21 20 24 28 Lumber - average selling price (4) $/thousand fbm 650 611 642 604 588 580 564 548 Average USD/CAD exchange rate (5) 1 USD in CAD 1.2713 1.2528 1.3449 1.3238 1.3341 1.3050 1.2886 1.3732 Closing USD/CAD exchange rate (5) 1 USD in CAD 1.2545 1.2480 1.2977 1.3322 1.3427 1.3117 1.3009 1.2971\nNotes: (1) Figures in this table may not equal or sum to figures presented elsewhere due to rounding.

Liquidity\nBalance Sheet\nInterfor strengthened its financial position throughout 2017, with strong cash flow generated from operations used to repay debt and fund capital projects. Net debt at December 31, 2017 was $119.3 million, or 12.3% of invested capital, representing a decrease of $170.3 million from the level of net debt at December 31, 2016.\nA strengthening of the Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar by 6.6%, contributed $17.7 million to the net debt reduction in 2017 over 2016 as all debt held was denominated in U.S. Dollars.\nFor the 3 months ended For the year ended Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Sep. 30, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Thousands of Dollars 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 Net debt Net debt, period opening, CAD $ 177,787 $ 346,929 $ 218,252 $ 289,551 $ 452,303 Net drawing (repayment) on credit facilities, CAD (1 ) (66,178 ) 2 (40,217 ) (143,882 ) Impact on U.S. Dollar denominated debt from (strengthening) weakening CAD 1,301 9,678 (9,942 ) (17,704 ) (16,056 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents, CAD (59,787 ) (878 ) (30,525 ) (112,330 ) (2,814 ) Net debt, period ending, CAD $ 119,300 $ 289,551 $ 177,787 $ 119,300 $ 289,551 Net debt components by currency U.S. Dollar debt, period opening, USD $ 200,000 $ 274,709 $ 200,000 $ 230,000 $ 338,699 Net repayment on credit facilities, USD - (44,709 ) - (30,000 ) (108,699 ) U.S. Dollar debt, period ending, USD $ 200,000 $ 230,000 $ 200,000 200,000 230,000 Spot rate, period end 1.2545 1.3427 U.S. Dollar debt expressed in CAD 250,900 308,821 Cash and cash equivalents, CAD (131,600 ) (19,270 ) Net debt, period ending, CAD $ 119,300 $ 289,551 Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes Interfor’s credit facilities and availability as of December 31, 2017:\nRevolving Senior U.S. Operating Term Secured Operating Thousands of Canadian Dollars Line Line Notes Line Total Available line of credit $ 65,000 $ 200,000 $ 250,900 $ 62,725 $ 578,625 Maximum borrowing available $ 65,000 $ 200,000 $ 250,900 $ 62,725 $ 578,625 Less: Drawings - - 250,900 - 250,900 Outstanding letters of credit included in line utilization 12,515 - - 2,634 15,149 Unused portion of facility $ 52,485 $ 200,000 $ - $ 60,091 312,576 Add: Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 131,263 Available liquidity at December 31, 2017 $ 443,839 As of December 31, 2017, the Company had commitments for capital expenditures totaling $27.3 million for both maintenance and discretionary capital projects.\nInterfor continues to maintain its disciplined focus on monitoring discretionary capital expenditures, optimizing inventory levels and matching production with offshore and domestic demand.\nAs at December 31, 2017, the Company had net working capital of $257.1 million and available liquidity of $443.8 million, including cash and borrowing capacity on operating and term line facilities. These resources, in addition to cash generated from operations, will be used to support working capital requirements, debt servicing commitments and capital expenditures. We believe that Interfor will have sufficient liquidity to fund operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis release makes reference to the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted net earnings per share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net debt to invested capital and Operating cash flow per share (before working capital changes) which are used by the Company and certain investors to evaluate operating performance and financial position.
