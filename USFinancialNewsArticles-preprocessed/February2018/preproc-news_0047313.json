    "text": "MAJURO, Marshall Islands, Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pioneer Marine Inc. and its subsidiaries (OSLO-OTC:PNRM) (\"Pioneer Marine,\" or the \"Company\") a leading shipowner and global drybulk handysize transportation service provider announced its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights:\nNet Income/(loss) Net income of $2.5 million or $0.09 per share for Q4 2017, increased by $6.3 million compared to a loss of $3.8 million for Q4 2016. Net loss of $5.0 million or $0.17 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $22.2 million compared to a net loss of $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTime Charter equivalent (TCE) revenue $13.7 million for Q4 2017, increased by $4.3 million or 46% compared to $9.4 million for Q4 2016; Similarly, TCE per day was increased by 49% to $9,391 per day for Q4 2017 as compared to $6,303 per day for Q4 2016. $45.8 million for the YTD 2017, increased by $16.8 million or 58% compared to $29.0 million for the same period in 2016; Similarly, TCE per day was increased by 53% to $7,980 for the YTD 2017 as compared to $5,227 per for YTD 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA* $5.8 million positive Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2017, increased by $5.3 million compared to $0.5 million for Q4 2016. $12.9 million positive Adjusted EBITDA for the YTD2017, increased by $14.7 million compared a negative figure of $1.8 million for the same period in 2016.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 include $1.3 million of restructuring costs and $0.1 million loss on vessel disposition, excluding these expenses, the net loss is $3.6 million or $0.12 per share basic and diluted for year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, six vessels completed their Special Surveys resulting in Drydock expenditure of $3.2 million that are recognized as operating costs in the period.\nLiquidity & Capital Resources:\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had a total liquidity of $73.8 million inclusive of $12.5 million in restricted cash. The Company has no capital commitments .\n*For reconciliation and definition of Adjusted EBITDA refer to “Summary of Operating Data (unaudited)” section within this press release.\nTorben Janholt, Chief Executive Officer commented: “2017 was overall a very good year for our Company. We have reported a positive EBITDA of $5.8 million and a net profit of $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. These positive results are the outcome of the successful Company’s restructuring within the year as well as further activities undertaken by the new Executive Management Team to streamline operations. Our organization and operational platform is now more straightforward and adaptable leading to additional efficiencies and improved results.\n“Further, 2017 will be remembered as a year of recovery for the dry bulk owners in general, after one of the most challenging periods in almost 40 years. The fourth quarter is always the strongest period for the dry bulk market and this year was not an exception, creating expectations for a sustained recovery in 2018. The average BHSI index stood at $9,369 per day for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to $7,371 per day for the third quarter, reflecting a 27% increase. The market increase was mainly driven by China’s substitution of low quality iron ore and coal towards seaborne imports of higher quality.\n“Looking forward, the dry bulk fleet is expected to grow this year at a pace that matches the expected demand growth of 2019. We believe that 2018 will be a much better year for the bulk market compared to previous years. We aim to take advantage of the market opportunities and bring sustainable growth to our Company.”\nFinancial Review: Three months ended December 31, 2017\nTime Charter Equivalent (\"TCE\") revenue amounted to $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $9.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. TCE per day for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 49% to $9,391 per day as compared to $6,303 per day for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of the TCE revenue is attributable to the improved market rates despite the slight decrease of fleet operating days.\nThe Company continues to keep vessels operating expenses (“OPEX”) under control at $6.9 million or $4,676 per day for the fourth quarter of 2017 reduced by 8% as compared to $7.5 million or $4,895 per day for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and administration expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased to $0.9 million or $612 per day, which is significantly reduced by 25% as compared to same quarter in 2016. The decrease in G&A expenses per day is attributed to the successful restructuring of the Company which has positively contributed to our bottom line for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nInterest expense and finance cost for the fourth period ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $1.3 million, reduced by $0.1 million as compared to for the fourth quarter of 2016. The slight reduction is due to the decreased indebtedness despite the increased floating rates as compared to same period in previous year.\nFinancial Review: Twelve months ended December 31, 2017\nTime Charter Equivalent (\"TCE\") revenue amounted to $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 or $7,980 per day compared to $29.0 million or $5,227 per day in the prior year. The above figures present an increase of 58% in TCE revenues and 53% in TCE per day figures, which is attributable to the improved market rates throughout 2017 as compared to year ended December 31, 2016.\nVessel Operating Expenses (\"OPEX\") in line with Company’s effort to maintain low operating cost, have amounted to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 or at $4,764 per day. This represent an increase of 4% in the daily OPEX figures mainly attributable to the additional expenses incurred for the vessels that went into drydock in the first half of 2017 in relation to routine repair work and spares delivered while in drydock.\nDrydock expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $3.2 million since six vessels completed their special surveys within this period. While at the same period in 2016 the Drydock expense amounted to $0.6 million as only one vessel completed its special survey.\nGeneral and administration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $4.0 million or $675 per day as compared to $4.8 million or $846 per day during the same period in 2016. The decrease in G&A expenses per day is attributed to the successful restructuring the Company that was completed within 2017.\nInterest expense and finance cost for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $5.6 million mainly due to reduction of capitalised interest given that Company's newbuilding program was effectively terminated on May 23, 2016.\nRestructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $1.3 million and mainly includes severance payments to senior management, consulting fees, legal fees and various expenses incurred following the change of senior management announced by the Company on May 30, 2017.\nCurrent Fleet List\nVessel\nYard\nDWT Year Built Handysize Calm Bay Saiki Heavy Industries 37,534 2006 Reunion Bay Kanda Shipbuilding 32,354 2006 Fortune Bay Shin Kochijyuko 28,671 2006 Ha Long Bay Kanda Kawajiri 32,311 2007 Teal Bay Kanda Kawajiri 32,327 2007 Eden Bay Shimanami Shipyard 28,342 2008 Emerald Bay Kanda Shipbuilding 32,258 2008 Mykonos Bay Jinse Shipbuilding 32,411 2009 Resolute Bay Hyundai Vinashin 36,767 2012 Jupiter Bay Tsuji Heavy Industries 29,997 2012 Venus Bay Tsuji Heavy Industries 30,003 2012 Orion Bay Tsuji Heavy Industries 30,009 2012 Falcon Bay Yangzhou Guoyu Shipbuilding 38,464 2015 Kite Bay Yangzhou Guoyu Shipbuilding 38,419 2016 Handymax Paradise Bay Oshima Shipbuilding 46,232 2003 Supramax Tenacity Bay Jiangsu Hantong Ship Heavy Industry 56,842 2008 Summary of Operating Data (unaudited)\n(In thousands of U.S. Dollars except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Revenue, net 15,379 11,210 51,034 34,702 Voyage expenses (1,630) (1,806) (5,263) (5,691) Time charter equivalent revenue 13,749 9,404 45,771 29,011 Vessel operating expense (6,883) (7,519) (28,267) (25,907) Drydock expense 3 (572) (3,213) (572) Depreciation expense (2,005) (2,089) (8,157) (8,005) General and administration expense (901) (1,250) (4,007) (4,770) Write off of capitalised expenses and fees - - - (11,614) Loss on vessel disposition - - (62) - Impairment on vessels - (303) - (303) Restructuring costs - - (1,286) - Interest expense and finance cost (1,356) (1,444) (5,587) (5,141) Interest income 141 124 596 327 Other expenses and taxes, net (208) (130) (793) (259) Net Income / (loss) 2,540 (3,779) (5,005) (27,233) Adjusted net Income/ (loss) (2) 2,540 (3,476) (3,657) (15,316) Net income/(loss) per share, basic and diluted 0.09 (0.13) (0.17) (0.91) Adjusted net income/(loss) per share, basic and diluted (2) 0.09 (0.12) (0.12) (0.51) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Net income/(loss) 2,540 (3,779) (5,005) (27,233) Add: Loss on vessel disposition - - 62 - Add: Restructuring costs - - 1,286 - Add: Impairment of vessel - 303 - 303 Add: Write off of capitalised expenses and fees - - - 11,614 Adjusted Net Income/(loss) 2,540 (3,476 ) (3,657 ) (15,316 ) Add: Depreciation expense 2,005 2,089 8,157 8,005 Add: Drydock expense (3) 572 3,213 572 Add: Interest expense and finance cost 1,356 1,444 5,587 5,141 Add: Other taxes 37 20 169 81 Less: Interest income (141) (124) (596) (327) Adjusted EBITDA (1) 5,794 525 12,873 (1,844 ) Adjusted EBITDA represents net loss before interest, other taxes, depreciation and amortization, drydock expense, loss on vessel disposition, restructuring costs and write off capitalised expenses and fees and is used as a supplemental financial measure by management to assess our financial and operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA assists our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. We believe that including Adjusted EBITDA as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) or cash flow from operations, as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies.\nAdjusted net income/(loss) and related per share amounts is not a measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be used in isolation or substitution of Company’s results.\nVessel Utilization: Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Ship days (2) 1,472 1,536 5,933 5,639 Less: Off-hire days - 26 100 71 Less: Off-hire days due to drydock 8 18 97 18 Operating days (3) 1,464 1,492 5,736 5,550 Fleet Utilization (4) 99%\n97%\n97%\n98%\nTCE per day- $ (1) 9,391 6,303 7,980 5,227 Opex per day- $ (6) 4,676 4,895 4,764 4,594 G&A expenses per day- $ (7) 612 814 675 846 Vessels at period end 16 17 16 17 Average number of vessels during the period (5) 16 16.7 16 15.4 Time Charter Equivalent, or TCE revenue, are non-GAAP measures. Our method of computing TCE revenue is determined by voyage revenues less voyage expenses (including bunkers and port charges). Such TCE revenue, divided by the number of our operating days during the period, is TCE per day, which is consistent with industry practice. TCE revenue is included because it is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance irrespective of changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters and time charters), and it provides useful information to investors and management. Ship days: We define ship days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ship days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period. Operating days: We define operating days as the number of our ship days in a period less days required to prepare vessels acquired for their initial voyage and off-hire days associated with off-hire for undergoing repairs, drydocks or special surveys. The Company uses operating days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. Fleet utilization is defined as the ratio of operating days to ship days. Average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our fleet for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of ship days divided by the number of calendar days in that period. Opex per day is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ship days for the relevant time period. G&A expenses per day is calculated by dividing general and administrative expenses by ship days for the relevant time period.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited)\n(In thousands of U.S. Dollars)\nAs at December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 ASSETS Cash & cash equivalents 61,354 59,017 Restricted cash (current and noncurrent) 12,468 22,805 Vessels, net 171,387 185,938 Other receivables 5,449 3,824 Other assets 62 1,448 Total assets 250,720 273,032 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 4,249 4,773 Deferred revenue 656 1,088 Total debt, net of deferred finance costs 92,535 108,886 Total liabilities 97,440 114,747 Shareholders' equity 153,280 158,285 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity 250,720 273,032 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (Unaudited)\n(In thousands of U.S. Dollars)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Cash flows from operating activities Net Loss (5,005) (27,233) Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by /(used in) operating activities: Depreciation 8,157 8,005 Amortization of deferred finance fees 807 885 Write off of capitalised expenses and fees - 11,640 Write off of shareholder receivable - 104 Write off of receivable from shipbuilding yard 88 - Impairment charge - 303 Loss on vessel disposition 62 - Changes in operating assets and liabilities (1,519) 736 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities 2,590 (5,560 ) Cash flows from investing activities Payments for vessel acquisition and vessels improvements (391) (26,415) Cash proceed from vessel sale 6,982 - Refund for shipbuilding contracts terminated - 54,122 Purchase of other fixed assets (15) (54) Decrease/(increase) in restricted cash 10,337 (9,915) Net cash provided by investing activities 16,913 17,738 Cash flows from financing activities Loan repayments (17,046) 4,750 Loan proceeds - (11,028) Payment of deferred finance fees and other loan fees (120) (6,280) Repurchase of common stock - (606) Net cash used in financing activities (17,166 ) (13,164 ) Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 2,337 (986 ) Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year 59,017 60,003 Cash and cash equivalents at year end 61,354 59,017 About Pioneer Marine Inc.\nPioneer Marine is a leading ship owner and global drybulk handysize transportation service provider.
