    "text": "OVERLAND PARK, Kan. and DALLAS, Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FireMon, provider of continuous security for the hybrid enterprise, announced today that CRN ® , a brand of The Channel Company , has named Kurt Mills, Vice President of Global Channel Sales & Operations, to its list of 2018 Channel Chiefs. The executives on this annual list represent top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their organization through channel partners.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding channel partner programs.\nWith a proven track record of building and upgrading channel programs, distribution and strategic relationships, Mills has put into place a highly effective, solution-oriented worldwide channel sales strategy. In the past year, he spearheaded the relaunch of FireMon’s Ignite Partner Program, which evolved and expanded the program internationally and introduced new systems and tools to enable channel sales.\nThe refresh was anchored by a state-of-the-art, mobile-friendly partner portal that gives partners direct access to sales tools, deal registrations and ready-made marketing campaigns. Another focus of the program evolution has been eLearning – a priority for Mills, since he joined the company in 2016. As such, the new program includes two new online, self-paced courses for technical and sales resources as well as an advanced, bootcamp-style course led by a FireMon instructor.\n“This year, we put the focus back on our partners, making it easier for them to bring more effective security management to their customers,” said Mills. “We wanted to remove barriers to working with FireMon, and I’m happy to report that more than 200 partners around the world have leveraged the new systems and tools we rolled out last year.”\nPreviously Mills ran worldwide channel sales and operations for Blue Coat Systems. He also held leadership positions at Aerohive Networks, Websense and McAfee.\n“The executives on CRN’s 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,” said Robert Faletra, Executive Chairman of The Channel Company. “These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief’s impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.”\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list, including the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs, is featured online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs and will appear in the February 2018 issue of CRN.\nAbout The Channel Company\nThe Channel Company enables breakthrough IT channel performance with our dominant media, engaging events, expert consulting and education and innovative marketing services and platforms.
