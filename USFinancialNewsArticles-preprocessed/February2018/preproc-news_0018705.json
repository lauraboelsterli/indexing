    "text": "WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE: PMT) today reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $34.6 million, or $0.50 per common share on a diluted basis, for the fourth quarter of 2017, on net investment income of $93.7 million. PMT previously announced a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.47 per common share of beneficial interest, which was declared on December 19, 2017, and paid on January 26, 2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nFinancial results:\nNet income attributable to common shareholders of $34.6 million, up 161 percent from the prior quarter; includes $13.0 million benefit from remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability in PMT’s taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS) as a result of the newly enacted federal tax law Diluted earnings per common share of $0.50, up 150 percent from the prior quarter; includes a benefit of $0.18 from the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability Net investment income of $93.7 million, up 24 percent from the prior quarter Book value per common share increase to $20.13 at December 31, 2017, up from $19.74 at September 30, 2017 Repurchased approximately 5.2 million PMT common shares from November 6, 2017 to January 5, 2018 at a cost of $82.6 million Annualized return on average common equity of 11 percent, up from 4 percent for the prior quarter 1\nInvestment activities and correspondent production results:\nContinued investment in GSE credit risk transfer (CRT) and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) resulting from PMT’s correspondent production business Correspondent production related to conventional conforming loans totaled $5.9 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB), down 10 percent from the prior quarter CRT deliveries totaled $4.8 billion in UPB, which will result in approximately $168 million of new CRT investments once the aggregation period is complete Added $83 million in new MSR investments Completed the previously announced sale of $287 million in UPB of nonperforming and performing loans from the distressed portfolio\nNotable activity after quarter end:\nEntered into an agreement to sell $381 million in UPB of nonperforming and performing loans from the distressed portfolio 2\nFull-Year 2017 Highlights\nNet income attributable to common shareholders of $102.5 million, up 35 percent from the prior year; includes $13.0 million benefit from remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability in PMT’s TRS Diluted earnings per common share of $1.48, up 37 percent from the prior year; includes a benefit of $0.18 from the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability Net investment income of $317.9 million, up 17 percent from the prior year Return on average common equity of 8 percent, up from 5 percent for the prior year 3 Issued 12.4 million preferred shares for gross proceeds of $310 million Repurchased approximately 6.3 million PMT common shares from March 9, 2017 through January 5, 2018 at a cost of $101.8 million PMT’s equity allocation to CRT, MSRs and excess servicing spread (ESS) grew from 43 percent to 66 percent of total equity, while allocation to distressed mortgage loans declined from 39 percent to 22 percent 4\n“We made substantial progress in the strategic transformation of PMT during the fourth quarter,” said President and CEO David Spector. “We completed a bulk sale of nonperforming and performing distressed loans, which brought our equity allocated to distressed loans down to 22%. During the most recent purchase window, we repurchased $83 million of PMT stock with an estimated book value of $105 million. Our earnings for the quarter benefited from strong results in credit risk transfer and correspondent production, as well as from the remeasurement of a net deferred tax liability in our taxable REIT subsidiary resulting from the federal tax law enacted late last year. Earnings for the quarter were partially offset by the underperformance of the distressed portfolio which was driven by valuation losses on nonperforming loans.”\nThe following table presents the contributions of PMT’s segments, consisting of Credit Sensitive Strategies, Interest Rate Sensitive Strategies, Correspondent Production and Corporate.\nQuarter ended December 31, 2017\nCorrespondent production\nCredit sensitive strategies\nInterest rate sensitive strategies\nCorporate\nConsolidated\n(in thousands) Net gain (loss) on investments Mortgage loans at fair value $ - $ (8,207 ) $ - $ - $ (8,207 ) Mortgage loans held by variable interest entity net of asset-backed\n-\n-\n112\n-\n112\nMortgage-backed securities\n-\n149\n(3,820\n)\n-\n(3,671\n)\nCRT Agreements - 57,137 - - 57,137 Hedging derivatives - - (3,524 ) - (3,524 ) Excess servicing spread investments - - (3,610 ) -\n(3,610\n)\n- 49,079 (10,842 ) - 38,237 Net gain on mortgage loans acquired for sale 20,191 41 - - 20,232 Net mortgage loan servicing fees - 43 19,872 - 19,915 Net interest income Interest income 12,328 11,997 18,669 119 43,113 Interest expense (6,914 ) (12,256 ) (16,319 ) - (35,489 ) 5,414 (259 ) 2,350 119 7,624 Other (loss) income 9,704 (2,009 ) - - 7,695 35,309 46,895 11,380 119 93,703 Expenses: Mortgage loan fulfillment and servicing fees payable to PennyMac Financial Services, Inc.\n19,175 3,469 7,608 - 30,252 Management fees payable to PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. - - - 5,900 5,900 Other 2,063 4,156 554 4,831 11,604 21,238 7,625 8,162 10,731 47,756 Pretax income (loss) $ 14,071 $ 39,270 $ 3,218 $ (10,612 ) $ 45,947 Credit Sensitive Strategies Segment\nThe Credit Sensitive Strategies segment includes results from distressed mortgage loans, CRT, non-Agency subordinated bonds and commercial real estate investments. Pretax income for the segment was $39.3 million on revenues of $46.9 million, compared with pretax income of $13.1 million on revenues of $20.5 million in the prior quarter.\nNet gain on investments was $49.1 million, an increase of 164 percent from the prior quarter.\nPMT’s distressed mortgage loan portfolio generated realized and unrealized losses totaling $8.2 million, compared with realized and unrealized gains of $3.3 million in the prior quarter. Fair value gains on performing loans in the distressed portfolio were $0.6 million while fair value losses on nonperforming loans were $11.7 million.\nThe schedule below summarizes the gains (losses) on distressed mortgage loans:\nQuarter ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in thousands) Valuation changes: Performing loans $ 647 $ 8,638 $ (619 ) Nonperforming loans (11,672 ) (5,841 ) (1,451 ) (11,025 ) 2,797 (2,070 ) Gain on payoffs 1,114 224 174 Gain (loss) on sale 1,704 256 860 $ (8,207 ) $ 3,277 $ (1,036 ) The nonperforming loan portfolio was adversely impacted by higher recidivism of previously performing loans as well as seasonally high costs related to the maintenance of PMT’s lien interest in the loans. Losses to the distressed portfolio in connection with the bulk sale of nonperforming and performing loans were approximately $4 million, including sale expenses and adverse valuation impact on the carrying value of the remaining nonperforming loans. Lower valuation gains on the performing loan portfolio were driven by reduced impact of market improvements and lower reperformance during the quarter.\nNet gain on CRT investments was $57.1 million, compared to a gain of $15.2 million in the prior quarter. The gain was driven by a tightening of credit spreads for such securities, consistent with spread tightening across many asset classes during the quarter. At quarter end, PMT’s investments in CRT totaled $589 million, compared with $546 million at September 30, 2017.\nNet interest expense for the segment totaled $0.3 million, compared to net interest income of $2.9 million in the prior quarter. Interest income totaled $12.0 million, a 25 percent decrease from the prior quarter, driven by a decrease in capitalized interest from a reduction in loan modification activity and fewer performing loans in the distressed loan portfolio. Interest expense totaled $12.3 million, down 6 percent from the prior quarter, primarily driven by ongoing reductions in the distressed loan portfolio and real estate acquired in the settlement of loans (REO).\nOther investment losses were $2.0 million, compared with a $0.9 million loss in the prior quarter, driven by a seasonal increase in tax payments on real estate acquired in settlement of loans (REO). At quarter end, PMT’s inventory of REO properties totaled $162.9 million, down from $185.0 million at September 30, 2017.\nSegment expenses were $7.6 million, a 2 percent increase from the prior quarter, resulting from expenses related to the sale of distressed loans, partially offset by lower servicing expense on a smaller distressed loan portfolio.\nInterest Rate Sensitive Strategies Segment\nThe Interest Rate Sensitive Strategies segment includes results from investments in MSRs, ESS, Agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and non-Agency senior MBS and interest rate hedges. The segment includes investments that typically have offsetting exposures to changes in interest rates. Interest Rate Sensitive Strategies generated pretax income of $3.2 million on revenues of $11.4 million, compared with pretax income of $13.3 million on revenues of $20.7 million in the prior quarter.\nThe results in the Interest Rate Sensitive Strategies segment consist of net gain/loss on investments, net interest income and net loan servicing fees, as well as the associated expenses.\nSegment investments produced a net loss of $10.8 million, primarily consisting of $3.8 million of losses on MBS; $3.6 million of losses on ESS; and $3.5 million of losses on hedging derivatives.\nNet interest income for the segment was $2.4 million, compared to $3.6 million in the prior quarter. Interest income totaled $18.7 million, a 4 percent decrease from the prior quarter, driven by a reduction in our MBS and ESS investment balances from the prior quarter. Interest expense totaled $16.3 million, a 3 percent increase from the prior quarter due to an increase in short-term borrowing costs.\nNet mortgage loan servicing fees were $19.9 million, down from $21.9 million in the prior quarter. Net loan servicing fees included $47.4 million in servicing fees, reduced by $22.6 million of amortization and realization of MSR cash flows. Net loan servicing fees also included a $3.8 million valuation loss on MSRs carried at fair value, a $1.6 million impairment provision for MSRs carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, $0.8 million of related hedging losses, and $0.6 million of MSR recapture income. PMT’s hedging activities are intended to manage the Company’s net exposure across all interest rate-sensitive strategies, which include MSRs, ESS and MBS.\nThe following schedule details net loan servicing fees:\nQuarter ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in thousands) From nonaffiliates Servicing fees (1) $ 47,430 $ 44,280 $ 37,079 Effect of MSRs: Carried at lower of amortized cost or fair value Amortization and realization of cashflows (22,609 ) (21,634 ) (17,927 ) (Provision for) reversal of impairment (1,589 ) (1,702 ) 41,607 Gain on sale 660 - - Carried at fair value - change in fair value (3,765 ) (3,977 ) 7,034 Gains (Losses) on hedging derivatives (782 ) 4,576 (60,734 ) (28,085 ) (22,737 ) (30,020 ) From PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. MSR recapture fee receivable from PFSI 570 333 724 Net mortgage loan servicing fees $ 19,915 $ 21,876 $ 7,783\n(1) Includes contractually specified servicing and ancillary fees\nPMT’s MSR portfolio, which is subserviced by a subsidiary of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE: PFSI), grew to $72.1 billion in UPB from $67.9 billion at September 30, 2017.\nMSR and ESS valuation losses primarily resulted from yield curve flattening, and ESS valuations were also adversely impacted by higher than expected prepayment activity during the quarter. ESS valuation losses are net of recapture income totaling $1.1 million from PFSI for prepayment activity during the quarter. When prepayment of a loan underlying PMT’s ESS results from a refinancing by PFSI, PMT generally benefits from recapture income.\nSegment expenses were $8.2 million, a 10 percent increase from the prior quarter, driven by higher servicing expense from a larger servicing portfolio and a temporary increase in delinquencies resulting from the recent natural disasters.\nCorrespondent Production Segment\nPMT acquires newly originated mortgage loans from third-party correspondent sellers and typically sells or securitizes the loans, resulting in current-period income and ongoing investments in MSRs and GSE CRT related to a portion of its production. PMT’s Correspondent Production segment generated pretax income of $14.1 million versus $8.3 million in the prior quarter.\nThrough its correspondent production activities, PMT acquired $15.4 billion in UPB of loans and issued IRLCs totaling $15.9 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $17.4 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively, in the prior quarter. Of the correspondent acquisitions, conventional conforming acquisitions totaled $5.9 billion, and government-insured or guaranteed acquisitions totaled $9.5 billion, compared with $6.5 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively, in the prior quarter.\nSegment revenues were $35.3 million, a 3 percent increase from the prior quarter. Segment revenues included a net gain on mortgage loans of $20.2 million, other income of $9.7 million, which primarily consists of volume-based origination fees, and net interest income of $5.4 million. Net gain on mortgage loans acquired for sale in the quarter increased 12 percent from the prior quarter, driven by improvements to loan acquisition strategies and secondary market execution. Net interest income increased 16 percent from the prior quarter driven by the optimization of financing arrangements.\nThe following schedule details the net gain on mortgage loans acquired for sale:\nQuarter ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in thousands) Net gain on mortgage loans acquired for sale: Receipt of MSRs in loan sale transactions $ 82,948 $ 82,838 $ 101,186 Provision for losses relating to representations and warranties provided in mortgage loan sales:\nPursuant to mortgage loans sales (792 ) (1,075 ) (1,251 ) Reduction in liability due to change in estimate 2,156 1,642 741 Cash investment (1) (69,846 ) (61,678 ) (63,938 ) Fair value changes of pipeline, inventory and hedges 5,766 (3,760 ) (13,429 ) $ 20,232 $ 17,967 $ 23,309\n(1) Includes cash hedge expense\nSegment expenses were $21.2 million, down 19 percent from the prior quarter, driven by a decrease in volume-based fulfillment fee expense and a lower weighted average fulfillment fee. The weighted average fulfillment fee rate in the fourth quarter was 33 basis points, down from 36 basis points in the prior quarter and reflects discretionary reductions to facilitate the successful completion of certain loan transactions by PMT.\nCorporate Segment\nThe Corporate segment includes interest income from cash and short-term investments, management fees, and corporate expenses.\nSegment revenues were $119,000, a decrease from $182,000 in the prior quarter.\nManagement fees were $5.9 million, down 2 percent from the prior quarter, resulting from a reduction in PMT’s shareholders’ equity, driven by common share repurchases. No incentive fees were paid in the fourth quarter or the prior quarter.\nOther segment expenses were $4.8 million compared with $4.7 million in the prior quarter.\nTaxes\nPMT recorded income tax expense of $5.1 million compared with a $4.8 million expense in the prior quarter. As a result of the new tax law, remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability in PMT’s TRS resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $13 million, or $0.18 per share. Going forward, the statutory reduction in the corporate tax rate is expected to improve the after-tax profitability of the TRS.\nExecutive Chairman Stanford L. Kurland concluded, “PMT’s fourth quarter performance represents the further affirmation of our strategic focus on correspondent production and the investments it creates. The correspondent business generates attractive returns on its own and also produces unique long-term investments such as CRT and MSRs. We also are working on enhancing returns by optimizing our financing structures, such as the one we have implemented for financing Fannie Mae MSRs. We believe the income potential of these strategies taken together should produce attractive returns on equity, as reflected in our run-rate income potential. The continued shift to these newer strategies is reflected in our improving run-rate income potential, which is further enhanced by lower provisions for corporate income taxes.”\nManagement’s slide presentation will be available in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.pennymac-REIT.com beginning at 1:30 p.m. (Pacific Daylight Time) on Thursday, February 8, 2018.\nAbout PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust\nPennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust is a mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests primarily in residential mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets.
