    "text": "(Adds details, updates to close)\nFeb 15 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose on Thursday as gains in the financial sector and shares of TransCanada Corp offset a decline in natural resource companies.\n* The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index ended up 79.39 points, or 0.52 percent, at 15,407.66.\n* Investors were taking in a slew of Canadian corporate earnings, while global markets rose.\n* TransCanada was the biggest lift on the index, climbing 5.0 percent to C$56.33 after it reported strong fourth-quarter profit and said it would go ahead with the expansion of its NGTL natural gas system.\n* The financials group also helped support the market, gaining 0.4 percent as Toronto-Dominion Bank rose 0.7 percent to C$72.81, while Brookfield Asset Management was up 2.2 percent at C$49.43.\n* Bombardier jumped 11.3 percent to C$3.66 following better-than-expected results and as Delta Air Lines said it would go ahead with plans to buy some Canadian-made CSeries jets after a U.S. trade ruling stopped the United States from imposing steep duties on the aircraft.\n* Canadian Tire Corp climbed 6.6 percent to C$174.48 after the retailer reported better-than-expected quarterly profit amid an early winter in some parts of the country.\n* On the downside, Barrick Gold Corp shed 3.0 percent to C$16.62 after the world’s biggest gold producer, forecast an output drop over the next four years.\n* Barrick helped weigh on the materials sector, which retreated 0.4 percent.\n* Cenovus Energy dropped 5.3 percent to C$9.36 after the company said it was looking to sell assets in Western Canada’s Deep Basin.\n* The stock weighed on the energy sector, which lost 0.9 percent.\n* The TSX posted 12 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows. Volume on the index was 248.75 million shares (Reporting by Leah Schnurr in Ottawa; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Diane Craft)\n ",
