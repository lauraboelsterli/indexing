(NYSE American:ACY), a global aircraft leasing company announced today that the California Department of Business Oversight has determined that the terms and conditions of the offer and sale of AeroCentury common stock in AeroCentury’s proposed Merger (the “Merger”) with JetFleet Holding Corp. (“JHC”) are fair. Consequently, the Department issued a permit authorizing AeroCentury to solicit the consent of the JHC shareholders to the Merger, and issue shares of common stock in the Merger when and if such Merger is consummated.

Provided these conditions are completed on a timely basis, AeroCentury expects the acquisition to close in early April 2018.\nAbout AeroCentury : AeroCentury is an independent global aircraft operating lessor and finance company specializing in leasing regional jet and turboprop aircraft and related engines.
