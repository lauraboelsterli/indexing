    "text": "Quarterly distribution increase of 1.25 cents to $0.73875 per unit\nHOUSTON, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Spectra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: SEP) announced today that the board of directors of the general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution to unitholders of $0.73875 per unit, an increase of 1.25 cents over the previous level of $0.72625 per unit. The cash distribution is payable on February 28, 2018, to unitholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2018. This quarterly cash distribution equates to $2.955 per unit on an annual basis.\nThis information is intended to be a qualified notice under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b). Under rules applicable to publicly-traded partnerships, our distributions to non-U.S. unitholders are subject to withholding tax at the highest effective applicable rate to the extent attributable to income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. Given the uncertainty at the time of making distributions regarding the amount of any distribution that is attributable to income that is so effectively connected, we intend to treat all of our distributions as attributable to our U.S. operations, and as a result, the entire distribution will be subject to withholding.\nSpectra Energy Partners\nSpectra Energy Partners, LP is one of the largest pipeline master limited partnerships in the United States and connects growing supply areas to high-demand markets for natural gas and crude oil.
