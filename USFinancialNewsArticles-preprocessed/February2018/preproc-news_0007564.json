    "text": "Published: Feb 1, 2018 9:08 a.m. ET Share \nRuling sparks confusion as to whether any among the 28 athletes would be allowed to participate in Winter Games kicking off Feb. 9 \nBy James Marson David Gauthier-Villars \nAn international sports tribunal overturned the Olympic life bans of 28 Russian athletes, a boon for Russia a little over a week before the start of the Winter Olympics, where its national team has been barred from participating because of an alleged state-sponsored doping scheme. \nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport, an appellate court for sports cases, said Thursday that evidence it reviewed in 28 appeals by Russian athletes were “insufficient” to support accusations of antidoping rule violation. The court said sanctions against them were annulled, and results they achieved during the Sochi Olympics in Russia in 2014, where Moscow is accused of having carried out the doping, reinstated. \nThe International Olympic Committee said it regretted the ruling, saying it “may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping.” The IOC, which has suspended Russia’s membership and allowed only “athletes from Russia” to compete in the Pyeongchang Games in South Korea, complained the court had used a higher threshold on the necessary level of evidence than in previous decisions. \nRussian authorities hailed Thursday’s news, saying it vindicated their repeated denials of systemic doping. “There was no system, no kind of manipulation at the Sochi Olympics,” Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitali Mutko said, according to the Interfax news agency. “That’s what we’ve always said, but today it came from the highest arbitration court.” \nThe court said it only examined individual cases, adding its mandate wasn’t to determine whether there was an organized doping scheme in Sochi. ‘We will try to file applications for those who are ready and who meet the quotas and qualifications to participate in the Olympic Games.’ Deputy Prime Minister. Mutko, a former sports minister, said.",
