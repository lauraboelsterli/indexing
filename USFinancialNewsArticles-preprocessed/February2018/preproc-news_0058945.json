    "text": "NEW YORK(Reuters) - Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange rose 2.6 percent in mid-February, the exchange said on Tuesday.\nAs of Feb. 15, short interest rose to about 16.166 billion shares, compared with 15.755 billion shares as of Jan. 31.\nInvestors who sell securities short borrow shares and then sell them, expecting the stock to fall so they can buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.\n ",
