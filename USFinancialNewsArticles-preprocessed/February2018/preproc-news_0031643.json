The expertise of those included on the list encompasses that of CEOs, entrepreneurs, technologists, workforce specialists, data scientists, and more from a variety of different companies and lines of service.\nNominees were chosen after a rigorous review of candidates suggested by individuals, colleagues, and other industry sources.\n\"It's truly an honor to be recognized as one of the staffing industry's 100 most influential people,\" said Leverant. \"My focus has always been to make an impact in the staffing industry for the good in order to strengthen the industry overall.
