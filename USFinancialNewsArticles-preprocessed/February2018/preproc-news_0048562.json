    "text": "LAS VEGAS, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE: BYD) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nKeith Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boyd Gaming, said: \"Boyd Gaming finished a strong year with a record fourth-quarter performance, as every segment of our business delivered growth in net revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins. Our Nevada operations continued their long-term growth trajectory, with our 11 th consecutive quarter of same-store Adjusted EBITDA gains in our Las Vegas Locals segment. Our regional operations showed further improvement, as our Midwest and South segment posted its best performance of the year. And we laid the groundwork for future growth, reaching agreements in December to acquire five properties in the Midwest and Northeast. In all, 2017 was an exceptional year for our Company, as we created significant value for our shareholders and positioned ourselves to continue delivering growth.\"\nBoyd Gaming achieved record fourth-quarter net revenues of $590.8 million, an increase of 6.5% from $554.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the fourth quarter 2017 was $82.2 million, or $0.71 per share, versus $10.7 million, or $0.10 per share, in the prior-year fourth quarter. The Company reported net income of $82.2 million, or $0.71 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $12.2 million, or $0.11 per share, for the year-ago period.\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA (1) was a fourth-quarter record of $148.4 million, up 6.9% from $138.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Earnings (1) for the fourth quarter 2017 were $25.6 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to Adjusted Earnings of $44.3 million, or $0.38 per share, for the same period in 2016.\nResults for the fourth quarter include the operations of Cannery and Eastside Cannery, acquired by the Company on December 20, 2016. The Company's fourth-quarter 2017 tax provision includes a $60.1 million noncash income tax benefit to recognize the impact of the recent federal tax legislation on its deferred tax liabilities. Results for the prior-year period included noncash intangible asset impairment charges of $36.9 million and $11.1 million of noncash income tax benefit resulting from the release of a previously recorded deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 included $1.5 million in after-tax income for the Company's share of a property tax recovery realized by Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, which was sold on August 1, 2016.\n(1)\nSee footnotes at the end of the release for additional information relative to non-GAAP financial measures.\nOperations Review\nLas Vegas Locals\nIn the Las Vegas Locals segment, fourth-quarter 2017 net revenues were $217.6 million, up from $185.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Fourth-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA grew to $64.5 million, compared to $52.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 results include a full quarter of contributions from Cannery and Eastside Cannery, both acquired on December 20, 2016.\nOn a same-store basis, the Las Vegas Locals segment, including Aliante, posted its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit Adjusted EBITDA growth, as every major Locals property reported year-over-year increases in both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Same-store operating margins also continued to improve, rising 265 basis points year-over-year. Results benefited from continued operating efficiencies, refinements to marketing programs and strong economic conditions.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Cannery and Eastside Cannery each continued to grow Adjusted EBITDA at a double-digit pace over their 2016 standalone results. Results at these properties reflect the realization of synergies, marketing and operational enhancements, and a growing regional economy.\nDowntown Las Vegas\nIn the Downtown Las Vegas segment, net revenues were $64.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 3.9% from $62.0 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted EBITDA rose 8.5% to $16.8 million, versus $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins all increased at each of the three downtown properties, driven by continued growth in visitation throughout the Downtown area, as well as further increases in play from the Company's Hawaiian customer segments.\nMidwest and South\nIn the Midwest and South segment, net revenues were $308.8 million, an increase from $307.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $86.3 million, up slightly from $86.1 million in the year-ago period. Included in fourth-quarter 2016 Adjusted EBITDA results was a one-time, favorable property tax adjustment of $2.9 million.\nThe segment reported its strongest quarterly results of the year, driven by refinements to operations, increasingly effective marketing programs, and healthy economic conditions in most markets. Broad-based improvements in operating results were partially offset by the impact of Hurricane Nate, which forced the temporary closure of the IP and Treasure Chest in early October.\nFull-Year 2017 Results\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, Boyd Gaming reported record net revenues of $2.38 billion, compared to $2.18 billion for the full-year 2016. Total Adjusted EBITDA (1) for 2017 reached a record $595.6 million, up 11.1% from $536.3 million in the prior year. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, was $167.8 million, or $1.45 per share, compared to $205.5 million, or $1.78 per share, in the prior year.\nResults for the current year include the operations of Aliante, acquired by the Company on September 27, 2016, as well as Cannery and Eastside Cannery, acquired on December 20, 2016. The Company's tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017, includes a $60.1 million noncash benefit due to the recent federal tax legislation. The prior-year results included noncash intangible asset impairment charges of $38.3 million and pretax losses on the early extinguishments of debt of $42.4 million. In addition, the Company's full-year 2016 results were favorably impacted by $201.5 million of noncash income tax benefits resulting from the release of a previously recorded deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nThe Company reported net income, including discontinued operations, of $189.2 million, or $1.64 per share, for the full year 2017, compared to net income of $418.0 million, or $3.63 per share, for the prior year. Discontinued operations for both periods include results from the Company's equity interest in Borgata, while full-year 2016 results also included a $181.7 million after-tax gain from the third-quarter 2016 sale of the equity interest. Adjusted Earnings (1) for the full year 2017 were $118.8 million, or $1.03 per share, up from Adjusted Earnings of $104.6 million, or $0.91 per share, for the same period in 2016.\nBalance Sheet Statistics\nAs of December 31, 2017, Boyd Gaming had cash on hand of $203.1 million, and total debt of $3.12 billion.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance\nFor the full year 2018, Boyd Gaming projects total Adjusted EBITDA of $600 million to $620 million. This guidance includes the anticipated impact of a new competitor near Blue Chip in Indiana. It does not include any contributions from the Company's pending acquisitions.\nConference Call Information\nBoyd Gaming will host a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results today, February 20, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern.

Financial Measures\nRegulation G, \"Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information in public disclosures. We believe that our presentations of the following non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance to investors: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted EPS). The following discussion defines these terms and why we believe they are useful measures of our performance. We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding forward-looking GAAP measure due to our inability to project special charges and certain expenses.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in our industry that we believe, when considered with measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), provides our investors a more complete understanding of our operating results before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes and facilitates comparisons between us and our competitors. Management has historically adjusted EBITDA when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. We refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform comparisons of past, present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core on-going operations. We have historically reported this measure to our investors and believe that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in our financial reporting. We use Adjusted EBITDA in this press release because we believe it is useful to investors in allowing greater transparency related to a significant measure used by our management in their financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted EBITDA is among the more significant factors in management's internal evaluation of total company and individual property performance and in the evaluation of incentive compensation related to property management. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in the evaluation of potential acquisitions and dispositions. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by management in the annual budget process. Externally, we believe these measures continue to be used by investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our company. Adjusted EBITDA reflects EBITDA adjusted for deferred rent, share-based compensation expense, project development, preopening and writedown expenses, impairments of assets, loss on early extinguishments and modifications of debt and other operating items, net.\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS\nAdjusted Earnings is net income before project development, preopening and writedown expenses, impairments of assets, certain adjustments to property tax accruals, other items, net, gain or loss on early extinguishments and modifications of debt, other non-recurring adjustments, net, the impact on Boyd's income tax provision of recent tax legislation and from the release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and income from discontinued operations, net of tax. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS are presented solely as supplemental disclosures because management believes that they are widely used measures of performance in the gaming industry.\nLimitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and certain other non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS or certain other non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, income taxes and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our depreciation and amortization, interest and income taxes, capital expenditures and other items both in our reconciliations to the historical GAAP financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and certain other non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and certain other non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP, nor should these measures be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and certain other non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding historical GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nForward-looking Statements and Company Information\nThis press release contains within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
