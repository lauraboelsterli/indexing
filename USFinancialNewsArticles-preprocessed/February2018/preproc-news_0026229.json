(\"LJMIX\" or the \"Company\") (LJMIX) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased LJM Preservation and Growth Fund Class I (\"LJMIX\") (MUTF: LJMIX) between February 28, 2015 and February 7, 2018, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/ljmix .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) LJMIX was not focused on capital preservation and left investors exposed to an unacceptably high risk of catastrophic losses; and (2) LJMIX had not taken appropriate steps to preserve capital in down markets.\nOn February 5, 2018, the S&P dropped about 4.6% and LJMIX dropped roughly 80% from a previous close price of $9.82 per share on February 2, 2018 to $1.94 per share on February 7, 2018.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
