    "text": "February 6, 2018 / 10:21 AM / in 32 minutes Bank of England signs up to code aimed at keeping forex markets clean Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England has signed up to a new global code of conduct designed to avoid more currency manipulation scandals, putting pressure on UK banks to follow suit. \nAfter banks were fined billions of dollars for trying to rig currency benchmarks, central banks across the world sponsored a new, voluntary FX market code published last year, which banks and dealers are also being urged to adopt. \nLondon accounts for 37 percent of the world’s $5 trillion a day global foreign exchange market and the BoE published on Tuesday a signed “statement of commitment” to apply the code in all its activities in currency markets. \n“Fair, transparent and robust markets, underpinned by high standards, benefit all participants,” Dave Ramsden, BoE deputy governor for markets and banking, said in a statement. \nIn 2014 the BoE fired its chief dealer Martin Mallett, and called for an independent investigation into what the Bank knew of alleged currency market collusion and manipulation. \nThe investigation found at least 20 “examples of misjudgements” by Mallett, including violations of the Bank’s information technology and confidentiality policies. \nThe Czech National Bank, Bank of Spain, Central Bank of Cyprus, National Bank of Austria, National Bank of Poland and the National Bank of Romania also announced formal adherence to the FX code on Tuesday. \nAll central banks in the European Union will have formally backed the FX code by May. \nThe BoE also announced it has signed up to two other codes of conduct, the first on standards expected from participants in the deposit, repo and securities lending markets, the second on conduct in precious metals markets.
