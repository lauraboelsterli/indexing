    "text": "Outstanding Operational Performance in the Quarter and the Year\nHighest Quarterly Sales Volume in Company's History\nLong-term Debt Reduced by $1.1 Billion\nDEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CF), the global leader in nitrogen products manufacturing and distribution, today announced results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nNet earnings of $465 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, which includes a net income tax benefit of $491 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Adjusted net loss (1) of $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share (1) EBITDA (2) of $224 million; adjusted EBITDA (2) of $260 million Sales volume of approximately 5.3 million tons, five percent higher than previous quarterly record Reduced long-term debt by $1.1 billion, lowering annualized interest payments by $76 million\nFull Year Highlights\nNet earnings of $358 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, which includes a net income tax benefit of $491 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Adjusted net loss (1) of $59 million or $0.25 per diluted share (1) EBITDA (2) of $856 million; adjusted EBITDA (2) of $969 million Year-end 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate at lowest level in company’s history Record production volume of 10.3 million tons of gross ammonia Record sales volumes of approximately 20 million product tons\nImpact of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the company's fourth quarter 2017 net earnings of $1.98 per diluted share included a $2.09 per share net income tax benefit and for the full year 2017 net earnings of $1.53 per diluted share included a $2.10 per share net income tax benefit. The net income tax benefit is primarily comprised of a $552 million income tax benefit from a revaluation of the company's deferred taxes as a result of the new lower corporate tax rate and a $57 million income tax provision related to the transition tax on deferred foreign earnings. This is a one-time item that affects the comparability of results between periods, and accordingly has been excluded from adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA.\n(1) See reconciliations of adjusted net (loss) earnings and adjusted net (loss) earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release. (2) EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense-net, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. See reconciliations of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release. Overview of Results\nCF Industries Holdings, Inc., today announced fourth quarter 2017 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $465 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, and adjusted net loss of $3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2017 EBITDA was $224 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $260 million. These results compare to fourth quarter 2016 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $320 million, or $1.38 per diluted share; adjusted net loss 2016 of $90 million, or $0.39 per diluted share; EBITDA loss of $135 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $133 million. Fourth quarter 2017 results include a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $13 million, compared to a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $5 million of 2016.\nFor the full year 2017, net earnings attributable to common stockholders was $358 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, and adjusted net loss was $59 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Full year 2017 EBITDA was $856 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $969 million. These results compare to full year 2016 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $277 million, or $1.19 per diluted share; adjusted net earnings for full year 2016 of $109 million, or $0.47 per diluted share; EBITDA of $395 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $858 million. Full year 2017 results include a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $26 million, compared to a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $133 million for full year 2016.\n“Outstanding execution by the team in 2017 produced records for safe operations, production and sales volumes,\" said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. \"In addition, we paid down $1.1 billion in debt during the quarter and recently exercised our right to purchase all of the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. We estimate that full ownership of TNCLP would have added approximately $45 million to EBITDA, including anticipated cost reductions and network optimization benefits. Additionally, we estimate that full ownership of TNCLP and the debt reduction would have resulted in $110 million of additional free cash flow.”\nManufacturing Operations\nCF Industries' manufacturing network continued its focus on safety and operated efficiently during the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2017, CF Industries' 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0.67 incidents per 200,000 work hours, well below industry averages.\nGross ammonia production during the fourth quarter of 2017 was more than 2.6 million tons, the second highest volume for a quarter in the company's history.\nSales Overview\nNet sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $1,099 million from $867 million in the same period last year due to higher sales volumes across most segments and higher average selling prices across all segments.\nTotal sales volumes for the quarter were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as the company's production increased at the Donaldsonville and Port Neal Nitrogen Complexes.\nAverage selling prices for the quarter were higher year-over-year across all segments due largely to a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. Additionally, average ammonia selling prices benefited from the commencement of delivery under a long-term supply agreement.\nThe company's average selling price for ammonia was $285 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $277 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016. The average selling price for urea was $244 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $214 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the average selling price for UAN was $150 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $149 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCost of sales per ton increased 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily driven by increased gas consumption to support the higher production and sales volumes and increased 11 percent for the full year 2017 compared to the full year 2016 for the same volume reasons.\nControllable cost of sales, defined as non-gas cash costs (maintenance, labor, electricity, other raw materials, transportation and distribution, and other plant costs), which excludes the impact of natural gas, derivatives and depreciation and amortization, decreased 8 percent per ton, (3) in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016, and 14 percent per ton, (3) in the full year 2017, as a result of cost reduction initiatives and production efficiencies.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the company's cost of sales was $3.24 per MMBtu, which includes a realized loss of $0.13 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges totaling $13 million. This compares to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $3.24 per MMBtu of 2016, which included a realized loss of $0.06 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges totaling $5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the average price of natural gas at Henry Hub in North America was $2.87 per MMBtu, and the average price of natural gas at the National Balancing Point in the United Kingdom was $6.92 per MMBtu.\nAdditionally, the company recorded an unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to an unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $91 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company did not enter into any additional natural gas derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n(3) See reconciliation of controllable cost of sales and controllable cost of sales per ton to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release. Market Overview\nCF management expects the combination of: a somewhat weaker U.S. dollar; higher energy costs in key producing regions; reduced production in China; higher oil and freight costs; and steady global demand to support nitrogen prices during the first half of 2018 at levels higher than the same period in 2017.\nThe U.S. dollar is expected to remain lower against currencies in key nitrogen producing regions through at least the first half of the year, pushing up the cost of nitrogen fertilizer exports in U.S. dollar terms. From the beginning of July 2017 to the beginning of February 2018, the RMB strengthened against the dollar from approximately 6.8 to 6.3 and the Russian Ruble strengthened against the dollar from approximately 60 to 57.\nAdditionally, energy prices since the middle of 2017 have increased significantly for marginal producers in Eastern Europe and China. From the beginning of July 2017 to the beginning of February 2018, the price of natural gas per MMBtu at TTF in Europe has increased approximately 25 percent and the cost of anthracite coal per metric ton in China has increased 29 percent. Over the same period, the price per MMBtu of natural gas at Henry Hub has increased less than three percent.\nOcean freight costs have risen as well, adding cost to globally traded nitrogen. At the beginning of February, ocean freight to ship urea from the Arab Gulf to the Gulf of Mexico was 15 percent per ton higher than the year before and nearly 30 percent per ton higher than at the beginning of July 2017.\nThese factors have accelerated the transformation of China's role in the global urea market. According to official government data, Chinese urea exports have declined approximately 65 percent in two years, from over 13 million metric tons in 2015 to approximately 4.7 million metric tons in 2017. Industry observers expect marginal producers in China to face continued pressures during 2018, not only from higher coal costs and currency impacts, but also from the effect of environmental regulation enforcement. These challenges are likely to further reduce Chinese net urea exports in 2018.\nIndia and Brazil will remain key countries for urea demand this year. Published reports and CF analysis suggest that India may require 500,000-1,000,000 metric tons of urea to be imported before the end of March to meet that country’s fertilizer needs for 2018. Additionally, Brazil has emerged in recent years as the second largest importer of urea in the world, with imports of approximately 5.4 million metric tons in 2017, 15 percent higher than 2016 and 64 percent higher than 2012. Countries such as Australia, Mexico and Turkey have also significantly increased imports of urea in recent years.\nImports of nitrogen will continue to be necessary to meet expected demand in North America in 2018 with the company projecting that approximately 91 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States. For much of 2017, nitrogen prices in the region discouraged imports. Urea barge prices at New Orleans averaged approximately $25 below international parity during the fourth quarter and only rose above international parity for one week in all of 2017. As a result, imports of urea and UAN from July through December declined 37 percent and 24 percent, respectively, compared to the same period in 2016. Given steady demand and higher netbacks available in other regions, nitrogen prices in North America will likely have to rise to attract the imports necessary to meet expected demand.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures in 2017 totaled $473 million. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was for new activities in 2017 and the remainder was for activities performed in 2016 but paid for in 2017. As of September 30, 2017, the company had $158 million in costs accrued but unpaid for work completed in 2016 related to capacity expansion projects. At December 31, 2017, these costs are no longer the subject of disputes and the company's capital expenditures for 2017 reflect all payments associated with these formerly disputed costs.\nCapital expenditures in 2018 for new activity are estimated to be in the range of approximately $400 to $450 million, which takes into account a higher number of plant turnarounds than in 2017.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $835 million on the balance sheet, had no borrowings outstanding under its $750 million revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under its debt instruments.\nOn December 1, 2017, the company completed the redemption of all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of its 6.875% Senior Notes due May 2018. Additionally, on December 26, 2017, the company purchased $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.125% Senior Notes due 2020 pursuant to a tender offer. As a result, the aggregate principal amount of CF Industries Holdings, Inc.'s outstanding long-term indebtedness was approximately $4.75 billion at the end of 2017, compared to $5.85 billion at the end of 2016. At this level of gross debt, interest expense for 2018 would be approximately $230 million, or $76 million lower than 2017 on an annualized basis.\nExercise of Right to Purchase All Publicly Traded Units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.\nThe company announced on February 7, 2018, that its wholly owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. has elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement. The purchase price of all of the publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. The company intends to fund the purchase with cash on hand. As of the April 2, 2018, purchase date, all rights of the holders of the units will terminate, with the exception of the right to receive payment of the purchase price.\nCHS Inc. Distribution\nOn January 31, 2018, the Board of Managers of CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) approved a semi-annual distribution payment to CHS Inc. (CHS) of $49 million for the distribution period ended December 31, 2017. The distribution was paid on January 31, 2018. The total distribution to CHS pertaining to 2017 was approximately $108 million.\nConsolidated Results\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in millions, except per share and per MMBtu amounts)\nNet sales $ 1,099 $ 867 $ 4,130 $ 3,685 Cost of sales 956 773 3,700 2,845 Gross margin $ 143 $ 94 $ 430 $ 840 Gross margin percentage 13.0 % 10.8 % 10.4 % 22.8 % Net earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 465 $ (320 ) $ 358 $ (277 ) Adjusted net (loss) earnings (1) $ (3 ) $ (90 ) $ (59 ) $ 109 Net earnings (loss) per diluted share $ 1.98 $ (1.38 ) $ 1.53 $ (1.19 ) Adjusted net (loss) earnings per diluted share (1) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.39 ) $ (0.25 ) $ 0.47 EBITDA (1) $ 224 $ (135 ) $ 856 $ 395 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 260 $ 133 $ 969 $ 858 Tons of product sold (000s) 5,284 4,683 19,952 16,957 Supplemental data (per MMBtu): Natural gas costs in cost of sales (2) $ 3.11 $ 3.18 $ 3.33 $ 2.61 Realized derivatives loss in cost of sales (3) 0.13 0.06 0.07 0.46 Cost of natural gas in cost of sales $ 3.24 $ 3.24 $ 3.40 $ 3.07 Average daily market price of natural gas (per MMBtu): Henry Hub $ 2.87 $ 2.99 $ 2.96 $ 2.48 National Balancing Point UK $ 6.92 $ 5.69 $ 5.80 $ 4.66 Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives $ (3 ) $ (91 ) $ 61 $ (260 ) Depreciation and amortization $ 235 $ 203 $ 883 $ 678 Capital expenditures $ 183 $ 392 $ 473 $ 2,211 Production volume by product tons (000s): Ammonia (4) 2,642 2,326 10,295 8,307 Granular urea 1,122 914 4,451 3,368 UAN (32%) 1,892 1,795 6,914 6,698 AN 555 553 2,127 1,845\n(1) See reconciliations of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net (loss) earnings and adjusted net (loss) earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying this release.\n(2) Includes the cost of natural gas that is included in cost of sales during the period under the first-in, first-out inventory cost method.\n(3) Includes realized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives settled during the period.

Segment Results\nAmmonia Segment\nCF Industries’ ammonia segment produces anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is the company’s most concentrated form of nitrogen, containing 82 percent nitrogen. The results of the ammonia segment consist of sales of ammonia to external customers. In addition, ammonia is the “basic” nitrogen form that the company upgrades into other nitrogen products such as urea, UAN and AN.\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in millions, except per ton amounts)\nNet sales $ 344 $ 211 $ 1,209 $ 981 Cost of sales 300 210 1,071 715 Gross margin $ 44 $ 1 $ 138 $ 266 Gross margin percentage 12.8 % 0.5 % 11.4 % 27.1 % Sales volume by product tons (000s) 1,207 762 4,105 2,874 Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) (1) 991 626 3,367 2,358 Average selling price per product ton $ 285 $ 277 $ 295 $ 341 Average selling price per nutrient ton (1) 347 337 359 416 Gross margin per product ton $ 36 $ 1 $ 34 $ 93 Gross margin per nutrient ton (1) 44 2 41 113 Adjusted gross margin (2) : Gross margin $ 44 $ 1 $ 138 $ 266 Depreciation and amortization 53 37 183 96 Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives — (30 ) 20 (85 ) Adjusted gross margin $ 97 $ 8 $ 341 $ 277 Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales 28.2 % 3.8 % 28.2 % 28.2 %\n(1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.\n(2) Adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization and unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives. The company has presented adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales because management uses these measures, and believes they are useful to investors, as supplemental financial measures in the comparison of year-over-year performance. A reconciliation of adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales to gross margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the table above. See \"Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release.\nComparison of 2017 to 2016 fourth quarter periods:\nAmmonia sales volume increased of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to additional production volume from the company's Donaldsonville and Port Neal Nitrogen Complexes and increased demand for fall agricultural applications. Ammonia average selling prices increased primarily due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. Additionally, ammonia selling prices benefited from the commencement of delivery under a long-term supply agreement. Ammonia gross margin per ton increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the absence of start-up expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 associated with the new Port Neal ammonia plant, production efficiencies due to increased volumes and higher average selling prices. These were partially offset by a $30 million lower unrealized mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives compared to the prior year period and an increase in realized natural gas costs.\nGranular Urea Segment\nCF Industries’ granular urea segment produces granular urea, which contains 46 percent nitrogen. Produced from ammonia and carbon dioxide, it has the highest nitrogen content of any of the company’s solid nitrogen products.\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in millions, except per ton amounts)\nNet sales $ 246 $ 189 $ 971 $ 831 Cost of sales 188 139 856 584 Gross margin $ 58 $ 50 $ 115 $ 247 Gross margin percentage 23.6 % 26.5 % 11.8 % 29.7 % Sales volume by product tons (000s) 1,008 883 4,357 3,597 Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) (1) 463 406 2,004 1,654 Average selling price per product ton $ 244 $ 214 $ 223 $ 231 Average selling price per nutrient ton (1) 531 466 485 502 Gross margin per product ton $ 58 $ 57 $ 26 $ 69 Gross margin per nutrient ton (1) 125 123 57 149 Adjusted gross margin (2) : Gross margin $ 58 $ 50 $ 115 $ 247 Depreciation and amortization 59 37 246 112 Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives (1 ) (23 ) 16 (67 ) Adjusted gross margin $ 116 $ 64 $ 377 $ 292 Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales 47.2 % 33.9 % 38.8 % 35.1 %\n(1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.\n(2) Adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales are non-GAAP financial measures.

See \"Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release.\nComparison of 2017 to 2016 fourth quarter periods:\nGranular urea sales volume increased for the quarter primarily due to additional production volume from the company's Port Neal Nitrogen Complex. Granular urea average selling price per ton increased primarily due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. Granular urea gross margin per ton was relatively unchanged as higher average selling prices and production efficiencies due to increased volumes were partially offset by a $1 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives compared to a $23 million gain in the prior year period; an increase in depreciation primarily associated with the new Port Neal urea plant; and, to a lesser extent, higher realized natural gas costs.\nUAN Segment\nCF Industries’ UAN segment produces urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN). UAN is a liquid product with nitrogen content that typically ranges from 28 percent to 32 percent and is produced by combining urea and ammonium nitrate in solution.\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in millions, except per ton amounts)\nNet sales $ 288 $ 305 $ 1,134 $ 1,196 Cost of sales 272 274 1,055 920 Gross margin $ 16 $ 31 $ 79 $ 276 Gross margin percentage 5.6 % 10.2 % 7.0 % 23.1 % Sales volume by product tons (000s) 1,920 2,047 7,093 6,681 Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) (1) 606 648 2,242 2,109 Average selling price per product ton $ 150 $ 149 $ 160 $ 179 Average selling price per nutrient ton (1) 475 471 506 567 Gross margin per product ton $ 8 $ 15 $ 11 $ 41 Gross margin per nutrient ton (1) 26 48 35 131 Adjusted gross margin (2) : Gross margin $ 16 $ 31 $ 79 $ 276 Depreciation and amortization 73 72 265 247 Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives — (29 ) 19 (81 ) Adjusted gross margin $ 89 $ 74 $ 363 $ 442 Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales 30.9 % 24.3 % 32.0 % 37.0 %\n(1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.

See \"Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release. Comparison of 2017 to 2016 fourth quarter periods:\nUAN sales volume decreased in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to lower export sales than in the prior year period. UAN average selling price per ton was relatively unchanged. UAN gross margin per ton decreased in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to a $29 million lower unrealized net mark-to-market gain compared to the prior year period and, to a lesser extent, an increase in realized natural gas costs partially offset by cost reduction initiatives.\nAN Segment\nCF Industries' AN segment produces ammonium nitrate (AN). AN is used as a nitrogen fertilizer with nitrogen content between 29 percent to 35 percent, and also is used by industrial customers for commercial explosives and blasting systems. AN is produced at the company's Yazoo City, Mississippi; Billingham, United Kingdom; and Ince, United Kingdom, complexes.\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in millions, except per ton amounts)\nNet sales $ 125 $ 93 $ 497 $ 411 Cost of sales 115 93 446 409 Gross margin $ 10 $ — $ 51 $ 2 Gross margin percentage 8.0 % — % 10.3 % 0.5 % Sales volume by product tons (000s) 576 541 2,353 2,151 Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) (1) 194 181 793 726 Average selling price per product ton $ 217 $ 172 $ 211 $ 191 Average selling price per nutrient ton (1) 644 514 627 566 Gross margin per product ton $ 17 $ — $ 22 $ 1 Gross margin per nutrient ton (1) 52 — 64 3 Adjusted gross margin (2) : Gross margin $ 10 $ — $ 51 $ 2 Depreciation and amortization 21 21 85 93 Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives (1 ) (3 ) 2 (10 ) Adjusted gross margin $ 30 $ 18 $ 138 $ 85 Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales 24.0 % 19.4 % 27.8 % 20.7 %\n(1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.

Comparison of 2017 to 2016 fourth quarter periods:\nAN sales volume increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to increased demand for both agricultural and industrial applications. AN average selling price per ton increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance and the effect of a long-term AN supply agreement that commenced in 2017. AN gross margin per ton increased due to higher average selling prices partially offset by a $1 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives compared to a $3 million mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in the prior year period and an increase in realized natural gas costs.\nOther Segment\nCF Industries’ Other segment includes diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and compound fertilizer products (NPKs).\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in millions, except per ton amounts)\nNet sales $ 96 $ 69 $ 319 $ 266 Cost of sales 81 57 272 217 Gross margin $ 15 $ 12 $ 47 $ 49 Gross margin percentage 15.6 % 17.4 % 14.7 % 18.4 % Sales volume by product tons (000s) 573 450 2,044 1,654 Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) (1) 112 87 397 317 Average selling price per product ton $ 168 $ 153 $ 156 $ 161 Average selling price per nutrient ton (1) 857 793 804 839 Gross margin per product ton $ 26 $ 27 $ 23 $ 30 Gross margin per nutrient ton (1) 134 138 118 155 Adjusted gross margin (2) : Gross margin $ 15 $ 12 $ 47 $ 49 Depreciation and amortization 17 12 57 46 Unrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives (1 ) (6 ) 4 (17 ) Adjusted gross margin $ 31 $ 18 $ 108 $ 78 Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales 32.3 % 26.1 % 33.9 % 29.3 %\n(1) Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons.

See \"Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release. Comparison of 2017 to 2016 fourth quarter periods:\nOther segment volume increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to higher year-over-year sales of DEF as the company continues to grow its North American DEF business. Other segment average selling price per ton increased primarily due to the impact of a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. Other segment gross margin per ton was relatively unchanged as higher average selling prices were partially offset by a $1 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives compared to a $6 million mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in the prior year period, higher depreciation related to the new DEF unit at Donaldsonville and an increase in realized natural gas costs.\nDividend Payment\nOn February 7, 2018, CF Industries’ Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per common share. The dividend will be paid on February 28, 2018 to stockholders of record as of February 16, 2018.\nConference Call\nCF Industries will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results at 9:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, February 15, 2018.
