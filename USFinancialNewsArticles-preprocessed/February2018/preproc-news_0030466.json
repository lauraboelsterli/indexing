    "text": "LAS VEGAS, Live Ventures Incorporated (Nasdaq:LIVE), a diversified holding company, today announces financial results for its first fiscal quarter 2018, which ended December 31, 2017. The company reported record quarterly revenue of $40.3 million, representing an increase of 25.4 percent over the same period last year. Despite a one-time, non-cash charge of $2.3 million associated with the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the company reported quarterly basic earnings per share of $0.95, an increase of 33.8 percent over last year.\nCash availability, representing cash on hand and available credit on the company’s revolving lines of credit, reached a record $19.6 million.\nKey highlights of the first fiscal quarter 2018 compared to 2017 include:\nRevenues of $40.3 million, up 25.4 percent\nGross profit of $16.4 million, up 29.6 percent\nNet Income of $1.8 million, up 31.4 percent\nBasic earnings per share of $0.95, up 33.8 percent\nTotal assets of $132 million\nNet cash flow from operating activities totaled $6.3 million, up 98 percent\n“Our first fiscal quarter of 2018 was outstanding. Double-digit growth for both top and bottom line were driven by both of our core businesses, Vintage Stock and Marquis Industries. The company’s performance continues to accelerate, and we are expecting further organic growth from Vintage Stock and Marquis, and our new acquisition, ApplianceSmart,” said Virland Johnson, CFO of Live Ventures.\nThe company recorded a one-time, non-cash bargain purchase gain related to its acquisition of ApplianceSmart of $3.7 million. This bargain purchase gain is preliminary and subject to change, based on the company finalizing the purchase price allocation with respect to the acquisition of ApplianceSmart.\nLive Ventures will be holding its first quarter conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 14, 2018.
