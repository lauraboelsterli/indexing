Net income was $16.3 million, or $0.50 per common unit, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $16.4 million, or $0.50 per common unit, for the same period in 2016. The partnership reported adjusted EBITDA of $19.0 million and distributable cash flow of $17.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with adjusted EBITDA of $19.0 million and distributable cash flow of $17.8 million for the same period in 2016. Distribution coverage was 1.15x for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017.\n“We reported another solid year of consistent earnings with 9% distribution growth and a coverage ratio of 1.08x,” said Todd Becker, president and chief executive officer of Green Plains Partners. “The partnership performed well this year and we continue to focus on: organic growth, further development of downstream distribution services, and acquisitions that will diversify earnings. In addition, demand is strong for ethanol both domestically and globally. Now that Green Plains Inc. is operating its new export terminal joint venture in Beaumont, Texas, we look forward to potentially acquiring this asset in the first half of 2018.”\nFull Year Highlights\nIn February 2017, the partnership formed NLR Energy Logistics LLC, a 50/50 joint venture with Delek Renewables LLC to build an ethanol unit train terminal and provide approximately 100,000 barrels of storage. NLR Energy Logistics signed a five-year lease with the Little Rock Port Authority, effective June 1, 2017, and executed five-year terminal throughput agreements that will provide the terminal minimum volume commitments. Construction of the terminal is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2018 at a total cost of approximately $7.0 million.\nOn Sept. 11, 2017, John Neppl joined the company as chief financial officer of Green Plains Inc. and Green Plains Partners, replacing Jerry Peters, who retired. Mr. Peters continues as a member of the board of directors of Green Plains Holdings LLC, the general partner of Green Plains Partners. Mr. Neppl most recently served as chief financial officer of The Gavilon Group, LLC and brings extensive experience in commodity processing and trading businesses.\nOn Oct. 27, 2017, the partnership upsized its revolving credit facility by $40 million, from $155 million to $195 million, accessing a portion of the $100 million accordion in place on the facility.\nOn Jan. 18, 2018, the board of directors of the partnership’s general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.47 per unit, or approximately $15.3 million, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017. The fourth quarter distribution is payable on Feb. 9, 2018, to unitholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 2, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated revenues of $28.3 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, were consistent with the same period for 2016. Other revenue, which increased $0.5 million due to the expansion of the partnership’s truck fleet, was offset by revenues generated from the partnership’s terminal services agreements, which decreased $0.5 million due to lower third-party throughput volumes at the partnership’s fuel terminals.\nOperations and maintenance expenses decreased $0.2 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, compared with the same period for 2016, primarily due to lower railcar lease expenses of $0.6 million, offset by higher wages and fuel expense of $0.4 million related to truck fleet expansion. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, compared with the same period for 2016, primarily due to a benefit recognized during the fourth quarter of 2016 related to accrued transaction costs. Interest expense increased $0.2 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, compared with the same period last year due to the expanded credit facility and higher interest rates.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Green Plains Inc. operated its ethanol facilities at approximately 91% of its daily average capacity, which generated revenues in excess of the minimum volume commitment, and used the remaining $0.2 million credit related to the deficiency payment charged to Green Plains Trade during the second quarter of 2017.\nGREEN PLAINS PARTNERS LP SELECTED OPERATING DATA (unaudited, in million gallons) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 % Var. 2017 2016 % Var.

Management believes adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide investors useful information in assessing the partnership’s financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and adjustments for transaction costs related to acquisitions or financings, minimum volume commitment deficiency payments, unit-based compensation expense and net gains or losses on asset sales. Distributable cash flow is defined as adjusted EBITDA less interest paid or payable, income taxes paid or payable, maintenance capital expenditures and equity method investment earnings. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP to analyze the partnership’s results.\nAbout Green Plains Partners LP\nGreen Plains Partners LP (NASDAQ:GPP) is a fee-based Delaware limited partnership formed by Green Plains Inc. to provide fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage tanks, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses.
