    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Andrews & Springer LLC , a boutique securities class action law firm focused on representing shareholders nationwide, is investigating potential breach of fiduciary duty claims against the Board of Directors of Ply Gem Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: PGEM) (“Ply Gem” or the “Company”) relating to the sale of the Company to private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (“CD&R”). On January 31, 2018, the two parties announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which CD&R will acquire Ply Gem in a merger worth $2.4 billion. As a result of the merger, Ply Gem’s shareholders are only anticipated to receive $21.64 per share in cash in exchange for each share of Ply Gem.\nOur Firm's investigation so far has discovered that the process leading up to the announcement of the merger appears to have significant conflicts of interest, thus making the process and consideration unfair.\nAndrews & Springer is also investigating whether Ply Gem’s directors are breaching their fiduciary duties by failing to adequately shop the company and maximize shareholder value. Our investigation is also looking into whether Ply Gem’s top executives were conflicted and acted in their own self-interest when approving the merger.\nIf you own shares of Ply Gem and want to receive additional information and protect your investments free of charge, please visit us at http://www.andrewsspringer.com/cases-investigations/ply-gem-class-action-investigation/ or contact Craig J.
