    "text": "DENVER, Feb. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: RMAX), parent company of RE/MAX, one of the world's leading franchisors of real estate brokerage services, and Motto Mortgage (\"Motto\"), an innovative mortgage brokerage franchise, today announced that RE/MAX President Geoff Lewis has decided to retire.\nThe Board of Directors has determined that Lewis's responsibilities overseeing the Region Development group will be transitioned to RE/MAX Co-CEO Adam Contos effective immediately and that RE/MAX Region Executive Vice Presidents Josh Bolgren and Kevin Northrup will continue in their roles supporting franchises within owned and independent regions. Lewis will remain with RE/MAX as Senior Advisor for approximately five months, until June 30, 2018, to assist with the transition.\nDavid Liniger, Co-CEO and Co-Founder, commented, \"We wish Geoff well in his retirement. We look forward to the future with confidence as Adam works more closely with our Affiliates in both our owned and independent regions.\"\nMr. Lewis stated, \"It has been a great honor to have served as President of the leading real estate franchising company in the world. I especially want to thank the tremendous team that has supported me in my role. I remain confident that RE/MAX will retain its number one position and wish the company the greatest of success. I have decided that the time is right for me to retire.\"\nLewis joined RE/MAX World Headquarters in 2004 as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and became Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer the following year. He was promoted to Executive Vice President, Chief Legal and Compliance Officer in 2013 and was named President in 2015.\nAbout the RE/MAX Network\nRE/MAX was founded in 1973 by David and Gail Liniger, with an innovative, entrepreneurial culture affording its agents and franchisees the flexibility to operate their businesses with great independence.
