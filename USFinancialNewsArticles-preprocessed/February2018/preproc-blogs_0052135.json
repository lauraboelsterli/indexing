    "text": "Venture Capital BlackRock to talk to gun makers over response to school shootings BlackRock officials said they want to reach out to the companies \"to understand their response\" to the Florida school massacre. With BlackRock being by far the leader in the $3.4 trillion ETF space the firm theoretically could exert some pressure on the index providers. CNBC.com Getty Images Students from around the region gather in front of the White House to protest the lack of gun control in the wake of last weeks shooting in Florida, on February, 19, 2018 in Washington, DC. \nThe world's largest asset manager says it plans to speak with gunmakers following a wave of public outcry sparked by the Florida school shootings last week. \nBlackRock officials said they want to reach out to the companies \"to understand their response\" to the shootings. \nThe firm, which manages $5.7 trillion for clients, indirectly owns shares in the companies through the many exchange-traded funds under BlackRock's iShares umbrella. The funds track indexes such as the S&P 500 and various sector indexes as well. \nWith BlackRock being by far the leader in the $3.4 trillion ETF space, with nearly $1.4 trillion under management, the firm theoretically could exert some pressure on the index providers to remove the gunmakers from their listings. \nCompany spokesman Ed Sweeney said via e-mail that it cannot sell shares of a company in an index and instead \"we focus on engaging with the company and understanding how they are responding to society's expectations of them.\" \nShares of companies such as American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger rose Thursday after President Donald Trump said he was open to multiple gun control measures.",
