    "text": "DOWNERS GROVE, Ill., Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Univar Inc. (NYSE: UNVR) (\"Univar\"), a global chemical and ingredients distributor and provider of value-added services, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the fourth quarter, Univar reported net income of $27.0 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to a net loss of $59.2 million, or ($0.43) per share in the prior year fourth quarter. Earnings per share was adversely impacted by a $36.6 million, or ($0.26) per share charge, related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017.\nAdjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 36.0 percent to $0.34 per share from $0.25 per share in the prior year fourth quarter, driven by higher average selling prices, improved sales force execution, and mix enrichment. Adjusted EBITDA grew 10.4 percent to $148.5 million from $134.5 million in the fourth quarter of last year as a result of higher gross profit and operating expense productivity gains that funded investments in people and digital technologies.\nFor the full year, Univar reported net income of $119.8 million, or $0.85 per share, compared to a net loss of $68.4 million, or ($0.50) per share in the prior year.\nAdjusted earnings per share for the full year increased 35.0 percent to $1.39 per share from $1.03 per share in the prior year. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 21.9 percent as a result of the Company's initiatives to improve sales force execution, capture higher value business opportunities, and higher average selling prices. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7.3 percent to $603.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 30 basis points to 7.3 percent.\nIn 2017, the Company:\nExpanded consolidated gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin Grew Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in all operating segments Successfully realigned its USA commercial organization and supply chain to better meet the needs of customers and supplier partners Advanced its digitization initiatives with the launch of MyUnivar.com Strengthened its management team and unveiled its CEO succession plan\n\"2017 was a pivotal year as we significantly advanced our transformation. We considerably improved our execution and returned Univar to growth, increasing our momentum with each quarter of the year,\" said Steve Newlin, chairman and chief executive officer. \"Our strategic initiatives of Commercial Greatness, Operational Excellence and One Univar are strengthening our organization, and I am confident that David Jukes is the best leader to advance Univar's transformation to achieve our 2019 and 2021 growth targets.\"\nAddressing the Company's results, Univar executive vice president and chief financial officer, Carl Lukach said, \"We exited 2017 with higher profitability, solid cash flow, and a much stronger balance sheet. This enables us to deploy capital to targeted growth investments in our people, operations and technology, while continuing to reduce our leverage and earn a superior return on capital for our shareholders.\"\nCompany Performance\nThe results of Univar's operating performance are described below and, unless otherwise indicated, are a comparison of fourth quarter 2017 results with fourth quarter 2016 results, including Adjusted EBITDA, which is reconciled to reported net income in the accompanying supplemental financial information.\nUnivar Inc.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n$ change\n% change\n% change\nexcl.\ncurrency\nExternal Net Sales\nUSA\n$\n1,130.1\n$\n1,084.3\n$\n45.8\n4.2\n%\n4.2\n%\nCanada\n271.9\n242.1\n29.8\n12.3\n%\n5.8\n%\nEMEA\n460.9\n394.4\n66.5\n16.9\n%\n7.8\n%\nRest of World\n96.3\n91.7\n4.6\n5.0\n%\n0.5\n%\nTotal Consolidated Net Sales\n$\n1,959.2\n$\n1,812.5\n$\n146.7\n8.1\n%\n5.0\n%\nGross Profit\nUSA\n$\n260.2\n$\n246.1\n$\n14.1\n5.7\n%\n5.7\n%\nCanada\n58.1\n55.1\n3.0\n5.4\n%\n0.4\n%\nEMEA\n104.6\n92.0\n12.6\n13.7\n%\n4.7\n%\nRest of World\n22.0\n20.1\n1.9\n9.5\n%\n6.0\n%\nTotal Consolidated Gross Profit\n$\n444.9\n$\n413.3\n$\n31.6\n7.6\n%\n4.8\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\nUSA\n$\n86.7\n$\n78.3\n$\n8.4\n10.7\n%\n10.7\n%\nCanada\n28.1\n24.8\n3.3\n13.3\n%\n7.7\n%\nEMEA\n32.7\n28.9\n3.8\n13.1\n%\n1.4\n%\nRest of World\n7.8\n7.8\n—\n—\n%\n(2.6)\n%\nOther*\n(6.8)\n(5.3)\n(1.5)\n(28.3)\n%\n(28.3)\n%\nTotal Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n148.5\n$\n134.5\n$\n14.0\n10.4\n%\n6.7\n%\n* Other represents unallocated corporate costs that do not directly benefit segments.\nSegment Highlights for the Fourth Quarter 2017\nUSA – Adjusted EBITDA increased 10.7 percent to $86.7 million, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. USA segment sales increased 4.2 percent, the first quarter of sales growth in three years, and gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 23.0 percent. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points to 7.7 percent, reflecting higher gross margins and strong operating expense management.\nCanada – Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.3 percent to $28.1 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 10.3 percent, as a result of higher average selling prices, improved sales force execution, strong operating expense management and the benefit of a stronger Canadian dollar. Gross margin decreased 140 basis points to 21.4 percent driven largely by product and market mix, including effects of the drought-impacted agricultural season.\nEMEA – Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.1 percent to $32.7 million due to improvements in sales force execution, growth in Focused Industries and Industrial Specialties, higher average selling prices, as well as a stronger Euro. Operating expenses declined 40 basis points as a percentage of sales due to strong expense management. Gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 22.7 percent, largely due to a slight change in product and market mix compared to the prior year.\nRest of World – Adjusted EBITDA of $7.8 million was equal to last year as growth in Brazil and increased profitability in Asia Pacific was offset by softness in Mexico. Higher average selling prices and mix improvement were offset by lower volume, which was the result of continued shortages of certain products in Latin America and softness in local economic conditions. Gross margin increased 90 basis points to 22.8 percent. Supply and demand conditions continued to stabilize, and the Company expects business conditions to normalize in the first half of 2018.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nAs required, beginning with its first quarter 2018 earnings release, Univar will adopt the FASB retirement benefits pronouncement. Under this new standard, the Company will continue to report the service component of pension and other postretirement benefit cost in its operating costs. The non-service components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost will be reported below operating income. Univar will apply the new pronouncement retrospectively, and restate its 2016 and 2017 financial statements. Adoption and restatement of the retirement benefits pronouncement will not impact net income, but will retrospectively reduce Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $10 million in 2017 and $15 million in 2016.\nAlso as required, Univar's 2018 financial statements will reflect the Company's adoption of the FASB revenue recognition standard. This new standard redefines when and how revenue is recognized from our contracts with customers. While Univar's 2018 financial statements will be prepared under the new standard, the net impact on prior years will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings, reflecting the Company's election of the modified retrospective approach. The Company anticipates this adjustment to not be material and will include additional disclosures under the new standard in its future reporting.\nOutlook\nIn 2018, Univar expects to capitalize on the positive growth momentum it created in 2017 and further advance its key initiatives of Commercial Greatness, Operational Excellence and One Univar, towards achievement of its 2019 and 2021 financial targets. For the full year 2018, the Company expects mid-single digit revenue growth reflecting improvements in sales force execution, higher win/loss ratios, and new supplier authorizations. The Company also expects to continue delivering operating cost productivity gains that will help fund targeted investments in digital technologies and in its sales force. As a result, the Company expects to deliver low double digit percent growth in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted earnings per share between $1.60 and $1.80 for the full year. For the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA growth of around 10 percent.\nUnivar to Host Webcast on Feb. 28 at 9:00 a.m. ET\nThe Company will host a webcast with investors to discuss the fourth-quarter results at 9:00 a.m. ET on Feb. 28, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of its website at http://investor.univar.com . Following the event, an archived version of the webcast and supporting materials will be available on the same website.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted earnings per share\nThe Company monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. The Company evaluates performance on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA, which it defines as its consolidated net income (loss), plus the sum of interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization, other operating expenses, net (which primarily consists of pension mark to market adjustments, acquisition and integration related expenses, employee stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, business optimization, and other unusual or non-recurring expenses), impairment charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and other income (expense), net (which consists of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and undesignated derivative instruments, debt refinancing costs, and other non-operating activity). Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of operating performance because:\nThe Company reports Adjusted EBITDA to its lenders as required under the covenants of its credit agreements; Adjusted EBITDA excludes the effects of income taxes, as well as the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization expenses; The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA in setting performance incentive targets; The Company considers gains (losses) on the acquisition, disposal and impairment of assets as resulting from investing decisions rather than ongoing operations; and Other significant items, while periodically affecting the Company's results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of its results.\nThe Company has incorporated an Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share metric as a complementary metric to GAAP earnings per share to provide additional transparency to ongoing performance. Adjusted net income excludes the same items as Adjusted EBITDA, except for stock-based compensation expense.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe Company's management believes that certain financial measures that do not comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") provide relevant and meaningful information concerning the ongoing operating results of the Company. Such non-GAAP financial measures are used from time to time herein but should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP measures of performance. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in Schedules B and E.\nAbout Univar\nFounded in 1924, Univar (NYSE: UNVR) is a global chemical and ingredients distributor and provider of value-added services, working with leading suppliers worldwide.

Diluted earnings per share considers the impact of potential dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/univar-reports-2017-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial-results-300605631.html\nSOURCE Univar Inc.",
