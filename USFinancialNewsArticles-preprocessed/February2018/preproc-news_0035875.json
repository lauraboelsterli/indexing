(NYSE:CRL) today reported its results for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 and provided guidance for 2018. For the quarter, revenue from continuing operations was $478.5 million, an increase of 2.5% from $466.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue growth was driven by the Discovery and Safety Assessment and Manufacturing Support segments.\nThe addition of a 53 rd week at the end of 2016, which is periodically required to align to a December 31 st calendar year end, reduced reported fourth-quarter revenue growth by 5.1%. The February 2017 divestiture of the Contract Development and Manufacturing (CDMO) business reduced reported revenue growth by 1.1%. The impact of foreign currency translation benefited reported revenue growth by 2.4%. The acquisition of Brains On-Line contributed 0.7% to consolidated fourth-quarter revenue growth, both on a reported basis and in constant currency. Excluding the effect of these items, organic revenue growth was 5.6%.\nOn a GAAP basis, the fourth-quarter net loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders was $29.8 million, a decrease from net income of $44.7 million for the same period in 2016. The fourth-quarter diluted loss per share on a GAAP basis was $0.63, a decrease from earnings per share of $0.93 for the fourth quarter of 2016. The GAAP loss per share resulted from one-time expenses related to U.S. tax reform in the fourth quarter of 2017, which reduced earnings by $78.5 million, or $1.66 per share.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations was $68.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 16.9% from $58.3 million for the same period in 2016. Fourth-\nquarter diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.40, an increase of 15.7% from $1.21 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The non-GAAP earnings per share increase was driven primarily by a gain from the Company’s venture capital investments, as well as higher revenue and operating income.\nOn both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, the gain from the Company’s venture capital investments contributed $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a $0.02 gain for the same period in 2016. An excess tax benefit associated with stock compensation contributed $0.03 per share.\nJames C. Foster, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our strong performance in 2017 reflects robust client demand across our broad portfolio of essential, early-stage drug research and manufacturing support products and services, as well as disciplined investments in staffing and infrastructure we are making to support our continuing growth.”\n“We are continuing to strategically expand our portfolio with the intended acquisition of MPI Research, which will enhance our capabilities and provide capacity for growth in the Discovery and Safety Assessment segment. The continuing expansion of our unique portfolio enhances the value we can provide to clients, which is the basis for our expected growth in 2018 and over the longer term,” Mr. Foster concluded.\nFourth-Quarter Segment Results\nResearch Models and Services (RMS)\nRevenue for the RMS segment was $120.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 3.4% from $124.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Organic revenue declined by 1.4%, driven primarily by lower revenue for research models outside of China and the Research Animal Diagnostic Services (RADS) business. The decline was partially offset by higher revenue for research models in China, and the Insourcing Solutions and Genetically Engineered Models and Services (GEMS) businesses.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the RMS segment’s GAAP operating margin decreased to 10.5% from 26.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The GAAP operating margin decline was related primarily to an asset impairment and related charges associated with the planned closure of the Company’s research model production site in Maryland, which was announced in November 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin decreased to 26.0% from 27.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The non-GAAP operating margin decline was driven primarily by the research models business.\nDiscovery and Safety Assessment (DSA)\nRevenue from continuing operations for the DSA segment was $253.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 4.8% from $241.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth of 6.8% was driven by both the Discovery Services and Safety Assessment businesses. The DSA revenue increase was driven primarily by demand from biotechnology clients.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the DSA segment’s GAAP operating margin increased to 18.6% from 18.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The GAAP operating margin increase was due primarily to higher site consolidation costs in the fourth quarter of 2016, associated with the Company’s ongoing efficiency initiatives. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin decreased to 22.0% from 23.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The non-GAAP operating margin decline was driven primarily by study mix and higher staffing costs to support growth. In addition, foreign exchange reduced the DSA operating margin by approximately 80 basis points.\nManufacturing Support (Manufacturing)\nRevenue for the Manufacturing segment was $104.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 4.5% from $100.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth was 11.8%, driven by strong performances from the Microbial Solutions and Biologics Testing Solutions businesses.\nIn fourth quarter of 2017, the Manufacturing segment’s GAAP operating margin increased to 34.7% from 31.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin increased to 37.6% from 34.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin improvements were driven primarily by enhanced manufacturing efficiency and volume leverage from higher revenue in the Microbial Solutions business.\nFull-Year Results\nFor 2017, revenue increased by 10.5% to $1.86 billion from $1.68 billion in 2016. Organic revenue growth was 6.7%.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders was $123.5 million in 2017, a decrease of 20.1% from $154.5 million in 2016. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in 2017 were $2.54, a decrease of 21.1% from $3.22 in 2016.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations was $256.0 million in 2017, an increase of 16.9% from $218.9 million in 2016. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis in 2017 were $5.27, an increase of 15.6% from $4.56 in 2016.\nOn both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, the Company recorded gains from venture capital investments totaling $0.29 per share in 2017, compared to gains of $0.13 in 2016. An excess tax benefit associated with stock compensation contributed $0.23 per share in 2017.\nResearch Models and Services (RMS)\nFor 2017, RMS revenue was $493.6 million, a decrease of 0.1% from $494.0 million in 2016. Organic revenue growth was 1.2%.\nOn a GAAP basis, the RMS segment operating margin decreased to 23.2% in 2017 from 27.6% in 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin decreased to 27.3% in 2017 from 28.4% in 2016.\nDiscovery and Safety Assessment (DSA)\nFor 2017, DSA revenue was $980.0 million, an increase of 17.1% from $836.6 million in 2016. Organic revenue growth was 7.5%.\nOn a GAAP basis, the DSA segment operating margin increased to 18.8% in 2017 from 16.5% in 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin decreased to 22.3% in 2017 from 22.7% in 2016.\nManufacturing Support (Manufacturing)\nFor 2017, Manufacturing revenue was $384.0 million, an increase of 9.5% from $350.8 million in 2016. Organic revenue growth was 12.9%.\nOn a GAAP basis, the Manufacturing segment operating margin increased to 32.3% in 2017 from 29.8% in 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin increased to 35.5% in 2017 from 33.8% in 2016.\nStock Repurchase Update\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. For the full-year 2017, the Company repurchased 957,292 shares for a total of $90.6 million. As of December 30, 2017, the Company had $129.1 million available on its authorized stock repurchase program.\nAcquisition of MPI Research\nIn a separate press release today, Charles River announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MPI Research for approximately $800 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments.\nMPI is a leading non-clinical contract research organization (CRO) providing comprehensive testing services to biopharmaceutical and medical device companies worldwide. Acquiring MPI will enhance Charles River’s position as a leading global early-stage CRO by strengthening its ability to partner with clients across the drug discovery and development continuum. MPI is expected to be reported as part of Charles River’s Discovery and Safety Assessment segment.\nThe transaction is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.25 in 2018 and approximately $0.60 in 2019. The Company expects to generate operational synergies as a result of the acquisition, with benefits totaling $13 to $16 million by the end of 2019. Items excluded from non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to include all acquisition-related costs, which primarily include amortization of intangible assets, certain costs associated with efficiency initiatives, advisory fees, certain third-party integration costs, and the write-off of deferred financing costs and fees related to debt financing.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company is providing the following revenue growth and earnings per share guidance for 2018, both excluding and including the impact of the planned acquisition of MPI Research, which was announced on February 13, 2018.\nExcluding MPI, earnings per share in 2018 are expected to benefit from both higher revenue and modest operating margin improvement. The 2018 earnings per share guidance includes a gain of $0.14 on venture capital investments, and $0.14 for the excess tax benefit associated with stock compensation. In 2017, venture capital investment gains and the excess tax benefit associated with stock compensation represented $0.52 combined, which creates a $0.24 per share headwind for 2018 earnings per share.\nAdjusting for gains from venture capital investments and the excess tax benefit from stock compensation in both 2018 and 2017, year-over-year earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 119%-127% on a GAAP basis, and 8-11% on a non-GAAP basis.\nThe Company’s revenue and earnings per share guidance excluding the impact of MPI is as follows:\n2018 GUIDANCE EXCLUDING MPI\n(from continuing operations)\nRevenue growth, reported 7.2% - 8.2% Less: Contribution from acquisitions (1) (0.5% - 1.0%) Less: Favorable impact from foreign exchange (~1.0%) Revenue growth, organic (2) 5.7% - 6.7% GAAP EPS estimate (3) $4.71 - $4.86 Amortization of intangible assets ~$0.58 Charges related to global efficiency initiatives (4) ~$0.08 Acquisition-related adjustments (5) ~$0.05 Non-GAAP EPS estimate $5.42 - $5.57 Footnotes to Guidance Table excluding MPI:\n(1) The contribution from acquisitions reflects only the completed acquisitions of Brains On-Line and KWS BioTest.\n(2) Organic revenue growth is defined as reported revenue growth adjusted for acquisitions, the divestiture of the CDMO business, and foreign currency translation. Divestiture of the CDMO business is not expected to have a material impact on the revenue growth rate in 2018.\n(3) GAAP EPS guidance and related adjustments do not include any acquisition-related costs and charges associated with the planned acquisition of MPI because the transaction has not been completed and estimates for these costs have not been finalized.\n(4) These charges relate primarily to the Company’s planned efficiency initiatives including the closure of the Maryland research model production site. These charges primarily include accelerated lease obligations and severance. Other projects in support of the global productivity and efficiency initiatives are expected, but these charges reflect only the decisions that have already been finalized.\n(5) These adjustments are related to the evaluation and integration of acquisitions completed prior to February 2018, and do not include any costs related to the planned acquisition of MPI. These adjustments primarily include transaction, advisory, and certain third-party integration costs, as well as certain costs associated with acquisition-related efficiency initiatives.\nThe Company is also providing revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for 2018 including the benefit of the MPI acquisition. This combined guidance assumes that the transaction will be completed early in the second quarter of 2018. MPI is expected to be reported as part of Charles River’s DSA segment.\n2018 GUIDANCE INCLUDING MPI\n(from continuing operations)\nCharles River revenue growth, reported 7.2% - 8.2% Contribution from MPI 9% - 10% Revenue growth including MPI, reported 16% - 18% Charles River non-GAAP EPS estimate $5.42 - $5.57 Contribution from MPI ~$0.25 Non-GAAP EPS estimate including MPI (1) $5.67 - $5.82 Footnote to Guidance Table including MPI:\n(1) Additional items excluded from non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to include MPI acquisition and integration-related costs, which primarily include amortization of intangible assets, transaction, advisory and certain third-party integration costs, as well as certain costs associated with acquisition-related efficiency initiatives and the write-off of deferred financing costs and fees related to debt financing. Estimates of these costs have not been finalized.\nWebcast\nCharles River has scheduled a live webcast on Tuesday, February 13, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss matters relating to this press release. To participate, please go to ir.criver.com and select the webcast link. You can also find the associated slide presentation and reconciliations of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures on the website.\nLeerink Healthcare Conference Presentation\nCharles River will present at the LEERINK Partners 7 th Annual Global Healthcare Conference in New York, on Wednesday, February 14, at 1:00 p.m. ET. Management will provide an overview of Charles River’s strategic focus and business developments.\nA live webcast of the presentation will be available through a link that will be posted on ir.criver.com . A webcast replay will be accessible through the same website shortly after the presentation and will remain available for approximately two weeks.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations/Discontinued Operations\nThe Company reports non-GAAP results in this press release, which exclude often one-time charges and other items that are outside of normal operations. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the schedules at the end of this press release. In addition, the Company reports results from continuing operations, which exclude results of the Phase I clinical business that was divested in 2011. The Phase I business is reported as a discontinued operation.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets, and other charges related to our acquisitions, including the intended acquisition of MPI Research; bargain gains associated with our acquisitions; expenses associated with evaluating and integrating acquisitions and divestitures, as well as fair value adjustments associated with contingent consideration; charges, gains, and losses attributable to businesses or properties we plan to close, consolidate, or divest; severance and other costs associated with our efficiency initiatives; gain on and tax effect of the divestiture of the CDMO business; the write-off of a relocation subsidy liability in our China research models business; the write-off of deferred financing costs and fees related to debt financing; and costs related to a U.S. government billing adjustment and related expenses. This press release also refers to our revenue in both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis: “constant currency,” which we define as reported revenue growth adjusted the impact of foreign currency translation, and “organic revenue growth,” which we define as reported revenue growth adjusted for foreign currency translation, acquisitions, the divestiture, and the 53 rd week. We exclude these items from the non-GAAP financial measures because they are outside our normal operations. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures, as they are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In particular, we believe that the inclusion of supplementary non-GAAP financial measures in this press release helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects without the effect of these often one-time charges, and is consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company's performance, especially when comparing such results to prior periods or forecasts. We believe that the financial impact of our acquisitions and divestitures (and in certain cases, the evaluation of such acquisitions and divestitures, whether or not ultimately consummated) is often large relative to our overall financial performance, which can adversely affect the comparability of our results on a period-to-period basis. In addition, certain activities and their underlying associated costs, such as business acquisitions, generally occur periodically but on an unpredictable basis. We calculate non-GAAP integration costs to include third-party integration costs incurred post-acquisition. Presenting revenue on a constant-currency basis allows investors to measure our revenue growth exclusive of foreign currency exchange fluctuations more clearly. Non-GAAP results also allow investors to compare the Company’s operations against the financial results of other companies in the industry who similarly provide non-GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company intends to continue to assess the potential value of reporting non-GAAP results consistent with applicable rules and regulations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in this press release, and can also be found on the Company’s website at ir.criver.com .\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” “may,” “estimate,” “plan,” “outlook,” and “project,” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These statements also include statements regarding the projected future financial performance of Charles River and our specific businesses, including revenue (on both a reported, constant-currency, and organic growth basis), operating margins, earnings per share, the expected impact of foreign exchange rates, and the expected benefit of our life science venture capital investments; the future demand for drug discovery and development products and services, including our expectations for future revenue trends; our expectations with respect to the impact of acquisitions, including the intended acquisition of MPI Research, on the Company, our service offerings, client perception, strategic relationships, revenue, revenue growth rates, and earnings; our expectations regarding the timing of the close of the MPI acquisition, MPI’s final 2017 financial results, and our expected operational synergies; the development and performance of our services and products; market and industry conditions including the outsourcing of services and spending trends by our clients; the potential outcome of and impact to our business and financial operations due to litigation and legal proceedings; the impact of U.S. tax reform passed in the fourth quarter of 2017; and Charles River’s future performance as delineated in our forward-looking guidance, and particularly our expectations with respect to revenue, the impact of foreign exchange, and enhanced efficiency initiatives. Forward-looking statements are based on Charles River’s current expectations and beliefs, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by the forward-looking statements. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the ability to successfully integrate businesses we acquire; the ability to execute our efficiency initiatives on an effective and timely basis (including divestitures and site closures, such as our Maryland research model production site); the timing and magnitude of our share repurchases; negative trends in research and development spending, negative trends in the level of outsourced services, or other cost reduction actions by our clients; the ability to convert backlog to revenue; special interest groups; contaminations; industry trends; new displacement technologies; USDA and FDA regulations; changes in law; continued availability of products and supplies; loss of key personnel; interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (including the impact of Brexit); changes in tax regulation and laws, including recent U.S. tax reform; changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and any changes in business, political, or economic conditions due to the threat of future terrorist activity in the U.S. and other parts of the world, and related U.S. military action overseas. A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other matters can be found in the Risk Factors detailed in Charles River's Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed on February 14, 2017, as well as other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results and events may differ materially from results and events currently expected by Charles River, and Charles River assumes no obligation and expressly disclaims any duty to update information contained in this news release except as required by law.\nAbout Charles River\nCharles River provides essential products and services to help pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government agencies and leading academic institutions around the globe accelerate their research and drug development efforts.

(2) These adjustments are related to the evaluation and integration of acquisitions, which primarily include transaction, third-party integration, and certain compensation costs, and fair value adjustments associated with contingent consideration.

The supplementary non-GAAP financial measures included are not meant to be considered superior to, or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company intends to continue to assess the potential value of reporting non-GAAP results consistent with applicable rules, regulations and guidance. (2) The amount represents a $1.5 million charge recorded in connection with the modification of the option to purchase the remaining 13% equity interest in Vital River, partially offset by a $0.7 million gain on remeasurement of previously held equity interest in an entity acquired in a step acquisition. (3) These amounts represent the reversal of an uncertain tax position and an offsetting indemnification asset primarily related to the acquisition of BioFocus. (4) The amounts in the current year relate to an immaterial acquisition that represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired over the purchase price. (5) The amount represents the forgiveness of a liability related to the acquisition of Vital River. (6) The amounts for 4Q17 and FY 2017 include a $78.5 million estimate for the impact of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform legislation. The estimated impact of U.S. Tax Reform consists of the one-time transition tax on unrepatriated earnings (also known as the toll tax), withholding and state taxes related to the Company’s withdrawal of its indefinite reinvestment assertion regarding unremitted earnings, and the revaluation of U.S. federal net deferred tax liabilities. The final impact of U.S. Tax Reform may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis, and assumptions made by the Company, additional guidance that may be issued by regulatory agencies, and any updated or changes to estimates the Company utilized to calculate the transition impact.\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.
