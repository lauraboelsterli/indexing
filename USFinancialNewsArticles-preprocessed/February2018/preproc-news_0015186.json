    "text": "Gold prices fell for a third day on Thursday as a strengthening U.S. currency made dollar-denominated bullion more expensive for holders of other currencies.\nSpot gold was at one-month lows, down 0.17 percent at $1,315.31 an ounce at 10 a.m. EST. U.S. gold futures for April delivery were 0.24 percent higher at $1,317.80 an ounce.\nA global stock market selloff has driven investors to the relative safety of the dollar , lifting it from 3-year lows and pushing gold from an 18-month high reached in late January. \"The same thing that pushed gold up in January is pushing it down in February - the dollar,\" Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said.\nMomentum indicators suggested gold would fall to $1,300, said analysts at ScotiaMocatta, with technical support at $1,303, the 50-day moving average. Holdings of gold in exchange-traded funds tracked by Reuters have declined more than 1 percent this month and this week saw the biggest one-day fall since July, helping pull prices lower.\nshow chapters Dow has biggest reversal since August 2015 21 Hours Ago | 02:38 Also pressuring gold were comments by Federal Reserve officials that stock market turbulence was unlikely to derail interest rate rises this year. The Fed will stick to its plan for \"steady, gradual\" rate increases, said San Francisco Fed President John Williams.\nHigher rates are negative for gold because they push bond yields higher, reducing the attraction of non-yielding gold, and tend to boost the dollar. However, analysts polled by Reuters said they did not expect the dollar to rebound this year, despite expectations of at least three rate rises. They forecast the dollar index to end this year at 88.7, compared with around 90.5 on Thursday.\nIn other precious metals, silver was flat at $16.37 an ounce after touching $16.22, the lowest since Dec. 22.\nPlatinum traded at one-month lows, down 0.75 percent lower at $972.50 an ounce. Palladium was 0.73 percent lower at $977 an ounce after reaching its lowest since Nov. 15 at $976.97.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nHaving risen 56 percent last year to an all-time high in January, palladium, used in catalytic converters to control vehicle emissions, has fallen below technical support at its 55-day moving average and broken an 8-month uptrend, said analysts at Commerzbank.\n\"The market has topped as we suspected. We look for a slide to the $1,000 level and the $976 mid-November low and allow for losses to the $940.40 200-day moving average,\" they said. \"Palladium now appears to have run out of steam.\"",
