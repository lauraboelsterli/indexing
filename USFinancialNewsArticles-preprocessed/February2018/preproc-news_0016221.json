    "text": "TACOMA, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TrueBlue, Inc. (NYSE:TBI) announced today its fiscal fourth quarter 2017 results.\nRevenue was $670 million, a decrease of 9 percent, compared to revenue of $735 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the previously disclosed reduction in the scope of services provided to the company's former largest customer, revenue declined by 8 percent. Net income per diluted share was $0.40 compared to $0.43 in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income per diluted share 1 was $0.51 compared to $0.56 in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 included a 14 th week and two additional days from moving the week-ending date from Friday to Sunday. On a comparable basis, 2 revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter declined by 2 percent, or excluding the company's former largest customer, revenue declined by 1 percent.\n“We saw improving fundamentals this quarter driven by strong execution across the business,” TrueBlue CEO Steve Cooper said. “The broad-based improvements in the PeopleReady and PeopleManagement third quarter revenue trends continued throughout the fourth quarter, and PeopleScout delivered another quarter of double-digit growth.\n“We also made additional progress with our digital strategy. Adoption of JobStack TM , our PeopleReady mobile app, continued to climb, and we also launched Affinix TM in our PeopleScout business, a next generation technology that improves the candidate experience and streamlines the sourcing process.”\n2018 Outlook\nThe company estimates revenue for the fiscal first quarter of 2018 will range from $557 million to $572 million. It also expects net income per diluted share will range from $0.03 to $0.11. Adjusted net income per diluted share is expected to be $0.18 to $0.24.\nThe company estimates its historical effective income tax rate of 28 percent will drop to roughly 16 percent in fiscal 2018 and 2019 as a result of recent tax reform legislation. The lower rate could extend beyond 2019 if Congress extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). If the WOTC is not extended beyond 2019, the company estimates its effective income tax rate will return to roughly 28 percent.\nManagement will discuss fiscal fourth quarter 2017 results on a webcast at 2 p.m. PT (5 p.m. ET), today, Wednesday, Feb. 7. The webcast can be accessed on TrueBlue’s website: www.trueblue.com .\nAbout TrueBlue:\nTrueBlue (NYSE: TBI) is a leading provider of specialized workforce solutions that help clients create growth, improve efficiency and increase reliability.

SEGMENT DATA FOR FISCAL 2016 COMPARABLE 13- AND 52-WEEK PERIODS\n(Unaudited)\nAs previously reported, the company's 2016 fiscal fourth quarter includes a 14th week and two additional days from moving the week-ending date from Friday to Sunday. To facilitate comparison to the current year, the company is providing 13-week and 52-week comparable operating results.\n13-Week\nComparable\nPeriod (5)\n52-Week\nComparable\nPeriod (5)\n(in thousands) Revenue from services: PeopleReady $ 395,643 $ 1,593,710 PeopleManagement 240,989 923,594 PeopleScout 44,077 179,094 Total company 680,709 2,696,398 Adjusted Segment EBITDA (1): PeopleReady $ 23,636 $ 106,351 PeopleManagement 11,299 26,953 PeopleScout 6,621 34,317 Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA $ 41,556 $ 167,621 4. RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT EBITDA TO ADJUSTED SEGMENT EBITDA FOR FISCAL 2016 COMPARABLE 13- AND 52-WEEK PERIODS\n(Unaudited)\nQ4 2016 2016 13-Week 52-Week Comparable Period (5) Comparable Period (5) (in thousands) PeopleReady PeopleManagement PeopleScout PeopleReady PeopleManagement PeopleScout Segment EBITDA (1) $ 23,360 $ 9,162 $ 6,621 $ 98,558 $ (61,056 ) $ 19,148 Acquisition/integration and other costs (2) — 2,137 — 1,660 3,909 — Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge (3) — — — 4,275 84,100 15,169 Work Opportunity Tax Credit processing fees (4) 276 — — 1,858 — — Adjusted Segment EBITDA (1) $ 23,636 $ 11,299 $ 6,621 $ 106,351 $ 26,953 $ 34,317 (1) Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Segment EBITDA\") is a primary measure of segment performance. Segment EBITDA includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge directly attributable to the reportable segment together with certain allocated corporate general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA excludes unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses. Adjusted Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and further excludes acquisition/integration and other costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, and Work Opportunity Tax Credit third-party processing fees. Adjusted Segment EBITDA is a key measure used by management to assess performance and, in our opinion, enhances comparability and provides investors with useful insight into the underlying trends of the business. It is not meant to be considered in isolation, superior to, or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n(2) Other charges for the 13 weeks and 52 weeks ended Dec. 31, 2017, include a workforce reduction charge of $2.5 million primarily associated with employee reductions in the PeopleReady business, offset by $2.3 million of workers' compensation benefit. The workers' compensation benefit is associated with the favorable settlement of insurance coverage associated with a former insurance company and other items not considered part of our core operations. For the prior year periods, acquisition/integration costs related to the acquisition of the recruitment process outsourcing business of Aon Hewitt, which was completed on Jan. 4, 2016. In addition, other charges include costs associated with our exit from the Amazon delivery business of $1.8 million, and branch signage write-offs of $1.6 million due to our re-branding to PeopleReady in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. (3) The goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in the prior year included the write-off of the CLP and Spartan reporting unit trade names/trademarks of $4.3 million due to our re-branding to PeopleReady during the fiscal third quarter of 2016, and $99.3 million of impairment charges recorded in the fiscal second quarter of 2016 relating to our Staff Management | SMX, hrX and PlaneTechs reporting units. Note, our PeopleScout and hrX service lines were combined during fiscal 2016 and now represent a single operating unit (PeopleScout). (4) These third-party processing fees are associated with generating the Work Opportunity Tax Credits, which are designed to encourage employers to hire workers from certain targeted groups with higher than average unemployment rates and reduce our income taxes. (5) Our fiscal period ends on the Sunday closest to the last day of Dec. In fiscal years consisting of 53 weeks, the final quarter consists of 14 weeks, while in fiscal years consisting of 52 weeks, all quarters consist of 13 weeks. The 13-week comparable period represents the 13 weeks ended Jan. 1 2017. The 52-week comparable period represents the sum of the 13 weeks ended Jan. 1, 2017 and the 39 weeks ended Sept. 23, 2016.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207005977/en/\nTrueBlue, Inc.\nDerrek Gafford, 253-680-8214\nEVP & CFO\nSource: TrueBlue, Inc.",
