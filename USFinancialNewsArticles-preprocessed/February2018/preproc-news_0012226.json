    "text": "First 5 Commission Welcomes Return of Former Commissioner\nSACRAMENTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First 5 California, also known as the California Children and Families Commission, welcomes Molly Munger, Co-Founder and Co-Director of Advancement Project, as the newest member of the Commission. Ms. Munger was appointed to the Commission by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon. She previously served a term as First 5 Commissioner from 2007 to 2011.\nMs. Munger has been at the forefront of many social causes, including acting as representative for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund as Western Regional Counsel. Ms. Munger is a respected crusader for improving and expanding early childhood education in California.\n“Molly Munger and early childhood education are synonymous. Along with her co-founders at the Advancement Project, Ms. Munger has been a leader of modern early childhood education advocacy,” said Camille Maben, Executive Director of First 5 California. \"We are energized by this opportunity to work together to develop, strengthen, and build a better future for young children and their families,” added Ms. Maben.\n“I am excited to return to the First 5 California Commission. California can and must do more to support its youngest children and their families,” said Ms. Munger. “This opportunity allows me to advocate for the creation of additional opportunities that can result in beneficial outcomes that too many children and families still lack,\" added Ms. Munger.\nMs. Munger was appointed to fill the position previously occupied by Conway Collis.\nFirst 5 California was established in 1998 when voters passed Proposition 10, which taxes tobacco products to fund services for children ages 0 to 5 and their families. First 5 California programs and resources are designed to educate and support teachers, parents, and caregivers in the critical role they play during a child's first five years – to help California kids receive the best possible start in life and thrive.
