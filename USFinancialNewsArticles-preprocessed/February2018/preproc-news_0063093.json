    "text": "Investing to Create an Omni-Channel Business Services Platform as part of Multi-Year Strategic Transformation\nQ4 2017 Reported Sales of $2.6 Billion versus $2.7 Billion in Q4 2016\nQ4 2017 GAAP Operating Income of $59 Million versus $57 Million in Q4 2016\nCash Flow from Continuing Operations of $467 Million and Free Cash Flow of $326 Million in 2017\nCompuCom Once Again Named a Leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed Workplace Services, N.A.\nProvides Outlook for Fiscal 2018\nBOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Office Depot, Inc. (“Office Depot,” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ODP), a leading omni-channel provider of business services and supplies, products and technology solutions, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2017.\nConsolidated (in millions, except per share amounts) 4Q17 4Q16 FY17 FY16 Selected GAAP measures: Sales $2,581 $2,725 $10,240 $11,021 Sales decline from prior year period (5)% (7)% Operating income $59 $57 $341 $531 Operating income margin 2.3% 2.1% 3.3% 4.8% Net income (loss) from continuing operations $(48) $55 $146 $679 Earnings (loss) per share continuing operations $(0.09) $0.10 $0.27 $1.24 Selected Non-GAAP measures: (1) Adjusted sales decline from prior year period (2) (4)% (5)% Adjusted operating income (3) $95 $96 $446 $456 Adjusted operating income margin (3) 3.7% 3.7% 4.4% 4.2% Adjusted net income from continuing operations $45 $59 $241 $251 Adjusted net earnings per share continuing operations (most dilutive) $0.08 $0.11 $0.45 $0.46 Free Cash Flow from continuing operations (4) $10 $6 $326 $381 (1) Adjusted results represent non-GAAP measures and exclude charges or credits not indicative of core operations and the tax effect of these items, which may include but not be limited to merger integration, restructuring, acquisition costs, asset impairments and executive transition costs. Reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in this release as well as on the Investor Relations website at investor.officedepot.com .\n(2) Adjusted sales change excludes impact from U.S. retail store closures, foreign currency translation, the CompuCom acquisition and additional 53 rd week in fiscal 2016.\n(3) Fourth quarter and full year 2016 adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin amounts exclude the benefit of $143 million in sales and $15 million in operating income from the additional 53 rd week\n(4) As used throughout this release, Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations less capital expenditures\n“I’m pleased that we delivered strong fourth quarter results and achieved full year 2017 adjusted operating income that exceeded our most recent outlook, despite significant revenue pressure throughout the year,” said Gerry Smith, chief executive officer of Office Depot. “Fourth quarter sales trends in the Business Solutions Division continued to improve sequentially and we also saw relative improvement in store traffic recently as a result of strategic shifts in our offer and marketing mix. We are encouraged to see our initiatives to transform the Company beginning to gain traction, including our ability to generate Free Cash Flow to fund these future growth engines.”\nConsolidated Results\nReported (GAAP) Results\nTotal reported sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.6 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 5%. Sales for the full year 2017 were $10.2 billion, a decline of 7% compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter and full year 2016 results benefited from an additional 53 rd week sales of approximately $143 million and have been removed from our adjusted sales change below.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Office Depot reported operating income of $59 million. The Company recognized a net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $48 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, resulting from a net tax expense of approximately $68 million associated with changes to the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets and tax valuation allowance due to recent tax law reform. The impact of this change has been removed from our adjusted comparisons below.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reported operating income of $57 million, which included the benefit of approximately $15 million from the additional 53 rd week. Net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $55 million, or $0.10 per diluted share.\nFor the full year 2017 period, Office Depot reported operating income of $341 million compared to an operating income of $531 million in the prior year period. Net income from continuing operations in 2017 was $146 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $679 million, or $1.24 per diluted share in 2016. Full year 2016 results benefited from $250 million of operating income related to the Staples termination fee received in the second quarter of 2016 and from a net tax credit of approximately $240 million associated with the reduction of the U.S. tax valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2016, in addition to the 53 rd week benefit stated above.\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Results (2)\nExcluding the impact of retail store closures, foreign currency translation, the CompuCom acquisition and the additional 53 rd week in fiscal 2016, the year-over-year adjusted sales change for the fourth quarter of 2017, would have been a decline of 4%. The full year 2017 decline excluding these items would have been 5%.\nAdjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2017 exclude charges and credits totaling $36 million, which were comprised of $16 million in acquisition-related expenses, $11 million in restructuring charges, $6 million in OfficeMax merger-related expenses and $3 million in non-cash asset impairment charges, as well as the after-tax impact of these items. Accordingly,\nFourth quarter 2017 adjusted operating income was $95 million compared to an adjusted operating income of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding the 53 rd week benefit in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income from continuing operations was $45 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $59 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 adjusted operating income was $446 million compared to an adjusted operating income of $456 million in 2016, excluding the 53 rd week benefit. Full year 2017 adjusted net income from continuing operations was $241 million compared to $251 million in the full year 2016, with adjusted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.45 in 2017 compared to $0.46 in 2016.\nFourth Quarter Division Results\nRetail Division\nRetail Division reported sales were $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 comparable sales declined 4% versus the prior year primarily driven by fewer transactions and lower average order values.\nRetail Division (in millions) 4Q17 4Q16 Adjusted\n4Q16 (5)\nFY17 FY16 Adjusted\nFY16 (5)\nSales $1,164 $1,366 $1,279 $4,962 $5,603 $5,516 Comparable store sales change from prior year (4)% (5)% Division operating income $40 $62 $48 $254 $299 $285 Division operating income margin 3.4% 4.5% 3.8% 5.1% 5.3% 5.2% (5) Fourth quarter and full year 2016 adjusted amounts exclude the benefit of $87 million in sales and $14 million in operating income from the additional 53 rd week.\nRetail Division operating income was $40 million, or 3.4% of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $48 million, or 3.8% of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding the 53 rd week operating income benefit in 2016. Operating income declined $8 million versus the prior year primarily due to the negative flow-through impact from lower sales and a lower gross margin rate, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses realized from the Company’s store closure program and cost reduction initiatives.\nDuring the fourth quarter the Company closed 26 stores, ending the year with a total of 1,378 stores in the Retail Division.\nBusiness Solutions Division\nBusiness Solutions Division reported sales were $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decline of 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding sales from the additional selling week in the fourth quarter of 2016, sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined 3% in constant currency versus the prior year, a quarterly sequential improvement of approximately 150 basis points. The sales decline versus 2016 was primarily driven by lower average sales volume, a shift in the holiday calendar and the impact of sales from omni-channel programs that are recorded in the Retail Division.\nBusiness Solutions Division (in millions) 4Q17 4Q16 Adjusted\n4Q16 (6)\nFY17 FY16 Adjusted\nFY16 (6)\nSales $1,257 $1,355 $1,298 $5,108 $5,400 $5,344 Sales change from adjusted prior year (in constant currency) (3)% (4)% Division operating income $68 $75 $71 $262 $265 $261 Division operating income margin 5.4% 5.5% 5.5% 5.1% 4.9% 4.9% (6) Fourth quarter and full year 2016 adjusted amounts exclude the benefit of $56 million in sales and $4 million in operating income from the additional 53 rd week.\nBusiness Solutions Division operating income was $68 million, or 5.4% of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $71 million, or 5.5% of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2016 excluding the 53 rd week operating income benefit in 2016. The slight decline in operating income of $3 million versus the prior year was primarily due to the flow-through impact from lower sales and a lower gross margin rate, partially offset by cost savings and efficiencies including lower selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCompuCom Division\nAs previously announced, the Company completed the acquisition of CompuCom Systems, Inc. during the fourth quarter of 2017. Results for this business are now reported separately and included within the total Company results for the period beginning November 8, 2017.\nCompuCom Division reported sales were $156 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, with reported operating income of $8 million, or 4.8% of sales.\nCompuCom was once again named as a Leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed Workplace Services, North America. This is the 15 th consecutive year that CompuCom has received formal industry recognition. The Gartner Magic Quadrant is a graphical portrayal of exceptional vendor performance and demonstrates CompuCom’s strong ability to deliver remote and on-site managed workplace services to mid-size and large enterprise clients.\nSale of International Businesses\nOffice Depot successfully closed on the sale of its business in Australia on February 5, 2018. The Company’s sale of the remaining discontinued operation in New Zealand remains subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate includes support staff services and certain other expenses that are not allocated to the Company’s operating divisions. Unallocated expenses decreased to $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to cost savings and the 53 rd week impact of approximately $3 million in the prior year.\nThe Company’s retained sourcing and trading operations in Asia, reported as an “Other” segment, contributed $4 million in sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 and an operating loss of $1 million.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAs of December 30, 2017, Office Depot had total available liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion consisting of $0.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $0.9 billion available under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Total debt was $1.0 billion, excluding $776 million of non-recourse debt related to the credit-enhanced timber installment notes.\nFor the full year 2017, cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $467 million. This is an increase over the prior year, excluding the Staples termination fee and associated costs in 2016, primarily due to a greater focus on working capital improvements, including targeted inventory reductions. The 2017 amount includes the impact of $53 million in restructuring costs, $53 million in OfficeMax merger–related costs and $15 million in acquisition costs. Capital expenditures were $141 million in 2017, $19 million of which were related to the OfficeMax merger integration. Accordingly, Free Cash Flow of continuing operations was $326 million in 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share on December 15, 2017 for approximately $14 million. For the full year 2017, the Company paid approximately $53 million in dividends to shareholders. In addition, Office Depot repurchased approximately 6 million shares at a total cost of approximately $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nStrategy and Outlook (7)\n“I’m very excited by the positive response we have received from our customers and key business partners since announcing our new strategic direction to transform and strengthen Office Depot,” said Gerry Smith. “This was never more evident than in our BizBox flagship store grand opening in Austin, Texas at the end of January. The BizBox services platform provides small and medium-sized businesses with the core services needed to start and grow their businesses. By delivering an increasing number of service offerings, we create broader and longer-lasting relationships with our customers. We are accelerating a number of initiatives to drive this transformation including expanding the CompuCom technology services footprint, rolling out the BizBox services platform and accelerating the offering of new subscription-based services.”\nAccordingly, Office Depot expects sales from the new growth initiatives, including recent acquisitions, to help mitigate but not completely offset negative impacts to 2018 from:\nLower store volume Prior year store closures Adoption of new revenue recognition standards estimated to reduce reported sales by approximately $60 million\nAt the end of 2017, the Company substantially completed the integration with OfficeMax which provided significant synergy benefits since the integration first began in 2014. In addition, since retaining the retail footprint is a critical part of the Company’s omni-channel strategy going forward, Office Depot has decided to significantly slow the pace of future store closures. As a result, the Company believes it is now significantly complete with the prior cost savings programs and does not expect material additional benefits from these programs to be realized in 2018.\nAccordingly, adjusted operating income in 2018 is expected to be affected by the flow-through impact of lower sales volume, as well as additional factors including:\nApproximately $40 million of incremental growth investments as the Company accelerates the transition towards a services-driven model Normalized compensation-related expense over the prior year of approximately $30 million resulting from lower than expected payouts in 2017 Adoption of new pension and defined benefit plan expense reporting requirements with a year-over-year impact of approximately $13 million Partially offset by a full-year of incremental benefits from acquisitions and realization of approximately $20 million in expected synergies from the CompuCom acquisition\nDespite these impacts, the Company expects to deliver strong free cash flow performance in 2018 through a continued focus on driving working capital efficiencies, building upon the improvements initiated in 2017. Also, the Company’s cash tax rate is anticipated to remain low as tax operating loss carry forwards and credits continue to be utilized.\nTaking these items into consideration, the Company provides the following outlook for fiscal 2018:\nProjected Outlook (7) FY 2018 Combined Company full-year sales ~ $10.6 billion Adjusted operating income ~ $350 million Adjusted diluted earnings per share ~ $0.30 Free Cash Flow ~ $325 million Other underlying assumptions include:\nNet interest expense ~ $100 million Non-GAAP effective tax rate ~ 31% Full-year weighted-average diluted share count ~ 570 million Depreciation and amortization expense ~ $175 million Capital expenditures ~ $175 million Cash tax rate < 10% “We remain intensely focused on profitably growing Office Depot with a deliberate shift to a more services oriented revenue base while continuing to generate strong free cash flow,” said Gerry Smith. “We recognize that 2018 is a year of transition and that investments are required to advance our Company’s multi-year transformation. However, as we look to 2019 and beyond, I expect that 2018 will be our pivot year as the actions we have already taken, coupled with the additional initiatives and investments we have planned this year, should allow us to grow year-over-year profitability in 2019. I am confident that we have a compelling and differentiated strategy to create a unique omni-channel business services platform that will generate long-term sustainable growth and greater value to our customers, partners and shareholders.”\nThe Company expects to provide additional details on the long-term strategic direction and operating priorities, at an Investor Day expected to be held on or about May 16, 2018 in New York City. Further details on this event will be forthcoming.\n(7) The Company’s outlook for 2018 included in this release is for continuing operations only and includes non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes charges or credits not indicative of core operations, which may include but not be limited to merger integration expenses, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, executive transition costs, asset impairments and other significant items that currently cannot be predicted. The exact amount of these charges or credits are not currently determinable, but may be significant. Accordingly, the Company is unable to provide equivalent reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP for these financial measures.\nAbout Office Depot, Inc.\nOffice Depot, Inc.

The Company also reviews certain financial measures excluding impacts of transactions that are not related to core operations (“non-GAAP”). Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the ability of investors to analyze trends in the business and provides a means to compare periods that may be affected by various items that might obscure trends or developments in the business. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to assist in making business decisions and assessing overall performance. Non-GAAP measures help to evaluate programs and activities that are intended to attract and satisfy customers, separate from expenses and credits directly associated with Merger, restructuring, and certain similar items. Certain non-GAAP measures are also used for short and long-term incentive programs.\nThe Company’s measurement of these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly titled financial measures used by others and therefore may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to the GAAP measures, but only to clarify some information and assist the reader. Reconciliations of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures have been included in the tables within this material.\nThe Company’s outlook for 2018 is for continuing operations only and includes non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes charges or credits not indicative of core operations, which may include but not be limited to merger integration expenses, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, executive transition costs, asset impairments and other significant items that currently cannot be predicted. The exact amount of these charges or credits are not currently determinable, but may be significant. Accordingly, the Company is unable to provide equivalent reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP for these financial measures.\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nQ4 2017\nReported\n(GAAP)\n% of\nSales\nLess:\nCharges &\nCredits\nAdjusted\n(Non-GAAP)\n% of\nSales\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 513 19.9 % $ 1 $ 512 19.8 % Assets impairments $ 3 0.1 % $ 3 $ — — % Merger and restructuring expenses, net\n$ 32 1.2 % $ 32 $ — — % Operating income (loss) $ 59 2.3 % $ (36 ) $ 95 3.7 % Income tax expense $ 89 3.4 % $ 56 $ 33 1.3 % Net income (loss) from continuing operations $ (48 ) (1.9 ) % $ (92 ) $ 45 1.7 % Earnings (loss) per share continuing operations (most dilutive) $ (0.09 ) $ (0.17 ) $ 0.08 Q4 2016 Reported\n(GAAP)\n% of\nSales\nLess:\nCharges &\nCredits\nAdjusted\n(Non-GAAP)\n% of\nSales\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 547 20.1 % $ 6 $ 541 19.9 % Assets impairments $ 6 0.2 % $ 6 $ — — % Merger and restructuring expenses, net\n$ 43 1.6 % $ 43 $ — — % Operating income (loss) $ 57 2.1 % $ (55 ) $ 111 4.1 % Income tax expense (benefit) $ (9 ) (0.3 ) % $ (50 ) $ 41 1.5 % Net income (loss) from continuing operations $ 55 2.0 % $ (5 ) $ 59 2.2 % Earnings (loss) per share continuing operations (most dilutive) $ 0.10 $ (0.01 ) $ 0.11 OFFICE DEPOT, INC.\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations\n(Unaudited) (continued)\n2017\nReported\n(GAAP)\n% of\nSales\nLess:\nCharges &\nCredits\nAdjusted\n(Non-GAAP)\n% of\nSales\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 2,022 19.7 % $ 8 $ 2,014 19.7 % Assets impairments $ 4 0.0 % $ 4 $ — — % Merger and restructuring expenses, net\n$ 94 0.9 % $ 94 $ — — % Operating income (loss) $ 341 3.3 % $ (106 ) $ 446 4.4 % Income tax expense (benefit) $ 153 1.5 % $ (10 ) $ 163 1.6 % Net income (loss) from continuing operations $ 146 1.4 % $ (96 ) $ 241 2.4 % Earnings (loss) per share continuing operations (most dilutive) $ 0.27 $ (0.18 ) $ 0.45 2016 Reported\n(GAAP)\n% of\nSales\nLess:\nCharges &\nCredits\nAdjusted\n(Non-GAAP)\n% of\nSales\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 2,242 20.3 % $ 6 $ 2,236 20.3 % Assets impairments $ 15 0.1 % $ 15 $ — — % Merger and restructuring expenses (income), net\n$ (80 ) (0.7 ) % $ (80 ) $ — — % Operating income $ 531 4.8 % $ 59 $ 471 4.3 % Income tax expense (benefit) $ (220 ) (2.0 ) % $ (383 ) $ 163 1.5 % Net income from continuing operations $ 679 6.2 % $ 427 $ 251 2.3 % Earnings per share continuing operations (most dilutive) $ 1.24 $ 0.78 $ 0.46 Amounts may not foot due to rounding\nNote: The Company has released a majority of the deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the U.S. for GAAP purposes.
