    "text": "SEATTLE, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced fourth quarter 2017 financial results including the following highlights compared to the same quarter of 2016:\nDiluted Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders per share (EPS 1 ) increased 51% to $0.92 (includes a net income tax benefit from U.S. tax reform of $0.21) Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders increased 51% to $167 million (includes a net income tax benefit from U.S. tax reform of $39 million) Operating Income increased 16% to $199 million Revenues increased 16% to $1.90 billion Net Revenues 2 increased 15% to $629 million Airfreight tonnage volumes increased 6% and ocean container volumes increased 1%\n“We executed well across all of our businesses in the fourth quarter, with improved performance throughout the second half of 2017,” said Jeffrey S. Musser, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The global freight industry is stronger than it was a year ago, particularly in certain key lanes and especially for shipments by air. In response to that continued robust demand, and combined with tight capacity and unpredictable rates, we continued to grow profitably by delivering outstanding services and solutions to our customers.\n“I credit our strong results to the hard work and discipline of everyone throughout our talented organization, as we continue to move higher volumes in all services with greater efficiency per-shipment. The vast majority of our dedicated employees work in the field at one of our many District operations, where they are close to our customers and greatly attuned to their individual supply chain needs. Because each District is responsible for its own P&L, we are all highly motivated to drive efficiency and growth in support of profitable business.”\nBradley S. Powell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, “We continued to improve operational performance on many levels, pushing operating efficiency (operating income as a percentage of net revenue) to nearly 32% in Q4 and above 30% for the full year. We are managing our pricing well in a volatile rate environment, and we are controlling expenses by making the best of our investments in people, processes, and core technologies. We will continue to invest in people and systems to support profitable growth, while working to further hone our performance at the District level to move more freight and to move it more efficiently.”\nMr. Powell also noted, “We were positively impacted by the implementation of U.S. tax law changes in Q4, which resulted in recognizing a $39 million net income tax benefit. The impact on our effective tax rate in future periods will largely depend on the mix of pretax earnings that we generate in our U.S. and foreign operations, as well as further interpretation of and guidance to be issued on the new tax law. At this time, we expect our effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 31% and 34% of pretax earnings.”\nExpeditors is a global logistics company headquartered in Seattle, Washington.

Net revenues are a Non-GAAP measure calculated as revenues less directly related operating expenses attributable to the Company's principal services. We believe that net revenues are a better measure than are total revenues when analyzing and discussing our effectiveness in managing our principal services since total revenues earned as a freight consolidator include the carriers' charges to us for carrying the shipment, whereas revenues earned in other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees earned by us. Net revenue is one of our primary operational and financial measures and demonstrates our ability to concentrate and leverage purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings. Using net revenues also provides a commonality for comparison among various services. The following table presents the calculation of net revenues.\nThree months ended Twelve months ended December 31, December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total revenues $ 1,901,371 $ 1,642,007 $ 6,920,948 $ 6,098,037 Expenses: Airfreight services 636,344 515,612 2,126,761 1,752,167 Ocean freight and ocean services 380,689 371,989 1,543,740 1,378,699 Customs brokerage and other services 255,529 205,815 931,258 803,135 Net revenues $ 628,809 $ 548,591 $ 2,319,189 $ 2,164,036 CONTACTS :\nJeffrey S.
