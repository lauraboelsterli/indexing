GLOBAL TOP NEWS • U.S. gun lobby slams anti-gun 'elites' after Florida school massacre The head of the US National Rifle Association lashed out at gun control advocates on Thursday, saying Democratic elites are politicizing the latest mass school shooting in the United States to try to erode constitutionally guaranteed gun rights. • Japan's inflation steady in Jan, keeps BOJ exit from stimulus distant Japan's core consumer inflation was steady in January from a year earlier in a sign a strengthening economy has yet to prompt companies to raise prices, a challenge policy makers have yet to overcome despite years of massive stimulus. • HP Inc results beat estimates, raises 2018 profit forecast HP reported first-quarter revenue and profit on Thursday above Wall Street estimates as it sold more personal computers and printers, helping the company raise its full-year profit forecast. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,400.50, up 0.19 pct from its previous close. • The Indian rupee will likely open steady to higher against the dollar, after the greenback’s recent rally fizzled out amid a slight pullback in the U.S. treasury yields overnight. • Indian government bonds are likely to trade lower in early session as higher U.S. yields weigh on demand amid lack of fresh domestic triggers. GLOBAL MARKETS • The Dow and S&P 500 advanced on Thursday to halt a two-session losing skid, buoyed by gains in industrial and energy shares as U.S. Treasury yields eased, while the Nasdaq lost ground for a third straight session. • Asian shares rebounded as comments from a Federal Reserve official eased worries that the central bank might raise rates more aggressively this year, while the safe-haven yen held on to its gains amid heightened volatility across markets. • The dollar sagged broadly after its recovery this week faded as U.S. Treasury yields declined from their recent peaks. • Oil prices edged up, supported by lower U.S. crude inventories, but gains were capped by a surge in U.S. exports that dragged net imports in the world's biggest fuel consumer to a record low. • Gold prices slipped on a stronger dollar and the yellow metal was on track for its sharpest weekly drop in 2-1/2 months.
