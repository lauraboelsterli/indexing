    "text": " 13 AM / Updated 15 minutes ago Air France-KLM, Delta study ways of keeping Alitalia in Skyteam Reuters Staff 1 Min Read PARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) is studying with its U.S. partner Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) ways of keeping Alitalia inside the Skyteam alliance - but without Air France-KLM being a buyer, Chief Executive Jean-Marc Janaillac said on Friday. However, the Franco-Dutch airline group is not directly involved in the sale process and has not had access to Alitalia data, he told a news conference. British low-cost airline easyJet ( EZJ.L ) said last month that it was interested in parts of Alitalia, and that discussions were ongoing. Reporting by Tim HepherEditing by Sudip Kar-Gupta",
