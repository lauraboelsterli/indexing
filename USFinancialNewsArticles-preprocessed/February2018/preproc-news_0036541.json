The index is still 5.5 percent off its record high hit on Jan. 26.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was up 0.88 percent at 7,206.41.\nEarlier in the session, the market turned negative briefly as the energy sector took a beating from a slide in oil prices.\n“We’re stabilized for the moment. The real question was how the market reacted to the CPI and PPI numbers and it seems to have taken higher inflation in stride,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts.\nInvestors also appeared not to be as nervous from a week ago even as U.S. 10-year treasury yields hit a more than four-year peak of 2.944 percent.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose to 19.57 points, but was well below the 50 point-mark it touched last week.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,651 to 1,162. On the Nasdaq, 1,730 issues rose and 1,121 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty; Editing by Savio D‘Souza)\n ",
