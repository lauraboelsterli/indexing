    "text": "19 COMMENTS Comcast Corp. CMCSA -5.80% is planning a takeover bid for European pay-TV giant Sky SKYAY 20.44% PLC, putting the cable giant on a collision course with rivals 21st Century Fox FOX -2.94% and Walt Disney Co. DIS -4.06% \nEarly Tuesday Comcast said it was planning a £22.1 billion ($30.9 billion) offer for Sky, topping a rival bid from Fox to consolidate ownership of the U.K. broadcaster—and moving to peel away one of the most attractive overseas assets that Disney has separately agreed to buy from Fox. \nComcast is offering £12.50 a share for all of Sky, significantly higher than the £10.75-a-share offer from Fox for the 61% of Sky it doesn’t already own. \nSky’s shares soared more than 20% to £13.47—well above the Comcast offer—with investors gearing up for a potential bidding war. Sky’s stock had already been trading above Fox’s offer price amid expectation Fox would need to raise its bid.\nWho Gets Sky? Comcast, Disney and 21st Century Fox are all jostling for U.K. broadcaster Sky. Dec. 9, 2016\nFox makes bid for 61% of Sky it doesn't already own\nOffers\nto buy\nOwns\nDec. 14, 2017\nWalt Disney Co. agrees to buy 21st Century Fox assets, including 39% Sky stake\n61%\n39%\nJan. 23, 2018\nBritish regulators say Fox ownership of all of Sky isn't in public interest, but leave door open for remedial moves\nFeb. 27., 2018\nComcast offers to buy all of Sky\nWhat's next?\n1\nFox could make a new bid\nFox could accept Comcast bid for its Sky stake, but needs Disney approval\nFox could hold onto its stake, partnering with Comcast in Sky until Disney buys Sky\n2\n3\nSource: staff reports\nLate last year, Disney agreed to buy a big chunk of assets from Fox, including its stake in Sky, for more than $52 billion. Sky was seen as a particularly attractive asset in the package—a way Disney could grow its overseas footprint.\nThat’s the same rationale Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said is driving his interest. In an early Tuesday conference call, he said he values Sky’s unusual position as both a telecom operator—selling TV, internet and wireless plans across Europe—and a media company that broadcasts its own channels and produces original sports, entertainment and news programming. Sky has about 23 million customers in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.\nIn a recent sports-rights auction, Sky retained a set of prized English Premier League soccer games , paying less many thought. Mr. Roberts said the auction factored into Comcast’s decision to go after Sky.\nSo did a trip to London late last year, he said, when he discussed Sky with a taxi driver . The driver gave him the pros and cons of Sky, and one of its biggest competitors, Virgin Media, which is owned by John Malone’s Liberty Global PLC.\nThen he said he talked to a Sky salesperson at a Westfield mall in London, and came away impressed with Sky’s offerings.\n“The trip was not the deciding factor, but it was another reminder for me how impressive Sky is and how lucky we would be at Comcast to combine together,” Mr. Roberts said.\nRelated \nHedge Funds Win Big From Comcast’s Move for Sky Comcast’s Offer for Sky: What It Means for Fox and Disney After a London Cab Ride, Comcast’s Roberts Set His Sights on Sky The Comcast bid is the latest move in complicated, four-way deal talks that have been under way for more than a year between, first, Fox and Sky, then Fox and Disney and, separately, Fox and Comcast. Over the course of those negotiations, Rupert Murdoch has pivoted from buyer —aggressively moving to consolidate its ownership of Sky after failing to do so several years earlier—to a seller of assets.\nThe Comcast move for Sky also represents one of the more dramatic moves in a yearslong consolidation and conversion drive convulsing the telecom and media sectors. The companies that own TV and internet pipes also want to own the content that flows through them. Most prominent among those efforts is AT&T Inc.’s proposal to buy Time Warner Inc. for about $85 billion. The Justice Department is suing the companies to block the deal, saying it would hurt pay-TV competition.\nMr. Roberts said Tuesday that Comcast preferred to buy 100% of Sky, including Fox’s current 39% stake. He said Comcast would also settle for a majority stake, and would be prepared to be co-owners with either Fox or Disney.\nSky said in a statement that its independent directors were “mindful of their fiduciary duties” and obligations under U.K. takeover rules, adding a further announcement would be made as and when appropriate. Representatives of Fox and Disney couldn’t immediately be reached for comment early Tuesday.\nThe separate Fox-Sky deal has been subject to a gantlet of regulatory reviews in Britain . Regulators have raised concerns that full Fox ownership of Sky, which operates a British news operation, would give Mr. Murdoch’s media holdings too much sway in the country.\nMr. Murdoch and his family are significant shareholders in both Fox and News Corp , which owns three major British newspapers. News Corp also owns The Wall Street Journal. Fox has said there are sufficient news outlets in the country—including new, online ones—and that media control wouldn’t be concentrated with the deal.\nAfter British authorities appeared to lay out an opening for approval earlier this year, Sky shares have strengthened on expectation the Fox-Sky deal would get done. Big investors, including U.S. hedge-fund manager Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp., have poured money into Sky shares, betting the rising share price could trigger a higher bid.\nBehind the Murdochs’ Sale Plan: Scale, Price and Family Dynamics For more than six decades, media titan Rupert Murdoch mostly was a buyer, rather than a seller. Not anymore. Read More. (Dec. 6, 2017)\nComcast’s Mr. Roberts earlier walked away from deal talks with Mr. Murdoch over buying Fox. However, Comcast executives have recently started to reconsider a bid for Fox , or parts of it, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Roberts said on the conference call Tuesday he hadn’t spoken with the Murdoch family since they broke off talks two months ago.\nThe offer puts the ball in the courts of Fox and Disney. If Fox was to raise its bid—a move that shareholders would expect given Sky’s soaring share price—it would likely need to discuss the structure of any new bid with Disney.\nWhat Disney Wants The Disney-Fox deal, by assets and revenue. $55.1B\nDisney\n$19B\nCurrent revenue\nRevenue from Fox\nassets being\nacquired\nFox\nWhat Disney is buying\nrevenue\nFilm and TV studio \nStar and Sky\nRegional sports networks \nHulu stake\nCable networks FX and\nNational Geographic\n$19B\n$10B\nWhat Fox is keeping\nFox News \nFox broadcast\nFS1 sports channel\nLocal TV stations \nBig Ten Network\n$19B\n$55.1B\nDisney\nCurrent revenue\nRevenue from Fox\nassets being\nacquired\nFox\nWhat Disney is buying\nrevenue\nFilm and TV studio \nStar and Sky\nRegional sports networks \nHulu stake\nCable networks FX and\nNational Geographic\n$19B\n$10B\nWhat Fox is keeping\nFox News \nFox broadcast\nFS1 sports channel\nLocal TV stations \nBig Ten Network\n$19B\n$55.1B\nDisney\nCurrent revenue\nRevenue from Fox\nassets being\nacquired\nFox\nWhat Disney is buying\nrevenue\nFilm and TV studio \nStar and Sky\nRegional sports networks \nHulu stake\nCable networks FX and\nNational Geographic\n$19B\n$10B\nWhat Fox is keeping\nFox News \nFox broadcast\nFS1 sports channel\nLocal TV stations \nBig Ten Network\n$19B\n$55.1B\nDisney\nRevenue \nfrom Fox\nassets being\nacquired\nCurrent revenue\nFox\nWhat Disney is \nbuying\nrevenue\nFilm and TV studio \nStar and Sky\nRegional sports networks \nHulu stake\nCable networks FX and\nNational Geographic\n$19B\n$10\nWhat Fox is \nkeeping\nFox News \nFox broadcast\nFS1 sports channel\nLocal TV stations \nBig Ten Network\nNote: Revenue from latest full fiscal year\nSources: the companies\nFox, meanwhile, is in a difficult position somewhere in the middle. Its 39% interest in Sky makes it a big potential beneficiary of the significantly sweetened bid. But accepting the Comcast offer changes the major contours of the Disney-Fox deal. The fine print of the Disney deal stipulates that Disney must approve of any sale of Sky shares. It’s unclear whether Disney would want to end up partners with Comcast. Mr. Murdoch’s son, James, is Sky’s chairman.\nFox would be required to pay Disney a $1.53 billion breakup fee if Fox’s board changed its recommendation for the Disney deal. Similarly, Disney would have to pay Fox the same breakup fee if a change in Disney’s board recommendation for the merger caused Fox to end the pact.\nAnother option for Fox: Hold on to its 39% stake, making it a partner with Comcast in Sky, at least until Disney completes its Fox takeover.\nThe cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix.
