    "text": " 18 AM / Updated 15 minutes ago U.N. envoy sees difficult talks on Syria ceasefire deal   GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Thursday he hoped the U.N. Security Council would agree a resolution to end fighting in the besieged Syrian enclave of eastern Ghouta, but said it would not be easy. “I hope it will. But it’s uphill. But I hope it will. It is very urgent,” he told Reuters as he arrived at the United Nations in Geneva. Asked what would happen if there were no deal, he said: “Then we will have to push for it to take place as soon as possible because there is no alternative but a ceasefire and humanitarian access.” Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Gareth Jones",
