    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO and NEW YORK, Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- White Oak Global Advisors, LLC on behalf of its institutional clients (collectively “White Oak” or the Company), announced today that White Oak has acquired Federal National Commercial Credit, Inc. (“FNCC”), a specialized commercial finance company providing government receivable financing, commercial factoring and asset based loans to small and middle-market companies. Established in 1992, FNCC is an industry leader in providing financing solutions for companies that are doing work for the federal government. The acquisition expands White Oak’s asset-based lending product offerings and capabilities to serve new government and factoring clients.\nFNCC’s senior leadership team consisting of Kwesi Rogers, CEO, and Kysha Pierre-Louis, Chief Credit Officer, will continue to lead the business from Bethesda, MD. Post-close the business will be named White Oak Business Capital, Inc. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n“White Oak is focused on growing its asset-based lending platform to serve the tens of thousands of companies that require debt financing in the U.S and globally that are currently underserved by traditional capital sources.
