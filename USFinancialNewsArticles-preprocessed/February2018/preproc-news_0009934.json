    "text": "New team will drive greater digital fundraising and channel integration\nCONCORD, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- This week, Concord Direct, a New Hampshire-based direct response company, announced the acquisition of Strength in Members (SiM), a Boulder, Colorado-based digital marketing agency. The two companies have worked collaboratively for the past two years, helping organizations launch and improve their digital lead acquisition, strategy, program development, email creative and production, and search and social advertising.\n“As digital increasingly becomes part of the marketing channel mix for our clients, it has become increasingly important to seamlessly integrate digital into the overall strategy rather than maintain it within a silo,” said Tom Cook, President of Concord Direct. “Knowing this, it made sense for Concord Direct and SiM to formally combine to further integrate the direct mail and digital solutions we develop to help our clients achieve their goals. We are excited and fortunate to have a team of the caliber of Peter Genuardi and his people join our company.”\nGenuardi, CEO of SiM, founded the company in 2012 and has since worked with leading nonprofit brands such as Catholic Relief Services, Human Rights Campaign, Sierra Club, Morris Animal Foundation, and KaBOOM! Genuardi will now lead Concord Direct’s digital team as Executive Director of Digital Services.\nSaid Genuardi, “I’m thrilled to bring our team into the Concord Direct family. We have worked with Concord Direct to deliver cutting-edge digital fundraising programs, websites, and cause-focused applications. Now we can continue to expand our offerings with innovative, integrated multichannel marketing products and services that very few agencies are even thinking about.”\nConcord Direct will continue to serve clients out of its offices in Concord, N.H., Baltimore, Md., and now Boulder, Colo.\nAbout Concord Direct\nFounded in 1958, Concord Direct, formerly known as Concord Litho, is an innovative, performance-driven direct response marketing company. Nonprofit organizations and commercial clients have partnered with Concord Direct to maximize the performance of their direct marketing programs and generate hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and revenue. Through their dynamic and flexible approach to direct marketing, they bring a compelling way of working to drive improved results. Bringing solutions focused both online and offline, Concord Direct has manufacturing facilities located at its headquarters in Concord, N.H. and has offices in Baltimore, Md. and Boulder, Colo.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180206006075/en/\nConcord Direct\nSteve Rudman, 603-410-1430\nwww.concorddirect.com\nSource: Concord Direct",
