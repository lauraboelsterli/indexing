    "text": "Greno Will Create and Direct the Original Feature “Powerless”\nSANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Skydance Media, a diversified media company that creates elevated, event-level entertainment for global audiences, announced today that Nathan Greno will join the Company’s rapidly expanding animation studio where he will direct the upcoming animated feature film, Powerless (working title). Under the multi-year deal, Greno, an animation veteran best known for his work on Tangled, will also consult on projects currently in development. Skydance plans to release the film under its newly-formed animation label.\nThis press release features multimedia.

In addition to creating his own project for Skydance, Nathan will lend his expertise providing guidance on projects in our development pipeline.”\n“I’m ecstatic to be joining the burgeoning team of Skydance Media’s animation studio,” added Greno. “From my first meeting with David, Dana, and Bill, I knew Skydance was the creative home I’d been searching for. I feel very much in step with David’s vision of what an animation studio should be.”\nGreno directed Disney’s 2010 animated hit Tangled, which grossed over $590 million worldwide. He has spent the past two decades working at Disney, including serving as creative advisor on Best Animated Feature Oscar winner Big Hero 6. Additional Disney credits include Frozen and Bolt. Greno also directed the shorts Super Rhino and Tangled Ever After. Greno is repped by Verve and attorney Rob Szymanski.\nIn 2017, Skydance formed an animation division to develop and produce a slate of high-end feature films and television series in partnership with Spain’s Ilion Animation Studios. Skydance’s first two animated features are Luck, which comes to theaters on March 19, 2021, and Split. Luck, directed by Alessandro Carloni and written by Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger, is a comedy that pulls back the curtain on the millennia-old battle between the organizations of good luck and bad luck that secretly affect our daily lives. Split, directed by Vicky Jenson and written by Linda Woolverton, tells the story of Elian, a teenager who comes of age using her magical powers to defend her family when the opposing forces of light and darkness threaten to divide her kingdom.\nAbout Skydance Media\nSkydance is a diversified media company founded by David Ellison in 2010 to create high quality, event-level entertainment for global audiences.
