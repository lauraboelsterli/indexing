    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cogint, Inc. (NASDAQ: COGT), a leading provider of information and performance marketing solutions, today announced its plan to spin-off its data and analytics business, Red Violet, earlier than previously anticipated. As the Company works towards the closing of its business combination with BlueFocus International Limited, including meeting the remaining closing conditions and obtaining all regulatory approvals, the Company expects to announce a record date for the spin-off within the next 30 days, subject to the SEC's clearance of the Red Violet Registration Statement on Form 10 and meeting all other conditions to the spin-off. The Company's Board of Directors has authorized management to establish a record date for the spin-off at the time all such conditions have been met and expects to declare a spin-off dividend of one share of Red Violet common stock for every four to five shares of Cogint common stock held on the record date, subject to the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Upon the spin-off, Red Violet expects to have approximately $20 million in cash and no debt.\n“cogint experienced yet another breakthrough year in 2017 and an even stronger start to 2018,” said Derek Dubner, CEO of cogint. “We are so confident in the spin-off path we are taking and the expected increase in shareholder value, that we are announcing today that we will be accelerating the spin-off of Red Violet. This spin-off will enable the investment community to more appropriately value our businesses, provide greater insight into the financial performance of each, will enable each business to make decisions best for its respective interests, including capital deployment, and will permit both to compete more effectively in their respective industries.”\nPost spin-off, the Company expects cogint, which will include its digital marketing company, Fluent, to be profitable from day one. Fluent will continue to provide industry-leading, people-based digital marketing and customer acquisition to leading consumer brands and direct marketers, leveraging its mobile-first platform and performance-based model.\nRed Violet, a software and services company specializing in big data analysis, will provide cloud-based, mission-critical information solutions to enterprises in a variety of industries, not only in the $8+ billion North American risk analytics market, but in other emerging and expansive technology-driven markets that require identity verification and other risk mitigation solutions, including mobile identity authentication and enterprise-oriented blockchain.\nAbout cogint™\nAt cogint, we believe that time is your most valuable asset.
