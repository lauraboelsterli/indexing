    "text": "LAFAYETTE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Stepping Stones Group, a provider of therapy and education solutions to children with special needs and autism in educational settings, today announced the acquisition and recapitalization of Cobb Pediatric Therapy Services, a provider of speech language pathology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and school psychology services to school districts in the Southeastern United States. Stepping Stones is a portfolio company of Five Arrows Capital Partners, the North American corporate private equity business of Rothschild Merchant Banking. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\nCobb Pediatric is headquartered in Cobb County, Georgia and serves schools throughout the Southeast. The company was founded in 1989 by CEO June Whitehead, a speech pathologist by training. Cobb Pediatric has been recognized as a top work place for the past six years including by The Atlanta Journal Constitution in 2017.\n“We’re excited to announce the acquisition of Cobb Pediatric, an established company that has earned a great reputation among its customers and employees over the past 29 years,” said Anthony Rintala, Chief Executive Officer of The Stepping Stones Group. “June has built a strong business while doing tremendous, impactful work in the communities in which they operate. We’re pleased that Mark Norris, Cobb Pediatric’s President, will be continuing with us once the transaction closes as his deep experience will ensure that we can continue to build on Cobb Pediatric’s success and further expand The Stepping Stones Group’s footprint of qualified therapists across the country.”\nStepping Stones provides services to over 300 school districts and 42,000 children across more than 20 states in the U.S. The acquisition of Cobb Pediatric will further expand the company’s footprint to now span more than 25 states.\nMs. Whitehead added, “With Stepping Stones’ reach and expertise, Cobb Pediatric will now be part of a larger platform to empower even more schools and more therapists to help children with special needs reach their potential and lead fulfilling lives. I am thrilled that Mark will stay with the company and can’t wait to see what the future holds for The Stepping Stones Group.”\nStepping Stones has completed two previous add-on acquisitions in the past two years, acquiring AlphaVista Services in June 2016 and Staffing Options & Solutions in June 2017 to accelerate growth and gain access to new geographies across the U.S. Each operating division has retained its unique brand identity but operates under The Stepping Stones Group platform.
