The official said that Trump will outline a plan to boost infrastructure and call for cutting regulatory earnings to speed approval for new projects. Published 9 Mins Ago Reuters Getty Images A section of road collapsed along State Route 4 on June 25, 2016 outside of Queen Scholls, West Virginia. \nU.S. President Donald Trump plans to unveil details of his long-awaited plan to generate at least $1.5 trillion in infrastructure improvements over 10 years next Monday, a White House official said on Tuesday. \nTrump will issue \"infrastructure principles, which will outline a plan\" to boost infrastructure and call for cutting regulatory burdens to speed approval for new projects, the official said. Reuters reported this month that the administration's plan will call for $200 billion in new federal funding, offset by unspecified spending cuts, including $100 billion in cost-sharing payments for state and local projects and $50 billion dedicated for rural projects.",
