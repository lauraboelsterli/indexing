    "text": "U.S. Same Facility Revenue Grows 6.6%\nProvides 2018 Financial Guidance\nFRANKLIN, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACHC) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Revenue increased 3.1% for the quarter to $724.5 million from $702.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income attributable to Acadia stockholders was $69.6 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $41.8 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include a non-cash decrease in the provision for income taxes of $20.2 million from the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on net deferred tax liabilities. This estimate will continue to be evaluated as further information becomes available. Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Acadia stockholders per diluted share (“adjusted EPS”) was $0.61 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $0.59 for the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding the impact of a tax benefit of $20.2 million due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; transaction-related expenses of $5.4 million and $14.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectfully; and debt extinguishment costs of $0.8 million and loss on divestiture of $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial results in this release appears beginning on page 8.\nJoey Jacobs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Acadia, commented, “We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter of 2017. We note that the results for the fourth quarter of 2016 include revenue of approximately $30 million and adjusted EPS of approximately $0.05 from 22 facilities in the U.K. that were divested on November 30, 2016.”\nSame facility revenue for Acadia’s U.S. operations increased 6.6% for the fourth quarter of 2017 from the fourth quarter of 2016, with a 3.1% increase in patient days and a 3.3% increase in revenue per patient day. U.S. same facility EBITDA margin was 26.3% for the latest quarter, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSame facility revenue for Acadia’s U.K. operations increased 3.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, with a 1.5% increase in patient days and a 2.2% increase in revenue per patient day. U.K. same facility EBITDA margin was 21.1% for the fourth quarter compared with 22.3% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Mr. Jacobs added, “The fourth quarter results for our operations in the U.K. met our revised expectations. Our results still reflect a lower census than normal and continued pressure from higher agency labor expense, primarily for nurses and other clinical staff, due to tightening in the U.K. labor market.”\nTotal same facility revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 5.6%, with a 2.4% increase in patient days and a 3.1% increase in revenue per patient day. Total same facility EBITDA margin was 24.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 24.9% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The growth in same facility revenue reflected the addition of 750 beds to existing and new facilities in 2017, of which 398 beds opened in the fourth quarter. The Company expects to add more than 800 beds to existing and new facilities in 2018.\nAcadia’s consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $153.5 million, or 21.2% of revenue, compared with $149.5 million, or 21.3% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAcadia today established its financial guidance for 2018 and the first quarter of 2018, as follows:\nRevenue for 2018 in a range of $3.04 billion to $3.08 billion; Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 in a range of $637 million to $644 million; Adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2018 in a range of $2.42 to $2.48; Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 in a range of $0.47 to $0.49; and An exchange rate of $1.35 per British Pound Sterling and a tax rate of approximately 21%.\nThe Company’s guidance does not include the impact of any future acquisitions or transaction-related expenses.\nEBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for equity-based compensation expense, transaction-related expenses, debt extinguishment costs, loss on divestiture and gain on foreign currency derivatives. Adjusted income is defined as net income adjusted for transaction-related expenses, tax reform impact, debt extinguishment costs, loss on divestiture, gain on foreign currency derivatives and income tax effect of adjustments to income.\nAcadia will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter financial results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, February 22, 2018. A live webcast of the conference call will be available at www.acadiahealthcare.com in the “Investors” section of the website. The webcast of the conference call will be available through March 8, 2018.\nRisk Factors\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements. Generally, words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “plan,” “continue,” and “believe” or the negative of or other variation on these and other similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this news release.

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties and our future results could differ significantly from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation, (i) potential difficulties operating our business in light of political and economic instability in the U.K. and globally following the referendum in the U.K. on June 23, 2016, in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, or Brexit; (ii) the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, including the devaluation of the British Pound Sterling (GBP) relative to the U.S. Dollar (USD) following the Brexit vote; (iii) Acadia’s ability to complete acquisitions and successfully integrate the operations of acquired facilities; (iv) Acadia’s ability to add beds, expand services, enhance marketing programs and improve efficiencies at its facilities; (v) potential reductions in payments received by Acadia from government and third-party payors; (vi) the occurrence of patient incidents and governmental investigations, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock and result in substantial fines and incremental regulatory burdens; (vii) the risk that Acadia may not generate sufficient cash from operations to service its debt and meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements; and (viii) potential operating difficulties, labor costs, client preferences, changes in competition and general economic or industry conditions that may prevent Acadia from realizing the expected benefits of its business strategy. These factors and others are more fully described in Acadia’s periodic reports and other filings with the SEC.\nAbout Acadia\nAcadia is a provider of behavioral healthcare services.

Footnotes We have included certain financial measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income, which are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined under the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. We define EBITDA as net income adjusted for net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for equity-based compensation expense, transaction-related expenses, debt extinguishment costs, loss on divestiture and gain on foreign currency derivatives. We define Adjusted income as net income adjusted for transaction-related expenses, tax reform impact, debt extinguishment costs, loss on divestiture, gain on foreign currency derivatives and income tax effect of adjustments to income. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income are supplemental measures of our performance and are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income are not measures of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity. Our measurements of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of a company’s historical performance. We believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers of equity securities, many of which present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income when reporting their results. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share, where provided, to expected results due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of transaction-related expenses and the tax effect of such expenses. (a) Represents the equity-based compensation expense of Acadia. (b) Represents transaction-related expenses incurred by Acadia related to acquisitions and integration efforts. (c) Represents debt extinguishment costs recorded in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs. (d) As part of divestitures in the U.K. and U.S., the loss on divestiture includes an allocation of goodwill to the disposal groups of approximately $106.9 million, loss on the sale of properties of approximately $45.0 million, transaction-related expenses of approximately $26.8 million and write-off of intangible assets of approximately $0.1 million. (e) Represents the change in fair value of foreign currency derivatives purchased by Acadia related to (i) acquisitions in the U.K. and (ii) certain transfers of cash between the U.S. and U.K. under the Company’s cash management and foreign currency risk management programs. (f) Represents the Company’s estimate of the one-time remeasurement of deferred taxes pursuant to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
