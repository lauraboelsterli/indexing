    "text": "PHOENIX, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Republic Bank of Arizona, (OTCBB:RBAZ) (“RBAZ”) (“Bank”) announced a net income of $215,000, or $0.13 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and a net income of $624,000, or $0.37 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a net income of $89,000, or $0.05 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and $676,000 or $0.40 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPresident and CEO Ralph Tapscott stated, “Last quarter I was pleased to announce we posted one of the best quarters in my tenure with the Bank, and this quarter would have surpassed the third quarter until the December 22, 2017 tax reform measure was signed into law. When the new law was signed, we, like many other financial institutions, revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and other provisions of the legislation. Based on this analysis, RBAZ recorded a one-time tax charge of approximately $268,000, or $0.16 per share, primarily related to the revaluation of these deferred tax items. This increase in income tax expense was reflected in our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2017 and was in addition to the normal provision for income tax.”\nMr. Tapscott continued, “Our focus for this year and into the future is to deepen relationships with our clients, and to be out in the community to develop new clientele. Our total asset growth of 41.8% and deposit growth of 52.1% for 2017 shows that we are maintaining our client centric focus and will continue to provide that exceptional service as we move the Bank’s offices a few blocks west to 645 East Missouri Suite 108 this spring. We marched past the $100 million in assets milestone during the quarter and set our focus on our longer term goal of exceeding $250 million. Our experienced team delivers service levels that are truly the differentiators that set us apart. We will continue to invest in the team that will deliver results. We have only begun to push the needle, and I hope you will continue to follow our progress.”\n2017 Highlights Include:\nTotal assets grew $36,256,000 or 41.8% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016. Since December 31, 2016, customer checking deposits have grown nearly $27,130,000 or 342% through the year ended December 31, 2017. Total deposit growth during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $37,152,000 or 52.1%. Changes in deposit composition, coupled with the payoff of FHLB term advances, have allowed RBAZ’s cost of funds to decrease by 10.8% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year. Non-interest expense was reduced by 3.7% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year.\nThe Bank remains “well capitalized” as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2017 (%) Ratio to be Well\nCapitalized (%) Leverage Ratio 13.08 5.00 Common Equity Tier 1 24.93 6.50 Tier 1 Capital to Risk Weighted Assets 24.93 8.00 Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets 26.20 10.00 About the Company\nRepublic Bank of Arizona is a locally owned community bank in Phoenix, Arizona.
