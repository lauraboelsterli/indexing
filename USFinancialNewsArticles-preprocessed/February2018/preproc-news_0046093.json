    "text": "RESTON, Va., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LDOS), a FORTUNE 500 ® science, information technology and engineering leader, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017.\nRoger Krone, Leidos Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"We closed out 2017 with another strong quarter of operational performance, enabling us to achieve strong margins and generate more than half a billion dollars of cash from operations for the year. With the successful completion of most of our integration activities, we shift our focus to growth in the year ahead. Our strong balance sheet and increased cash generation allows us to continue to invest for growth while also returning capital to shareholders. Further, the talent and diversity of our employees, combined with their dedication to delivering mission critical solutions gives us confidence in our ability to deliver value to our customers and shareholders.\"\nFourth Quarter Summary Results\nRevenues for the quarter were $2.52 billion, compared to $2.58 billion in the prior year quarter, reflecting a 2.3% decrease.\nOperating income for the quarter was $101 million, compared to $152 million in the prior year quarter. Operating margin decreased to 4.0% from 5.9% in the prior year quarter, due to increases in acquisition and integration costs, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring expenses and amortization of equity method investments. Excluding non-GAAP items, operating margin was 9.2%, compared to 9.3% in the prior year quarter.\nDiluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") attributable to Leidos common stockholders for the quarter was $0.74, compared to $0.39 in the prior year quarter. Excluding the items mentioned above, non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Leidos common stockholders for the fourth quarter was $0.87 compared to $0.75 in the prior year quarter. The weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 154 million compared to 153 million in the prior year quarter.\nDefense Solutions\nDefense Solutions revenues for the quarter of $1.22 billion decreased $48 million, or 3.8%, compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue decline was primarily attributable to completion of certain contracts and net volume decreases, partially offset by growth in its airborne programs.\nDefense Solutions operating income margin for the quarter was 7.0%, compared to 6.9% in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the quarter was 9.3%, compared to 8.0% in the prior year quarter. Operating margins were favorably impacted by profit write-ups on certain contracts.\nCivil\nCivil revenues for the quarter of $854 million decreased $8 million, or 0.9%, compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue decline was primarily attributable to the timing of our security products business, partially offset by net volume increases on certain contracts.\nCivil operating income margin for the quarter was 6.6%, compared to 7.7% in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the quarter was 10.7%, compared to 10.2% in the prior year quarter. Operating margins were favorably impacted by profit write-ups on certain contracts.\nHealth\nHealth revenues of $441 million for the quarter decreased $2 million, or 0.5%, as compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue decline is primarily attributable to net volume decreases on certain contracts offset by growth in our federal health business.\nHealth operating income margin for the quarter was 10.0%, compared to 10.8% in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the quarter was 12.0%, compared to 15.1% in the prior year quarter. Operating margins were impacted by lower volume on high margin contracts.\nFiscal Year 2017 Summary Results\nRevenues for fiscal year 2017 were $10.17 billion, compared to $7.04 billion in the prior year, reflecting a 44.4% increase.\nOperating income for fiscal year 2017 was $559 million, compared to $417 million in the prior year primarily due to the acquired IS&GS Business. Operating margin for fiscal year 2017 was 5.5%, compared to 5.9% in the prior year primarily due to increases in the non-GAAP items previously mentioned above in the fourth quarter summary results. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP operating margin increased to 9.8% from 8.6% in the prior year.\nDiluted EPS attributable to Leidos common stockholders for fiscal year 2017 was $2.38, compared to $2.35 for the prior year. Excluding the impact of items mentioned above, the non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Leidos common stockholders for fiscal year 2017 was $3.72, compared to $3.51 in the prior year. The diluted share count was 154 million, up from 104 million in the prior year due to the issuance of approximately 77 million shares of Leidos common stock to participating Lockheed Martin stockholders during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 in connection with the acquisition of the IS&GS Business.\nDefense Solutions\nDefense Solutions revenues of $4.96 billion for fiscal year 2017 increased $1.12 billion, or 29.0%, compared to the prior year. The revenue growth was primarily attributable to the acquired IS&GS Business and growth in its airborne programs, partially offset by completion of certain contracts, net volume decreases and a contract write-up in fiscal 2016.\nDefense Solutions operating income margin for fiscal year 2017 was 6.2%, compared to 8.1% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin decreased slightly to 8.4%, compared to 8.6% in the prior year.\nCivil\nCivil revenues of $3.41 billion for fiscal year 2017 increased $1.33 billion, or 63.7%, compared to the prior year. The revenue growth was primarily attributable to the acquired IS&GS Business, partially offset by fiscal 2016 revenues from the divestiture of the heavy construction business, net volume decreases on certain contracts and lower revenues from our international business, including the adverse impact of foreign currency.\nCivil operating income margin for fiscal year 2017 was 6.6%, compared to 7.0% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the year was 10.8%, compared to 8.9% in the prior year. Operating margins were favorably impacted by stronger program performance.\nHealth\nHealth revenues for fiscal year 2017 of $1.80 billion increased $685 million, or 61.3%, compared to the prior year. The revenue growth was primarily attributable to the acquired IS&GS Business and growth in our federal health business, partially offset by lower volume in commercial health.\nHealth operating margin for fiscal year 2017 was 12.7%, compared to 9.8% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the year was 14.9%, compared to 12.4% in the prior year. Operating margins were favorably impacted by higher margins on certain IS&GS contracts.\nCash Flow Summary\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the quarter were $164 million compared to $121 million in the prior year quarter. The higher operating cash inflows were primarily due to the favorable timing of working capital changes, partially offset by higher integration and restructuring costs and cash paid for income taxes.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the quarter were $38 million compared to $8 million in the prior year quarter. The increased cash outflows were primarily due to higher purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the quarter were $65 million compared to $227 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in financing cash outflows were primarily due to lower repayments of long-term debt of $160 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year were $526 million compared to $449 million in the prior year. The higher operating cash inflows were primarily due to the favorable timing of working capital changes, partially offset by higher integration and restructuring costs, higher payments for interest and cash paid for income taxes.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year were $71 million compared to net cash provided by $26 million in the prior year. The higher cash flows used were primarily due to cash proceeds received from both the acquisition of the IS&GS Business and the divestiture of the heavy construction business in fiscal 2016 and higher purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year were $429 million compared to $751 million in in the prior year. The decrease in financing cash outflows were primarily due to a special cash dividend payment in the prior year and lower debt repayments partially offset by higher borrowings in the prior year and higher dividend payments.\nAs of December 29, 2017, the Company had $390 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.1 billion in long-term debt.\nShare Repurchase Authorization\nOn February 16, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 20 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in one or more open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase transactions. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company's common stock, general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, compliance with the terms of the Company's outstanding indebtedness and other considerations. There is no assurance as to the number of shares that will be repurchased, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company's discretion. This share repurchase authorization replaces the previous share repurchase authorization announced in December 2013.\nNew Business Awards\nNet bookings totaled $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and $9.7 billion for fiscal year 2017, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9 and 1.0 for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017, respectively.\nNotable recent awards received include:\nUnited States Army : Leidos was awarded a competitive task order to provide mission support services to the U.S. Army's Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center Prototyping Integration and Testing Division (\"PI&TD\"). The single-award task order has a one-year base period of performance, four one-year options, and a total contract value of approximately $230 million. Leidos' work will help PI&TD integrate C4ISR systems into military and aerospace equipment and weapons systems, as well as support evaluation exercises. NASA Johnson Space Center : Leidos was awarded a follow-on contract to provide sustained engineering and mission support under the Cargo Mission Contract 3 for the International Space Station (\"ISS\"). Under the contract, Leidos will apply multiple technology innovations to improve capabilities for cargo packing, as well as customer-focused enhancements that provide the ISS with cost-effective solutions in a dynamic and challenging environment. The single-award cost-plus fixed-fee contract has a two-year base period of performance, three option periods, and a maximum potential value of $159 million. Office of Naval Research : Leidos was awarded a cost-plus-fixed fee contract for the Sea Hunter II -Autonomous Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel Hull Number 2. This contract contains options, which if exercised, would bring the contract value to approximately $44 million. Leidos will provide research, development, test and evaluation for the second vessel. U.S. Intelligence Community : The Company was awarded contracts valued at $600 million, if all options are exercised, by U.S. national security and intelligence clients. Though the specific nature of these contracts is classified, they all encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security.\nThe Company's backlog at the end of fiscal year 2017 was $17.5 billion, of which $5.0 billion was funded.\nForward Guidance\nThe Company's outlook for fiscal year 2018 is as follows:\nRevenues of $10.25 billion to $10.65 billion; Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.1% to 10.4%; Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.50; and Cash flows provided by operating activities at or above $675 million.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, asset impairment charges, restructuring expenses, acquisition and integration costs, amortization of equity method investments, gains and losses on sale of assets and businesses, promissory note impairment and adjustments to the income tax provision to reflect non-GAAP exclusions. See Leidos' non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliation included elsewhere in this release.\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted EBITDA margins (non-GAAP) or non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to GAAP net income (loss), due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation. Because certain deductions for non-GAAP exclusions used to calculate projected net income (loss) may vary significantly based on actual events, the Company is not able to forecast on a GAAP basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in order to provide a GAAP calculation of projected net income (loss) at this time. The amounts of these deductions may be material and, therefore, could result in projected GAAP net income (loss) and diluted earnings per share being materially less than projected adjusted EBITDA margins (non-GAAP) and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nIn December 2017, the U.S. Government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). The Company expects to be impacted by many of the Tax Act provisions, including most notably the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%. The lower rate applies to earnings starting in fiscal year 2018, however due to the Tax Act's 2017 enactment date, the Company recognized a one-time net benefit of $115 million to our fourth quarter GAAP net income. The majority of the benefit is due to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities at the lower rate which contributed $0.75 to GAAP diluted EPS in the quarter. The one-time Tax Act benefit is excluded from our non-GAAP net income and EPS results. Taking into account the Tax Act changes, we expect our normalized fiscal year 2018 GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23% to 24%.\nASC Topic 606 Update\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we will adopt Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC Topic 606\") using the modified retrospective method. The implementation of the new standard will impact some of our contracts as a result of the identification of new performance obligations, and on contracts that currently use the units-of-delivery method of revenue recognition, that will convert to an over-time model from the current point-in-time model. Based on our preliminary assessment, the impact of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 is not expected to be material.\nConference Call Information\nLeidos management will discuss operations and financial results in an earnings conference call beginning at 8 A.M. eastern on February 22, 2018.

Backlog value is based on management's estimates about volume of services, availability of customer funding and other factors, and excludes contracts that are under protest. Our estimate of backlog comprises both funded and negotiated unfunded backlog. Backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by several factors including modifications of contracts, non-exercise of options, foreign currency movements, etc.\nFunded backlog for contracts with the U.S. Government represents the value on contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. Funded backlog for contracts with non-U.S. Government entities and commercial customers represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which Leidos is obligated to perform, less revenues previously recognized on the contracts.\nNegotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding has not been appropriated and unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include future potential task orders expected to be awarded under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (\"IDIQ\"), General Services Administration Schedule or other master agreement contract vehicles, with the exception of certain IDIQ contracts where task orders are not competitively awarded or separately priced but instead are used as a funding mechanism, and where there is a basis for estimating future revenues and funding on future task orders is anticipated.\nThe estimated value of backlog as of the dates presented was as follows:\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nDefense Solutions:\nFunded backlog\n$\n2,384\n$\n3,171\nNegotiated unfunded backlog\n5,285\n4,936\nTotal Defense Solutions backlog\n$\n7,669\n$\n8,107\nCivil:\nFunded backlog\n$\n2,064\n$\n1,950\nNegotiated unfunded backlog\n5,321\n5,250\nTotal Civil backlog\n$\n7,385\n$\n7,200\nHealth:\nFunded backlog\n$\n595\n$\n854\nNegotiated unfunded backlog\n1,827\n1,575\nTotal Health backlog\n$\n2,422\n$\n2,429\nTotal:\nFunded backlog\n$\n5,043\n$\n5,975\nNegotiated unfunded backlog\n12,433\n11,761\nTotal backlog\n$\n17,476\n$\n17,736\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.\nUNAUDITED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe Company uses and refers to non-GAAP operating income, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS, which are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") and, accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP measures provide another measure of the Company's results of operations and financial condition, including its ability to comply with financial covenants. These non-GAAP measures are frequently used by financial analysts covering Leidos and its peers. The Company's computation of its non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, thus limiting their use for comparability.\nNon-GAAP operating income is computed by excluding the following items from net income: (i) other (expense) income, net; (ii) interest expense; (iii) interest income; (iv) the following discrete items (referred to as non-GAAP adjustments); and (v) income tax benefit (expense) adjusted to reflect the non-GAAP adjustments.\nAcquisition and integration costs - Represents costs related to the acquisition and integration of the IS&GS business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets - Represents the amortization of the fair value of the acquired intangible assets. Restructuring expenses - Represents costs associated with lease termination and severance costs related to the Company's acquisition of the IS&GS Business and other Corporate mandated activities. Amortization of equity method investments - Represents the amortization of the fair value of equity method investments acquired with the IS&GS Business. Tax purchase accounting adjustments - Represents the tax purchase accounting adjustments related to the IS&GS acquisition. Gains and losses on sale of assets and businesses - Represents the gains or losses on certain sales of real estate and businesses. Asset impairment charges - Represents impairments of long-lived intangible and tangible assets. Promissory note impairment - Represents an impairment on a promissory note. Impact of Tax Act - Represents the cumulative impact from the federal government enacted Tax Act.\nNon-GAAP operating margin is computed by dividing non-GAAP operating income by revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA is computed by excluding the following items from income before income taxes: (i) discrete items as identified above; (ii) interest expense; (iii) interest income; and (iv) depreciation expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is computed by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue.\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.\nUNAUDITED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES [CONTINUED]\n(in millions, except per share
