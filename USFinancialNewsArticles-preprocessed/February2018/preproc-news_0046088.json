    "text": "HANOVER, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ledyard Financial Group, Inc. (ticker symbol LFGP), the holding company for Ledyard National Bank, today reported earnings for 2017 of $3,845,238, a 6.9% decrease over the prior year. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset position to reflect the reduction in its federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%. This revaluation resulted in an increase to income tax expense of approximately $503,800. Pre-tax income for 2017 was $5,208,013 or a 1.4% improvement over the prior year. This improvement was due to strong equity markets, robust new business activity at Ledyard Financial Advisors, and an improvement in net interest margin.\n”The impact of this new law on Ledyard doesn’t detract from the strong year our core businesses had in 2017 as evidenced by the growth in our pre-tax income and our investment in the Concord, New Hampshire market. We expect the decrease in the tax rate to contribute positively to our bottom line results in future years”, stated Kathryn Underwood, President and CEO of Ledyard Financial Group.\nNet income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $592,465 or $0.19 per share compared to $987,221 or $0.32 per share for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $394,755 or 40%, due to the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax asset position in connection with the Tax Cuts and Job Acts of 2017 . Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was $3,845,238 or $1.25 per share compared to $4,128,419 or $1.34 per share for the same period in 2016.\nTotal revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $6,520,551 compared to $5,966,718 for the same period in 2016, for an increase of $553,833 or 9.3%. Total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was $25,275,053 compared to $23,535,879 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $1,739,174 or 7.4%. Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $3,696,853 compared to $3,422,586 for the same period in 2016, for an increase of $274,268 or 8%. Net interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was $14,480,765 compared to $13,256,991 for the same period in 2016, for an increase of $1,223,773 or 9.2%.\nNo funds were added to the Allowance during 2017 or during 2016. Net charge-offs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, were $190,136 compared to $6,588 for the comparable period in 2016.

Revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was $9,437,325 compared to $8,314,869 for the same period in 2016, for an increase of $1,122,457 or 13.5%. Assets under management and custody at Ledyard Financial Advisors totaled approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $356 million over the prior year.\nNon-interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $5,241,589 compared to $4,756,526 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $485,063 or 10.2%.

The primary contributor to the increase in non-interest expense was the increased investment in people, facilities, and marketing as a result of the Company’s entry into the Concord, New Hampshire market.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company’s shareholders’ equity stood at $46.6 million, compared to $42.9 million for the same period in 2016.
