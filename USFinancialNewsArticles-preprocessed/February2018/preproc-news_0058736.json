    "text": "February 27, 2018 / 11:50 AM / Updated 12 minutes ago Hedge funds expect counter bid for Sky after Comcast offer Ben Martin 1 Min Read LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Two hedge fund shareholders in Sky say Comcast Corp’s $31 billion offer for the British pay-television broadcaster is likely to trigger a higher counter bid for the FTSE 100 company. Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey said Comcast’s proposal, which rivals an offer for Sky made by Twenty-First Century Fox , was “fantastic” and that a counter bid was now likely. Polygon portfolio manager Bechara Nasr said Sky could eventually fetch an offer of more than 15 pounds per share. (Reporting by Ben Martin; editing by Jason Neely)",
