McMaster said on Saturday. “What’s particularly concerning is that this network of proxies is becoming more and more capable, as Iran seeds more and more ...destructive weapons into these networks,” McMaster told the annual Munich Security Conference. “So the time is now, we think, to act against Iran,” he said.
