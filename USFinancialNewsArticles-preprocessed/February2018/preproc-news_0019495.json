As oil prices rebounded and the oil industry recovered from setbacks, our management made prudent decision to invest in manufacturing equipment and constructing wastewater, and oil sludge treatment plants. Our gross margin decreased significantly primarily due to increased sales of equipment with lower margin during the construction and test-run stage of our new plants. After this stage terminates in approximately 6 months to one year, we expect that our gross margin will increase when we plan to produce and sell our equipment with higher margin. Therefore, we believe our operation and profitability will be gradually improved in the coming months. We're excited that many potential clients have shown strong interest in the furnaces we produce, and Qing Hai oilfield and Gan Su oilfield also express their urgent requirement of our wastewater and oily sewage capability. We also maintain constant fast expansion of business scope. Beyond the oilfield service industry, we expand our business to other domains, such as coal chemical and petroleum chemistry. We also invested in Future Gas Station (Beijing) Technology, Ltd. (\"FGS\"), a service company focusing on providing new technical application and data operation to gas stations of oil companies. With its DT Refuel mobile application, FGS provides solutions to gas stations to improve their operations and their customers' experience. Recon and FGS plan to jointly develop an integrated block chain-based mobile shopping system for use in gas stations. We believe all activities made during our second quarter of 2018 will bring long-term return benefit for Recon and all of its shareholders.\"\nMr. Yin continued, \"Looking to the coming year and beyond, management will focus on the following aspects: 1) for market and business, we will continue improving operation quality and disperse risks by pursuing high-quality business and sophisticated products; 2) for technology and products, we will also enhance cooperation with regional leading manufacturing companies, positively introduces advanced overseas technique and continuously integrate and upgrade current industrial equipment and solutions to establish leading position in various fields, and to maximize the added value of products and service; and 3) for internal control: we will always seek to improve our cash flow management to meet development requirements and minimize company risks.\"\nRecent Developments\nOn November 20, 2017, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Yongquan Bi (\"Mr. Bi.\"), pursuant to which Mr. Bi agreed to purchase an aggregate of 3 million unregistered restricted shares for $4.8 million, a per-share purchase price of $1.60.

Gross profit margin decreased to 9.6% from 38.0% in the prior year period. The significant decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of furnaces which usually generates lower gross margin. The management believes that our gross margin will increase after the construction and test-run stage of our new plants and equipment, when our equipment is expected to be sold at the normal price.\nNet Loss\nLoss from operations was RMB 10.6 million ($1.6 million) during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to RMB3.8 million in the prior year period. The increase in net loss is largely due to a decrease in gross profit and an increase in general and administrative expenses, partly offset by a decrease in research and development expenses and selling and distribution expenses.\nNet loss attributable to Recon for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB10.2 million ($1.6 million), or RMB1.22 ($0.19) per basic and diluted share based on 8.4 million basic and diluted shares outstanding, compared to RMB4.4 million, or RMB0.70 per basic and diluted share based on 6.2 million basic and diluted shares outstanding in the prior year period.\nNon U.S. GAAP Net Loss\nNon U.S. GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders excluding certain non-cash expenses such as restricted shares issued for consulting services and non-cash stock compensation expense was RMB3.1 million ($481,456), or RMB0.37 ($0.06) per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of RMB3.3 million, RMB0.53 per basic share, or RMB0.48 per diluted share, for the same period last fiscal year. Please see the note about non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation table at the end of this press release.\n6 MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 UNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenue\nFor the Six Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\n2016\n2017\nIncrease\nChange\nHardware and software\n¥\n38,042,938\n¥\n53,064,176\n¥\n15,021,238\n39.5\n%\nService\n72,170\n182,551\n110,381\n152.9\n%\nTotal revenues\n¥\n38,115,108\n¥\n53,246,727\n¥\n15,131,619\n39.7\n%\nTotal revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were approximately ¥53.2 million ($8.2 million), representing an increase of approximately ¥15.1 million or 39.7% from ¥38.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The overall increase in revenue was accomplished through Recon's expansion of new clients and development of new business. See below for more details:\nFor the Six Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nIncrease /\nPercentage\n2016\n2017\n(Decrease)\nChange\nAutomation product and software\n¥\n17,964,392\n¥\n13,602,598\n¥\n(4,361,794)\n(24.3)%\nEquipment and accessories\n17,340,842\n39,029,881\n21,689,039\n125.1\n%\nWaste water treatment products\n2,737,704\n431,697\n(2,306,007)\n(84.2)%\nServices\n72,170\n182,551\n110,381\n152.9\n%\nTotal revenue\n¥\n38,115,108\n¥\n53,246,727\n¥\n15,131,619\n39.7\n%\n(1)\nRevenue from automation product and software decreased by ¥4.4 million or 24.3%. Affected by less expenditure on surface projects of our clients for the last two years, requirement of automation related projects maintained at a lower level and fluxed. Revenue from this product line may fluctuate from time to time. Management is confident on further development on this business because it believes oil companies will continue to invest in automation products. In addition, during this period, management also expanded new market of automation business to coal chemical industry.\n(2)\nAs shown above, the overall increase in revenue was primarily due to the increased equipment, including furnaces and related accessories.\n(3)\nRevenue from waste water treatment products decreased by ¥2.3 million or 84.2% as most of Recon's wastewater treatment projects were not finished thus less revenue was recorded in the six months ended December 31, 2017.\n(4)\nRevenue from services for the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 consisted mainly of maintenance services, which were provided upon request by customers. Revenue from services increased by ¥0.1 million or 152.9% mainly because maintenance requests outpaced the purchase of new equipment due to industry softness, and we believe margin level is reasonable.\nCost and Margin\nFor the Six Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nIncrease /\nPercentage\n2016\n2017\n(Decrease)\nChange\nTotal revenues\n¥\n38,115,108\n¥\n53,246,727\n¥\n15,131,619\n39.7\n%\nCost of revenues\n25,505,506\n47,198,605\n21,693,099\n85.1\n%\nGross profit\n¥\n12,609,602\n¥\n6,048,122\n¥\n(6,561,480)\n(52.0)%\nMargin %\n33.1\n%\n11.4\n%\n(21.7)%\n-\nCost of Revenues. Recon's cost of revenues increased from approximately ¥25.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016 to approximately ¥47.2 million ($7.3 million) for the same period in 2017, representing an increase of approximately ¥21.7 million ($3.3 million), or 85.1%. This increase was mainly caused by significant growth in revenue generated from equipment and accessories with lower gross profit margin.\nGross Profit. Recon's gross profit decreased to approximately ¥6.0 million ($0.9 million) for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from approximately ¥12.6 million for the same period in 2016. Recon's gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11.4% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from 33.1% for the same period in 2016. This was mainly due to the increased equipment business with lower margin during this period, which led to the increase in cost of revenues in proportion to the increase in Recon's revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the Six Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nIncrease /\nPercentage\n2016\n2017\n(Decrease)\nChange\nSelling and distribution expenses\n¥\n2,395,089\n¥\n2,981,637\n¥\n586,548\n24.5\n%\n% of revenue\n6.3\n%\n5.6\n%\n(0.7)%\n-\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n15,244,707\n18,672,141\n3,427,434\n22.5\n%\n% of revenue\n40.0\n%\n35.1\n%\n(4.9)%\n-\nProvision for (reversal of) doubtful accounts\n(690,964)\n80,539\n771,503\n(111.7)%\n% of revenue\n(1.8)%\n0.2\n%\n2.0\n%\n-\nResearch and development expenses\n4,954,802\n1,819,720\n(3,135,082)\n(63.3)%\n% of revenue\n13.0\n%\n3.4\n%\n(9.6)%\n-\nOperating expenses\n¥\n21,903,634\n¥\n23,554,037\n¥\n1,650,403\n7.5\n%\nSelling and Distribution Expenses. Selling and distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenditures of Recon's sales and marketing organization, sales commissions, costs of Recon's marketing programs including traveling expenses, advertising and trade shows, and rental expense, as well as shipping charges. Selling expenses increased by approximately ¥0.6 million (approximately $0.1 million) for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in traveling expense and service fees, partly offset by a decrease in shipping charges, as we began working with qualified vendors located closer to our customers. Selling expenses were 5.6% of total revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 6.3% of total revenues in the same period of 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs in human resources, facilities costs, depreciation expenses, professional advisor fees, audit fees, stock based compensation expense and other miscellaneous expenses incurred in connection with general operations. General and administrative expenses increased by 22.5% or ¥3.4 million (approximately $0.5 million), from approximately ¥15.2 million in the six months ended December 31, 2016 to approximately ¥18.7 million (approximately $2.9 million) in the same period of 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in performance-based compensation, consulting fees, rent expenses and investor relationship expenses. General and administrative expenses accounted 35.1% of total revenues in the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 40.0% of total revenues in the same period of 2016. In December 2016, the Company's board approved the grants of restricted stock to management plan based on performance targets for the coming three fiscal years from FY2017 to FY2019. During the six months period ended December 31, 2017, because of the grant of certain restricted stock to management as the target for the FY2017 achieved, compensation expenses increased ¥1.3 million.\nProvision for doubtful accounts. Provision for doubtful accounts is the estimated amount of bad debt that will arise as a result of lower collectability from accounts receivables, other receivables and purchase advances. We reversed provision for doubtful accounts of ¥0.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016 and recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of ¥80,500 (approximately $12,377) for the same period in 2017. Management will continue to monitor and maintain the provision at a lower level.\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenditures for Recon's research and development projects. Research and development expenses decreased from approximately ¥5.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016 to approximately ¥1.8 million (approximately $0.3 million) for the same period of 2017. This decrease was primarily due to less research and development expense spent on design of chemical products used for waste water treatment and digital oilfield models and platform. The Company was focusing on transform of advanced R&D results into projects, which were undertaken by Gansu BHD and Qinghai BHD.\nNet Loss\nFor the Six Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nIncrease /\nPercentage\n2016\n2017\n(Decrease)\nChange\nLoss from operations\n¥\n(9,294,032)\n¥\n(17,505,915)\n¥\n(8,211,883)\n88.4\n%\nOther income, net\n(162,538)\n(89,775)\n72,763\n(44.8)%\nLoss before income taxes\n(9,456,570)\n(17,595,690)\n(8,139,120)\n86.1\n%\nIncome tax expenses (benefits)\n(20,143)\n9,282\n29,425\n(146.1)%\nNet loss\n(9,436,427)\n(17,604,972)\n(8,168,545)\n86.6\n%\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to non-\ncontrolling interest\n376,212\n(618,162)\n(994,374)\n(264.3)%\nNet loss attributable to Recon Technology,\nLtd\n¥\n(9,812,639)\n¥\n(16,986,810)\n¥\n(7,174,171)\n73.1\n%\nLoss from operations. Loss from operations was ¥17.5 million (approximately $2.7 million) for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a loss of ¥9.3 million for the same period of 2016. This ¥8.2 million (approximately $1.3 million) increase in loss from operations was primary due to a decrease in gross profit, as well as an increase in general and administrative expenses and partly offset by a decrease in research and development expenses as discussed above.\nBasic and diluted loss per share. Basic and diluted loss per share attributable to common shareholders was RMB2.21, as compared to RMB 1.62, for the six months ended December 31, 2016.\nNon U.S. GAAP Net Loss\nNon U.S. GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders excluding certain non-cash expenses (non-GAAP) such as restricted shares issued for consulting services and non-cash stock compensation expense was RMB5,402,955($830,281), or RMB0.70 ($0.11) per diluted share, for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to non U.S. GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders of RMB234,103, or RMB 0.04 per basic and diluted share, for the same period last fiscal year. Please see the note about non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation table at the end of this press release.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSelected Balance Sheet Highlights in RMB\nConversion US$1.0: RMB6.51 at December 31, 2017\nPercentage\n12/31/2017\n6/30/2017\nChange\nCash\n8,270,939\n3,809,279\n117.13\n%\nTotal Current Assets\n86,931,130\n68,387,075\n27.12\n%\nTotal Assets\n98,422,335\n71,155,045\n38.32\n%\nWorking Capital\n52,116,241\n38,941,318\n33.83\n%\nTotal Current Liabilities\n34,814,889\n29,445,757\n18.23\n%\nTotal Stockholders' Equity\n44,767,252\n33,244,445\n34.66\n%\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity\n98,422,335\n71,155,045\n38.32\n%\nCash from Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities was ¥12.7 million (approximately $2.0 million) for the six months ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of ¥18.7 million (approximately $2.9 million) compared to net cash provided by operating activities of ¥6.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the net loss available to the Company in the amount of ¥17.6 million (approximately $2.7 million), share based compensation of ¥3.6 million (approximately $0.5 million), restricted shares issued for management of ¥6.1 million (approximately $0.9 million) and restricted shares issued for services of ¥1.9 million (approximately $0.3 million), and an increase in trade accounts receivable and purchase advance, partly offset by an increase in trade accounts payable.\nCash from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was ¥7.4 million (approximately $1.1 million) for the six months ended December 31, 2017, representing an increase in cash used in investing activities of ¥7.2 million ($1.1 million) compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was due to an increase in the Company's payments for a land use right of 50 years, payments for construction in progress and investment in unconsolidated entity.\nCash from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to ¥24.5 million (approximately $3.8 million) for the six months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of ¥2.5 million for the same period in 2016. During the six months ended December 31, 2017, we repaid ¥20.3 million (approximately $3.1 million) in short-term borrowings to related parties and repaid ¥3.0 million ($0.5 million) in short-term borrowings to one third-party, and we received ¥16.2 million (approximately $2.5 million) in short-term borrowings from related parties, received ¥4.6 million (approximately $0.7 million) in short-term borrowings from third-parties and received ¥10.0 million (approximately $1.5 million) in long-term borrowings from one related party. We also received ¥1.7 million (approximately $0.3 million) capital contribution by non-controlling shareholders. Moreover, this increase in net cash provided by financing activities was due to net proceeds from sale of common stock of ¥15.3 million (approximately $2.4 million) for the six months ended December 31, 2017.\nSTATEMENT REGARDING UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe unaudited financial information set forth above is subject to adjustments that may be identified when audit work is performed on the Company's year-end financial statements, which could result in significant differences from this unaudited financial information.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Recon's unaudited condensed consolidated financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), Recon uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: certain non-cash expenses such as restricted shares issued for consulting services and non-cash stock compensation expense, basic and diluted earnings (losses) per common share excludes non-cash expenses such as restricted shares issued for consulting services and non-cash stock compensation expense.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
