    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday pushed for a vote on legislation that would require “universal” background checks for gun sales, saying a narrower bipartisan bill to improve background checks did not go far enough.\n“We Democrats, at a minimum, believe we should be passing a universal background check legislation that assures that guns don’t fall into the wrong hands,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters.\nReporting by Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell; Writing by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Doina Chiacu\n ",
