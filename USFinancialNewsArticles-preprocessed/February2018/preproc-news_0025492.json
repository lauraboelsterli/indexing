Fair captures this opportunity to usher in a new era of flexible auto financing, in partnership with automakers and dealers.\n\"Fair's business model demonstrates a game-changing alternative for the massive used car market in the United States through flexible auto leasing. It provides a user-friendly, brand new automotive financing experience through a fully digital, transparent, mobile, and reliable technology platform,\" said Ms. Anju Patwardhan, Managing Director of CreditEase FinTech Investment Fund. \"Mr. Scott Painter and Mr. Georg Bauer are visionary automotive industry leaders, each with over 20 years of experience and have proven track record across automobiles and finance. They have built a deep management team with unparalleled industry knowledge at Fair.\"\nCEFIF is a firm believer in using technology to disrupt and change traditional industries and is also an early investor in DiYiCheDai and DaSuoChe in China that are changing vehicle ownership and financing models. \"We will continue to deploy CreditEase's rich technology, risk management, and finance expertise to support the industry growth,\" said Ms.Patwardhan.\nAbout CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund:\nFounded in February 2016, CreditEase FinTech Investment Fund is a venture fund investing in growth-stage FinTech companies in China and the global markets.
