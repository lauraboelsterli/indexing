    "text": "1320 COMMENTS OXON HILL, Md.—The head of the National Rifle Association called for fortifying the nation’s schools and cast efforts to tighten gun laws as attacks on American freedom, in a speech just over a week after a Florida school shooting that left 17 dead.\nWayne LaPierre, executive vice president and chief executive of the NRA, used language similar to that employed by President Donald Trump on protecting students, while also taking shots at some of the president’s favorite political targets, including the national media, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and prominent Democratic lawmakers.\nMr. LaPierre said local officials and parents need to take steps to “harden” schools, “including effective, trained armed security that will absolutely protect every innocent child in this country.” Mr. Trump also called Thursday for “hardened” security , proposing that some teachers be armed.\nMr. LaPierre told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference that liberal lawmakers, egged on by the media national, are cynically using the latest school tragedy to roll back Second Amendment gun protections. Current laws, if more vigorously enforced and observed, are sufficient to curb mass shootings, he said.\n“What they want are more restrictions on the law-abiding,” Mr. LaPierre said. “Think about that. Their solution is to make you—all of you—less free.”\nPresident Donald Trump, in response to Florida’s school shooting, pledged action on certain gun regulations on Thursday, including background checks. He said he’s concerned that violence on the internet, in video games and in movies, is shaping how young minds are being formed. Photo: Agence France-Presse The NRA, the nation’s largest gun-rights group, faces renewed scrutiny following the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Critics say the NRA’s campaign donations and political influence give it outsize influence in Congress, where the group works to stave off stricter gun controls and loosen existing ones.\nThe group endorsed Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential race and spent $30 million in ads supporting him and attacking his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Mr. Trump mentioned the group’s support of him during the White House meeting with local officials.\n“They’re very close to me. I’m close to them,” Mr. Trump said, adding he had spoken “often” with the NRA in the past few days as he worked to develop a response to the Parkland shooting. He also played down potential conflict with the group over some of his proposals, such as placing new age restrictions on gun purchases, which the NRA has opposed.\n“It’s not a battle,” he said. “I think the NRA wants to do the right thing.”\nThe NRA has long been a potent political force. The group says it has five million dues-paying members, and it “grades” politicians on their gun stances, sending those report cards to members across the country. In a measure of its cash clout, the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics calculated that five Republican senators have received more than $27 million in election aid from the group over their careers.\nIn his CPAC speech, Mr. LaPierre took political positions that align with Mr. Trump, accusing Democratic lawmakers of politicizing the shooting rather than coming up with what he billed as practical solutions.\n“They want to sweep right under the carpet the failure of school security, the failure of family, the failure of America’s mental health system and even the unbelievable failure of the FBI.”\nThe FBI acknowledged after the attack that agents failed to act on a tip in January about the alleged shooter in Florida.\nIn an emotional meeting Wednesday at the White House, students, parents, and administrators affected by school shootings offered pleas for change to President Donald Trump. Photo: Getty In another nod to Mr. Trump, Mr. LaPierre also attacked the FBI more broadly, and said rank-and-file members should call “BS on its rogue leadership.” He didn’t specify what he meant when describing FBI “corruption, and its own unethical agents.”\nMr. Trump fired James Comey as the head of the FBI in 2017 and has regularly criticized officials over their handling of separate probes into Russia meddling in the 2016 election and Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.\nMr. LaPierre had harsh words for prominent Democratic lawmakers, saying the party has shifted left over the past few decades and is now controlled by “European-style socialists.” He mentioned some potential Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential race, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California.\n“They hide behind labels like Democrat, left-wing and progressive to make their socialist agenda more palatable, and that is terrifying,” he said.\nSen. Harris responded to Mr. LaPierre in a tweet: “I am not going to be silenced by attacks from the NRA or anyone else — and neither will my Senate colleagues or the students from Stoneman Douglas. It’s time to stand up to the gun lobby and keep our communities safe.”\nThe office of Sen. Warren didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOn the media, Mr. LaPierre said: “You know, the whole discussion of the Second Amendment and the gun issue in this country has become so dishonest in the national media.”\nIn separate comments at CPAC, NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said media outlets have their own motives. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” she said. “You guys love it. I’m not saying you love the tragedy, but I am saying you love the ratings.”\nRelated Coverage Trump’s Stance on Guns Puts Pressure on Congress Governors Join Forces on Illegal Guns Some Teachers Already Have Guns Vermont’s Governor Changes Position on Gun Laws Parkland Students Protest in Tallahassee Florida Weighs What to Do About School Shooting Trump Takes Step to Ban ‘Bump Stocks’ Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Julie Bykowicz at julie.bykowicz@wsj.com",
