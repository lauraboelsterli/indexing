The Company reported net income of $92.1 million, or $1.92 earnings per share, for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. Excluding special items, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.55 in the quarter.\n“We delivered a solid first half to fiscal year 2018 including driving consistent backlog growth, gaining market share through expanded and new customer relationships, and enhancing our manufacturing discipline through the Carpenter Operating Model,” said Tony Thene, Carpenter’s President and CEO. “Our SAO segment recorded its best second quarter and best first half since fiscal year 2014, while results at our PEP segment finished well ahead of our expectations. In addition, we submitted the majority of our Aerospace Vendor Approved Processes (VAP) qualifications for our Athens facility, representing a major milestone. We are now actively working with our major customers to secure necessary approvals.”\n“Conditions across our end-use markets continue to improve and we are generating increased customer demand for our solutions and growing our backlog. In the Aerospace and Defense end-use market, new engine platform demand is increasing and we are further benefiting from our strong position across a range of attractive sub-markets. In addition, demand for our solutions portfolio in the Medical end-use market remains high while the recovery in the oil & gas sub-market is strengthening.”\n“Moving forward, we will continue to strategically invest in our core long-term growth capabilities. In addition, given the recent tax legislation, we plan to accelerate our investment into key areas including additive manufacturing and soft magnetics, which is consistent with our commitment to being a leading solutions provider for our customers. By combining our solutions-focused commercial approach with high-end specialty alloys, we have a real opportunity to raise our performance for both customers and investors to sustain a healthy, dynamic and growing enterprise that will reward our shareholders for years to come.”\nFinancial Highlights\n($ in millions) Q2 Q2 Q1 FY2018 FY2017 FY2018 Net Sales $ 487.8 $ 427.4 $ 479.8 Net Sales Excluding Surcharge (a) $ 415.5 $ 366.7 $ 409.8 Operating Income $ 40.8 $ 15.4 $ 41.7 Operating Income Excluding Pension EID (a) $ 41.3 $ 21.0 $ 42.2 Net Income $ 92.1 $ 7.0 $ 23.4 Cash Provided from (Used for) Operating Activities $ 24.7 $ (29.5 ) $ (7.4 ) Free Cash Flow (a) $ (10.7 ) $ (56.5 ) $ (44.9 ) (a) Non-GAAP financial measure explained in attached schedules Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $487.8 million compared with $427.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of $60.4 million (or 14.1 percent), on 13.1 percent higher volume. Net sales excluding surcharge were $415.5 million, an increase of $48.8 million (or 13.3 percent) from the same period a year ago.\nOperating income was $40.8 million compared to $15.4 million in the prior year period. Operating income—excluding pension earnings, interest and deferrals (EID)—was $41.3 million, compared to $21.0 million in the prior year period. These results primarily reflect stronger market conditions driving higher product demand compared to the same quarter a year ago.\nIn December 2017, “An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018” (the “Act”) was enacted. The Act includes provisions that reduce the federal corporate income tax rate, create a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings (transition tax), and change certain business deductions including allowing for immediate expensing of certain qualified capital expenditures. The permanent reduction to the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% was effective January 1, 2018. Based on the provisions of the Act, during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate was adjusted to incorporate the lower federal tax rate that will be phased in for fiscal year 2018. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a discrete income tax net benefit of $66.0 million. Provisional amounts related to the Act include a $73.3 million income tax benefit to reflect the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the reduced federal tax rate and a $5.1 million income tax charge for the liability associated with the transition tax. Also included in the net discrete income tax benefit is a charge of $2.2 million related to increases in certain state valuation allowances resulting from a state law change that will limit the Company’s ability to utilize certain state net operating loss carryforwards in future periods.\nCash provided from operating activities in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $24.7 million, compared to cash used from operating activities of $29.5 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily related to the $100 million voluntary pension contribution made in October 2016.\nFree cash flow in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was negative $10.7 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $56.5 million in the same quarter last year. Capital expenditures were $26.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to $18.5 million in the same quarter last year.\nTotal liquidity, including cash and available revolver balance, was $405.4 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. This consisted of $20.7 million of cash and $384.7 million of available borrowings under the Company’s credit facility.\nConference Call and Webcast Presentation\nCarpenter will host a conference call and webcast presentation today, February 1 st at 10:00 a.m. ET, to discuss the financial results of operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.

income $ 40.8 $ 15.4 $ 82.5 $ 16.8 The Company has two reportable segments, Specialty Alloys Operations (“SAO”) and Performance Engineered Products (“PEP”).\nThe SAO segment is comprised of Carpenter’s major premium alloy and stainless steel manufacturing operations. This includes operations performed at mills primarily in Reading and Latrobe, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas as well as South Carolina and Alabama.\nThe PEP segment is comprised of the Company’s differentiated operations. This segment includes the Dynamet titanium business, the Carpenter Powder Products (CPP) business, the Amega West business, and the Latrobe and Mexico distribution businesses. The businesses in the PEP segment are managed with an entrepreneurial structure to promote flexibility and agility to quickly respond to market dynamics. It is our belief this model will ultimately drive overall revenue and profit growth. The pounds sold data above for the PEP segment includes only the Dynamet and CPP businesses.\nCorporate costs are comprised of executive and director compensation, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. Also included are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other specifically-identified income or expense items.\nThe service cost component of net pension expense, which represents the estimated cost of future pension liabilities earned associated with active employees, is included in the operating results of the business segments. The residual net pension expense, or pension earnings, interest and deferrals (pension EID), is comprised of the expected return on plan assets, interest costs on the projected benefit obligations of the plans, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and is included under the heading \"Pension earnings, interest and deferrals\".\nPRELIMINARY NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited) OPERATING MARGIN EXCLUDING SURCHARGE, PENSION EARNINGS, INTEREST AND DEFERRALS Three Months Ended Six Months Ended AND SPECIAL ITEMS December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net sales $ 487.8 $ 427.4 $ 967.5 $ 816.3 Less: surcharge 72.3 60.7 142.2 109.7 Net sales excluding surcharge $ 415.5 $ 366.7 $ 825.3 $ 706.6 Operating income $ 40.8 $ 15.4 $ 82.5 $ 16.8 Pension earnings, interest and deferrals 0.5 5.6 1.1 12.7 Operating income excluding pension earnings, interest and deferrals 41.3 21.0 83.6 29.5 Special items: Pension curtailment charge — — — 0.5 Operating income excluding pension earnings, interest and deferrals and special items $ 41.3 $ 21.0 $ 83.6 $ 30.0 Operating margin 8.4 % 3.6 % 8.5 % 2.1 % Operating margin excluding surcharge, pension earnings, interest and deferrals and special items 9.9 % 5.7 % 10.1 % 4.2 % Management believes that removing the impacts of raw material surcharge from operating margin provides a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company. In addition, management believes that excluding the impact of pension earnings, interest and deferrals, which may be volatile due to changes in the financial markets, is helpful in analyzing the true operating performance of the Company. Management also believes that removing the impact of the special items is helpful in analyzing the operating performance of the Company, as these costs are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s board of directors and others.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS Income\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes Income\nTax\nBenefit\n(Expense) Net\nIncome Earnings\nPer\nDiluted\nShare* Three months ended December 31, 2017, as reported $ 33.7 $ 58.4 $ 92.1 $ 1.92 Special items: Impact of US tax reform and other legislative changes — (66.0 ) (66.0 ) (1.37 ) Three months ended December 31, 2017, as adjusted $ 33.7 $ (7.6 ) $ 26.1 $ 0.55 * Impact per diluted share calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding of 47.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS Income\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes Income\nTax\nExpense Net\nIncome Earnings\nPer\nDiluted\nShare* Three months ended December 31, 2016, as reported $ 8.3 $ (1.3 ) $ 7.0 $ 0.15 Special items: None reported — — — — Three months ended December 31, 2016, as adjusted $ 8.3 $ (1.3 ) $ 7.0 $ 0.15 * Impact per diluted share calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding of 47.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS Income\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes Income\nTax\nBenefit\n(Expense) Net\nIncome Earnings\nPer\nDiluted\nShare** Six months ended December 31, 2017, as reported $ 68.9 $ 46.6 $ 115.5 $ 2.41 Special items: Impact of US tax reform and other legislative changes — (66.0 ) (66.0 ) (1.38 ) Six months ended December 31, 2017, as adjusted $ 68.9 $ (19.4 ) $ 49.5 $ 1.03 ** Impact per diluted share calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding of 47.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS Income\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes Income\nTax\n(Expense)\nBenefit Net\nIncome Earnings\nPer\nDiluted\nShare** Six months ended December 31, 2016, as reported $ 3.0 $ (2.2 ) $ 0.8 $ 0.01 Special items: Pension curtailment charge 0.5 (0.1 ) 0.4 0.01 Income tax item*** — 2.1 2.1 0.04 Total impact of special items 0.5 2.0 2.5 0.05 Six months ended December 31, 2016, as adjusted $ 3.5 $ (0.2 ) $ 3.3 $ 0.06 ** Impact per diluted share calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding of 47.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. *** Discrete income tax charge recorded as a result of reduced tax benefits claimed in prior years in connection with the Company’s decision to make a $100 million voluntary pension contribution in October 2016.\nManagement believes that earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of the special items is helpful in analyzing the operating performance of the Company, as these costs are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s board of directors and others.\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, FREE CASH FLOW 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net cash provided from (used for) operating activities $ 24.7 $ (29.5 ) $ 17.3 $ (25.4 ) Purchases of property, equipment and software (26.8 ) (18.5 ) (55.7 ) (45.1 ) Dividends paid (8.6 ) (8.5 ) (17.2 ) (17.0 ) Free cash flow $ (10.7 ) $ (56.5 ) $ (55.6 ) $ (87.5 ) Management believes that the free cash flow measure provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it is a measure of cash generated which management evaluates for alternative uses.\nPRELIMINARY SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE (in millions) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, NET SALES BY END-USE MARKET 2017 2016 2017 2016 End-Use Market Excluding Surcharge: Aerospace and Defense $ 220.3 $ 199.0 $ 435.8 $ 372.5 Energy 28.9 27.1 57.8 52.8 Transportation 29.7 28.7 60.3 59.2 Medical 37.2 25.1 70.6 48.1 Industrial and Consumer 70.2 59.2 141.9 118.5 Distribution 29.2 27.6 58.9 55.5 Total net sales excluding surcharge 415.5 366.7 825.3 706.6 Surcharge 72.3 60.7 142.2 109.7 Total net sales $ 487.8 $ 427.4 $ 967.5 $ 816.3 Media Inquiries:\nWilliam J.
