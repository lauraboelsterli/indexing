    "text": "(Repeats to attach to additional alert)\nTOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Japan’s economy grew at an annualised rate of 0.5 percent in October-December, posting the eighth straight quarter of expansion due to growth in consumer spending and capital expenditure.\nThat marked the longest streak of growth since a 12-quarter stretch between April-June 1986 and January-March 1989 around the height of Japan’s economic bubble.\nThe preliminary reading for fourth-quarter gross domestic product compared with a median estimate of a 0.9 percent annualised increase in a Reuters poll of economists.\nIt followed a revised 2.2 percent annualised rate of expansion in the third quarter, the Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.\nOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 0.1 percent, slightly less than the median estimate for a 0.2 percent increase.\nFor more background, see this PREVIEW To view the full tables, go to the Cabinet Office's website: here (Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim)\n ",
