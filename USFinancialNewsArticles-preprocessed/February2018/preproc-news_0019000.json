    "text": "SAN DIEGO & EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Shareholder rights law firm Robbins Arroyo LLP is investigating whether certain officers and directors of Mattel, Inc. (NasdaqGS: MAT) breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders. Mattel designs, manufactures, and markets a range of toy products worldwide.\nView this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog: www.robbinsarroyo.com/mattel-inc-feb-2018\nMattel Accused of Participating in Illegal Channel Stuffing\nPurchasers of Mattel filed a securities class action complaint against the company's officers and directors for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 between October 20, 2016 and April 20, 2017. According to the complaint, Mattel deceived investors by engaging in the illegal practice of channel stuffing in order to artificially inflate revenue and conceal softening demand. Former Mattel employees stated that the impetus behind the scheme was the company's loss of the global rights to produce and sell toys based on the Disney Princess characters to its main competitor, Hasbroâ€”a loss that some analysts valued at $500 million annually. In carrying out its scheme, Mattel used promotions and discounts to over-supply its retailers with inventory in an effort to record as much revenue as possible during the 2016 holiday season. Even though Mattel knew that the retailers already had enough products and that much of them would need to be returned or steeply discounted, Mattel added inventory to its distribution channels to create a misleading impression of its financial health. On January 25, 2017, when Mattel finally admitted that worldwide net sales, gross margins, and operating income declined significantly due to elevated sales adjustments and heavier discounting, the company's stock plummeted and has continued to fall, closing at $17.00 per share on February 7, 2018.\nMattel Shareholders Have Legal Options\nConcerned shareholders who would like more information about their rights and potential remedies can contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law. The firm represents individual and institutional investors in shareholder derivative and securities class action lawsuits, and has helped its clients realize more than $1 billion of value for themselves and the companies in which they have invested.\nAttorney Advertising.
