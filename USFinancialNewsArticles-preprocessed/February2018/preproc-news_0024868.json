    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Third Seven Capital Advisors (\"TSCA\"), a privately held, national investment advisory firm, today announced that John Terrill of Synergy Advisors Group (Synergy) is the first advisor recruited to join the New York-based RIA firm. He officially joined TSCA on Friday February 9, 2018.\nSynergy, founded in 2010, manages more than $200 million in client assets (AUM). Terrill leads a five-person team in Oklahoma City.\n\"John represents everything we look for in an advisor,\" said Amit Dogra, President of TSCA. \"He immediately understood our differentiators of putting the investments back in investing as exciting, and our commitment to advisors over robos as refreshing.\"\nTerrill describes joining TSCA as giving him a competitive advantage. \"We help our clients by looking at the whole picture and using a total wealth management approach. We recognized early on that having access to TSCA's curated, direct investment platform in combination with its unique business consulting and growth program would accelerate the growth of my business.\"\nDogra also noted that TSCA's goal to attract $1 billion of new AUM in 2018 is well on track. \"Whether at a wirehouse, independent broker-dealer or an existing RIA, the TSCA platform appeals to all advisors who have never had access or desire more access to the 'shark tank' type of investment that excites both clients and advisors. Synergy is but the first signing. We look forward to adding more advisors aggressively in the near future,\" says Dogra.\nAbout Third Seven Capital Advisors\nThird Seven Capital Advisors is a privately held, national investment advisory firm, built with a client first culture.
