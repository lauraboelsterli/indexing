    "text": "\n— United Airlines (@united) February 24, 2018 \nThe Delta airfare discount, according to the NRA, ranged from 2% to 10%. Information about the discounts was still on the NRA convention website as of midmorning. \nGet CEO Daily , Fortune’s newsletter for leaders. \nDelta’s decision is particularly notable because the offer it is rescinding is part of a broader program available to meeting and convention organizers, which Delta previously defended as “a routine, publicly available pricing program . . . for group travel.” In other words, Delta is not simply canceling a special deal for NRA members. It is, in essence, blacklisting the NRA from a group discount available to most other major groups. \nDelta and United join a growing list of major companies rescinding discounts or other offers for NRA members. Public pressure, organized on social media under the hashtag #boycottnra, is part of a larger backlash following a school shooting that left 17 dead in Parkland, Florida. Companies that have said they will drop agreements with the NRA now include the insurer MetLife , several car rental agencies, and credit-card issuer First National Bank . \nCritics and activists argue that these discounts promote NRA membership, giving the organization more leverage to oppose even the moderate gun control policies, such as tougher background checks, that most Americans support .
