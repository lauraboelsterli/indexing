    "text": "February 26, 2018 / 2:02 AM / Updated 9 minutes ago Kuroda says no plan to conduct another review of BOJ's policy Reuters Staff 1 Min Read TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday he had no plan to conduct another comprehensive assessment of the central bank’s monetary policy. “Things are proceeding smoothly, so I don’t have any plan at this stage to conduct another comprehensive review,” Kuroda told parliament, pointing to a steady recovery in the economy. Kuroda made the remark when asked by a lawmaker whether the BOJ would conduct an assessment of why its policy had failed to accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target. He reiterated the BOJ’s resolve to maintain its massive monetary stimulus with inflation distant from its target. The BOJ revamped its policy framework to one targeting interest rates from the pace of money printing in 2016, after three years of heavy asset buying failed to fire up inflation.
