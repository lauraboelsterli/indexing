Full year 2017 GAAP revenue for the company increased 3 percent to $5.70 billion versus last year, with 5 percent growth in the Payments segment and 2 percent growth in the Financial segment.

GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in 2017 included discrete tax benefits from the December 2017 enactment of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $1.30 per share and $1.28 per share in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations also included net investment gains of $0.09 per share and $0.39 per share in 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the disposition of a business and a business interest at StoneRiver Group, L.P. (\"StoneRiver\"), a joint venture in which the company owns a 49 percent interest.\nGAAP operating margin was 28.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 26.9 percent for the full year, increasing 200 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.48 billion in 2017 compared with $1.43 billion in the prior year, an increase of 4 percent.

In December 2017, we executed a definitive agreement to sell the retail voucher business acquired as part of the Monitise acquisition for £37 million. The sale was completed on January 10, 2018. In early 2018, we were named one of FORTUNE Magazine World's Most Admired Companies ® for the fifth consecutive year. The company received high category marks in innovation, use of corporate assets and long-term investment value.\nSale of Majority Share of Lending Solutions Business\nToday we announced a definitive agreement to sell the majority share of our Lending Solutions business to Warburg Pincus LLC (\"Lending Transaction\").

The company also expects adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6.05 to $6.30 which represents growth of 22 to 27 percent over 2017 as adjusted for the Lending Transaction which is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2018.\n\"We expect accelerated internal revenue growth in 2018 resulting primarily from continuing growth in high-value solutions,\" said Yabuki. \"In addition, we intend to invest a portion of the tax rate benefit which we believe will enhance our future performance.\"\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe company will discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on a conference call and webcast at 4 p.m. CT on Wednesday, February 7, 2018.

For more information, visit Fiserv.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this earnings release, the company supplements its reporting of information determined in accordance with GAAP, such as revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities, with \"adjusted revenue,\" \"internal revenue growth,\" \"adjusted operating income,\" \"adjusted operating margin,\" \"adjusted net income,\" \"adjusted earnings per share,\" \"adjusted earnings per share, excluding the Lending Transaction\" and \"free cash flow.\" Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses should enhance shareholders' ability to evaluate the company's performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Therefore, the company excludes these items from GAAP revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities to calculate these non-GAAP measures. The corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this earnings release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the non-cash and other items described below that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures. See page 12 for additional information regarding the company's forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.\nExamples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, gains or losses from dispositions and unconsolidated affiliates, severance costs, merger and integration costs, certain costs associated with the achievement of the company's operational effectiveness objectives, and certain discrete tax benefits. The company excludes these items to more clearly focus on the factors management believes are pertinent to its operations, and management uses this information to make operating decisions, including the allocation of resources to the company's various businesses.\nInternal revenue growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and are described on page 11. Management believes internal revenue growth is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of postage reimbursements in the company's Output Solutions business, and including deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. Management believes free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions. Management believes this supplemental information enhances shareholders' ability to evaluate and understand the company's core business performance.\nThese non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding anticipated internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share growth.

Non-cash or other items may be significant and include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, gains or losses from dispositions and unconsolidated affiliates, severance costs, merger and integration costs, certain costs associated with the achievement of the company's operational effectiveness objectives, and certain discrete tax benefits. The company estimates that the amortization expense with respect to acquired intangible assets as of December 31, 2017 will be approximately $160 million in 2018. Other adjustments to earnings per share that have been incurred in 2017 are presented on page 7. Estimates of these other adjustments on a forward-looking basis are not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of these items.\nThe following table presents 2017 results excluding the company's sale of a 55 percent interest of its Lending Solutions business which is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2018.\n2017 adjusted earnings per share 1 $ 5.12 Estimated impact of the Lending Transaction (0.16 ) 2017 adjusted earnings per share, excluding the Lending Transaction $ 4.96 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook $6.05 - $6.30 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth outlook 22% - 27% 1 See page 7 for a reconciliation of GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to adjusted earnings per share.\nSee page 3 for disclosures related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nFISV-E\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006140/en/\nMedia Relations:\nBritt Zarling\nVice President, Corporate Communications\nFiserv, Inc.\n678-375-1595\nbritt.zarling@fiserv.com\nor\nInvestor Relations:\nPaul Seamon\nVice President, Investor Relations\nFiserv, Inc.\n262-879-5727\npaul.seamon@fiserv.com\nSource: Fiserv, Inc.",
