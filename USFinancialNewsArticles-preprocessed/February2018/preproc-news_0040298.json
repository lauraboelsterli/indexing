    "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said on Thursday there would be more talks on restoring devolved government in Northern Ireland, but the timing was uncertain.\nTalks to end a year-long stalemate broke down yet again on Wednesday after the leader of the largest unionist party said there was no prospect of a deal and called on Britain to take further financial control of the region.\n“Will there be more talks? Absolutely. When, I cannot be sure”, McDonald told reporters.\nReporting by Graham Fahy; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ",
