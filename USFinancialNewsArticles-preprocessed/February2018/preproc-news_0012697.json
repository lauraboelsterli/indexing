    "text": "Published: Feb 7, 2018 6:59 a.m. ET Share \nThe U.S. military doesn’t have a history of holding military parades. Parades are expensive and impractical, say critics inside the Pentagon Getty Images President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, joined French President Emmanuel Macron for the Bastille Day parade in Paris. The last major U.S. military parade was in 1991 at the end of the Gulf War. There was a parade a few months after the end of World War II. \nBy Julie Bykowicz \nWASHINGTON—The U.S. Department of Defense is planning a military parade at the request of President Donald Trump, White House and Pentagon officials said Tuesday. \nAfter observing the Bastille Day celebrations in Paris last year, Trump said he wanted to hold a similar parade on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, perhaps to celebrate the Fourth of July. \nThe French parade last July, which also marked the centennial of the U.S. entry into World War I, featured more than 6,000 service members, tanks and planes overhead in an elaborate display of military might. French President Emmanuel Macron invited Trump to watch the parade beside him. \n“It was one of the greatest parades I’ve ever seen,” Trump said in September at the Lotte New York Palace hotel. “And to a large extent, because of what I witnessed, we may do something like that on July Fourth in Washington, down Pennsylvania Avenue. I don’t know. We’re going to have to try and top it.” \n“President Trump is incredibly supportive of America’s great service members who risk their lives every day to keep our country safe,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. “He has asked the Department of Defense to explore a celebration at which all Americans can show their appreciation.” \nThe U.S. military doesn’t have a history of holding military parades. Parades are expensive and impractical, critics inside the Pentagon said. They demand the movement of equipment and weaponry that are rarely kept at a parade site. Moreover, a parade would require participating troops to train for months. ",
