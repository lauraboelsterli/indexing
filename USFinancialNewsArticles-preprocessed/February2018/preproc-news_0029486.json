    "text": "LOWELL, Mass., Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CSPi (NASDAQ:CSPI), a provider of IT managed services, security solutions and packet capture products, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company also announced that its board of directors has voted to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share to shareholders of record February 28, 2018, payable on March 16, 2018.\nManagement Comments\n“Our strong first quarter performance can be attributed to the ongoing execution of our growth strategy,” said Chief Executive Officer, Victor Dellovo. “We outperformed expectations with increased sales in both our High Performance Products and Technology Solutions divisions in what we expected would be a relatively soft first half of the year due to timing issues. Revenues were up 10.5% for the first quarter, primarily driven by sales growth at our U.K. Technology Solutions business. We reported generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) loss per share of $0.32 in Q1 2018 versus a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. Excluding the effect of the new tax legislation, we reported non-GAAP loss per share of $0.02.”\n“In our High Performance Products division, we received royalty revenues equivalent to one E-2D plane. We are receiving orders for royalties for miscellaneous projects within the E-2D program and continue to anticipate sales for the E-2D foreign military program, with the bulk of those orders in the second half of our fiscal 2018.”\n“During the quarter, we begin shipping Myricom® nVoy Series, which is part of our next-generation of cybersecurity products. Our Myricom® nVoy Series is now generally available to the market. The nVoy solution assists organizations in meeting data privacy regulations by notifying security resources of a verified data breach while also identifying the exact records or files that may have been compromised. Market interest continues to grow for our recently announced software security solution, ARIA™ Software Defined Security, and it has received two industry awards for best product. We are on track to realize revenues from our next generation security products in the latter part of 2018 and remain excited by our potential in the cybersecurity market.”\n“In Technology Solutions, we continue to see increased demand for our managed services, particularly in wireless security in the U.S. and Germany geographies where data privacy concerns are growing. Across the board, we gained, renewed or grew Technology Solutions customer accounts.”\n“We’re excited with the forward momentum we are experiencing as a result of our focus on growing our managed services business while also developing solutions to capitalize on the steady demand for cyber security products and the proliferation of wireless. We have a solid team in place and are successfully driving our transformation. We look forward to a positive fiscal 2018 as we expand our technology services and solutions to meet market needs,” concluded Dellovo.\nFinancial Results\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue increased to $22 million from $19.9 million in the first quarter a year ago.\nGross profit for the quarter increased 15.3% to $5.1 million, or 23.3% of sales, from $4.5 million, or 22.4% of sales, a year ago. Net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.2 million, or $0.32 per share. The new tax legislation enacted in December resulted in a one-time charge of $1.1 million, or $0.30 per share, during the first quarter. The charge includes $490,000 for the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as the Company’s tax rate was reduced from 34% to 21%, and $649,000 for the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings that will be paid over the next eight years.\nExcluding the tax impact, non-GAAP net loss and EPS would have been $61,000 and $0.02 per share, respectively, for Q1 fiscal 2018 compared with a net loss of $43,000, or $0.01 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nCash and short-term investments increased to $18.2 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $13.9 million at 2017 fiscal year end primarily as a result of collections of accounts receivable.\nReconciliations of Net Income - GAAP to Non-GAAP\n(Unaudited)\nTo help understand the Company’s financial performance, the Company has supplemented its financial results that it provides in accordance with GAAP with non-GAAP financial measures to show the results without the effects of the recently enacted U.S. Tax legislation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConsolidated Three Months Ended (In thousands) December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016\nNet loss (GAAP) (2) $ (1,200 ) $ (43 ) Income tax expense for the Tax Act(1) (2) (1,139 ) -- Net loss before income tax from Tax Act (non-GAAP) (1) $ (61 ) $ (43 ) Net loss per share before income tax from the Tax Act –basic (non-GAAP) (2) $ (.02 ) $ (.01) ) Weighted average shares outstanding -basic 3,768 3,671 On December 22, 2017, the U.

Such forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to anticipate sales for the E-2D foreign military program, with the bulk of those orders in the second half of our fiscal 2018. The Company cautions that numerous factors could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made by the Company. Such risks include general economic conditions, market factors, competitive factors and pricing pressures, and others described in the Company's filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section on forward-looking statements included in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company presented certain adjusted financial information in this news release, including non-GAAP net income and earnings per share. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of the new tax legislation. The financial table above reconciles non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The Company believes that the use of non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of the new tax legislation help investors better understand the Company’s core operating results and facilitates the comparison of results across reporting periods and with other companies. Non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company’s GAAP results and may be different than adjusted measures used by other companies.\nCSP INC.
