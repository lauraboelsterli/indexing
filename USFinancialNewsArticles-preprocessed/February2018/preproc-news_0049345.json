    "text": "GLENDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $334.1 million or $1.92 per diluted common share, compared to $352.8 million or $2.03 in 2016 representing a decrease of $18.7 million or $0.11. The decrease primarily reflects (i) a $29.2 million reduction due to the impact of foreign exchange translation gains and losses associated with our euro denominated debt and (ii) a $7.2 million increase in interest expense associated with higher outstanding debt balances offset partially by (iii) a $13.8 million increase in self-storage net operating income (described below).\nThe $13.8 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $8.7 million increase in our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) and a $5.1 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 2.1% or $11.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 2.6% or $2.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased property manager payroll and repairs and maintenance costs, offset partially by reduced advertising and selling costs. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 345 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since January 2015.\nOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nIn 2017, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1,171.6 million or $6.73 per diluted common share, compared to $1,183.9 million or $6.81 per share in 2016 representing a decrease of $12.3 million or $0.08. The decrease primarily reflects (i) a $67.6 million reduction due to the impact of foreign exchange translation gains and losses associated with our euro denominated debt, (ii) an $8.5 million increase in interest expense associated with higher outstanding debt balances and (iii) a $7.8 million casualty loss and $5.2 million in incremental tenant reinsurance losses related to Hurricane Harvey and Irma offset partially by (iv) a $66.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income (described below) and (v) an $18.9 million increase in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities.\nThe $66.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $44.6 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $22.3 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 3.0% or $63.0 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 3.4% or $18.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased property taxes, advertising and selling expense and repairs and maintenance costs, offset partially by lower snow removal costs. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 345 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since January 2015.\nFunds from Operations\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, funds from operations (“FFO”) was $2.70 per diluted common share, as compared to $2.77 in 2016, representing a decrease of 2.5%. FFO is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation, gains and losses and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, FFO was flat at $9.70 per diluted common share.\nWe also present “Core FFO per share,” a non-GAAP measure that represents FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) EITF D-42 charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, (iii) reversals of accruals with respect to share based awards forfeited by executive officers and (iv) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items. We review Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe it is used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO per share is not a substitute for net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.\nThe following table reconciles from FFO per share to Core FFO per share (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Percentage Percentage 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change FFO per share $ 2.70 $ 2.77 (2.5 )% $ 9.70 $ 9.70 0.0 % Eliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investments:\nForeign currency exchange loss (gain), net\n0.03 (0.14 ) 0.29 (0.11 ) Application of EITF D-42 0.01 0.02 0.19 0.17 Casualty losses and tenant claims due to hurricanes\n- - 0.07 - Reversals of accruals on forfeited executive share-based awards\n- - (0.03 ) - Other items 0.01 - 0.01 0.03 Core FFO per share $ 2.75 $ 2.65 3.8 % $ 10.23 $ 9.79 4.5 % Property Operations – Same Store Facilities\nThe Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues and cost of operations since January 1, 2015. We review the operations of our Same Store Facilities, which excludes facilities whose operating trends are significantly affected by factors such as casualty events, as well as recently developed or acquired facilities, to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2015, 2016 and 2017. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,042 facilities (130.3 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 82% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2017.\nSelected Operating Data for the Same Store Facilities (2,042 facilities) (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Percentage Percentage 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change (Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per square foot amounts) Revenues: Rental income $ 527,011 $ 515,653 2.2 % $ 2,098,780 $ 2,035,701 3.1 % Late charges and administrative fees 24,719 24,494 0.9 % 97,593 97,655 (0.1 )% Total revenues (a) 551,730 540,147 2.1 % 2,196,373 2,133,356 3.0 % Cost of operations: Property taxes 31,665 31,113 1.8 % 199,628 191,912 4.0 % On-site property manager payroll 24,707 23,438 5.4 % 107,535 106,460 1.0 % Supervisory payroll 8,542 8,580 (0.4 )% 38,041 36,966 2.9 % Repairs and maintenance 11,122 10,260 8.4 % 43,233 39,943 8.2 % Snow removal 812 866 (6.2 )% 3,061 4,235 (27.7 )% Utilities 9,162 9,158 0.0 % 39,135 39,424 (0.7 )% Advertising and selling expense 6,749 7,266 (7.1 )% 28,443 25,824 10.1 % Other direct property costs 14,435 14,099 2.4 % 57,853 55,797 3.7 % Allocated overhead 9,874 9,374 5.3 % 42,010 39,963 5.1 % Total cost of operations (a) 117,068 114,154 2.6 % 558,939 540,524 3.4 % Net operating income (b) $ 434,662 $ 425,993 2.0 % $ 1,637,434 $ 1,592,832 2.8 % Gross margin 78.8 % 78.9 % (0.1 )% 74.6 % 74.7 % (0.1 )% Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 93.1 % 93.8 % (0.7 )% 93.8 % 94.5 % (0.7 )% Realized annual rental income per (c): Occupied square foot $ 17.40 $ 16.89 3.0 % $ 17.19 $ 16.54 3.9 % Available square foot (“REVPAF”) $ 16.18 $ 15.83 2.2 % $ 16.11 $ 15.63 3.1 % At December 31: Square foot occupancy 91.2 % 92.5 % (1.4 )% Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (d)\n$ 17.97 $ 17.44 3.0 % (a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales. (b) See attached reconciliation of self-storage net operating income (“NOI”) to operating income. (c) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income. (d) Contract rent represents the applicable contractual monthly rent charged to our tenants, excluding the impact of promotional discounts, late charges and administrative fees.

Investing and Capital Markets Activities\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, we acquired eight self-storage facilities (six in Texas and one each in Alabama and Kentucky) with 0.5 million net rentable square feet for $68.1 million. During 2017, we acquired 22 self-storage facilities (six in Texas, three in Ohio, two each in Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina and South Carolina and one each in Alabama, Minnesota and New York) with 1.4 million net rentable square feet for $149.8 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we acquired or were under contract to acquire two self-storage facilities (one each in Nebraska and Tennessee) with 0.2 million net rentable square feet for $18 million.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, we completed four newly developed facilities and various expansion projects (0.6 million net rentable square feet) costing $56 million. During 2017, we completed 16 newly developed facilities and various expansion projects (2.7 million net rentable square feet) costing an aggregate of $312 million. At December 31, 2017, we had various facilities in development (2.7 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $367 million and various expansion projects (1.9 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $247 million. The remaining $350 million of development costs for these projects is expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 months.\nOn December 31, 2017, we acquired the 74.25% interest we did not own in 12 stabilized self-storage facilities (three in California, two in Minnesota, Nevada and New York, and one each in New Jersey, Ohio and Virginia) with 0.7 million net rentable square feet for $135.5 million in cash. Our existing 25.75% interest in the earnings of the legacy institutional partnership that owned these properties, and that we managed, was reflected as Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Entities. We commenced consolidating these properties effective December 31, 2017.\nDuring 2017, we raised $1,580.0 million in gross proceeds from public offerings comprised of a) two series of Preferred Shares for $580.0 million in gross proceeds with an average coupon rate of 5.1% and b) a public offering of senior notes, comprised of $500 million maturing in five years at a 2.370% coupon rate and $500 million maturing in ten years at a 3.094% coupon rate. During 2017, we redeemed two series of Preferred Shares with an average coupon rate of 5.8% at par for $922.5 million.\nDistributions Declared\nOn February 20, 2018, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 14, 2018.\nFourth Quarter Conference Call\nA conference call is scheduled for February 21, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. (PST) to discuss the fourth quarter earnings results.

FFO represents net income before real estate depreciation, gains or losses and impairment charges, which are excluded because they are based upon historical real estate costs and assume that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FAD represents FFO adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and to deduct capital expenditures. We utilize FAD in evaluating our ongoing cash flow available for investment, debt repayment, and common distributions. We believe investors and analysts utilize FAD in a similar manner. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO and FAD are not substitutes for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because they exclude investing and financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.

We utilize NOI in determining current property values, evaluating property performance, and in evaluating operating trends. We believe that investors and analysts utilize NOI in a similar manner. NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results.
