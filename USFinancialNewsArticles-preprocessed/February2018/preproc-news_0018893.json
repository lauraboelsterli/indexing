    "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations on Friday described the details of a Reuters investigation into the killing of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar as “alarming” and said it showed the need for a thorough probe into the violence in the country’s Rakhine state.\n“We’re aware of this latest report, the details of which are very alarming. This once more attests to the need for a full and thorough investigation by the authorities of all violence in Rakhine State and attacks on the various communities there,” U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for the release of the two detained journalists and continues to press for that, Haq said.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols, Editing by Franklin Paul\n ",
