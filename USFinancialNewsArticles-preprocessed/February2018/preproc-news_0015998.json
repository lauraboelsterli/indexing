(NASDAQ:SITO) (hereinafter “SITO” or the “Company”), an insights-driven Consumer Behavior and Location Sciences™ company, announced today that the Company’s media placement revenue increased by $7.4 million, or 101%, to $14.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to media placement revenues of $7.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The Company’s media placement revenue increased by $13.9 million, or 48%, to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to total revenues of $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company is providing the following guidance with respect to expenses. Please note, however, that the audit of the Company’s financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 is not yet complete, and such guidance is subject to adjustment based on the results of such audit:\nAs discussed on our earnings call on November 14, 2017, the Company’s total cost of revenue, which represents the costs associated with media placement revenues, is expected to increase to between $7.8 million and $8.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and to between $22.2 million and $22.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to total cost of revenue of approximately $3.7 million and approximately $13.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Cost of revenue has increased faster than media placement revenue primarily as a result of a change in our advertising mix.\nSales and marketing expense is expected to increase to between $3.9 million and $4.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and to between $14.5 million and $14.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to sales and marketing expense of approximately $2.8 million and approximately $10.4 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expense is expected to increase to between $5.9 million and $6.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and to between $16.0 million and $16.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to general and administrative expense of approximately $1.8 million and approximately $6.1 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Included within general and administrative expenses during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 is a $2.2 million charge relating to the accrual of bonuses earned by the Company’s executive management team under their respective employment agreements with the Company, in connection with the achievement of certain performance-based targets, as disclosed in the Company’s Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 24, 2017. Management has agreed to take 75% of this bonus in equity. In addition, there were additional non-recurring items that impacted our G&A that will be detailed when we release our full year earnings.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $3.6 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $8.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nAlthough the audit of the Company’s financial position and results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 is not yet final, the preliminary, unaudited financial information announced above reflects the Company’s preliminary expectations with respect to its revenues and expenses described above based on information currently available to management.\nThe preliminary financial results presented above reflect management’s estimates based solely upon information available to the Company’s management as of the date of this announcement.\nThe preliminary financial results presented above are not, and shall not be deemed to constitute, a comprehensive statement of the Company’s financial results for fiscal year 2017.
