    "text": "0 COMMENTS The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday issued new guidelines on cybersecurity disclosures for public companies, including suggestions for adjusting insider trading policies to account for investigations into cyberbreaches.\nThe SEC reiterated that cyberrisks and incidents may fall under the scope of material nonpublic information, and corporate insiders could run afoul of the law by trading company securities while in possession of such information. The guidelines also encourage companies to adopt prophylactic measures such as restricting employee trading while a breach investigation is under way and before it is disclosed.\n“Companies are going to need to examine their policies and procedures to ensure they explicitly account for information related to cybersecurity risks and incidents, including while they’re under investigation,” said John Carlin, partner at law firm Morrison & Foerster LLP.\nThe SEC said companies should develop plans to elevate alerts about cyber incidents so that top management knows when to avoid trading.\nThe regulator also called for greater clarity and more detailed information around cyberrisks and breaches and discouraged companies from delaying disclosure due to a continuing investigation.\nThe new rules are unlikely to prompt companies to disclose a breach to investors before it becomes public through other channels, such as state reporting requirements or media reports.\n“They’re a step in the right direction, but that will be the test,” Mr. Carlin said.\nThe overall guidance provides “only modest changes” to the SEC’s previous efforts in this field, issued in 2011, according to a statement from Commissioner Kara Stein.\n“There is so much more we can and should do,” Ms. Stein said, adding that the SEC should consider rule making rather than guidelines.\nCommissioner Robert Jackson Jr., another Democratic member of the SEC, said he “reluctantly” supported the guidance because it “essentially reiterates years-old” guidelines from the SEC staff.\nMr. Jackson cited a report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers last week that echoed concerns that the SEC’s “disclosure requirements are too general and do not provide clear instructions on how much information to disclose.”\n—Dave Michaels contributed to this article\nWrite to Tatyana Shumsky at tatyana.shumsky@wsj.com",
