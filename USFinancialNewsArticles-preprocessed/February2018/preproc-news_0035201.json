    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - A battle for control of Russia’s Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel) resurfaced on Friday as billionaires Vladimir Potanin and Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich made counter offers for each others shares.\nPotanin made an offer to purchase a minority stake in Nornickel from Abramovich and his partners, Interros holding, which manages Potanin’s assets, told Reuters.\nMeanwhile Potanin received a counter offer from Abramovich and partners, in line with a Nornickel shareholder agreement, Interros added. Interros did not disclose the size of the stakes involved in the offers.\nAbramovich and his partners hold 4.2 percent in Nornickel, while Potanin, also Nornickel chief executive since 2015, is already the largest shareholder in Nornickel with a stake of 30.4 percent.\nHowever the matter was further complicated as another Nornickel shareholder, aluminum producer Rusal, controlled by Oleg Deripaska, is seeking an injunction in a London court to block the possible deals, Interros said.\nInterros said it believes Rusal’s claim against the possible deals is unjustified. Rusal holds a stake of 27.8 percent in Nornickel.\nRusal declined to comment until after its application hearing, expected on Friday at 1130 GMT. A representative of Abramovich and Nornickel declined to comment.\nThese moves by Nornickel’s shareholders are the latest in a series of previous conflicts for control over the $33 billion mining company, which competes with Brazil’s Vale SA for the rank of the world’s top nickel producer. It is also the world’s largest palladium producer.\nNornickel shares were down 2.8 percent in Moscow on Friday, underperforming in a flat MICEX index.\nReporting by Polina Devitt; Editing by David Holmes\n ",
