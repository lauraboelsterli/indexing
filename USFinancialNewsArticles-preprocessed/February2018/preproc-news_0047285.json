    "text": "GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) — DineEquity, the owner of the Applebee's and IHOP restaurant chains, reported that its fourth-quarter profit soared as it benefited from the recently-changed tax law that slashed corporate tax rates.\nThe company also announced Tuesday that it would officially change its name to Dine Brands Global Inc. later this week.\nDineEquity reported fourth-quarter net income of $85.5 million, or $4.67 per share, in the last three months of 2017, up from $21.3 million, or $1.18 per share, in the same period the year before. The company said much of that increase was due to a $66.6 million tax benefit.\nAdjusted earnings came 74 cents per share, the Glendale, California-based company said. That beat the average analyst estimate of 69 cents per share, according to FactSet.\nRevenue slipped 3.5 percent to $148.8 million in the period but still topped the consensus estimate of $148 million.\nSales at domestic locations open at least a year — a key metric of a retailer's health — rose 1.3 percent at Applebee's but slipped 0.4 percent at IHOP.\nThe company said its board approved a dividend of 63 cents per share for the first quarter, down from 97 cents the prior quarter. The new dividend is payable April 6 to shareholders of record March 19.\nFor the year, the company swung to a loss of $330.5 million, or $18.28 per share. Revenue was reported as $604.8 million.\nDineEquity expects full-year 2018 earnings in the range of $4.95 to $5.25 per share, ahead of the FactSet estimate of $4.56 per share.\nShares of DineEquity Inc. soared $12.19, or 22 percent, to $66.86 in midday trading Tuesday.\nElements of this story were generated by Automated Insights ( http://automatedinsights.com/ap ) using data from Zacks Investment Research.
