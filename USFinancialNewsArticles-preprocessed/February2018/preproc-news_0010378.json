    "text": "Feb 5 (Reuters) - Welcome to the home for real time coverage of European equity markets brought to you by Reuters stocks reporters and anchored today by Helen Reid. Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net MORNING CALL: SELL-OFF TO SPREAD TO EUROPE (0618 GMT) Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. European stocks are in for a turbulent start to the week after a sharp sell-off in Asian shares overnight, with fears of resurgent inflation taking their toll on markets near record high levels. Asian shares fell the most in more than a year, tracking a much weaker Wall Street session after Friday's U.S. payrolls report showed wages growing at their fastest pace in more than 8 years. Spreadbetters call the DAX 153 points lower at 12,632.4, the CAC 40 down 64 points at 5,300.7, and the FTSE down 79 points at 7,364. (Helen Reid)",
