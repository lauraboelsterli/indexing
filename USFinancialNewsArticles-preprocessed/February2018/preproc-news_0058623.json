The Company has also published a supplemental to this earnings release which is available at www.istar.com in the \"Investors\" section.\n\"2017 was a strong year for iStar. Our accomplishments include successfully delivering significant earnings, executing $2 billion of transformative capital markets transactions that resulted in upgrades by all three credit rating agencies and launching a new publicly traded company focused on reinventing the ground lease business,\" said Jay Sugarman, iStar's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our focus now is growing our investment pace and our share price and we have taken several steps to accelerate our momentum in 2018.\"\nNet income (loss) for fiscal year and fourth quarter 2017 was $110.9 million, or $1.56 per diluted common share and $(4.9) million, or $(0.07) per diluted common share, respectively.\nAdjusted income for fiscal year and fourth quarter 2017 was $214.6 million, or $2.57 per diluted common share, and $31.5 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, respectively.\nHired new Chief Investment Officer, Marcos Alvarado, former Head of Acquisitions & Business Operations at Cadre and former Managing Director at Starwood Capital.\nIncreased new loan originations to $457 million during the quarter.\nRealized $360 million of proceeds from legacy assets in 2017, goal to outpace this amount in 2018.\nWorking with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to review strategic options for longer-term legacy asset portfolio.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\niStar reported net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of $(4.9) million, or $(0.07) per diluted common share, versus $(19.3) million, or $(0.27) per diluted common share for the fourth quarter 2016.\nAdjusted income allocable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter was $31.5 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, versus $2.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter 2016.\nAdjusted income represents net income computed in accordance with GAAP, prior to the effects of certain non-cash items. The calculation of adjusted income and reconciliation to GAAP net income are presented in the financial tables that follow the text of this press release.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nFor the full year 2017, net income allocable to common shareholders was $110.9 million, or $1.56 per diluted common share, versus $44.0 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share for the full year 2016.\nAdjusted income allocable to common shareholders for the full year was $214.6 million, or $2.57 per diluted common share, versus $112.6 million, or $1.15 per diluted common share for the prior year.\nNew Accounting Standards Impact on 2018 Results\nOn January 1, 2018, new accounting standards related to partial sales of non-financial assets became effective. The Company will adopt this standard using the modified retrospective approach, in which it will record a cumulative adjustment to equity on January 1, 2018 in lieu of recasting prior financial periods. Specifically, the Company expects to record an incremental gain to beginning balance of GAAP book equity of approximately $76 million, or approximately $1.10 per basic common share, in the first quarter. The adjustment relates to previously unrecognized gains from prior asset sales, including the sale of the Company's ground lease assets to Safety, Income & Growth in 2017. The Company will reflect these cumulative gains in its adjusted income metrics for the first quarter of 2018.\nExecutive Team Update\niStar announced that it has hired Marcos Alvarado as its Chief Investment Officer and a member of its senior executive team. Mr. Alvarado has closed more than $25 billion of investments across all parts of the capital structure and will leverage his extensive experience to help the Company identify opportunities and grow its core businesses. Mr. Alvarado was previously Head of Acquisitions & Business Operations for Cadre and a Managing Director at Starwood Capital.\n\"Marcos brings top tier real estate investment experience to our company and offers a unique perspective for iStar's creative strategies,\" said Sugarman. \"In the short time he's been with the team, he has already made important contributions to our unique platform. In addition, I am happy to announce that we have appointed Nina Matis as Vice Chairman in addition to her responsibilities as Chief Legal Officer.\"\nPortfolio Overview and Investment Activity\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's portfolio totaled $4.9 billion, which is gross of $356 million of accumulated depreciation and $18 million of general loan loss reserves and includes $120 million market value of SAFE shares as of December 31, 2017 versus carrying value of $84 million.\niStar's portfolio includes its core businesses of real estate finance, net lease, and SAFE as well as non-core businesses of operating properties and land & development.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company invested a total of $504 million in new investments, prior financing commitments and ongoing development across its four segments, and generated $335 million of proceeds from repayments and sales.\nReal Estate Finance\niStar's real estate finance business targets sophisticated and innovative investors by providing one-stop capabilities that encompass financial alternatives ranging from full envelope senior loans to custom-tailored mezzanine and preferred equity capital positions.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's real estate finance portfolio totaled $1.3 billion. The portfolio is categorized into iStar 3.0 loans, made post January 1, 2008, and legacy loans, which were all made prior to December 31, 2007.\nDuring the quarter, the Company closed on $457 million of loan originations and funded $405 million associated with these deals and prior financing commitments.\nReal Estate Finance Statistics\n$ in millions\niStar 3.0\nLegacy Loans\nGross book value\n$\n1,121\n$\n197\n% of total loan portfolio\n85%\n15%\nPerforming loans\n$\n1,121\n$\n20\nNon-performing loans\n$\nâ€”\n$\n177\n% Performing / Non-performing\n100% / 0%\n10% / 90%\nFirst mortgages / senior loans\n71%\n27%\nMezzanine / subordinated debt\n29%\n73%\nTotal\n100%\n100%\nWtd. avg.

The Company targets mission-critical facilities leased on a long-term basis to tenants, offering structured solutions that combine iStar's capabilities in underwriting, lease structuring, asset management, and build-to-suit construction.\nAt the end of the quarter, the book value of iStar's net lease portfolio totaled $1.3 billion, gross of $292 million of accumulated depreciation. The portfolio was comprised of $1.1 billion of wholly-owned assets, a $121 million equity investment in its net lease joint venture and $120 million market value in shares of SAFE.\nSince 2014, the Company has invested in new net lease investments primarily through its net lease joint venture with a sovereign wealth fund, in which it holds a 52% interest. At the end of the quarter, the venture's balance sheet, gross of $48 million of accumulated depreciation, included $691 million of assets, $406 million of liabilities and $224 million of equity (net of a $13 million non-controlling interest). The investment period for the fund expires on March 31, 2018.\nDuring the quarter, the Company sold an office property with a remaining lease term approaching five years in Sunnyvale, CA for $100 million and generated a $62.5 million gain. In addition, the Company recorded a $5.3 million impairment on one net lease asset based on a change in business plan.\nSafety, Income & Growth Inc. (NYSE: SAFE)\niStar is the founder, largest shareholder and manager of Safety, Income & Growth Inc. (NYSE: SAFE), the first and only publicly traded company to focus on ground leases. Ground leases provide a unique mix of principal safety, growing dividends and the potential for significant capital appreciation. iStar held 6.8 million shares, or 37.6% of the shares outstanding, at the end of the year. During the fourth quarter, the Company purchased 0.5 million shares of SAFE for $9.6 million. Subsequent to the end of the year, iStar purchased an additional 0.4 million shares for $7.6 million, bringing its ownership up to 39.9% of shares outstanding.\nSAFE is seeking to reinvent how ground leases are utilized in the $7 trillion institutional commercial real estate market. These efforts are beginning to gain traction, as SAFE has recently closed on two transactions that demonstrate how SAFE Ground Leases TM can be a better way for real estate investors, developers and acquirers to capitalize their projects. As of its most recent report, SAFE's pipeline stood at nearly $1 billion, including $72 million of deals under LOI.\nOperating Properties\nAt the end of the quarter, iStar's operating property portfolio totaled $629 million, gross of $55 million of accumulated depreciation, and was comprised of $580 million of commercial and $49 million of residential real estate properties.\nThe Company's commercial operating properties represent a diverse pool of assets across a broad range of geographies and collateral types including office, entertainment and hotel properties. These properties generated $25.4 million of revenue offset by $21.1 million of operating expenses during the quarter.\nLand & Development\nAt the end of the quarter, the Company's land & development portfolio totaled $933 million, including 8 master planned communities, 6 waterfront projects and 14 urban/infill developments. These projects are collectively entitled for approximately 12,500 lots and units.\nFor the quarter, the Company's land and development portfolio generated $18.2 million of revenues, offset by $15.0 million of cost of sales. In addition, the Company recorded a loss of $1.1 million from land development equity method investments. During the quarter, the Company invested $40.3 million in its land portfolio.\nDuring the quarter, the Company recorded a $10.5 million impairment associated with its Coney Island amphitheater. The impairment is related to the slower than expected ramp up of revenues at the amphitheater and restaurant.\nCapital Markets and Balance Sheet\nAs previously reported, iStar executed a comprehensive series of capital markets transactions during the third quarter of 2017 which enhanced the Company's overall financial position, extended its debt maturity profile, lowered its cost of capital and resulted in upgrades from all three credit rating agencies. Near the end of the third quarter, the Company issued three series of notes totaling $1.09 billion. Proceeds from the issuances, together with cash on hand, were used to repay $1.15 billion of notes and $240 million of preferred stock at the beginning of the fourth quarter. As a result, the Company recorded a $9.0 million one-time prepayment penalty on the early redemption of these notes in the quarter.\nSubsequent to the end of the year, the Company purchased approximately 0.7 million shares of STAR under its 10b5-1 share repurchase program for $7.1 million. Following these purchases, the Company had $42.9 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.\nCapital Structure\n$ in millions\nAt December 31, 2017\nSecured debt\n$924\nUnsecured debt\n2,552\nTotal debt\n$3,476\nPreferred equity (A) (1)\n$505\nCommon equity (B)\n375\nTotal equity\n$880\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\nand general loan loss reserves (C) (2)\n$435\nAdjusted common equity (B) + (C)\n$810\nAdjusted total equity (A) + (B) + (C)\n$1,315\n(1) Represents aggregate liquidation preference.\n(2) Accumulated depreciation and amortization includes iStar's proportionate share of\naccumulated depreciation and amortization relating to equity method investments.\nThe Company seeks to match funds its balance sheet to help insulate from the impact of rising interest rates. At the end of the year, the Company had $789 million of floating rate loans and $499 million of floating rate debt, net of repaying its revolving credit facility. As a result, a 25 basis point increase in LIBOR would result in an approximately $1 million increase to full year net income.\nLeverage\nThe Company's weighted average cost of debt for the fourth quarter was 5.1%. The Company's leverage was 2.1x on an actual basis at the end of the quarter, on the low end of the Company's targeted range of 2.0x - 2.5x. The chart below shows the calculation of the Company's leverage.\nLeverage\n$ in millions\nAt December 31, 2017\nTotal debt\n$3,476\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents\n658\nNet book debt (A)\n$2,818\nTotal equity (1)\n$880\nAdd: Accumulated depreciation and\namortization (2)\n417\nAdd: General loan loss reserves\n18\nSum of total equity, accumulated D&A and\ngeneral loan loss reserves (B)\n$1,315\nLeverage (A) / (B)\n2.1x\n(1) Includes aggregate liquidation preference of preferred equity.\n(2) Accumulated depreciation and amortization includes iStar's proportionate share\nof accumulated depreciation and amortization relating to equity method\ninvestments.\nLiquidity\nThe Company continues to maintain a healthy liquidity position. Unrestricted cash at the end of the quarter was $658 million, which is available for new investment activity and working capital.\nLiquidity\n$ in millions\nAt December 31, 2017\nUnrestricted cash\n$658\nRevolving credit facility capacity\nâ€”\nTotal liquidity\n$658\nCorporate Initiatives\nSince 2012, the Company has generated $2.5 billion of proceeds from the sale of legacy assets and recorded net gains of approximately $700 million. Today, the non-core, legacy portfolio, comprised of primarily land & development, operating properties and NPLs, has been reduced to $1.7 billion.\nFor 2018, the Company is targeting to generate over $400 million of proceeds from legacy asset monetizations.\nIn addition, the Company is working with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to explore alternatives for the balance of the legacy asset portfolio. Alternatives may include accelerated sales of individual assets or groups of assets, and structural alternatives such as a spinoff and/or joint venture. As part of this review, the Company is also looking at opportunities to reduce its G&A. There can be no assurance that the Company's review of alternatives for the legacy portfolio will result in any transaction.\n* * *\niStar (NYSE: STAR) finances, invests in and develops real estate and real estate related projects as part of its fully-integrated investment platform. Building on over two decades of experience and more than $35 billion of transactions, iStar brings uncommon capabilities and new ways of thinking to commercial real estate and adapts its investment strategy to changing market conditions. The Company is structured as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), with a diversified portfolio focused on larger assets located in major metropolitan markets.\niStar will hold a quarterly earnings conference call at 10:00 a.m. ET today, February 26, 2018.

Adjusted income is used internally as a supplemental performance measure adjusting for certain non-cash GAAP measures to give management a view of income more directly derived from current period activity. Adjusted income is calculated as net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders, prior to the effect of depreciation and amortization, provision for (recovery of) loan losses, impairment of assets, stock-based compensation expense, the non-cash portion of gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt and is adjusted for the effect of gains or losses on charge-offs and dispositions on carrying value gross of loan loss reserves and impairments (\"Adjusted Income\"). In the third quarter 2017, the Company modified its presentation of Adjusted Income to exclude the effect of the amount of the liquidation preference that was recorded as a premium above book value on the redemption of preferred stock and the imputed non-cash interest expense recognized for the conversion feature of its senior convertible notes. Adjusted Income should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as shown in our consolidated statements of operations. Adjusted Income should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of our liquidity, nor is Adjusted Income indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs or available for distribution to shareholders. Rather, Adjusted Income is an additional measure we use to analyze our business performance because it excludes the effects of certain non-cash charges that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our operating performance while including the effect of gains or losses on investments when realized. It should be noted that our manner of calculating Adjusted Income may differ from the calculations of similarly-titled measures by other companies.\n(1) Depreciation and amortization includes our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization expense relating to equity method investments and excludes the portion on depreciation and amortization expense allocable to non-controlling interests.\n(2) Impairment of assets includes impairments on equity method investments recorded in earnings from equity method investments.\n(3) Losses on charge-offs and dispositions represents the impact of charge-offs and dispositions realized during the period. These charge-offs and dispositions were on assets that were previously impaired for GAAP and reflected in net income but not in Adjusted Income.\niStar\nEarnings Per Share Information\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months\nEnded December 31,\nFor the Twelve Months\nEnded December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nEPS INFORMATION FOR COMMON SHARES\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to iStar (1)\nBasic\n$\n(0.07)\n$\n(0.37)\n$\n(0.25)\n$\n0.35\nDiluted\n$\n(0.07)\n$\n(0.37)\n$\n(0.25)\n$\n0.35\nNet income (loss)\nBasic\n$\n(0.07)\n$\n(0.27)\n$\n1.56\n$\n0.60\nDiluted\n$\n(0.07)\n$\n(0.27)\n$\n1.56\n$\n0.60\nAdjusted income\nBasic\n$\n0.46\n$\n0.04\n$\n3.02\n$\n1.53\nDiluted\n$\n0.40\n$\n0.04\n$\n2.57\n$\n1.15\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n68,200\n71,603\n71,021\n73,453\nDiluted (for net income per share)\n68,200\n71,603\n71,021\n73,835\nDiluted (for adjusted income per share)\n84,090\n72,038\n87,028\n114,102\nCommon shares outstanding at end of period\n68,236\n72,042\n68,236\n72,042\n(1) Including preferred dividends, net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and income from sales of real estate.\niStar\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands)\n(unaudited)\nAs of\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nASSETS\nReal estate\nReal estate, at cost\n$\n1,629,436\n$\n1,740,893\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n(347,405)\n(353,619)\nReal estate, net\n$\n1,282,031\n$\n1,387,274\nReal estate available and held for sale\n68,588\n237,531\n$\n1,350,619\n$\n1,624,805\nLand and development, net\n860,311\n945,565\nLoans receivable and other lending investments, net\n1,300,655\n1,450,439\nOther investments\n321,241\n214,406\nCash and cash equivalents\n657,688\n328,744\nAccrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net\n11,957\n11,254\nDeferred operating lease income receivable\n86,877\n88,189\nDeferred expenses and other assets, net\n141,730\n162,112\nTotal assets\n$\n4,731,078\n$\n4,825,514\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\n$\n238,004\n$\n211,570\nLoan participations payable, net\n102,425\n159,321\nDebt obligations, net\n3,476,400\n3,389,908\nTotal liabilities\n$\n3,816,829\n$\n3,760,799\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\n$\nâ€”\n$\n5,031\nTotal iStar shareholders' equity\n$\n879,703\n$\n1,016,564\nNoncontrolling interests\n34,546\n43,120\nTotal equity\n$\n914,249\n$\n1,059,684\nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n4,731,078\n$\n4,825,514\niStar\nSegment Analysis\n(In thousands)\n(unaudited)\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017\nReal\nEstate\nFinance\nNet\nLease\nOperating\nProperties\nLand &\nDev\nCorporate\n/ Other\nTotal\nOperating lease income\n$\nâ€”\n$\n30,078\n$\n15,183\n$\n268\n$\nâ€”\n$\n45,529\nInterest income\n23,403\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n23,403\nOther income\n779\n595\n11,922\n829\n1,930\n16,055\nLand development revenue\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n18,157\nâ€”\n18,157\nEarnings (loss) from equity method investments\nâ€”\n1,723\n(1,474)\n(1,105)\n194\n(662)\nIncome from sales of real estate\nâ€”\n62,535\n1,247\nâ€”\nâ€”\n63,782\nTotal revenue and other earnings\n$\n24,182\n$\n94,931\n$\n26,878\n$\n18,149\n$\n2,124\n$\n166,264\nReal estate expense\nâ€”\n(3,679)\n(22,368)\n(15,017)\nâ€”\n(41,064)\nLand development cost of sales\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n(15,028)\nâ€”\n(15,028)\nOther expense\n(149)\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n44\n(105)\nAllocated interest expense\n(8,798)\n(12,051)\n(4,699)\n(6,264)\n(14,190)\n(46,002)\nAllocated G&A (1)\n(3,602)\n(4,685)\n(2,090)\n(3,847)\n(5,229)\n(19,453)\nSegment profit (loss)\n$\n11,633\n$\n74,516\n$\n(2,279)\n$\n(22,007)\n$\n(17,251)\n$\n44,612\n(1) Excludes $6.1 million of stock-based compensation expense.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017\nReal\nEstate\nFinance\nNet\nLease\nOperating\nProperties\nLand &\nDev\nCorporate\n/ Other\nTotal\nReal estate\nReal estate, at cost\n$\nâ€”\n$\n1,108,051\n$\n521,385\n$\nâ€”\n$\nâ€”\n$\n1,629,436\nLess: accumulated depreciation\nâ€”\n(292,268)\n(55,137)\nâ€”\nâ€”\n(347,405)\nReal estate, net\n$\nâ€”\n$\n815,783\n$\n466,248\n$\nâ€”\n$\nâ€”\n$\n1,282,031\nReal estate available and held for sale\nâ€”\nâ€”\n68,588\nâ€”\nâ€”\n68,588\nTotal real estate\n$\nâ€”\n$\n815,783\n$\n534,836\n$\nâ€”\n$\nâ€”\n$\n1,350,619\nLand & development, net\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n860,311\nâ€”\n860,311\nLoans receivable and other lending investments, net\n1,300,655\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n1,300,655\nOther investments\nâ€”\n205,007\n38,761\n63,855\n13,618\n321,241\nTotal portfolio assets\n$\n1,300,655\n$\n1,020,790\n$\n573,597\n$\n924,166\n$\n13,618\n$\n3,832,826\nCash and other assets\n898,252\nTotal assets\n$\n4,731,078\niStar\nSupplemental Information\n(In thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nOPERATING STATISTICS\nExpense Ratio\nGeneral and administrative expenses -
