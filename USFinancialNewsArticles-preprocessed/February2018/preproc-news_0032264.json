    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Nasdaq:OHRP), a pharmaceutical company developing therapies for ophthalmic diseases, today reported financial results and operating highlights for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“We recently announced top-line results from the MAKO study evaluating the efficacy and safety of topically administered squalamine in combination with monthly Lucentis ® injections for the treatment of wet-AMD, which did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint,” said Dr. Jason Slakter, chief executive officer of Ohr Pharmaceutical. “Based on these results, we have discontinued development of squalamine, taken measures to preserve cash and are evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.”\nCorporate Highlights for the Fiscal First Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nReported topline data from the MAKO study which did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint. There were no differences in the safety profile between the two treatment groups. The MAKO study evaluated the efficacy and safety of topically administered squalamine in combination with monthly Lucentis ® injections for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (“wet-AMD”). Based on the results, the Company has discontinued further development of squalamine and is evaluating strategic alternatives. The Board of Directors has engaged Roth Capital Markets, LLC, to advise the Board of Directors and management, and to assist in pursuing a range of strategic alternatives.﻿\nFinancial Results for the Quarter ended December 31, 2017\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $4.2 million, or ($0.07) per share, compared to a net loss of approximately $7.0 million, or ($0.21) per share in the same period of 2016.
