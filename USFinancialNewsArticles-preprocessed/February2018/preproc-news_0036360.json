    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Adams Keegan, a national managed HR, payroll and benefits provider, today announced its expansion into the Northeast United States, extending its footprint throughout New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. The expansion comes after years of continuous, nationwide growth for the company and will be led by Mike LaFeve, Northeast Region Business Development Director. LaFeve reports to Trevor Benitone, Vice President of Business Development.\n\"We are dedicated to meeting the needs of our clients and providing the best service possible, and having a physical presence in the Northeast enables us to do just that,\" said Jay Keegan, President and CEO at Adams Keegan. \"Bringing someone with Mike's experience as a leader and relationship builder on board allows us to continue to create and foster relationships within the broader business community, which better enables us to help growing companies address their HR challenges.\"\nWhile the firm already had clients in all 50 states, the decision for Adams Keegan to enter the Northeast market was made based on its success with past expansions into Atlanta, Georgia and Nashville, Tennessee. The company also saw an opportunity presented by access to the considerable, HR-savvy business community in the Northeast.\nAs was the strategy behind previous expansions, Adams Keegan believes the key to a sustainable growth trajectory is finding the right person to lead the effort and to grow deliberately. In his position as Business Development Director, LaFeve is tasked with expanding awareness of the Adams Keegan name and value proposition in the New York City metro area and the Northeast as a whole, to develop new business and ultimately lead a regional client support team.\nPrior to joining Adams Keegan, LaFeve served 22 years in the United States Air Force and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel after a career focused primarily in Special Operations aviation. LaFeve received a Bachelor of Science in industrial engineering from the University of Washington, as well as a Master of Business Administration from St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas.\nNow operating in the largest metropolitan area in the country, this move demonstrates Adams Keegan's focus on relieving companies across the U.S. of their HR and administrative challenges, as well as its confidence in the fact that companies are looking for a unique, service-oriented solution.\n\"Adams Keegan offers the perfect blend of people plus technology to deliver comprehensive employer services,\" said Benitone. \"This enables our ultimate goal of allowing our clients to focus on growing their business, and not on the distractions of administration and paperwork.\"\nThis development coincides with Adams Keegan's recent announcement of an expansion in Nashville. In addition to growing its Tennessee-, Georgia- and New York-based offices, the company is considering similar markets with exceptional patterns of growth for new openings.\nAbout Adams Keegan\nAdams Keegan is a national managed HR, payroll and benefits provider, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.
