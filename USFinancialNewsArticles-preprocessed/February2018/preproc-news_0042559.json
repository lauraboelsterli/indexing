Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. These risks include, but are not limited to our ability to replicate the results described in this release for future wells; the ability to finance our continued exploration, drilling operations and working capital needs; our anticipated future cash flows and ability to access other sources of liquidity; all the other uncertainties, costs and risks involved in exploration and development activities; and the other risks identified in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").

The forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date hereof, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lilis-energy-announces-execution-of-amendment-for-approval-of-share-repurchase-program-by-lenders-and-preferred-equity-holder-300601700.html\nSOURCE Lilis Energy, Inc.",
