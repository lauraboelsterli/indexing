    "text": "February 23, 2018 / 11:36 AM / a day ago Super Rugby week two (Reuters) - Highlights from week two of Super Rugby: REBELS 45 REDS 19 The Rebels started their season with a record-breaking victory over a Reds side who lost captain Scott Higginbotham to a red card following a dangerous tackle after 10 minutes. The Melbourne-based side, statistically the worst team in the competition in 2017, ran in seven tries, their most ever in a Super Rugby fixture, and scored the most points by the team in a single game as they made their numerical advantage count. Winger Sefanaia Naivalu, fullback Dane Haylett-Petty and flyhalf Jack Debreczeni crossed for two tries each to go with a score for centre Tom English. The Rebels, down to 13 players for 10 minutes when lock Lukhan Tui was sent to the sin-bin in the first half, managed tries through centres Duncan Paia‘aua and Samu Kerevi, and winger Chris Feauai-Sautis.

Walden’s centre partner Rob Thompson also grabbed two tries, while flyhalf Bryn Gatland, winger Matt Duffie and number eight Akira Ioane (two) replied for the visitors.
