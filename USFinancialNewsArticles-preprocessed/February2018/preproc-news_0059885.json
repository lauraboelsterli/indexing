Reuters Staff 1 Min Read GENEVA (Reuters) - Military operations have killed at least 30 people, including women and children, in Syria’s besieged eastern Ghouta in the last 48 hours, while shelling on Damascus continues from the rebel-held area, a United Nations spokeswoman said on Monday. “The United Nations has mobilised and is ready to immediately support life-saving aid convoys to several areas in eastern Ghouta as soon as conditions allow, as well as hundreds of medical evacuations,” Linda Tom, a U.N. humanitarian spokeswoman in Damascus, said in emailed comments.
