    "text": "February 6, 2018 / 9:28 PM / in 25 minutes White House backs House Republican stopgap funding bill Reuters Staff 1   The White House said on Tuesday it supports Republican-backed legislation in the House of Representatives that would fund most government programs through March 28 and provide defence spending for the rest of the fiscal year. \nUnless Congress passes a funding measure by midnight on Thursday, the U.S. government will be forced into a partial shutdown. A vote on the House Republican measure is expected later on Tuesday. Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Eric Walsh",
