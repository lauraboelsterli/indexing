    "text": " 20 PM / Updated 32 minutes ago Late Ki strike gives Swansea crucial win over Burnley Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Swansea City edged further away from the Premier League relegation zone as Ki Sung-yueng scored a late goal to beat Burnley 1-0 at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday. \nSwansea enjoyed more than two-thirds of possession but both teams struggled to create clear-cut opportunities in the first half. \nIt changed after the interval when visitors Burnley threatened to score with a stinging half-volley from winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson but he was denied with a stunning fingertip save by Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. \nSwansea boss Carlos Carvalhal introduced January signing Andre Ayew to boost to the attacking line and was rewarded with a string of chances before Kiâ€™s drilled effort from the edge of the area clinched victory with less than 10 minutes left. \nThe victory moved Swansea up to 15th in the table, two points clear of the bottom three, and extended their unbeaten run to five matches.
