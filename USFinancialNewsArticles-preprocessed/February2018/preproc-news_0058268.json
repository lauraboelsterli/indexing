GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Japan's industrial output tumbles in January as inventories build up Slowing production of cars and electronics in January tipped Japan's industrial output into its biggest tumble since a devastating earthquake in March 2011, highlighting a weakening in demand and a build up of inventory. • Comcast's $31 billion Sky bid crashes Murdoch and Disney show U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp has offered $31 billion for Sky Plc, threatening a plan hatched by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and Walt Disney to seize control of Europe's biggest pay-TV group. • U.S. congressional Republicans reject new limits on guns Republican leaders of the U.S. Congress said on Tuesday they would not raise the minimum age for gun buyers, in a sign that one of US President Donald Trump's proposals likely will not get far on Capitol Hill after a deadly Florida school shooting. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,512.50, down 0.5 pct from its previous close. • The Indian rupee will likely open sharply lower against the dollar after the Federal Reserve chair’s upbeat economic assessment and optimism on achieving inflation target boosted the U.S. currency. • Indian government bonds are likely to edge lower in early trade tracking firm U.S. Treasury yields that make emerging market debt less attractive for investors. The yield on the 7.17 pct bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.64 pct -7.70 pct band. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks suffered on Tuesday their biggest daily drops since the selloff three weeks ago after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell revived fears about more interest-rate increases than expected this year. • Asian shares faltered and bonds were sold off as risk appetite soured after comments from new Federal Reserve Chair revived fears about faster rate rises in the United States. • Asian shares extended losses and bonds were sold off as weak factory data from China revived worries about global economic growth amid fears of faster rate rises in the United States. • The margin between U.S. shorter- and longer-dated yields narrowed on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said data since December pointed to a strengthening economy and his confidence had increased that inflation will rise. • U.S. oil prices extended declines into a second day on Wednesday as the dollar gained and industry data showed an increase in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles, with surging production in the country hampering OPEC attempts to end a global glut. • Gold prices were unchanged near a more than two-week low, as the dollar held recent highs after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell vowed to prevent the economy from overheating while sticking with gradual rate rises.
