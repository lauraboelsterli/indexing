The bank re-affirmed its return on equity target of 14 percent or above. \nThe bank has focused its international growth strategy on the Pacific Alliance, a Latin American trading bloc comprising Mexico, Peru, Chile and Columbia. \nMcGuckin said he expects that region’s contribution to the bank’s total revenue to increase toward a 30 percent level over the next three years from 23 percent now. The bank’s Canadian business, which currently accounts for 52 percent of total revenue, is expected to remain the main sources of its revenue during that period, McGuckin said. \nIn November, Scotiabank reported fourth-quarter earnings which were below market expectations. Canadian banks are bracing for a number of headwinds in 2018 including stricter mortgage rules and the potential for house price declines. $1 = 1.2317 Canadian dollars Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio",
