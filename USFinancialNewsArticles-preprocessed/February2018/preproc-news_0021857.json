    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: FET) today announced fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $248 million, an increase of $49 million, or 25%, from the third quarter 2017. Net income for the quarter was $51 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $15 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the third quarter 2017. Excluding $56 million or $0.51 per share of special items, the adjusted net loss was $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSpecial items in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a pre-tax gain of $120 million related to the Global Tubing transaction, partially offset by pre-tax charges of $29 million and tax charges of $35 million. See Tables 1-5 for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information.\nOn October 2, 2017, Forum acquired the remaining 52% interest of Global Tubing and began consolidating 100% of Global Tubing’s financial results in its Completions segment. As a result of the acquisition, the Company changed from the equity method of accounting for its 48% interest in Global Tubing, which did not include Global Tubing’s revenue, to now consolidating Global Tubing in its results. Global Tubing's revenue was $36 million in the fourth quarter 2017.\nNew orders received by Forum in the fourth quarter were $232 million, flat sequentially, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 93%.\nForum’s total revenue for the full year 2017 was $819 million, an increase of $231 million, or 39%, from 2016. Net loss was $57 million, or $0.58 per diluted share. Excluding $0.20 per share of special items, adjusted net loss was $0.38 per diluted share for the full year 2017. New inbound orders in the year were $870 million, a 46% increase from 2016, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 106%.\nSegment Results\nCompletions segment revenue was $103 million, an increase of $43 million, or 72%, from the third quarter 2017, primarily due to the consolidation of Global Tubing and improved sales of pressure pumping equipment, coiled tubing, artificial lift and downhole completion products. New inbound orders in the fourth quarter were $101 million, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 98%. The Completions segment designs and manufactures products for the well construction, completion, stimulation and intervention markets primarily in North America.\nProduction & Infrastructure segment revenue was $92 million, an 8% increase from the third quarter 2017, due to improved sales of well site production equipment and midstream and downstream valves in the U.S. New inbound orders in the fourth quarter were $81 million, a 26% decrease sequentially, primarily due to the exceptionally high orders for production equipment in the third quarter, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 88%. The Production & Infrastructure segment manufactures U.S. land well site production equipment, desalination refinery equipment, and a wide range of valves for energy, industrial and mining customers.\nDrilling & Subsea segment revenue was $54 million, flat with the third quarter 2017, due to a relatively stable global rig count and lower subsea activity. New inbound orders in the fourth quarter were $50 million, consistent with the third quarter 2017, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 92%. Drilling & Subsea operations focus primarily on manufactured equipment and consumable products for global drilling and subsea contractors.\nReview and Outlook\nPrady Iyyanki, Forum’s President and Chief Executive Officer, remarked, \"The fourth quarter was the strongest quarter in 2017 despite our customers controlling their budgets and expenses late in the quarter. Revenue was $248 million and adjusted EBITDA was $21 million, resulting in margins of 8.3%. Adjusting our third quarter 2017 results pro forma for the consolidation of Global Tubing, our fourth quarter revenue growth for the Company and the Completions segment were 7% and 12%, respectively, and incremental EBITDA margins were 52% for the Company and 68% for Completions, our fastest growing segment.\n\"We are well positioned for growth going into 2018. The market fundamentals are strong in North America completions activity, where we expect significant growth in customer spend. During the downturn, we repositioned the Company by making Completions our largest segment through the acquisitions of Global Tubing and Multilift, and the introduction of several new products. We expect strong demand for our North America Completions and Production and Infrastructure products to drive growth for Forum in 2018.\n\"Our financial liquidity remains strong. We ended the year with $115 million of cash on hand and approximately $300 million of total liquidity. During the quarter, working capital expanded as we ramped up our manufacturing volumes to respond to customer demand.\n\"In the first quarter 2018, Forum expects revenue of $240 to $255 million and EBITDA of $18 to $23 million. Although customer spending is off to a slow start in January, we expect activity to accelerate throughout the year. In recent months, commodity prices have been strong, crude inventory levels have declined, completions activity forecasts have increased, and indications of international recovery have further improved. I am confident about our ability to deliver a strong 2018.\"\nRecent Events\nOn October 30, 2017, Forum refinanced its $140 million revolving credit facility that was set to expire in 2018, with a new $300 million asset based revolving credit facility with an extended maturity.\nOn January 3, 2018, the Company contributed Forum Subsea Rentals into Ashtead Technology, a competing business, in exchange for a 40% interest in the combined company. The transaction creates a market leading independent provider of subsea survey and remotely operated vehicle equipment rental services.\nForum received orders for over 850,000 horsepower of J-Mac hydraulic fracturing power ends in 2017.\nForum commercialized its new Hydraulic Quick Latch during the fourth quarter 2017, which improves efficiency and safety in zipper frac operations.\nConference Call Information\nForum's conference call is scheduled for Friday, February 9, 2018 at 9:00 AM CST.

As a result, the Company recorded a net charge of $8.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. This amount, which is included in income tax expense (benefit) consists of two components: (i) a $26.7 million charge relating to the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of certain non-US subsidiaries that are owned either wholly or partially by a US subsidiary of Forum and (ii) an $18.5 million credit resulting from the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities in the US based on the new lower corporate income tax rate.

We believe that this ratio is useful to the Company’s investors because it provides an indication of whether the demand for our products, in the markets in which we operate, is strengthening or declining. A ratio of greater than one is indicative of improving market demand, while a ratio of less than one would suggest weakening demand. In addition, we believe the book-to-bill ratio provides more meaningful insight into future revenues for our business than other measures, such as order backlog, because the majority of our products are activity based consumable items or shorter cycle capital equipment, neither of which are typically ordered by customers far in advance.
