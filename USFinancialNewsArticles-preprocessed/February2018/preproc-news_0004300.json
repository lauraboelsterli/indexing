    "text": "Reid Travis had a hand in all 12 points of a game-opening run that gave Stanford a double-digit lead and allowed the Cardinal to coast to an 80-71 Pacific-12 win over Oregon State on Thursday night at Stanford, Calif.\nTravis finished with a game-high 24 points and nine rebounds as the Cardinal (12-11, 6-4 Pac-12) snapped a three-game losing streak.\nDrew Eubanks led four Beavers in double figures with 19 points as Oregon State (11-10, 3-6) lost its three straight and fell for the fifth time in six.\nTravis had four baskets, one that he turned into a three-point play, and assisted on a Dorian Pickens 3-pointer in Stanford’s 12-0 start.\nThe Beavers missed their first three shots and mixed in four turnovers before ending their drought on a jumper by Eubanks 3:56 into the game.\nStanford went up 27-7 on a layup by Isaac White with 9:27 remaining in the half.\nWith Travis scoring 21 points, the Cardinal retained a 43-28 halftime advantage, and Stanford rebuilt a 20-point margin in the third minute of the second half.\nOregon State chipped away at the deficit, getting as close as 64-58 on a pair of free throws by Eubanks with 8:06 to go.\nHowever, Pickens and Daejon Davis combined for seven consecutive free throws, opening a 13-point lead, and Stanford kept the Beavers at arm’s length the rest of the way.\nPickens finished with 15 points for the Cardinal, who had won five straight before the three-game losing streak.\nDavis had a game-high seven assists to complement 12 points for Stanford, which outshot the Beavers 55.8 percent to 49.0 percent.\nTres Tinkle had 18 points for Oregon State, which has yet to win a true road game this season, going 0-5.\nEthan Thompson and Stephen Thompson Jr. had 10 points apiece for the Beavers, who complete a two-game tour of the San Francisco Bay Area on Saturday at California.\nStanford plays host to Oregon on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
