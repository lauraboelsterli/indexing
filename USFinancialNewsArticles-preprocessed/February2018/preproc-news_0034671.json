Slideshow (3 Images) All flights to and from the airport were cancelled on Monday after the half-tonne ordnance was found at the nearby George V Dock in east London, and a 200-metre exclusion zone was also put in place. “The World War Two ordnance discovered in King George V Dock has been safely removed by the Royal Navy and Met Police,” Robert Sinclair, CEO of London City Airport said in a statement. “As a result, the exclusion zone has now been lifted and the airport will be open as normal on Tuesday.” Reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",
