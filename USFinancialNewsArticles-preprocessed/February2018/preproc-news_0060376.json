    "text": "0 COMMENTS The dollar rose to its highest level in two weeks Tuesday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. economic outlook remains bright amid strengthening growth and inflation.\nThe ICE Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six others, was recently up 0.6% at 90.37, its highest level since mid-February.\nSpeaking before Congress, Mr. Powell conveyed an upbeat picture of a U.S. economy expanding at a solid clip. The strong job market will help consumer spending and businesses will feel more confident about investing, which should boost productivity, he said.\nHis prepared remarks didn’t address the likely number or timing of Fed rate increases this year. However, “his hints at the upside potential for inflation and the increasing positives for growth suggest the risks are skewed towards a more aggressive monetary policy response,” analysts at ING said in a note to clients.\nMr. Powell also said that his personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December,\nSome analysts believe the Fed may deliver four rate increases this year, rather than the three it had earlier signaled. Expectations of rising borrowing costs tend to buoy the dollar, as higher rates make the U.S. currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors.\nThe euro was down 0.7% at $1.2233.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com",
