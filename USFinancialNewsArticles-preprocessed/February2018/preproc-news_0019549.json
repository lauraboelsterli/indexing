She was the only athlete to fall.

REUTERS/Issei Kato \nHer compatriot See Jee Won faired much better, scoring 68.46 but still did not finish in the top-10. Both will have another chance in the second round of qualifying on Sunday. \nThe top-10 from the first round of qualifying automatically moved on to Sunday’s final.
