    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on Monday it was too early to comment on an investigation into suspected doping at the winter Olympics by a Russian sportsman.\nAlexander Krushelnitsky, a bronze-medallist along with his wife in mixed-doubles curling, is suspected of having tested positive for meldonium.\nPeskov said it would be wise to wait for the results of the final doping tests in his case before drawing any conclusions.\nReporting by Andrew Osborn; Writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ",
