    "text": "LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - British travel company Thomas Cook said it was expanding its airline business for this summer, boosting capacity by 10 percent in response to growing demand from holidaymakers in Germany and Britain in recent months.\nThe company, due to report first quarter results on Thursday, said it would fly more routes from Germany after it bought a licence from now defunct airline Air Berlin, meaning it could fly six extra aircraft through its German airline Condor.\nThe balance of the growth would come from its newly-formed Spanish unit, Thomas Cook Airlines Balearics, which will operate five aircraft for use across the rest of the groupâ€™s airlines where needed.\nThe additional capacity will mean it flies 70 new routes this summer, adding destinations in Croatia and the U.S. (Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Kate Holton)\n ",
