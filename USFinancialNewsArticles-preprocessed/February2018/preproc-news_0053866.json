    "text": "NORTHBOROUGH, Mass., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (NYSE: ASPN) (\"Aspen Aerogels\") today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, which ended December 31, 2017, and discussed business developments during the quarter.\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter was $36.4 million compared to $27.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. Fourth quarter net loss was $1.7 million compared to $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss per share for the quarter was $0.07 compared to $0.25 in the fourth quarter last year.\nTotal revenue for the full year was $111.6 million compared to $117.7 million in 2016. Net loss for the year was $19.3 million compared to $12.0 million last year. Net loss per share for the year was $0.83 per share compared to $0.52 per share in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $2.2 million compared to $(2.1) million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $(3.3) million compared to $3.9 million in 2016. A reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to net loss is provided in the financial schedules that are part of this press release. An explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nNet loss and Adjusted EBITDA included legal and related expenses associated with Aspen Aerogels' ongoing patent enforcement actions of $0.6 million for the fourth quarter compared to $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $3.5 million for the full year compared to $3.6 million in 2016.\nRecent Business Developments\n\"Fourth quarter revenue growth of 32% was driven by strong demand in the U.S. and European markets and a high volume of subsea project work. In addition, we benefitted from record manufacturing yields and strong operational productivity in our East Providence, Rhode Island manufacturing facility. As a result, we delivered a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in revenue, gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA,\" said Don Young, President and CEO of Aspen Aerogels.\n\"We made solid progress during the quarter with our efforts to diversify our markets and expand the reach of our aerogel technology platform. We achieved continued growth in demand in the U.S. district energy market and for our new Pyrogel ® HPS product in the global power market. We also remain enthusiastic about the potential of our joint development initiative with BASF focused on the building materials market. Of note, we amended our supply agreement with BASF last week to secure $5 million in advance payments during 2018 which will help support our capacity expansion plans, our process improvement initiatives and our new business development efforts,\" continued Mr. Young.\n\"In addition, we are encouraged by our recent wins in patent enforcement actions at the International Trade Commission and in the German courts. These victories validate the strength of the patent portfolio protecting our innovative and expanding aerogel technology platform. We remain firmly committed to defending our intellectual property and will continue to assert our rights against companies that infringe our patented technology,\" concluded Mr. Young.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nAspen Aerogels issues its 2018 full year outlook as follows:\nTotal revenue is expected to range between $106 million and $116 million Net loss is expected to range between $16.9 million and $20.0 million Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $(2.0) million and $(5.0) million Net loss per share is expected to range between $(0.71) and $(0.85)\nOur 2018 outlook assumes depreciation and amortization of $10.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million, interest and other expense of $0.3 million, and weighted average shares outstanding of 23.6 million for the full year. In addition, our 2018 outlook reflects an expected $1.1 million to $1.3 million of costs and expenses associated with our ongoing patent enforcement efforts during the year.\n\"Looking forward to 2018, we anticipate that broad-based growth across our core and adjacent markets will offset most or all of the impact of a projected decline in the volume of subsea projects and the completion of the South Asia petrochemical project, which together comprised approximately 19% of our revenue during 2017,\" said Don Young, President and CEO of Aspen Aerogels. \"We remain committed to investing in new aerogel technologies, innovative products, and strategic partnerships to drive consistent, long-term growth. In line with this commitment, we have included an additional $6 million in expense for new initiatives and personnel in our 2018 operating plan intended to drive revenue growth in our energy infrastructure business and to leverage our aerogel technology platform to develop breakout opportunities in new markets,\" said Mr. Young.\n\"We have also commenced a series of projects, which we refer to as our EP20 projects, intended to increase the capacity of our East Providence manufacturing facility by 20% by the end of 2020. The EP20 projects will cost up to $20 million and will involve a series of process technology advancements to enhance the profit potential of our existing manufacturing assets. We intend to use a portion of the $5 million in advance payments from BASF to fund the EP20 projects planned for 2018,\" concluded Mr. Young.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for this 2018 financial outlook is provided in the financial schedules that are part of this press release. An explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nAspen Aerogels may incur charges, realize gains or losses, incur financing costs or interest expense, or experience other events in 2018 that could cause actual results to vary materially from this outlook. In addition, the timing of projects may have a significant impact on quarterly and annual revenue and profitability and can be difficult to predict.\nConference Call Notification\nA conference call with Aspen Aerogels management to discuss fourth quarter and full year results and business developments will be held at 5:00 pm EST on February 22, 2018. During the call, management will respond to questions concerning, but not limited to, Aspen Aerogels' financial performance, business conditions and industry outlook. Management's discussion and responses could contain information that has not been previously disclosed. The conference call will be available live as a listen-only webcast and will be hosted at the Investors section of the Aspen Aerogels website, www.aerogel.com . In addition, you may call 833-287-0799 (toll free, U.S. & Canada only) conference ID \"428079\" or +1 647-689-4458 (international) conference ID \"4284079\" to participate in the conference call.\nFollowing the live event, an archived version of the webcast will be available on the Aspen Aerogels website for convenient on-demand replay for at least a year.\nA copy of this press release is posted in the Investors section on the Aspen Aerogels website.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), Aspen Aerogels provides additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (\"non-GAAP\"). The non-GAAP financial measure included in this press release is Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as a measure of operating performance because the non-GAAP financial measures do not include the impact of items that management does not consider indicative of Aspen Aerogels' core operating performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) for planning purposes, including the preparation of Aspen Aerogels' annual operating budget, (ii) to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of its business, and (iii) as a performance measure under its bonus plan.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Aspen Aerogels' ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in its business, as they exclude expenses and gains not reflective of Aspen Aerogels' ongoing operating results or that may be infrequent and/or unusual in nature. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating Aspen Aerogels' operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of Aspen Aerogels' GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Aspen Aerogels' financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. In this press release, Aspen Aerogels has provided a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management strongly encourages investors to review Aspen Aerogels' financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\nAbout Aspen Aerogels, Inc.\nAspen Aerogels is an aerogel technology company that designs, develops and manufactures innovative, high-performance aerogel insulation used primarily in the energy infrastructure and building materials markets where thermal energy efficiency is at a premium and Aspen's products offer unique value.
