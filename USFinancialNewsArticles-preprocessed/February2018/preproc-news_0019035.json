Sitting in the heart of Silicon Valley brings an innovative and entrepreneurial perspective to all we do,\" said Beck-Dudley. \"I look forward to working with my fellow deans and sharing insights as we face the challenges and opportunities of leading business schools during this disruptive time.\"\nElected to the AACSB board in 2008 as a member, and as vice chair-chair elect in 2017, Beck-Dudley's volunteer work with the association spans nearly 15 years of dedicated service.
