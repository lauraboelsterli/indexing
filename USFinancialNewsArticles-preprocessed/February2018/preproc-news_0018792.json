    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 11:53 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Thailand issues arrest warrants against four activists Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai court issued arrest warrants for four pro-democracy activists on Friday for staging a public protest amid growing pressure on the junta to hold elections as promised, police said. \nRangsiman Rome, Sirawich Seritiwat, Ekachai Hongkangwan and Anond Nampa were charged with illegal assembly along with 35 other activists who staged a demonstration last month in central Bangkok to protest a delay to a general election scheduled to take place in November. \nThe 35 reported to police in Bangkok on Thursday and were later released the same day. The other four did not report to police. They face additional charges of breaking a junta order that bans public gatherings and with inciting unrest. \nKritsadang Nutcharus, a lawyer for the group, told Reuters he had been notified about the warrants and that the four men were ready to go to the police early next week.
