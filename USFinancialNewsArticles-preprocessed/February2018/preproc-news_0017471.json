    "text": "Tyler Seguin scored twice, including an empty-net goal with 58 seconds to play, as the visiting Dallas Stars defeated the reeling Chicago Blackhawks 4-2 on Thursday at the United Center.\nThe Stars swept the four-game season series.\nThe loss was the fourth in a row for Chicago, which has earned just one point -- for an overtime defeat at Calgary on Saturday -- in February.\nSeguin’s second goal clinched the game for Dallas, who have won four in a row and haven’t lost this month. The Stars won despite being outshot by Chicago 39-30.\nJonathan Toews sent the Blackhawks to the front at the 9:07 mark of the first period when he wristed a shot past Dallas netminder Ben Bishop (37 saves). Toews rushed down the ice to snare a pass off the near boards from teammate Brent Seabrook and went high to Bishop’s glove side and into the short side of the net.\nIt was Toews’ first goal in 12 games and his 15th of the season.\nSeguin tied the game with 14:16 to play in the second period when he rushed to the slot and flipped a pass from Alexander Radulov over the left shoulder of Chicago goaltender Anton Forsberg (26 saves). Dan Hamhuis was also credited with an assist on Seguin’s 27th goal of the season.\nDallas took the lead less than a minute later as Stephen Johns collected the puck at the point after and fired a one-timer past Forsberg. Remi Elie and Radek Faksa earned assists.\nChicago answered at the 12:48 mark of the second period when Artem Anisimov, working on the power play, converted a rebounded shot from Seabrook into the tying goal. Vinnie Hinostroza also got an assist.\nThe Stars kept up their attack into the final minute of the period and found satisfaction on Tyler Pitlick’s goal off a John Klingberg assist with just five seconds left, handing Dallas a 3-2 lead at the second intermission.\nDallas was to return home late Thursday to prepare for a Friday game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Blackhawks travel to Minnesota to face the Wild on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
