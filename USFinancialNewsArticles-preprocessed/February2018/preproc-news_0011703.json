He asked all \"other investors who care about our future to do the same.\" \nHe added the hashtag \"#unfriendfacebook.\"\nTweet \nFacebook has admitted that 10 million people saw Russian-bought ads intended to sway the 2016 U.S. election . \nFacebook and Jim Carrey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
