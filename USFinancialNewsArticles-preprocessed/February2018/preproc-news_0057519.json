    "text": "February's stock market correction probably would have been worse if companies had not stepped in to the fray.\nWith both traders and retail investors selling at a frenzied level earlier this month, corporations swept in looking for bargains. Sparked by rich valuations and fears that inflation finally might be coming home to roost , major averages each dipped more than 10 percent before recovering about half their losses in recent days.\nAs the month nears a close, companies have bought back $113.4 billion of their own shares, good for the highest total since April 2015, according to market data firm TrimTabs. That's part of an overall strong trend for buybacks, which stand at $5.8 billion a day during the current earnings season, a record.\nGoldman Sachs, for instance, reported that its buyback desk had its two busiest weeks ever during the market tumult.\nshow chapters ",
