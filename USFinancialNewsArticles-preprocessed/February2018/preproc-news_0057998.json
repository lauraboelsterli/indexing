    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- INDEPENDENCE CONTRACT DRILLING, INC. (the \"Company\") (NYSE: ICD) today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet loss of $5.7 million, or $0.15 per share. Adjusted net loss, as defined below, of $4.6 million, or $0.12 per share. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, of $3.7 million. Fleet utilization of 100.0%. Record revenue days of 1,289. Fully-burdened margin per day, of $5,244 per day. Net debt, excluding capitalized leases, of $46.0 million, on a borrowing base of $106.7 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported revenues of $25.0 million, a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.15 per share, an adjusted net loss (defined below) of $4.6 million, or $0.12 per share, and adjusted EBITDA (defined below) of $3.7 million. This compares to revenues of $23.4 million, a net loss of $6.0 million, or $0.16 per share, an adjusted net loss of $5.1 million, or $0.13 per share, and adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2017, and revenues of $18.0 million, a net loss of $10.4 million, or $0.28 per share, an adjusted net loss of $5.2 million, or $0.14 per share, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenues of $90.0 million, a net loss of $24.3 million, or $0.64 per share, an adjusted net loss of $20.1 million, or $0.53 per share, and adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 million. This compares to revenues of $70.1 million, a net loss of $22.2 million, or $0.67 per share, an adjusted net loss of $14.4 million, or $0.43 per share, and adjusted EBITDA of $16.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nChief Executive Officer Byron Dunn commented, \"The fourth quarter represented a significant milestone for ICD as we generated record revenue days on 100% utilization of our entire rig fleet. Market conditions continue to improve since year end, with demand and dayrates increasing for ICD's ShaleDriller rigs. Since year end, we extended contracts for four rigs adding three rig years of backlog. As a result of improving market conditions and outlook for our business, I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved completion of our next newbuild ShaleDriller rig, which we anticipate entering the market in early-to-mid third quarter of this year.\nQuarterly Operational Results\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company's fleet operated at 100.0% utilization and recorded 1,289 revenue days compared to 98.0% utilization and 1,235 revenue days in the third quarter of 2017 and 78.2% utilization and 936 revenue days in the fourth quarter of 2016. There were no revenue days earned on a standby-without-crew basis in the fourth or third quarters of 2017, compared to 92.0 days in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $25.0 million, compared to $23.4 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $18.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a revenue-per-day basis, revenues were $18,338 per day in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $18,034 in the third quarter of 2017 and $18,224 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Sequential revenue-per-day improvements were driven by increased pricing on contract renewals, partially offset by the expiration of a higher priced legacy contract that benefitted the prior quarter.\nOperating costs in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $18.8 million, compared to $18.2 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $12.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 operating costs included $0.5 million in expensed rig construction costs, third quarter 2017 operating costs included $0.4 million in rig construction costs, and fourth quarter 2016 operating costs included $0.9 million of reactivation costs and $0.2 million in rig construction costs. Fully-burdened operating costs, excluding reactivation and rig construction costs, were $13,094 per day in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $13,513 in the third quarter of 2017 and $10,681 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential decrease in cost per day related to higher operating costs in the third quarter of 2017 related to higher maintenance and repair expense and Hurricane Harvey and other weather-related costs.\nFourth quarter 2017 fully-burdened rig operating margins, excluding reactivation and expensed rig construction costs, were $5,244 per day, compared to $4,521 per day in the third quarter of 2017 and $7,543 per day in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $3.1 million (including $0.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation), compared to $2.9 million (including $0.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation) in the third quarter of 2017 and $4.3 million (including $0.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation) in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the third quarter of 2017 related primarily to an increase in incentive compensation expense, professional fees, and franchise tax expense, offset by lower non-cash stock-based compensation.\nDrilling Operations Update\nAll 14 of the Company's ShaleDrillerÂ® rigs are contracted and operating under term contracts.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's proforma backlog of revenues from contracts with original terms of six months or more, including contract extensions signed subsequent to year end, was $75 million. Approximately 88% of this backlog is expected to be realized during 2018.\nCapital Expenditures and Liquidity Update\nAggregate cash outlays for capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017, net of disposals, were $4.2 million including $2.5 million of payments for third quarter deliveries. The Company's capital expenditure budget for 2018 is $20.5 million, including $10 million associated with the completion of one additional newbuild rig.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had drawn $48.5 million on its $85.0 million revolving credit facility and had net debt, excluding capital leases, of $46.0 million. The borrowing base under the Company's credit facility was $106.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nConference Call Details\nA conference call for investors will be held today, February 26, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Central Time (12:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the Company's fourth quarter and year end 2017 results.

For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 there were zero operating days in which the Company earned revenue on a standby basis. For the three months ended December 31, 2016 there were 92.0 operating days in which the Company earned revenue on a standby basis including 92.0 standby-without-crew days. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 there were 77.9 and 882.1 operating days in which the Company earned revenue on a standby basis, respectively, including 69.0 and 839.0 standby-without-crew days, respectively.\n(2)\nAverage number of operating rigs is calculated by dividing the total number of rig operating days in the period by the total number of calendar days in the period.\n(3)\nRig utilization is calculated as rig operating days divided by the total number of days our drilling rigs are available during the applicable period.\n(4)\nAverage revenue per operating day represents total contract drilling revenues earned during the period divided by rig operating days in the period. Excluded in calculating average revenue per operating day are revenues associated with the reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs paid by customers of $1.4 million, $0.9 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and $4.6 million and $3.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in calculating average revenue per operating day for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $1.8 million of early termination revenues associated with a contract termination at the end of the first quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 and the third quarter of 2017 did not include any early termination revenues.\n(5)\nAverage cost per operating day represents total direct operating costs incurred during the period divided by rig operating days in the period. The following costs are excluded in calculating average cost per operating day: (i) out-of-pocket costs reimbursed by customers of $1.4 million, $0.9 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and $4.6 million and $3.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (ii) new crew training costs of zero, $30 thousand and zero for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and $0.1 million and $0.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (iii) construction overhead costs expensed due to reduced rig construction activity of $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and $1.1 million and $1.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (iv) rig reactivation costs for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and September 30, 2017 of zero, $0.9 million and zero, respectively, (excluding zero, $30 thousand and zero of new crew training costs (included in (ii) above), respectively), and $1.0 million and $3.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (excluding $0.1 million and $0.5 million of new crew training costs (included in (ii) above), respectively), and (v) out-of-pocket expenses of $0.1 million, net of insurance recoveries, incurred as a result of damage to one of our rig's mast during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. In addition, adjusted EBITDA is consistent with how EBITDA is calculated under our revolving credit facility for purposes of determining our compliance with various financial covenants. We define \"EBITDA\" as earnings (or loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and we define \"adjusted EBITDA\" as EBITDA before stock-based compensation, non-cash asset impairments, gains or losses on disposition of assets, and other non-recurring items added back to, or subtracted from, net income for purposes of calculating EBITDA under our revolving credit facility. Neither adjusted net loss, EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA is a measure of net income as determined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nManagement believes adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow our stockholders to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compliance with various financial covenants under our revolving credit facility and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure or non-recurring, non-cash transactions. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in calculating adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. None of adjusted net loss, EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA should be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), the most closely comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's return of assets, cost of capital and tax structure. Our presentation of adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Loss:\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nAmount\nPer\nShare\nAmount\nPer\nShare\nAmount\nPer\nShare\nAmount\nPer\nShare\nAmount\nPer\nShare\n(in thousands)\nNet loss\n$(5,745)\n$(0.15)\n$(10,375)\n$(0.28)\n$(5,980)\n$(0.16)\n$(24,298)\n$(0.64)\n$(22,178)\n$(0.67)\nAdd back:\nAsset impairments, net of insurance recoveries (1)\n994\n0.03\n3,822\n0.10\n899\n0.03\n2,568\n0.07\n3,822\n0.12\nLoss on disposition of assets, net (2)\n104\n-\n1,354\n0.04\n-\n-\n1,677\n0.04\n1,942\n0.06\nWrite-off of deferred financing costs (3)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n504\n0.02\nStock-based compensation - executive retirement (4)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(67)\n(0.01)\nExecutive retirement (4)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,552\n0.05\nAdjusted net loss\n$(4,647)\n$(0.12)\n$ (5,199)\n$(0.14)\n$(5,081)\n$(0.13)\n$(20,053)\n$(0.53)\n$(14,425)\n$(0.43)\nReconciliation of Net Loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n(in thousands)\nNet loss\n$ (5,745)\n$ (10,375)\n$ (5,980)\n$ (24,298)\n$ (22,178)\nAdd back:\nIncome tax expense\n177\n135\n30\n287\n202\nInterest expense\n895\n553\n772\n2,983\n3,045\nDepreciation and amortization\n6,724\n6,157\n6,529\n25,844\n23,808\nAsset impairments, net of insurance recoveries (1)\n994\n3,822\n899\n2,568\n3,822\nEBITDA\n3,045\n292\n2,250\n7,384\n8,699\nLoss on disposition of assets, net (2)\n104\n1,354\n-\n1,677\n1,942\nStock-based compensation\n528\n913\n867\n3,565\n4,249\nStock-based compensation - executive retirement (4)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(67)\nExecutive retirement (4)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,552\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 3,677\n$ 2,559\n$ 3,117\n$ 12,626\n$ 16,375\n(1)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a $1.0 million, or $0.03 per share, non-cash impairment of certain held for sale assets. In the third quarter of 2017, we recorded a $0.6 million, or $0.02 per share, non-cash impairment of the Galayda facility as a result of water-related damage from the heavy rainfall that occurred during Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, as well as a $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share, non-cash impairment representing the estimated damage to a piece of drilling equipment, net of insurance recoveries. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a $3.8 million, or $0.10 per share, non-cash write-down of assets held for sale to reflect their current fair value less estimated selling costs. For the full year 2017, we recorded a $2.6 million, or $0.07 per share, non-cash impairment primarily attributable to asset impairment expense associated with the impairment of certain held for sale assets and the impairment of our corporate headquarters as a result of water damage attributable to Hurricane Harvey. For the full year 2016, we recorded a $3.8 million, or $0.12 per share, non-cash impairment of assets held for sale to reflect their current market value less estimated selling costs\n(2)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a loss on disposition of assets of $1.4 million, or $0.04 per share, primarily due to a non-cash disposal of equipment in connection with the upgrade to 7,500 psi mud systems. For the full year 2017, we recorded a loss on disposition of assets of $1.7 million, or $0.04 per share, primarily attributable to a $0.7 million loss on the sale of drilling equipment previously designated as held for sale and a $0.8 million non-cash disposal of equipment in connection with upgrades to 7,500 psi mud systems. For the full year 2016, we recorded a loss on disposition of assets of $1.9 million, or $0.06 per share, primarily due to non-cash disposal of equipment in connection with the upgrade to 7,500 psi mud systems.\n(3)\nFor the full year 2016, we recorded $0.5 million, or $0.02 per share, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs in connection with a reduction of commitments under the Company's revolving credit facility in April 2016.\n(4)\nFor the full year 2016, we recorded $1.5 million, or $0.04 per share, of retirement benefits associated with the departure of an executive officer.\nINVESTOR CONTACTS:\nIndependence Contract Drilling, Inc.\nE-mail inquiries to: Investor.relations@icdrilling.com\nPhone inquiries: (281) 598-1211\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/independence-contract-drilling-inc-reports-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-year-ended-december-31-2017-300603796.html\nSOURCE Independence Contract Drilling, Inc.",
