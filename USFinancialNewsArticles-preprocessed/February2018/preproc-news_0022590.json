    "text": "EditorsNote: updates with details\nThe scheduled game between the Indiana Pacers and the New Orleans Pelicans was postponed Wednesday night due to concerns about a wet floor inside the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.\nA makeup date is to be determined.\nA leak in the building’s roof allowed rainwater to seep onto the court, and a delay began shortly before the scheduled tipoff. Arena officials raised a catch basin to the roof to catch the incoming water while workers dried the floor with towels.\nA delay of approximately 90 minutes ensued while officials of the two teams and the NBA office discussed options.\nEventually it was announced that the game would not be played Wednesday “out of an abundance of caution.”\n--Field Level Media\n ",
