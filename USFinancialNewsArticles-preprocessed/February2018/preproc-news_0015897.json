    "text": "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - France’s Perrine Laffont qualified in first place for the final of the women’s moguls after the first round of qualifying on Friday.\nLaffont, a world championship silver medalist, produced an impressive run to score 79.72 in the first action of the Pyeongchang 2018 Games at the Phoenix Snow Park.\nAndi Naude of Canada and American Morgan Schild were second and third respectively.\nThere was disappointment however for the hundreds of local fans who had turned out to see South Korea’s Seo Jung Hwa.\nSeo was greeted with huge cheers before her run but the 27-year-old fell before the final jump and finished in last place. She was the only athlete to fall.\nFreestyle Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women’s Moguls Qualification - Phoenix Snow Park - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 9, 2018 - Andi Naude of Canada in action. REUTERS/Issei Kato Her compatriot See Jee Won faired much better, scoring 68.46 but still did not finish in the top-10. Both will have another chance in the second round of qualifying on Sunday.\nThe top-10 from the first round of qualifying automatically moved on to Sunday’s final.\nSlideshow (4 Images) World number one American Jaelin Kauf, who was cheered on by family and friends at the bottom of the hill, scored 77.45 to finish fifth.\nCanada’s Sochi silver medalist Chloe Dufour-Lapointe finished the first round of qualifying in a disappointing 13th, while her sister Justine, who won gold in Russia four years ago, was fourth.\nThe men’s first qualifying round starts later on Friday.\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ",
