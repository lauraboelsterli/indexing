    "text": "LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - A lawyer for a firm controlled by Russian businessman Vladimir Potanin told a London court on Friday that financing for the potential purchase of a stake in Russiaâ€™s Norilsk Nickel from Roman Abramovich was already in place.\nThe lawyer, Peter Goldsmith also told the court that there could be grounds for damages if a delay in proceedings led to financial repercussions, such as from share price moves, loss of dividends and interest payments on financing.\nRusal, which also owns a stake in Nornickel, is seeking an injunction in the London court to block the deal.
