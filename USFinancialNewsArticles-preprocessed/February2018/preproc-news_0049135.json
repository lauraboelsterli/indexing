    "text": "PARIS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Orangeâ€™s annual sales in France grew for the first time in nine years, the telecoms operator said on Wednesday, signalling that its high investments in the country are starting to bear fruit.\nRevenues in France increased by 0.6 percent to 18.1 billion euros ($22.3 billion), the former monopoly said in a statement. It added 164,000 fibre broadband subscribers and 212,000 mobile contracts in the fourth quarter.\nThe overall fourth-quarter results were in line with expectations, with core operating profits growing by 2.5 percent to 3.22 billion euros.\nOrange confirmed its targets as laid out at its investor day last December, including a growth of its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, debt and amortisation in 2018.\n$1 = 0.8113 euros Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain and Gwenaelle Barzic Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
