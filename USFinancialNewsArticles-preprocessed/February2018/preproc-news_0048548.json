    "text": "ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LeaseQuery , an industry leader in lease accounting software , announced today that Rachel Bowles has joined the team as their newest business analyst. The hire comes on the heels of a record-breaking year of growth for LeaseQuery . Rachel will liaise between business stakeholders and LeaseQuery to document and communicate business requirements to continue improvements to the functionality of their lease accounting software as companies shift from FASB Topic 840 to Topic 842.\nShe will be working closely with the business and client success team to identify, prioritize, and implement these new functionalities based on client feedback. Her expertise will be essential for LeaseQuery clients as they move to adopt the new Lease Accounting Standards.\nGeorge Azih, the CEO of LeaseQuery, was quick to praise. “Rachel is a great addition to the team! In the short time she’s been with us, she has provided tremendous value. We look forward to accomplishing great things with her in the future!”\nRachel began her career at Ernst & Young (EY) after graduating from the University of Georgia with a degree in Management Information Systems. She completed an in-depth Business Analysis training program and worked within the IT Services group on the development of multiple internal applications. She gained extensive experience in documenting software requirements, building process flows, performing data analysis, and writing procedural documentation. After two years in that role, Rachel was promoted and transitioned into a client facing role within EY’s Technology Consulting practice working primarily on robotic process automation (RPA).\nLeaseQuery looks forward to Rachel’s efforts providing necessary context and analysis for the continued growth of functionalities of their lease accounting software.\nAbout LeaseQuery\nLeaseQuery is the first purpose-built lease accounting software built by Accountants for Accountants.
