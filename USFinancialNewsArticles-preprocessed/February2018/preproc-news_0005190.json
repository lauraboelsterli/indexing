The acquisition gives DBi additional resources and workforce to help preserve and maintain the country’s transportation infrastructure and protect the safety of the traveling public.\n“We are thrilled to welcome HDR|ICA Asset Management to our growing team,” said Mark Robinson, DBi Services President and COO. “This investment is part of our long-time commitment to providing innovative solutions to current and future asset maintenance challenges. HDR|ICA Asset Management’s people, knowledge, capabilities and current infrastructure projects complement and enhance the service we provide to our customers. Continued growth also means additional career opportunities and increased job stability for our collective employees.”\nThe partnership pairs together two companies with similar beginnings and family-focused cultures. Both were founded decades ago by local entrepreneurs. Through years of hard work, high-quality service, safety and satisfaction and a talented workforce, DBi and HDR|ICA Asset Management grew into leading providers in their respective and complementary fields. The two companies also share a comparable organizational structure and will operate in a unified manner to benefit customers.\n“As we got to know the team at DBi, it became clear to us that their client-focused approach, innovative solutions and commitment to employees were an excellent fit with our vision for our team, our customers, and the industry overall,” said Butch Eley, President of HDR|ICA Asset Management.\nRoger Zino, DBi CEO said, “The foundation DBi has built over the last 40 years is strong. With the addition of Butch Eley, Darrell Massengale, David Rader and the rest of the HDR|ICA Asset Management team, we are bringing together the leadership capabilities, experience and depth to define the next generation of service excellence, innovation and productivity for the benefit of both infrastructure providers and the traveling public.”\nDBi will immediately begin to operate HDR|ICA Asset Management under the name DBi Services, maintaining the business’s current operations in Tennessee and infrastructure projects in states that include Florida, Virginia, Texas, South Carolina, Arizona, Missouri and more.\nAbout DBi Services\nDBi Services is a global leader in infrastructure operations and maintenance. Founded in 1978, DBi is headquartered in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and has grown from a small commercial residential maintenance company to a global network of over 90 locations and approximately 2,500 employees in the US, Canada and the UK, providing infrastructure maintenance, management and operations solutions to government agencies, railways, utilities and private industries. To further fuel its growth, in 2016 DBi partnered with Sterling Partners, a growth-oriented private equity firm, allowing DBi to invest in more resources and build upon its position as a market leader.

Their performance-based approach to asset management has proven to help state governments save money on maintenance costs. In 2015, ICA was acquired by HDR, Inc., a global engineering, architecture, environmental and consulting firm. As HDR|ICA Asset Management, the company offered government and transportation agencies a strategic approach to decision making focused on maximizing life-cycle system performance and value.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180201005844/en/\nFor DBi Services\nKatie Chrapla\n312-329-3986\nkatie.chrapla@finnpartners.com\nSource: DBi Services",
