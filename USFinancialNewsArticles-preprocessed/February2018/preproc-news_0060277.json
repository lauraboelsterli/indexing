    "text": "ALLEN, Texas, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atrion Corporation (NASDAQ:ATRI) announced today that for the fourth quarter of 2017 revenues were $34.0 million compared to $33.3 million in the same period of 2016, net income was $8.6 million compared to $5.6 million, and diluted earnings per share were $4.66 compared to $3.00 in the prior-year period. For the full year 2017 compared to 2016, Atrion increased revenues to $146.6 million from $143.5 million, net income to $36.6 million from $27.6 million, and diluted earnings per share to $19.71 from $14.85.\nDavid Battat, President & CEO, commenting on the results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2017 as compared to the prior-year periods said, \"We had a solid fourth quarter with revenues up 2% and operating income up 9%. Full-year revenues were up 2%, and more importantly operating income was up 5%. I am especially pleased that growth in our fluid delivery and cardiovascular products more than made up for ongoing customer issues adversely impacting ophthalmic sales. GAAP net income and diluted EPS were both up 55% in the 2017 fourth quarter, and up 33% for the full year.”\nMr. Battat clarified, “Those much higher net income and EPS results were bolstered by significant and non-recurring tax benefits. In the first half of 2017, our tax rate was favorably impacted by the unusual confluence of five years’ worth of employee stock-based compensation exercises. The fourth quarter tax rate was favorably affected even more by the year-end passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced future liabilities on our balance sheet resulting from the accelerated depreciation we took on about $72 million in capital investments made over the last seven years. With this one-time, non-cash item, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was a negative 1% as compared to 28% in the prior-year period. For the full year, the collective impact of tax benefits resulted in a rate of 14% compared to 30% in 2016. However, we continue to believe that pretax metrics are the more appropriate measure of our performance.” Mr. Battat added, “As had been the case in the prior seven quarters, we did not engage in open market stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2017. Cash and long and short term investments increased by $4.6 million in the quarter, and by $20.7 million for the year, to a total of $74.7 million as of December 31, 2017.”\nCommenting on future expectations, Mr. Battat stated, “Following several years of high growth, the Company has been in a steady state for a couple of years while continuing to show our typical high returns on equity. We anticipate working through this relatively flat period in the next year, returning to progressively higher growth rates as products from the $28 million of investments in research and development over the last five years begin to make it through the lengthy processes of FDA approval and commercial adoption.” Mr. Battat added, “In 2018, while continuing to report uneven quarterly results, we expect the full year to show modest improvements in revenues and pretax income.” Mr. Battat continued, “For the full year, we anticipate an effective federal and state tax rate of 21%, substantially less than the 31% average we experienced over the last 10 years. Ironically, for most 2018 quarters, this new rate will be significantly higher than the sequential quarterly rates experienced in 2017 of 13%, 5%, 32%, and a negative 1%. Understandably, higher tax rates will negatively impact 2018 after tax net income and EPS comparisons to the prior-year periods. We will therefore continue to put the spotlight on results not affected by changes in tax rates.”\nAtrion Corporation develops and manufactures products primarily for medical applications.
