    "text": "February 10, 2018 / 9:43 PM / in 4 minutes Venus gives U.S. lead against Netherlands Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Venus Williams gave holders United States the perfect start in their Fed Cup World Group opener against the Netherlands with a 6-1 6-4 defeat of Arantxa Rus in Asheville on Saturday - her 1,000th match as a professional. \nWith sister Serena watching on from the sidelines after being selected for the team, the American veteran proved too strong for Rus as she put the home side 1-0 ahead. \nThe Czech Republic, winners in five of the last seven years, ended day one of their tie against Switzerland 2-0 ahead after Petra Kvitova beat Viktorija Golubic in three sets before Barbara Strycova eased past Belinda Bencic. \nVenus Williams, 37, was a big favorite against world number 138 Rus but was still relieved to claim her 776th career win. \n“It’s never easy and it’s always a challenge,” Venus said.
