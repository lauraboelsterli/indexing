    "text": "Feb 28 (Reuters) - New Zealandâ€™s Sky Network Television on Wednesday said half-year net profit rose 12 percent, in part aided by lower costs across core operations as a result of a smaller subscriber base.\nThe subscription television provider posted an interim net profit of NZ$66.6 million ($48.24 million) in the six months to Dec. 31, compared with NZ$59.3 million last year.\nThe company announced an interim dividend of NZ$0.075, down from the NZ$0.15 payout in the previous year.\nReporting by Devika Syamnath in Bengaluru, editing by David Evans\n ",
