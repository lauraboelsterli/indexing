For the third quarter of 2018, the calculation was based on diluted weighted average ordinary shares in issue of 577.6 million compared to 567.0 million diluted weighted average ordinary shares in issue during the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was (12.3%) compared to 19.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Ignoring the impact of net foreign exchange gains and losses, and related tax consequences, the tax rate which is used in determining adjusted earnings below, was 26.7% compared to 22.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOn a U.S. Dollar basis, and using the December 31, 2017 exchange rate of R12.3689 per U.S. Dollar, and at a ratio of 25 ordinary shares to one American Depositary Share (“ADS”), profit for the period was $4.8 million, or 21 U.S. cents per diluted ADS.\nAdjusted Earnings for the Period and Adjusted Earnings per Share: Adjusted earnings for the period, a non-IFRS measure, were R40.0 million ($3.2 million), compared to R37.4 million ($3.0 million) in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and exclude the net foreign exchange losses of R2.1 million ($0.2 million) referred to above. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 excluded the net foreign exchange loss of R4.9 million ($0.4 million) referred to above. Adjusted earnings per diluted ordinary share, also a non-IFRS measure, were 7 South African cents consistent with the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOn a U.S. Dollar basis, and using the December 31, 2017 exchange rate of R12.3689 per U.S. Dollar, and at a ratio of 25 ordinary shares to one ADS, adjusted earnings for the period was $3.2 million, or 14 U.S. cents per diluted ADS.\nStatement of Financial Position and Cash Flow: At December 31, 2017, the Company had R247.1 million ($20.0 million) of net cash and cash equivalents, compared to R356.3 million ($28.8 million) at March 31, 2017.\nThe Company generated R109.5 million ($8.9 million) in net cash from operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and invested R92.2 million ($7.5 million) in capital expenditures during the quarter (including investments in in-vehicle devices of R64.1 million or $5.2 million), leading to a free cash flow, a non-IFRS measure, of R17.3 million ($1.4 million), compared with free cash flow of R24.0 million ($1.9 million) for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Capital expenditures were R18.9 million ($1.5 million) higher than in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of increased investments in in-vehicle devices due to the continued increase in the number of bundled subscription contracts.\nBusiness Outlook\nMiX Telematics has translated U.S. Dollar amounts in this Business Outlook paragraph from South African Rand at the exchange rate of R11.9355 per $1.00, which was the R/$ exchange rate reported by Oanda.com as at January 29, 2018.\nBased on information as of today, February 1, 2018, the Company is issuing the following financial guidance for the full 2018 fiscal year:\nSubscription revenue - R1,432 million to R1,436 million ($120.0 million to $120.3 million), which would represent subscription revenue growth of 15.5% to 15.8% compared to fiscal 2017. Previous guidance was R1,420 million to R1,432 million. Total Revenue - R1,690 million to R1,695 million ($141.6 million to $142.0 million), which would represent revenue growth of 9.7% to 10.1% compared to fiscal 2017. Previous guidance was R1,661 million to R1,687 million. Adjusted EBITDA - R417 million to R428 million ($34.9 million to $35.9 million), which would represent Adjusted EBITDA growth of 38.3% to 41.9% compared to fiscal 2017. Previous guidance was R403 million to R421 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted ordinary share of 23.1 to 24.8 South African cents based on 572 million diluted ordinary shares in issue (previous guidance was 22.0 to 23.5 South African cents based on 568 million diluted ordinary shares in issue), and based on an effective tax rate of 28.0% to 31.0%. At a ratio of 25 ordinary shares to one ADS, this equates to adjusted earnings per diluted ADS of 48.4 to 51.9 U.S. cents.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the Company expects subscription revenue to be in the range of R371 million to R375 million ($31.1 million to $31.4 million), which would represent subscription revenue growth of 15.3% to 16.6% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, this represents subscription revenue growth of 17.8% to 19.1% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe key assumptions used in deriving the forecast are as follows:\nGrowth in subscription revenue and vehicles under subscription are based on expected growth rates related to market conditions and takes into account growth rates achieved previously. Achieving hardware sales according to expectations. Hardware sales are dependent on the volumes of bundled solutions selected by customers. An average forecast exchange rate for the 2018 fiscal year of R13.0300 per $1.\nThe forecast is the responsibility of the Board of Directors and has not been reviewed or reported on by the Company’s external auditors. The Company’s policy is to give guidance on a quarterly basis, if necessary, and does not update guidance between quarters.\nThe Company provides earnings guidance only on a non-IFRS basis and does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Ordinary Share guidance to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments that could be made for foreign exchange gains/(losses) and related tax consequences, restructuring costs, share-based compensation costs, and other charges reflected in the Company’s reconciliation of historic non-IFRS financial measures, the amounts of which, based on past experience, could be material.\nThe information disclosed in this “ Business Outlook ” paragraph complies with the disclosure requirements in terms of paragraph 8.38 of the JSE Listings Requirements which deals with profit forecasts.\nQuarterly Reporting Policy in respect of JSE Listings Requirements\nFollowing the listing of the Company’s ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange, the Company has adopted a quarterly reporting policy. As a result of such quarterly reporting the Company is, in terms of paragraph 3.4(b)(ix) of the JSE Listings Requirements, not required to publish trading statements in terms of paragraph 3.4(b)(i) to (viii) of the JSE Listings Requirements.\nConference Call Information\nMiX Telematics management will also host a conference call and audio webcast at 8:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) and 3:00 p.m. (South African Time) on February 1, 2018 to discuss the Company's financial results and current business outlook:\nThe live webcast of the call will be available at the “Investor Information” page of the Company’s website, http://investor.mixtelematics.com .

For more information visit www.mixtelematics.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including without limitation, statements concerning our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2018, our position to execute on our growth strategy, and our ability to expand our leadership position. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to us and on assumptions we have made. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and will be affected by a variety of risks and factors that are beyond our control including, without limitation, those described under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, as updated by other reports that the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this press release as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-IFRS financial measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding its financial results, the Company has disclosed within this press release, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure; it does not represent cash flows from operations for the periods indicated and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's results of operations or as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the profit for the period before income taxes, net finance income/(costs) including foreign exchange gains/(losses), depreciation of property, plant and equipment including capitalized customer in-vehicle devices, amortization of intangible assets including capitalized in-house development costs and intangible assets identified as part of a business combination, share-based compensation costs, restructuring costs, profits/(losses) on the disposal or impairments of assets or subsidiaries, insurance reimbursements relating to impaired assets and certain litigation costs.\nThe Company has included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in this press release because they are key measures that the Company's management and Board of Directors use to understand and evaluate its core operating performance and trends; to prepare and approve its annual budget; and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company's core business. Accordingly, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results.\nThe Company's use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to the Company; and other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including operating profit, profit for the period and our other results.\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings per Share\nAdjusted earnings per share is defined as profit attributable to owners of the parent, MiX Telematics Limited, excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) net of tax, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.\nWe have included Adjusted earnings per share in this press release because it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company's core business by excluding net foreign exchange gains/(losses) from earnings. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted earnings per share provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company's operating results.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow is determined as net cash generated from operating activities less capital expenditure for investing activities. We believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s cash flows as it provides detail of the amount of cash the Company generates or utilizes after accounting for all capital expenditures including investments in in-vehicle devices and development expenditure.\nFebruary 1, 2018\nJSE Sponsor\nJava Capital Trustees and

Dividends Paid\nIn respect of the second quarter of fiscal 2018, a dividend of R14.0 million ($1.1 million) was declared on October 31, 2017 and paid on November 27, 2017. Using shares in issue of 559,380,738 (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares), this equated to a dividend of 2.5 South African cents or 0.2 U.S. cents per share.\n9. Share Repurchase\nOn May 23, 2017, the MiX Telematics Board approved a share repurchase program of up to R270 million ($21.8 million) under which the Company may repurchase its ordinary shares, including American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”). The Company may repurchase its shares from time to time at its discretion through open market transactions and block trades, based on ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the Company, the market price of its securities and general market conditions. This share repurchase program may be discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors, and the Company has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its securities under the program. The repurchase program will be funded out of existing cash resources.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the following purchases had been made under the share repurchase program:\nFigures are in thousands unless otherwise stated South African Rand Period Total number of\nshares\nrepurchased\nAverage\nprice paid\nper share (1)\nShares canceled\nunder the share\nrepurchase program\nTotal value of shares\npurchased as part of\npublicly announced\nprogram\nMaximum value of\nshares that may yet\nbe purchased under\nthe program\nMonth June 2017 5,015,660 3.72 5,015,660 18,666 251,334 5,015,660 5,015,660 18,666 251,334 Figures are in thousands unless otherwise stated United States Dollar Period Total number of\nshares\nrepurchased\nAverage\nprice paid\nper share (1)\nShares canceled\nunder the share\nrepurchase\nprogram\nTotal value of shares\npurchased as part of\npublicly announced\nprogram\nMaximum value of\nshares that may yet\nbe purchased under\nthe program\nMonth June 2017 5,015,660 0.30 5,015,660 1,509 20,320 5,015,660 5,015,660 1,509 20,320 (1) Including transaction costs. Subsequent to the repurchase, the shares were de-listed and now form part of the authorized unissued share capital of the Company. At December 31, 2017, the Company had 562,231,288 ordinary shares of no par value in issue (excluding 40,000,000 treasury shares held by MiX Investments). No share repurchases were made during the quarter under review.\n10. Contingent Liabilities\nService agreement\nIn terms of an amended network services agreement with Mobile Telephone Networks Proprietary Limited (“MTN”), MTN is entitled to claw back payments from MiX Telematics Africa Proprietary Limited in the event of early cancellation of the agreement or certain base connections not being maintained over the term of the agreement. No connection incentives will be received in terms of the amended network services agreement. The maximum potential liability under the arrangement is R44.9 million or $3.6 million. No loss is considered probable under this arrangement.\n11. Taxation\nSection 11D allowances relating to tax assets recognized\nMiX Telematics International Proprietary Limited (“MiX International”), a subsidiary of the Group, historically claimed a 150% allowance for research and development spend in terms of section 11D (“S11D”) of the South African Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962 (“the Act”). As of October 1, 2012, the legislation relating to the allowance was amended. The amendment requires pre-approval of development project expenditure on a project specific basis by the South African Department of Science and Technology (“DST”) in order to claim a deduction of the additional 50% over and above the expenditure incurred (150% allowance). Since the amendments to S11D of the Act, MiX International had been claiming the 150% deduction resulting in a recognized tax benefit. MiX International has complied with the amended legislation by submitting all required documentation to the DST in a timely manner, commencing in October 2012.\nIn June 2014, correspondence was received from the DST indicating that the research and development expenditure on certain projects for which the 150% allowance was claimed in the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years did not, in the DST’s opinion, constitute qualifying expenditure in terms of the Act. MiX International, through due legal process, had formally requested a review of the DST’s decision not to approve this expenditure. While approvals were obtained for a portion of this project expenditure as a result of a further review performed by the DST in February 2017, we continue to seek approval for the remaining projects and as such the legal process is ongoing. In addition to the approvals that were subject to the legal process, further approvals have been obtained for certain project expenditure, relating to both current and prior financial years. However, at period end, an uncertain tax position remains in relation to S11D deductions in respect of which approvals remain pending.\nSince the introduction of the DST pre-approval process, the Group has recognized in the income statement cumulative tax incentives in addition to the incurred cost of R20.1 million ($1.6 million) in respect of S11D deductions, of which R0.4 million ($0.03 million) was recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2017. R17.3 million ($1.4 million) relates to deductions in respect of development project expenditure which has been approved by the DST. R2.8 million ($0.2 million) relates to an uncertain tax position in respect of projects where approvals have not yet been received from the DST. If the Group is unsuccessful in this regard, the Group will not recover the R2.8 million ($0.2 million) raised at December 31, 2017.\n12. Dividend Declared\nOn January 30, 2018 the Board declared that in respect of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which ended on December 31, 2017, a dividend of 2.5 South African cents (0.2 U.S. cents) per ordinary share to be paid on Monday, February 26, 2018.\nThe details with respect to the dividends declared for ordinary shareholders are as follows:\nLast day to trade cum dividend\nTuesday, February 20, 2018 Securities trade ex dividend Wednesday, February 21, 2018 Record date Friday, February 23, 2018 Payment date Monday, February 26, 2018 Share certificates may not be dematerialized or rematerialized between Wednesday, February 21, 2018 and Friday, February 23, 2018, both days inclusive.\nShareholders are advised of the following additional information:\nthe dividend has been declared out of income reserves; the local dividends tax rate is 20%; the gross local dividend amounts to 2.5 South African cents per ordinary share; the net local dividend amount is 2.0 South African cents per ordinary share for shareholders liable to pay dividends tax; the issued ordinary share capital of MiX Telematics is 602,231,288 ordinary shares of no par value; and the Company’s tax reference number is 9155/661/84/7.\nThe details with respect to the dividends declared for holders of our ADSs are as follows:\nEx dividend on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\nThursday, February 22, 2018 Record date Friday, February 23, 2018 Approximate date of currency conversion Monday, February 26, 2018 Approximate dividend payment date Thursday, March 8, 2018\n13.
