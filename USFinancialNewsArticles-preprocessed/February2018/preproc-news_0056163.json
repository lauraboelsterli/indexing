    "text": "Helsinn Group announces the appointment of\nPaul Rittman as Chief Executive Officer, Helsinn Therapeutics (HTU)\nLugano, Switzerland February 27, 2018 - Helsinn, a Swiss pharmaceutical group focused on building quality cancer care products, today announces that Paul Rittman has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer of its U.S. subsidiary, Helsinn Therapeutics, replacing William Mann, who steps down on February 28, 2018.\nMr. Rittman, who takes up his position on March 5, 2018, brings a wealth of pharmaceutical industry experience with internationally-based companies in commercial and general management roles, and most recently as Senior Vice President and General Manager, U.S. Oncology, leading Teva Pharmaceuticals' U.S. oncology activities for its branded products operation, where he has also previously held a number of other senior commercial roles. Prior to this he worked in a number of roles at Intrabiotics, Aventis/Hoechst Marion Roussel Pharmaceuticals and its predecessor companies.\nRiccardo Braglia, Helsinn Group Vice Chairman and CEO, commented: \"I am delighted to welcome aboard Paul Rittman, who has over 30 years' experience in pharmaceutical sales and marketing within oncology and across a range of disease areas in North America. I am sure his expertise, experience and network will prove invaluable in this key commercial moment for the Helsinn Group.\n\"I would also like to express my gratitude to William Mann for his leadership in establishing Helsinn Therapeutics, successfully transforming it from a small R&D-focused entity in 2009 into a commercial company with over 100 employees that became profitable in 2016, and we wish him the very best for the future.\"\nPaul Rittman, Chief Executive Officer of Helsinn Therapeutics, commented: \"I have always been impressed with Helsinn's core values of quality, integrity and respect and so I am delighted to be joining at this time. Helsinn is an international pharmaceutical business strongly committed to growth through investing in oncology while working to improving the everyday lives of people with cancer. I am excited to be part of this team and journey.\n\"Given the focus of Helsinn Therapeutics on both oncology therapeutics and supportive care, one of my first priorities will be to further expand the commercial presence of Helsinn in the U.S.\"\nEND\nAbout the Helsinn Group\nHelsinn is a privately owned pharmaceutical group with an extensive portfolio of marketed cancer care products and a robust drug development pipeline.
