    "text": " 14 AM / Updated 8 minutes ago Generic drugmaker Endo's loss narrows as impairment charges drop Reuters Staff 1 Min Read Feb 27 (Reuters) - Generic drugmaker Endo International Plc reported a smaller fourth-quarter loss on Tuesday, due to lower asset impairment charges. Net loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to $368.4 million, or $1.65 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.34 billion, or $14.98 per share, a year earlier. The Dublin, Ireland-based company recorded asset impairment charges of $130.45 million in the latest quarter, much less than the $3.52 billion charges it took a year ago.
