These forward-looking statements, which may be identified by words such as “will,” “continue” and “plan,” and similar words, phrases or expressions indicating belief or prospective events, are based on current expectations and beliefs of the management of Sigma Designs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, such management, and involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Sigma Designs’ and its management’s control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on such statements.\nParticular risks and uncertainties that could materially affect future results and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include any risks associated with Sigma Designs’ continued process to divest its remaining assets and its plan to complete its previously announced liquidation plan, such as: (1) the risk that Sigma Designs’ liquidation plan and planned divestitures of assets, including the timing of such planned events, is affected or delayed by external events beyond the control of Sigma Designs or by third parties involved in such transactions, (2) the risk that any conditions to the closing of any transactions required to complete the planned divestitures and/or planned liquidation are not satisfied; (3) uncertainties as to the timing of the consummation of such transactions and the ability of each party involved to consummate such transactions; (4) risks that the planned divestitures and/or planned liquidation disrupts the current plans and operations of Sigma Designs; (5) unexpected costs, charges or expenses, or unexpected tax consequences, resulting from the planned divestitures and/or planned liquidation; (6) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from Sigma Designs’ continued process towards completing the planned divestitures and/or planned liquidation; and (7) the ability of Sigma Designs to continue to explore ways to increase the available cash for distribution to shareholders through the planned divestitures and planned liquidation.\nThe foregoing review of important factors that could cause actual events to differ from expectations should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with Sigma Designs’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the risks set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of Sigma Designs’ public reports filed with the SEC, including its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017, which you may obtain for free at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov , and which discuss additional important risk factors that may affect Sigma Designs’ business, results of operations and financial conditions.

In addition, Sigma Designs may be subject to currently unforeseen risks that may have a materially adverse impact on it. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that the actual events and results will not be materially different than the anticipated results described in the forward-looking statements.
