Chairman and CEO Scott Thompson commented, \"The team is pleased to report our 2017 adjusted EBITDA was at the high end of our guidance despite rising commodity costs. Tempur-Pedic sales in North America grew 19 percent in the quarter excluding Mattress Firm, demonstrating brand strength even as the current Tempur-Pedic products reach the fourth year of their lifecycle. In addition, our North American direct to customer channel grew 56 percent, demonstrating our ability to change with consumers' purchasing habits.\"\n\"We enter 2018 as a much stronger company, supported by a diversified base of retail partners and a growing direct to consumer business. Our manufacturing operations have never been stronger, and we are incredibly excited about our innovative new product lineup, which will enable our retail partners to succeed by driving higher average selling prices.\"\nFourth Quarter Business Segment Highlights (1)\nThe Company's business segments include North America and International. Corporate operating expenses are not included in either of the business segments and are presented separately as a reconciling item to consolidated results.\nNorth America net sales decreased 22.1% to $485.5 million from $623.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a constant currency basis (2) , North America net sales decreased 22.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin increased to 39.8% as compared to 39.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating margin was 13.7% as compared to 16.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAt the beginning of the second quarter of 2017, the Company terminated its contracts with Mattress Firm, Inc. (\"Mattress Firm\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. (\"Steinhoff\"). In the fourth quarter of 2016, net sales to Mattress Firm were $155.7 million. Excluding Mattress Firm sales in the prior year, North America net sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by growth of Tempur-Pedic product sales, which increased approximately 19% in the period.\nNorth America net sales through the wholesale channel decreased $150.2 million or 25.0% to $451.1 million. Excluding Mattress Firm sales in the prior year, the wholesale channel increased 1% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. North America net sales through the direct channel increased $12.3 million or 55.7% to $34.4 million, primarily driven by an increase of more than 90% in web sales as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNorth America adjusted gross margin (2) improved 30 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was driven primarily by operational improvements, lower floor model discounts and favorable product and channel mix. This was partially offset by significant commodity cost inflation and fixed cost deleverage on lower unit volume. North America adjusted operating margin (2) declined 290 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decline in adjusted operating margin was driven by unfavorable operating expense leverage.\nInternational net sales increased 10.2% to $162.7 million from $147.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a constant currency basis (2) , International net sales increased 6.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin was 49.2% as compared to 48.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating margin increased to 20.3% as compared to 15.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInternational net sales through the wholesale channel increased $12.2 million or 10.1% to $132.7 million and sales through the direct channel increased $2.8 million or 10.3% to $30.0 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInternational adjusted gross margin (2) improved 40 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by operational improvements and favorable channel mix, partially offset by commodity cost inflation. International adjusted operating margin (2) improved 130 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, driven primarily by improved operating expense leverage.\nIn 2017, International operating income includes $4.6 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to the wind down of certain Latin American operations and leadership termination charges. As discussed below under \"Revisions of Previously Issued Financial Statements\", the Company has revised its prior year financial statements to correct certain immaterial errors relating to its Latin American operations. In 2016, International operating income includes $4.1 million of charges associated with this issue.\nCorporate operating expense decreased 6.8% to $20.5 million from $22.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company reported $41.9 million in cash and $1.8 billion in total debt, as compared to $65.7 million in cash and $1.9 billion in total debt as of December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Guidance\nFor the full year 2018, the Company currently expects adjusted EBITDA (2) to range from $450 million to $500 million.\nThe Company noted its expectations are based on information available at the time of this release, and are subject to changing conditions, many of which are outside the Company's control.\nThe Company also noted that its 2018 outlook for adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability. The Company further noted that it is unable to reconcile this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP net income, its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure, without unreasonable efforts, because the Company is currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact GAAP net income in 2018 but would not impact adjusted EBITDA. These items that impact comparability may include restructuring activities, foreign currency exchange rates, income taxes (including the impact of U.S. Tax Reform), and other items. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company's full year 2018 GAAP financial results.\nConference Call Information\nTempur Sealy International, Inc. will host a live conference call to discuss financial results today, February 22, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

As a result, the Company terminated the senior leadership team of this subsidiary. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company conducted a thorough review of certain of its Latin American operations and internal controls over financial reporting previously operating under the former leadership. As a result of this review, during the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company identified accounting and operational irregularities that violated Company policies, and corrected certain errors impacting its current and prior year financial statements. These errors were associated with a Latin American subsidiary, and the errors were immaterial to each of the prior reporting periods affected. However, the Company concluded that the cumulative effect of correcting the errors in fiscal year 2017 would materially misstate the Company's consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Accordingly, the financial results for the prior year have been revised. Additional charges have been recorded for prior years 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in the amounts of $10.5 million, $7.9 million, $5.7 million, and $15.8 million, respectively. The Company's revised 2016 financial statements are presented herein. The impact of correcting these errors in years preceding 2016 will be reflected in the Company's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAll amounts presented for 2016 reflect revisions to correct certain immaterial errors related to a subsidiary in Latin America.\nTEMPUR SEALY INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n(in millions, except percentages, ratios and per common share amounts)\nThe Company provides information regarding adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income (expense), adjusted operating margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated funded debt and consolidated funded debt less qualified cash, and free cash flow, which are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income and earnings per share as a measure of operating performance or an alternative to total debt. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors with performance measures that better reflect the Company's underlying operations and trends, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income and operating income. The adjustments management makes to derive the non-GAAP measures include adjustments to exclude items that may cause short-term fluctuations in the nearest GAAP measure, but which management does not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of the Company's business, including the exclusion of charges associated with the Mattress Firm termination in the first quarter of 2017, charges related to the Company's Latin American operations and other costs.\nThe Company believes that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying results from continuing operations and trends, and management uses these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage the Company's business, to evaluate its consolidated and business segment performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, to establish operational goals and to provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes. Limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures include that these measures do not present all of the amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with GAAP and these non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be construed as more significant than comparable measures defined by GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For more information about these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure, please refer to the reconciliations on the following pages.\nConstant Currency Information\nIn this press release the Company refers to, and in other press releases and other communications with investors the Company may refer to, net sales or earnings or other historical financial information on a \"constant currency basis,\" which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These references to constant currency basis do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. To provide information on a constant currency basis, the applicable financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior corresponding period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS\nA reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income and a calculation of adjusted EPS are provided below. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional useful information with respect to the impact of various adjustments as described in the footnotes at the end of this release.\nAll amounts presented for 2016 reflect revisions to correct certain immaterial errors related to a subsidiary in Latin America.\nPlease refer to Footnotes at the end of this release.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of the Company's GAAP net income to adjusted net income and a calculation of adjusted EPS for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nGAAP net income\n$\n49.7\n$\n52.9\nLatin American subsidiary charges (2)\n12.7\n10.5\nRestructuring costs (3)\n—\n8.3\nOther costs (4)\n0.4\n—\nStock compensation benefit (5)\n—\n(3.8)\nTax adjustments (6)\n(19.4)\n(1.4)\nAdjusted net income\n$\n43.4\n$\n66.5\nAdjusted earnings per common share, diluted\n$\n0.79\n$\n1.18\nDiluted shares outstanding\n54.8\n56.5\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of the Company's GAAP net income to adjusted net income and a calculation of adjusted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nYear Ended\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nGAAP net income\n$\n152.7\n$\n191.6\nLatin American subsidiary charges (7)\n24.4\n10.5\nCustomer termination charges (1)\n25.9\n—\nOther costs (4)\n3.4\n—\nRestructuring costs (3)\n—\n8.3\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (8)\n—\n47.2\nExecutive management transition and retention compensation (9)\n—\n3.0\nInterest expense (10)\n—\n2.1\nIntegration costs (11)\n—\n2.0\nStock compensation benefit (5)\n—\n(3.8)\nTax adjustments (6)\n(31.2)\n(18.5)\nAdjusted net income\n$\n175.2\n$\n242.4\nAdjusted earnings per common share, diluted\n$\n3.20\n$\n4.05\nDiluted shares outstanding\n54.7\n59.8\nAll amounts presented for 2016 reflect revisions to correct certain immaterial errors related to a subsidiary in Latin America.\nPlease refer to Footnotes at the end of this release.\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Gross Margin and Adjusted Operating Income (Expense) and Operating Margin\nA reconciliation of GAAP gross profit and gross margin to adjusted gross profit and gross margin, respectively, and GAAP operating income (expense) and operating margin to adjusted operating income (expense) and operating margin, respectively, is provided below.
