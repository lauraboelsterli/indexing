Clint Capela had 13 points while Gerald Green chipped in 12 off the bench.\nRichardson set career highs with 30 points and seven 3-pointers for Miami. Dragic also had 30 points, and Hassan Whiteside added 16 points and 17 rebounds.\nMiami lost its fifth straight.\nThe Heat were without Kelly Olynyk and Wayne Ellington, who were both nursing sore shoulders. It was the first game missed by both players.\nHouston’s Trevor Ariza missed his fifth straight game with a hamstring injury.\nHarden has been on a hot streak recently, recording a 60-point, 11-assist, 10-rebound triple-double against the Orlando Magic on Jan. 30. The output marked the first 60-point triple-double in NBA history.\nHe is also the Western Conference’s reigning Player of the Week, winning the award for the fourth time this season.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
