    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 1:59 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago Speed skating: Wust powers to 1,500m gold for record 10th medal Simon Jennings 2 Min Read \nGANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Ireen Wust of the Netherlands claimed a record 10th Olympic speed skating medal when she surged to gold in the women’s 1,500 meters at the Gangneung Oval on Monday. \nWust, who is also the first Dutch athlete to win five Olympic gold medals, crossed the line in one minute 54.35 seconds, with Japan’s Miho Takagi taking the silver and another Dutch skater Marrit Leenstra winning bronze. Slideshow (8 Images) \nWust’s second medal of the Games after her heartbreak in the 3,000m on Saturday where she finished 0.08 seconds behind compatriot Carlijn Achtereekte, lifted her past Germany’s Claudia Pechstein to stand alone as the most successful speed skater in history. \nThe 31-year-old Wust ran out of steam on the last lap of the 3,000m but made no mistake in the shorter distance, powering around the course to claim a second career 1,500m Olympic gold after her victory in Vancouver eight years ago. \nStanding on the podium Wust, who will call time on her glittering career after the Olympics, raised her arms and jumped into the air after cementing her place in history.
