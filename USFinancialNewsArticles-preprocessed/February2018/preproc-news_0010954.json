    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- JTV (Jewelry Television ® ), the leading omni-digital retailer dedicated to the jewelry and gemstones industry, announced its digital presence continued to grow rapidly with a 115% increase in unique user visits while mobile revenue increased 25% from the prior year.\nJTV realized a 6.2%, increase in same-store sales growth in the holiday months of 2017 (November – December 2017), nearly double overall retail performance, and delivering record profitability.\nJTV attributes this strong quarterly growth to a strategy that lessened the reliance on incentives and promotions.
