    "text": "On Wednesday, financial services firm Barclays released its 2017 annual report , which revealed that female employees of the company are paid roughly half, on average, of what male employees are paid.\nThe 326-page report indicates that female employees across Barclays' international workforce earn 48 percent less than their male coworkers on average. \nBonuses were also significantly lower for women. Over 93 percent of both female and male Barclays International employees receive a bonus, but female employees received bonuses that were a staggering 78.7 percent lower than their male peers.\nTolga Akmen/AFP | Getty Images \nBarclays suggests that these findings are a result of fewer women in high-paying leadership roles. Across the 79,900 members of Barclays' global workforce — of which 45,100 are male, 34,800 female — there are currently 401 senior management positions held by male employees, compared to just 154 held by female employees.
