    "text": "Stabilized Occupancy of 98.5 Percent\n19.9 Percent Rent Growth on Leases for the Fourth Quarter\n2018 Guidance Issued\nINDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Duke Realty Corporation (NYSE:DRE), the largest pure-play, domestic only, industrial REIT, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nJim Connor, Chairman and CEO said, \"In looking back, 2017 has proved to be one of the most transformational years in company history, as we divested of our medical office business and repositioned ourselves as a pure-play industrial REIT while providing a return of capital to our shareholders through an $0.85 per share special dividend. I'm pleased to report we concluded 2017 with an exceptional fourth quarter of operating performance and continued redeployment of capital into high-quality industrial assets. We increased stabilized occupancy to 98.5 percent, renewed leases at a very impressive 91.4 percent retention rate, increased rents by 19.9 percent on new and renewal leases, and increased same property net operating income by 3.2 percent during the quarter. We have also backfilled all 750,000 square feet that we previously leased to hhgregg, which is a testament both to the strength of the industrial real estate market and the quality of our market level professionals.\"\nQuarterly Highlights\n• Net income per diluted share was $0.52 for the quarter and $4.56 for the year. Funds from Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), was $0.33 for the quarter and $1.27 for the year. Core Funds from Operations (“Core FFO”) per diluted share was $0.30 for the quarter and $1.24 for the year.\n• Operating performance within the company's industrial portfolio:\nTotal stabilized occupancy at December 31, 2017 of 98.5 percent compared to 98.0 percent at September 30, 2017 and 98.1 percent at December 31, 2016 Total in-service occupancy at December 31, 2017 of 95.7 percent compared to 95.7 percent at September 30, 2017 and 97.7 percent at December 31, 2016 Total occupancy, including properties under development, of 93.8 percent at December 31, 2017 compared to 93.2 percent at September 30, 2017 and 95.6 percent at December 31, 2016 Tenant retention of 91.4 percent for the quarter and 80.5 percent for the year Same-property net operating income growth of 3.2 percent and 4.0 percent for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 Total leasing activity of 7.8 million square feet for the quarter and 23.7 million square feet for the year Overall rent growth on new and renewal leases of 19.9 percent for the quarter and 19.2 percent for the year\n• Successful execution of capital transactions in the fourth quarter:\nIssued $300 million of unsecured notes maturing in December 2027 at a stated rate of 3.375 percent Extended the company's $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility from January 2019 to January 2022 at a variable rate (subject to adjustment) of LIBOR plus .875 percent Completed $248 million of building dispositions during the quarter and $3.1 billion during the year Completed $367 million in acquisitions of eight bulk industrial buildings during the quarter bringing total acquisitions for the year to $997 million Started three new industrial development projects with expected costs of $207 million for the quarter bringing the total expected costs of development starts for the year to $866 million\nMark Denien, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"We are entering 2018 with significant balance sheet capacity to finance future growth. At the end of 2017 we had $116 million of cash held in escrow for future 1031 exchanges, $427 million in interest-bearing notes receivable, of which various notes totaling $145 million are scheduled to mature at various points throughout 2018, and had no borrowings on our unsecured line of credit.\nWith the previously announced $300 million unsecured note issuance, which we executed at a favorable 3.375 percent coupon rate, we have reduced our ongoing borrowing costs and optimally sequenced our future debt maturities. In total we have approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of liquidity and balance sheet capacity to fund additional real estate investments without any equity needs and still maintain our leverage metrics within our current ratings level.\"\nFinancial Performance\nA complete reconciliation, in dollars and per share amounts, of net income to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, as well as to Core FFO, is included in the financial tables included in this release.\nNet income was $0.52 per diluted share, or $188 million, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.13 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increased net income per diluted share for the quarter was primarily the result of gains on property sales. Net income for the full year 2017 was $4.56 per diluted share, or $1.65 billion compared to $0.88 per diluted share, or $315 million, for the full year 2016. The increased net income per diluted share for the full year was also primarily the result of gains on property sales.\nFFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $0.33 per diluted share, or $119 million, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.29 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increased FFO per diluted share for the quarter was primarily due to the loss on debt extinguishment in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the early redemption of $130 million of unsecured notes. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $1.27 per diluted share, or $460 million, for the full year 2017 compared to $1.21 per diluted share for the full year 2016. The increased FFO per diluted share for the full year was primarily due to lower losses on debt extinguishment and land impairment charges during 2017 in addition to an overall improvement in key operating metrics.\nCore FFO was $0.30 per diluted share, or $110 million, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Core FFO was $1.24 per diluted share, or $450 million, for the full year 2017 compared to $1.20 for the full year 2016. The increase in Core FFO for the full year was due to lower interest expense in 2017, as disposition proceeds were used to significantly reduce leverage.\nReal Estate Investment Activity\nMr. Connor further stated, \"We finished the quarter with an 8.5 million square foot development pipeline, with total expected stabilized project costs of $676 million. Even after starting $207 million of developments during the quarter, which were 12 percent pre-leased, we ended the year with a very solid pre-leasing level of 63 percent for our development pipeline, which demonstrates our disciplined approach to starting speculative developments in high-demand markets and our ability to execute the lease up of those projects.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we also completed our previously announced portfolio acquisition from Bridge Development Partners LLC (the \"Bridge Portfolio\") as well as three additional industrial properties.\"\nAcquisitions\nThe company completed the remaining tranches of the Bridge Portfolio acquisition during the quarter, which consisted of five bulk distribution properties totaling 1.8 million square feet in Northern New Jersey. Additionally, a 32-acre development parcel in Northern New Jersey was acquired, upon which development of a new property immediately commenced.\nThe company also acquired two bulk distribution properties in Houston totaling 772,000 square feet, which were 100 percent leased, and a 100 percent leased 71,000 square foot industrial property in the South Bay sub-market of Los Angeles.\nDevelopment\nThe fourth quarter included the following development activity:\nDuring the quarter, the company started $207 million of wholly owned development projects totaling 1.3 million square feet, which were 12 percent pre-leased in total. These wholly owned development starts were comprised of a 659,000 square foot speculative development project in Northern New Jersey on land acquired during the quarter as part of the Bridge Portfolio acquisition; a speculative project in Southern California totaling 282,000 square feet; and a 44 percent pre-leased project in Houston totaling 368,000 square feet. Seven projects totaling 3.0 million square feet, which were 83 percent leased, were placed in service during the quarter.\nBuilding Dispositions\nBuilding dispositions totaled $248 million in the fourth quarter and included the following wholly owned properties:\nOne medical office building, totaling 363,000 square feet, which represented the last of the medical office buildings expected to be sold during 2017 The company's sole remaining suburban office property in South Florida, totaling 144,000 square feet One non-strategic industrial property in Columbus, OH totaling one million square feet\nDistributions Declared\nThe company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash distribution on its common stock of $0.20 per share, or $0.80 per share on an annualized basis. The fourth quarter dividend will be payable on February 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 15, 2018.\n2018 Earnings Guidance\nA reconciliation of the company's per share guidance for diluted net income per common share to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, and to Core FFO is included in the financial tables to this release. The company issued guidance for net income of $0.68 to $0.98 per diluted share. The company issued guidance for FFO, as defined by NAREIT, of $1.24 to $1.32 per diluted share.\nCommenting on the company's 2018 outlook, Mr. Connor stated, \"We are introducing 2018 guidance for Core FFO of $1.24 to $1.30 per diluted share. Our 2018 Core FFO guidance is based on the anticipation that we will continue to experience strong leasing and development results across our markets and will have redeployed substantially all of the proceeds from the medical office disposition and returned to normal leverage levels by the second half of 2018. Our guidance for growth in Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\"), on a share adjusted basis, ranges from 2.7 percent to 8.2 percent and is driven largely by the same reasons as the growth in Core FFO.\nOur guidance for 2018 same property NOI growth reflects a change in methodology, as we disclosed a couple of weeks ago, whereby our same property population will be defined at the beginning of each calendar year and will include only buildings that were stabilized as of the beginning of the prior calendar year. Our guidance for same property NOI growth ranges from 3.25 percent to 4.75 percent and the projected growth is anticipated to be from continued strong rental rate increases as our stabilized occupancy levels are expected to decrease slightly from our current record levels.\nWe expect the continued redeployment of the medical office disposition proceeds in 2018 to primarily be in the form of development, as opposed to acquisitions, with our guidance for development starts ranging between $500 million and $700 million. This modest decline in development starts from 2017 is largely due to beginning 2018 with a significant backlog of development projects currently under construction as well as continuing a disciplined approach to managing lease-up risk and maintaining our development pipeline at a healthy level of pre-leasing.\"\nRanges for the other key assumptions underlying this updated guidance are as follows:\nDispositions of non-strategic properties in a range of $300 million to $500 million with the proceeds primarily used to fund development Acquisitions of properties in a range of $100 million to $500 million Average percent leased of our stabilized portfolio ranging from 97.1 percent to 98.1 percent General and administrative expenses ranging from $57 million to $53 million\nMore specific assumptions and components of the company's 2018 guidance will be available by 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time today through the Investor Relations section of the company's website.\nFFO and AFFO Reporting Definitions\nFFO: FFO is computed in accordance with standards established by NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) excluding gains (losses) on sales of depreciable property, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets; plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. The company believes FFO to be most directly comparable to net income as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The company believes that FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income (as defined by GAAP) as presented in the financial statements accompanying this release. FFO does not represent a measure of liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available for the company’s cash needs, including the company’s ability to make cash distributions to shareholders.\nCore FFO: Core FFO is computed as FFO adjusted for certain items that are generally non-cash in nature and that materially distort the comparative measurement of company performance over time. The adjustments include gains on sale of undeveloped land, impairment charges not related to depreciable real estate assets, tax expenses or benefits related to (i) changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, (ii) changes in tax exposure accruals that were established as the result of the adoption of new accounting principles, or (iii) taxable income (loss) related to other items excluded from FFO or Core FFO (collectively referred to as “other income tax items”), gains (losses) on debt transactions, gains (losses) on and related costs of acquisitions, gains on sale of merchant buildings, promote income and severance charges related to major overhead restructuring activities. Although the company’s calculation of Core FFO differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, the company believes it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of its operating performance.\nAFFO: AFFO is a supplemental performance measure defined by the company as Core FFO (as defined above), less recurring building improvements and total second generation capital expenditures (the leasing of vacant space that had previously been under lease by the company is referred to as second generation lease activity) related to leases commencing during the reporting period and adjusted for certain non-cash items including straight line rental income and expense, non-cash components of interest expense and stock compensation expense, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nSame-Property Performance\nThe company includes same-property net operating income growth as a property-level supplemental measure of performance. The company utilizes same-property net operating income growth as a supplemental measure to evaluate property-level performance, and jointly-controlled properties are included at the company's ownership percentage.\nA reconciliation of net income from continuing operations to same property net operating income is included in the financial tables to this release. A description of the properties that are excluded from the company’s same-property net operating income measure is included on page 17 of its December 31, 2017 supplemental information.\nAbout Duke Realty Corporation\nDuke Realty Corporation owns and operates approximately 146 million rentable square feet of industrial assets in 21 major logistics markets.
