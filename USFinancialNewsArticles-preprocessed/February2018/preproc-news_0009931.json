    "text": "Check out the companies making headlines after the bell Monday : \nLululemon Athletica shares dropped nearly 3 percent in extended trading. The athletic apparel retailer announced the resignation of CEO Laurent Potdevin on Monday . The company stated that Potdevin fell short of the company's standards of conduct. He will receive a $3.5 million lump sum payment under a separation agreement. \nCirrus Logic stock tanked in extended trading, falling more than 12 percent before slightly recovering down 10.56 percent. The semiconductor supplier announced disappointing third-quarter results, reporting revenue of $482.7 million and earnings of $1.59 per share. Analysts expected revenue of $531 million and EPS of $1.78.\nShares of Skyworks Solutions rose over 2 percent in the extended session. The semiconductor supplier's revenue and earnings exceeded analyst expectations, following strong global demand for its wireless communications engines. The company also announced a new $1 billion stock buyback plan and raised cash return targets to shareholders.\nEverest Re shares climbed 6.72 percent after the bell. The reinsurance company's profits grew as it reported a rise in premiums written. Revenue just beat analyst expectations and EPS reached a record high of $13.85.",
