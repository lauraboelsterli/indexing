    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DPW Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, announced today that it still anticipates the Company’s gross consolidated revenues for 2018 will range from $44 to $49 million thus maintaining its original revenue guidance reported on January 4, 2018. The Company highlighted the diversification of its subsidiaries that span multiple sectors with a wide customer base of commercial clients and government agencies. DPW’s consolidated revenues are derived from manufacturing advanced power supplies and solutions for commercial, medical, military and aerospace applications as well as from financial and other services provided. These varied revenue streams have continued to sustain DPW’s performance projections and planned growth despite the recent volatility with the top cryptocurrencies that has generated concern within the crypto-marketplace. DPW noted it has received many inquiries from investors and shareholders during the past month.\nCoolisys Technologies, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, remains committed to completing its acquisition of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (“Enertec”), the Israeli-based defense/aerospace electronics manufacturer supplying advance power solutions and systems during the 2018 current quarter. Enertec remains one of the key factors that supports the current revenue guidance.\n“We remain committed to our holding company business model as well as our acquisition and organic growth strategies. One of our corporate strengths is our diversification,” said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the Company’s CEO and Chairman. Ault continued, “With any disruptive new technology there is a healthy vetting process. We would argue the recent downturn of cryptocurrencies is a positive step, necessary for its longevity and success. We believe in the long-term value proposition of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. DPW is dedicated to our crypto-mining efforts and to our development and manufacturing products and services for the crypto-marketplace.”\nThe Company reminds all shareholders, investors and the public it will be hosting its next webcast on Wednesday, February 21, 2018 after the close of the financial markets. The webcast’s guest speaker will be Philip Mansour, the President and CEO of Avalanche International Corp, the parent company of MTIX, Ltd. (“MTIX”). Mr. Mansour will address the progress of the MTIX $50 million purchase order and on DPW’s investment in MTIX and their patented, proprietary Multiplex Laser Surface Enhancement (MLSE®) technology. The Company encourages everyone interested in the future of DPW to participate in the webcast.\nAbout DPW Holdings, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Fremont, CA, DPW Holdings, Inc., www.DPWHoldings.com , is a diversified holding company that, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Coolisys Technologies, Inc., is dedicated to providing world-class technology-based solutions where innovation is the main driver for mission-critical applications and lifesaving services.
