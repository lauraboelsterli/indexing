Much of this momentum is a result of our focus on and execution within our student-serving processes and initiatives. Our cash balances are expected to grow in 2018 and allow us to continue investing in our students and employees. Overall, we remain committed to improving student experiences, retention and academic outcomes and are executing well against our objective of sustainable and responsible growth.”\nREVENUE\nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, total revenue was $143.1 million and $596.4 million, respectively, representing a decrease of 7.8 percent and 15.3 percent, respectively, compared to total revenue of $155.3 million and $704.4 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by declining revenues within our teach-out campuses. There are seven campuses remaining to complete their teach-outs during 2018.\nTotal revenue for the University Group was $142.4 million and $569.6 million representing an increase of 5.0 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the respective prior year periods.\nFor the Quarter Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, Increase Increase Revenue ($ in thousands)\n2017 2016 (Decrease) 2017 2016 (Decrease) CTU $ 94,767 $ 94,696 0.1 % $ 371,325 $ 369,319 0.5 % AIU 47,633 40,909 16.4 % 198,251 193,032 2.7 % Total University Group\n142,400 135,605 5.0 % 569,576 562,351 1.3 % Corporate and Other — — NM — — NM Subtotal 142,400 135,605 5.0 % 569,576 562,351 1.3 % All Other Campuses (1) 718 19,650 -96.3 % 26,859 142,041 -81.1 % Total $ 143,118 $ 155,255 -7.8 % $ 596,435 $ 704,392 -15.3 % (1)\nCampuses included in All Other Campuses are in the process of being taught out or have completed their teach-out as of December 31, 2017. Previously, these campuses were reported within two segments, the former Transitional Group and Culinary Arts segments.\nTOTAL AND NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS\nAs of the end of 2017, total student enrollments for the University Group were 34,700 compared to 33,600 as of the prior year end representing a 3.3 percent increase . The increase in new and total student enrollments is primarily driven by our investments in student serving processes and operations that support growth.\nAs of December 31, Increase Total Student Enrollments 2017 2016 (Decrease) CTU 22,100 21,900 0.9 % AIU 12,600 11,700 7.7 % Total University Group 34,700 33,600 3.3 % All Other Campuses (1) 100 3,000 NM Total 34,800 36,600 -4.9 % For the Quarter Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, Increase Increase New Student Enrollments\n2017 2016 (Decrease) 2017 2016 (Decrease) CTU (2) 5,940 5,530 7.4 % 22,110 20,770 6.5 % AIU (2) 4,770 3,750 27.2 % 15,790 14,350 10.0 % Total University Group (2) 10,710 9,280 15.4 % 37,900 35,120 7.9 % All Other Campuses (1) — — NM — 1,080 NM Total 10,710 9,280 15.4 % 37,900 36,200 4.7 % (1)\nAll Other Campuses no longer enroll new students; students who re-enter after 365 days are reported as new student enrollments.\n(2)\nFor the first half of 2017, new student enrollments were positively impacted by a change to how the Company records certain cancelled students. Excluding the impact of this change new student enrollments would have increased 6.2% for CTU, increased 8.3% for AIU and increased 7.1% for the University Group for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year.\nOPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded operating income of $10.7 million and $34.1 million, respectively, compared to operating loss of $55.9 million and $32.3 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Total University Group and Corporate recorded operating income of $25.5 million and $95.5 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to operating loss of $17.9 million and operating income of $44.7 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nThe operating income reported for the current year improved by $66.5 million primarily driven by reduced operating expenses associated with the substantial completion of the teach-out of our All Other Campuses segment, as well as continued optimization of our marketing and advertising spend. Additionally, the prior year included legal settlement charges of $32.0 million as compared to $6.5 million in the current year.\nFor the Quarter Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, Increase Increase Operating Income ($ in thousands)\n2017 2016 (Decrease) 2017 2016 (Decrease) CTU $ 30,553 $ 28,719 6.4 % $ 109,202 $ 99,412 9.8 % AIU 414 (38,634 ) 101.1 % 8,401 (29,598 ) 128.4 % Total University Group 30,967 (9,915 ) 412.3 % 117,603 69,814 68.5 % Corporate and Other (5,472 ) (7,937 ) 31.1 % (22,067 ) (25,097 ) 12.1 % Subtotal 25,495 (17,852 ) 242.8 % 95,536 44,717 113.6 % All Other Campuses (14,783 ) (38,055 ) 61.2 % (61,400 ) (77,061 ) 20.3 % Total $ 10,712 $ (55,907 ) 119.2 % $ 34,136 $ (32,344 ) 205.5 % NET LOSS\nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net loss of $44.4 million and $31.9 million, respectively, as compared to $32.9 million and $18.7 million in the respective prior year periods. The net loss for the current quarter and year were driven by a $52.7 million charge recorded as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the fourth quarter of 2017, which resulted in a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and net state unrecognized tax positions at the new corporate federal income tax rate of 21%. The prior year quarter and year net loss was driven by $32.0 million of legal settlement charges.\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\nThe Company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant and non-cash items, as a means to understand the performance of its operations. (See tables below and the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation attached to this press release for further details.)\nAs shown in the table below, adjusted operating income for the University Group and Corporate was $28.1 million and $105.9 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Adjusted operating loss for All Other Campuses was $7.2 million and $39.0 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nFor the Quarter Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss)\n2017 2016 2017 2016 University Group and Corporate:\nOperating income (loss) (1) $ 25,495 $ (17,852 ) $ 95,536 $ 44,717 Depreciation and amortization (1) 2,631 2,690 10,326 11,164 Asset impairments (1) — — — 237 Unused space charges (1) (2) (7 ) 16 (7 ) 1,134 Significant legal settlements (1) — 32,000 — 32,000 Adjusted Operating Income -- University Group and Corporate (1)\n$ 28,119 $ 16,854 $ 105,855 $ 89,252 Increase (Decrease) 66.8 % 18.6 % All Other Campuses\nOperating loss (3) $ (14,783 ) $ (38,055 ) $ (61,400 ) $ (77,061 ) Depreciation and amortization (3) (9 ) 3,071 3,664 11,583 Asset impairments (3) — 927 — 927 Unused space charges (2) (3) 1,016 20,596 12,174 34,719 Significant legal settlements (3) 6,543 — 6,543 — Adjusted Operating Loss -- All Other Campuses (3)\n$ (7,233 ) $ (13,461 ) $ (39,019 ) $ (29,832 ) Increase (Decrease) 46.3 % -30.8 % (1)\nAmounts relate to the University Group and Corporate.\n(2)\nUnused space charges represent the net present value of remaining lease obligations for vacated space less an estimated amount for sublease income.\n(3)\nAmounts relate to All Other Campuses.\nBALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $7.3 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $9.8 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operations was $21.8 million as compared to net cash provided of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash usage for the current year was primarily driven by $32.0 million of legal settlement payments made during the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the Quarter Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, Increase Increase Selected Cash Flow Items\n2017 2016 (Decrease) 2017 2016 (Decrease) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 7,308 $ (9,789 ) 174.7 % $ (21,789 ) $ 6,475 -436.5 % Capital expenditures $ 2,906 $ 777 274.0 % $ 6,332 $ 4,129 53.4 % As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale short-term investments totaled $180.1 million and $207.2 million, respectively.\nOUTLOOK\nThe Company is executing well against its objective of sustainable and responsible growth with student initiatives and investments in our University Group showing positive results and the teach-out of our All Other Campuses segment substantially complete. As a result, consistent with the objective of sustainable and responsible growth the Company is providing an outlook to its adjusted operating income and ending cash balance for 2018 and 2019. The Company currently expects the following results, subject to the key assumptions identified below (see the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for adjusted operating income (loss) attached to this press release for further details):\nFinancial Outlook:\nFor the 1st Quarter Ending March 31, For the Year Ending December 31, 2017 2018 2017 2018 Adjusted Operating Income\nTotal Company $15.8M $22M - $24M $66.8M $99M - $106M University Group and Corporate $25.7M $26M - $27M $105.9M $110M - $115M All Other Campuses ($9.8M) ($3M) - ($4M) ($39.0M) ($9M) - ($11M) Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short term investments\n$180.1M $220M - $225M We expect adjusted operating income for the total company to grow in 2019 as compared to 2018 and our ending cash balance for 2019 to increase as compared to 2018.\nUniversity Group Enrollment Outlook:\nCTU New student enrollments for the first quarter of 2018 are expected to increase as compared to the prior year quarter. AIU: The academic calendar redesign has caused significant variability in quarterly new enrollment trends due to the varying number of enrollment days in any given quarter. As a result, we expect new student enrollments to decrease approximately 40 percent in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the prior year quarter. However, we expect this decrease to be more than offset by growth in new student enrollments in the second and third quarters of 2018, such that on a rolling three quarter basis we expect new student enrollments to reflect growth.\nOperating income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to adjusted operating income (loss), may not follow the same trends as discussed in the outlook above because of adjustments made for unused space charges that represent the present value of future remaining lease obligations for vacated space less an estimated amount for sublease income as well as depreciation, amortization, asset impairment charges and significant legal settlements. The operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) and cash outlook provided above for 2018 and 2019 are based on the following key assumptions and factors, among others: (i) prospective student interest in the Company’s programs continues to trend in line with recent experiences, (ii) initiatives and investments in student-serving processes and operations continue to positively impact enrollment trends within the University Group, (iii) achievement of anticipated recovery rates for the Company’s real estate obligations and timing of any associated lease termination payments in line with our current expectations, (iv) no material changes in the legal or regulatory environment, and excludes legal and regulatory liabilities and other related impacts which are not probable and estimable at this time, and any impact of new or proposed regulations, including the “borrower defense to repayment” and gainful employment regulations and any modifications thereto, and (v) no material changes in the estimated amount of compensation expense that could be impacted by changes in the Company’s stock price. Although these estimates and assumptions are based upon management’s good faith beliefs regarding current events and actions that may be undertaken in the future, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nCareer Education Corporation will host a conference call on Wednesday, February 21, 2018 at 5:30 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.

~5 Significant legal settlements (6) — — 6.5M — Adjusted Operating Loss (5) ($9.8M) ($3M) - ($4M) ($39.0M) ($9M) - ($11M) (1) The Company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain significant and non-cash items as a means to understand the performance of its operations. As a general matter, the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP to help analyze the performance of its operations, assist with preparing the annual operating plan, and measure performance for some forms of compensation. In addition, the Company believes that non-GAAP financial information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company’s historical results and to provide estimates of future performance. The Company believes adjusted operating income (loss) allows it to analyze and assess its ongoing operations and compare current operating results with the operational performance of other companies in its industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by items it does not consider reflective of underlying operating performance, such as unused space charges and significant legal reserves. In evaluating adjusted operating income (loss), investors should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to the adjustments presented above. The presentation of adjusted operating income (loss) should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine or non-recurring. Adjusted operating income (loss) has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss), or any other performance measure derived in accordance and reported under GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquid ity. Non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in a reconciliation to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide an additional way of viewing the Company’s results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. (2) Operating income (loss) for the University Group and Corporate and operating loss for All Other Campuses make up the components of operating income (loss). A reconciliation of these components for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is presented below: For the Quarter Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, ACTUAL ACTUAL 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating income (loss) for University Group and Corporate $ 25,495 $ (17,852 ) $ 95,536 $ 44,717 Operating loss for All Other Campuses (14,783 ) (38,055 ) (61,400 ) (77,061 ) Operating income (loss) $ 10,712 $ (55,907 ) $ 34,136 $ (32,344 ) (3) Amounts relate to the University Group and Corporate. (4) Unused space charges represent the net present value of remaining lease obligations for vacated space less an estimated amount for sublease income. These charges relate to exiting leased space as the Company continues to right-size the organization and therefore are not considered representative of ongoing operations. (5) Management assesses results of operations for the University Group and Corporate separately from All Other Campuses. As All Other Campuses have been announced for teach-out or have been taught out, management views these operations as not reflective of the ongoing business. As a result, management views adjusted operating income from the University Group and Corporate separately from the remainder of the organization, to assess results and make decisions. (6) Amounts relate to All Other Campuses.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221006353/en/\nInvestors:\nAlpha IR Group\nChris Hodges or Sam Gibbons\n(312) 445-2870\nCECO@alpha-ir.com\nOr\nMedia:\nCareer Education Corporation\n(847) 585-2600\nmedia@careered.com\nSource: Career Education Corporation",
