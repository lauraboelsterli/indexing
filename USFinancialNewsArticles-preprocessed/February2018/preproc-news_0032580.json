    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) raised Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat’s annual compensation by 48 percent to $23 million for 2017, a year in which the bank made more money from operations but still fell short of earlier targets. \nDirectors considered recent progress toward new targets when setting Corbat’s pay, according to a public filing on Friday. \nA year earlier, Corbat’s annual compensation was cut 6 percent to $15.5 million after the bank missed financial performance targets and saw one-third of its voting shareholders disapprove of his prior pay. \nAfter that vote, the company made changes to its pay plan, which was then endorsed by 97 percent of voting shareholders at its annual meeting in April. \nIn July, Citigroup recast targets set in 2013 as new goals for 2020. \nIn 2017, Citigroup stock jumped 25 percent and its profit rose 4 percent, excluding a charge for the impact of the U.S. tax law change on the value of its deferred tax assets. \n\nThe Citigroup Inc (Citi) logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017.REUTERS/Chris Helgren Corbat, 57, has been CEO since 2012. Citigroup is the fourth biggest U.S. bank by assets. \nThe change in Corbat’s pay compares with annual raises of 5 to 20 percent for some other Wall Street executives. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co, ( JPM.N ) the biggest U.S. bank, was paid $29.5 million, a 5.4 percent increase. Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) CEO James Gorman’s compensation was raised 20 percent to $27 million. \nLloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) received a 9 percent raise to $22 million, the company said on Friday. Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) CEO Brian Moynihan was paid $23 million, up 15 percent. \nCitigroup made additional disclosures on Friday which indicate that other senior executives received approximately these amounts of compensation in 2017: \nJames Forese, president and chief executive of Citi’s Institutional Clients Group received $20 million, up 31 percent from 2016. \nJohn Gerspach, chief financial officer, got $11 million, up 22 percent. \nStephen Bird, chief executive of global consumer banking, received $10.5 million, up 17 percent. \nJane Fraser, chief executive for Latin America, received $8.5 million, up 8 percent. \nReporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ",
