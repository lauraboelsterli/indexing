    "text": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s export orders in January are expected to rise for the 18th straight month but at a slower pace than in December, as demand for the island’s technology products remained robust, a Reuters poll showed.\nExport orders in January were forecast to expand 16.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the median forecast of 15 analysts in the poll. That compared with a 17.5 percent pace of growth in December and 11.6 percent in November.\nTaiwan’s export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia’s exports and for hi-tech gadgets, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.\nPoll compiled by Carol Lee; Writing by Yimou Lee; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ",
