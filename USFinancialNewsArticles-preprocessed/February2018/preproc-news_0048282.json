    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Air Lease Corporation (ALC) (NYSE:AL) announces financial results for the year and three months ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenues: $1,516 million for the full year 2017, an increase of 6.9% $398 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 7.6% Diluted earnings per share: $6.82 for the full year 2017, an increase of 98.3% $4.22 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 374.2% Adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes: $5.94 for the full year 2017, an increase of 4.8% $1.60 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 8.1% Diluted earnings per share, excluding effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform Act\"): $3.65 for the full year 2017, an increase of 6.1% $1.06 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 19.1% Margin: Pre-tax margin of 40.2% for the full year 2017 Adjusted pre-tax margin of 43.4% for the full year 2017 Return on equity: Pre-tax return on equity of 16.2% for the full year 2017 Adjusted pre-tax return on equity of 17.5% for the full year 2017\nHighlights\nRecorded a $354 million tax benefit or $3.16 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Act. The Tax Reform Act lowers the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We expect that the lower U.S. corporate tax rate will help to increase our net income and accelerate our growth.\nTook delivery of our first 737 MAX and A350 aircraft from our orderbook in the fourth quarter of 2017 and have commitments to purchase 128 737 MAX aircraft and 18 A350 aircraft between 2018 and 2023.\nEnded the year with a net book value of $13.3 billion in aircraft with a weighted average age of 3.8 years and a weighted average lease term remaining of 6.8 years.\nPlaced 97% of our order book on long-term leases for aircraft delivering through 2019 and 79% through 2020.\nEnded the year with $23.4 billion in committed minimum future rental payments, including $10.1 billion in contracted minimum rental payments on the aircraft in our existing fleet and $13.3 billion in minimum future rental payments related to aircraft delivering in the future.\nIssued a total of $2.2 billion of senior unsecured notes in 2017 and ended the year with liquidity of $3.2 billion and further decreased our composite cost of funds to 3.20%.\nDeclared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share on our outstanding common stock for the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend will be paid on April 6, 2018 to holders of record of our common stock as of March 20, 2018.\n“Air Lease achieved solid financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. For the first time, we exceeded $15 billion in assets and $1.5 billion in total revenues. We also maintained a high level of profitability. The industry backdrop remains healthy with passenger traffic up 7.6% year over year in 2017, exceeding the 10-year average annual growth rate. These robust levels of passenger traffic further support the ongoing demand for new aircraft we have seen from our customers. Looking ahead, we believe ALC is well positioned for continued growth, further enhanced by expected ongoing benefits resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” said John L. Plueger, Chief Executive Officer and President.\n“The ALC team should be commended for their customer focus and strong risk management principles, both of which underpin the results of the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Since inception ALC has been focused on driving shareholder value, and over the last 5 years ALC’s profits have increased more than threefold. Moving forward, we believe our valuable order book of highly in-demand, modern, fuel-efficient aircraft will service the needs of our customers, and together with our investment grade profile, will position us for continued success in the years to come,” said Steven F. Udvar-Házy, Executive Chairman of the Board.\nThe following table summarizes the results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 $ change % change 2017 2016 $ change % change Revenues $ 398,471 $ 370,487 $ 27,984 7.6 % $ 1,516,380 $ 1,419,055 $ 97,325 6.9 % Income before taxes $ 165,664 $ 149,403 $ 16,261 10.9 % $ 609,530 $ 580,238 $ 29,292 5.0 % Net income $ 471,102 $ 96,988 $ 374,114 385.7 % $ 756,152 $ 374,925 $ 381,227 101.7 % Adjusted net income before income taxes (1) $ 178,099 $ 162,314 $ 15,785 9.7 % $ 657,838 $ 622,871 $ 34,967 5.6 % Diluted EPS $ 4.22 $ 0.89 $ 3.33 374.2 % $ 6.82 $ 3.44 $ 3.38 98.3 % Adjusted diluted EPS before income taxes (1) $ 1.60 $ 1.48 $ 0.12 8.1 % $ 5.94 $ 5.67 $ 0.27 4.8 % Diluted EPS excluding Tax Reform Act (2) $ 1.06 $ 0.89 $ 0.17 19.1 % $ 3.65 $ 3.44 $ 0.21 6.1 % (1) Adjusted net income before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes have been adjusted to exclude the effects of certain non-cash items, one-time or non-recurring items, such as settlement expense, net of recoveries, that are not expected to continue in the future and certain other items. See note 1 under the Consolidated Statements of Income included in this earnings release for a discussion of the non-GAAP measures adjusted net income before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes and a reconciliation to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n(2) Diluted earnings per share excluding Tax Reform Act has been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Tax Reform Act, a provisional net benefit of $354.1 million, or $3.16 per diluted share and $3.17 per diluted share for the three months and 2017, respectively. The adjustment is due to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower enacted corporate tax rates, partially offset by other impacts of the Tax Reform Act. See note 2 under the Consolidated Statements of Income included in this earnings release for a discussion of diluted earnings per share excluding Tax Reform Act and a reconciliation to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nFlight Equipment Portfolio\nOur fleet grew by 10.3% based on net book value of $13.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 compared to $12.0 billion as of December 31, 2016.

The Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Accounting Standards Codification 740 requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $354.1 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in the 2017, partially offset by other impacts of the Tax Reform Act.\nThe $354.1 million benefit resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate by our management of the impact of the Tax Reform Act. Based on our initial assessment of the Tax Reform Act, we believe that the most significant impact on our financial statements is the remeasurement of deferred taxes. We do not expect other provisions of the Tax Reform Act to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Quantifying all of the impacts of the Tax Reform Act, however, requires significant judgment by our management, including the inherent complexities involved in determining the timing of reversals of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Accordingly, we will continue to analyze the impacts of the Tax Reform Act and, if necessary, record any further adjustments to our deferred tax assets and liabilities in future periods.\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of net income to diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of the Tax Reform Act (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited) Reconciliation of net income to diluted earnings per share excluding Tax Reform Act: Net income $ 471,102 $ 96,988 $ 756,152 $ 374,925 Impact of Tax Reform Act (354,127 ) — (354,127 ) — Net income excluding Tax Reform Act $ 116,975 $ 96,988 $ 402,025 $ 374,925 Assumed conversion of convertible senior notes 1,566 1,447 5,842 5,780 Net income excluding Tax Reform Act plus assumed conversions $ 118,541 $ 98,435 $ 407,867 $ 380,705 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 111,954,824 111,000,951 111,657,564 110,798,727 Diluted earnings per share excluding Tax Reform Act: $ 1.06 $ 0.89 $ 3.65 $ 3.44",
