    "text": "4:33 PM ET Tue, 20 Feb 2018 CNBC.com Leah Millis | Reuters President Donald Trump speaks about the mass shooting at a Florida high school in a national address from the White House in Washington, U.S., February 15, 2018. \nPresident Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he has recommended that \"bump stocks\" — devices used to make semi-automatic weapons capable of firing hundreds of rounds per minute — be banned. \nTrump said he has signed a memorandum recommending that Attorney General Jeff Sessions propose regulations that would declare that bump stocks are illegal \nThe gunman who killed 58 people and wounded hundreds of others in Las Vegas in October had at least 12 rifles fitted with bump stocks, authorities have said. \nTrump's announcement came six days after a gunman killed 17 people, 14 of them students, at a high school in Parkland, Fla., while armed with an AR-15 assault rifle. \n\"After the deadly shooting in Las Vegas, I directed [Sessions] to clarify whether certain bump stock devices like the one used in Las Vegas are illegal current law,\" Trump said at a White House event honoring first responders. \n\"That process began in December, and just a few moments ago I signed a memorandum directing the attorney general to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns,\" Trump said. \n\"I expect that these critical regulations will be finalized, Jeff, very soon.\" \nSemi-automatic weapons require a shooter to pull the trigger each time to fire a round. \nBut when those weapons are outfitted with a bump stock, the gun's recoil energy is used to \"bump\" the trigger into the shooter's finger, making it fire much faster. \nThat makes the weapon more akin to a machine gun, which are largely banned in the United States.",
