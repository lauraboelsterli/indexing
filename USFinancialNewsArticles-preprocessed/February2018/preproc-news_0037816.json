    "text": "NEWARK, Calif., Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Socket Mobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCKT), a leading innovator of data capture and delivery solutions for enhanced productivity, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFull Year Results :\nRevenue for 2017 was $21.3 million, an increase of 2.4 percent over 2016 revenue of $20.8 million. Cordless barcode scanning revenue in 2017 was $20.4 million or 96 percent of total revenue compared to cordless barcode scanning revenue in 2016 of $17.9 million or 86 percent of total revenue, a year over year revenue increase of 14.1 percent.\nGross margins in 2017 were $11.4 million, or 53.5 percent of revenue, up from $10.4 million, or 50.2 percent in 2016, primarily due to component cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies. Operating expenses in 2017 were $9.0 million compared to operating expenses in 2016 of $7.9 million, an increase of 14.0 percent. Net income before tax in 2017 was $2.3 million compared to net income before tax in 2016 of $2.4 million.\nEBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization totaled $3.2 million in both years. EBITDA was 15.3 percent of revenue in 2016 and 14.8 percent of revenue in 2017.\nThe Company reported income tax expense of $3.8 million in 2017 and a tax benefit of $9.7 million in 2016. Income tax expense in 2017 consisted of alternative minimum taxes payable of $51,000, deferred tax assets applied to 2017 income before tax of $1.1 million and a revaluation of deferred tax assets downward in the fourth quarter to reflect a lower effective corporate income tax rate applicable to 2018 and beyond estimated at 28 percent. Income tax expense in 2016 consisted of alternative minimum taxes payable of $82,000 and recording deferred tax assets of $9.8 million that were restored to the balance sheet at the end of 2016 and credited to net income. Previously the Company had accounted for income taxes using a full valuation allowance.\nThe Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2017 included cash of $3.4 million, up from cash of $1.3 million at December 31, 2016. The current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) increased from 1.37 at the end of 2016 to 3.81 at the end of 2017. Total shareholders equity increased from $16.2 million at December 31, 2016 to $17.2 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in net equity included the conversion of $1.2 million of subordinated convertible notes and accrued interest into equity in September 2017.\nFourth Quarter Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.4 million, with gross margins of 53 percent, operating expenses of $2.3 million, and net income before income taxes of $68,000. Cordless barcode\nscanning revenue in 2017 was $4.2 million, almost all relating to small unit sales. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $5.4 million. Cordless barcode scanning revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $5.2 million and included $1.0 million in revenue from corporate deployments. As\ndescribed under Full Year Results, the fourth quarter of both years included adjustments to deferred tax assets required under a change in accounting in 2016 and by changes to the corporate effective tax rate at the end of 2017 applicable to 2018 and beyond.\nComments from our Chief Executive Officer :\nKevin Mills, president and chief executive officer, commented, \"2017 was a good building year for Socket Mobile. Our cordless barcode scanning revenue grew year over year at 14.1 percent and was 96 percent of our revenue in 2017. We improved our gross margins on sales from 50.2 percent a year ago to 53.5 percent in 2017 that helped fund planned increases in our operating expenses. We maintained operating profitability at 2016 levels and increased our cash from $1.3 million at the end of 2016 to $3.4 million at the end of 2017.\n\"We increased our operating expenses in 2017, particularly in product development, to accelerate the development of new data capture products to serve growing markets for mobile applications running on smart phones and tablets. Our registered developer base continues to grow as did the third-party applications entering the market that use our barcode scanners and drive our revenue. Our new family of DuraScan® barcode scanners, released in late 2016 and early 2017 to address the needs of mobile markets with more rugged environments such as field work, transportation and warehousing, are being well received. In 2018, many of the improvements in our durable products are being integrated into our SocketScan™ products. We also introduced a contactless reader/writer series, starting with model D600, which supports Near Field Communications (NFC) and other contactless technologies. We've redesigned our software developer kit (SDK) with new development tools to improve how application developers integrate use of our products into their applications. We've done so while maintaining profitable operations as measured by EBITDA and profit before taxes.\n\"The deferred tax assets we set up in the fourth quarter of 2016 were primarily related to future net operating loss carryforwards that shelter our taxable income. The adjustment to deferred taxes and deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 did not affect cash and reflects the lower corporate tax rates that we will apply in 2018 and beyond while continuing to shelter our taxable income with net operating loss carryforwards.\n\"Our primary goals for 2018 are to continue to attract and support mobile application developers with data capture products designed for the mobile markets they serve with continued growth and profitability,\" Mills concluded.\nSubsequent Event\nWe commenced a tender offer on February 2, 2018 to purchase up to 1,250,000 shares of our common stock at a price not less than $3.75 per share or more than $4.25 per share. The offer expires on March 9, 2018 unless extended.\nConference Call\nManagement of Socket Mobile will hold a conference call and web cast today at 2 P.M. Pacific (5 P.M.
