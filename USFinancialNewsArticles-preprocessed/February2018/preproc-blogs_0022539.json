    "text": "If you want to know how a company like Snap can lose almost $3.5 billion in a year, look no further than stock rewards to engineers.\nIn 2017, the year it went public, Snap recorded a stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 billion, accounting for 77 percent of its net loss and more than three times the amount it generated in revenue.\nSnap reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday and said that its share-based pay jumped 27-fold from a year earlier to $181 million, with 72 percent tied to research and development.\nInternet companies commonly use stock awards as a way to lure developers in a highly competitive market, where cash-rich companies like Google and Facebook can pay much higher salaries. But even among its closest peers, Snap has counted on equity to an outsized degree.\nFacebook recorded stock-based compensation of $1.6 billion the year it went public, but generated over $5 billion in sales. Twitter's expense of $600 million in 2013 was slightly less than its revenue, while LinkedIn had just a $30 million expense and $522 million in sales in 2011, the year it debuted on the market.\nIn its first quarterly report as a public company, for the period ended in March, Snap recognized $2 billion of stock-based compensation, including $636.6 million for awards to CEO Evan Spiegel.\nSnap said in its IPO prospectus that restricted stock units include performance incentives and time-based incentives, with most of the latter vesting over four years. But Spiegel was issued a stock award that vested immediately at the time of the IPO, representing 3 percent of all outstanding shares and delivered in \"equal quarterly installments over three years beginning in the third full calendar quarter following this offering.\"\nAnalysts at Raymond James predict Snap's stock-based compensation this year will be $900 million, with the number falling to $850 million in 2019.",
