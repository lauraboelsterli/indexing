    "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda, Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Höegh LNG Partners LP (NYSE: HMLP) (the \"Partnership\") today reported its preliminary financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nReported total time charter revenues of $37.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $23.3 million of time charter revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 Generated operating income of $29.7 million and net income of $25.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to operating income of $33.2 million and net income of $24.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016; operating income and net income were impacted by unrealized gains on derivative instruments for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017 Excluding the impact of unrealized gains on derivative instruments, net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $20.7 million compared to $8.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly due to the inclusion of the results from the Höegh Grace and the income tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 Generated Segment EBITDA 1 of $33.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $25.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 On October 5, 2017, raised proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and expenses, of $110.9 million from the issuance of 4,600,000 Series A cumulative redeemable preferred units On December 1, 2017 acquired the remaining 49% ownership interest in Höegh LNG Colombia Holding Ltd., the owner of the entities that own and operate the Höegh Grace On January 26, 2018, commenced an \"at-the-market\" common and preferred unit offering program (\"ATM program\") On February 14, 2018, paid a $0.43 per unit distribution on common and subordinated units with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017, equivalent to $1.72 per unit on an annual basis On February 15, 2018, paid a $0.78993 per unit distribution on the Series A preferred units for the period commencing on October 5, 2017 to February 14, 2018. For subsequent quarters, the preferred unit distribution will be 0.546875 per unit, equivalent to $2.1875 per unit on an annual basis\nRichard Tyrrell, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer stated: \"During the fourth quarter, Höegh LNG Partners' high-quality, modern assets continued to generate stable cash flows in accordance with their long-term contracts.\nWe were active throughout the quarter, diversifying our access to growth capital through a $115 million preferred offering on attractive terms, while also expanding our fleet with the acquisition of the remaining 49% interest in the Höegh Grace. In conjunction with a favorable tax effect, the acquisition contributed to the Partnership recording its highest ever distributable cash flow 2 . The acquisition increases Höegh LNG Partners' asset base to three fully owned FSRUs and two joint venture owned FSRUs which represents a doubling in size since IPO. The average remaining contract term on our FSRUs is 11.5 years, with full contracted coverage on the entire fleet through at least 2025.\nSince the end of the quarter, Höegh LNG Partners has commenced an \"at-the-market\" program that enables us to issue both common and preferred units at such times as market conditions are supportive. The program increases balance sheet flexibility and expands our options for funding future growth.\"\n1 Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by investors to measure financial and operating performance. Please see Appendix A for a reconciliation of Segment EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Segment EBITDA does not include adjustments for (i) principal payment of direct financing lease of $0.9 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (ii) amortization in revenues for above market contracts of $0.9 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (iii) non-controlling interest: amortization in revenues for above market contracts of $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, (iv) equity in earnings of JVs: amortization for deferred revenue of $(0.6) million and $(0.5) million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (v) non-cash revenue: tax paid directly by charterer of $(0.2) million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, or (vi) non-controlling interest: non-cash revenue of $0.03 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\n2 Distributable cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure used by investors to compare cash generating performance to the cash distributions to the unitholders. Please see Appendix B for a reconciliation of Distributable cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for liquidity.\nFinancial Results Overview\nAs of January 1, 2017, the Partnership began consolidating Höegh LNG Colombia Holding Ltd., the owner of the entities that own and operate the Höegh Grace (the \"Höegh Grace entities\") as a result of the acquisition of a 51% interest in the Höegh Grace entities. As of January 1, 2017, the revenues, expenses and net income in the consolidated income statement included 100% of the results of the Höegh Grace entities. From January 1, 2017 until November 30, 2017, the consolidated income statement was reduced by the non-controlling interest in net income to arrive at the limited partners' interest in net income which reflected the Partnership's 51% interest in the net income of the Höegh Grace entities. Similarly, all of the assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet included 100% of the Höegh Grace entities' assets and liabilities. Until December 1, 2017, total equity was split between partners' capital (which included the Partnership's 51% interest in the net assets of the Höegh Grace entities) and the non-controlling interest. Management monitored the results of operations of the Höegh Grace entities based on the Partnership's 51% interest in the Segment EBITDA of such entities and, therefore, subtracted the non-controlling interest in Segment EBITDA to present Segment EBITDA. On December 1, 2017, the Partnership acquired the remaining 49% ownership interest in the Höegh Grace entities and, as of that date, there is no longer a non-controlling interest in the Höegh Grace entities.\nThe Partnership reported net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 of $25.4 million, an increase of $0.5 million from net income of $24.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were impacted by unrealized gains on derivative instruments mainly on the Partnership's share of equity in earnings (losses) of joint ventures. Excluding all the unrealized gains on derivative instruments, net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 would have been $20.7 million, an increase of $12.5 million from $8.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase is mainly due to the inclusion of the Höegh Grace entities from January 1, 2017 and the income tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Limited partners' interest in net income, which includes the Partnership's 51% interest in the Höegh Grace entities from October 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017 and the Partnership's 100% interest in the Höegh Grace entities for December 2017, was $20.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.0 million from net income of $24.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Preferred unitholders' interest in net income of $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to the issuance of preferred units on October 5, 2017. Non-controlling interest in net income of $2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to non-controlling interest for the 49% interest in the Höegh Grace entities not owned by the Partnership in October and November 2017.\nTotal revenues are comprised of time charter revenues related to the PGN FSRU Lampung, the Höegh Gallant and the Höegh Grace for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and the PGN FSRU Lampung and the Höegh Gallant for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Time charter revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $37.6 million, an increase of $14.3 million from $23.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase mainly relates to the revenue for the Höegh Grace which was consolidated on January 1, 2017. Excluding the revenue for the Höegh Grace, time charter revenues increased by $1.0 million due to higher one-off revenues following the conclusion of an audit for the amount the charterer would reimburse for certain 2014 and 2015 costs for the PGN FSRU Lampung which were partly offset by lower revenues for the Höegh Gallant.\nWith the exception of the 7 days off-hire for planned maintenance for the Höegh Gallant and minor amounts of reduced hire for the Neptune, all FSRUs were on hire for the entire fourth quarter of 2017. On October 28, 2017, the GDF Suez Cape Ann arrived in Tianjin, China to serve as an FSRU pursuant to a sub-charter made by its charterer.\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $14.0 million, an increase of $5.3 million, compared with $8.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase reflects approximately $4.7 million of higher operating expenses due to the inclusion of the Höegh Grace and higher operating expenses for the Höegh Gallant and PGN FSRU Lampung mainly due to variations between periods in deliveries of spare parts and consumable goods and certain maintenance costs.\nEquity in earnings of joint ventures for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $6.1 million, a decrease of $12.5 million from equity in earnings of $18.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The joint ventures own the Neptune and the GDF Suez Cape Ann. Unrealized gains on derivative instruments in the joint ventures significantly impacted the equity in earnings (losses) of joint ventures for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The joint ventures do not apply hedge accounting for interest rate swaps and all changes in fair value are included in equity in earnings of joint ventures. Excluding the unrealized gains for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the equity in earnings would have been $2.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to equity in earnings of $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $29.7 million, a decrease of $3.5 million from operating income of $33.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the unrealized gains on derivative instruments for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 impacting the equity in earnings (losses) of joint ventures, operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 would have been $26.0 million, an increase of $8.9 million from $17.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is mainly due to the inclusion of the results of the Höegh Grace consolidated as of January 1, 2017.\nSegment EBITDA 1 was $33.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $7.9 million from $25.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal financial expense, net for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $6.4 million, an increase of $0.5 million from $5.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The higher total financial expense, net was mainly due to higher interest expense of $0.7 million principally as a result of higher outstanding loan balances following the acquisition of the Höegh Grace entities. The gain on derivative instruments was $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The gains on derivative instruments relate to the ineffective portion of the hedge of the interest rate swaps related to the credit facilities that finance the PGN FSRU Lampung (the \"Lampung facility\"), the Höegh Gallant (the \"Gallant facility\") and the Höegh Grace (the \"Grace facility\"). The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the variable interest payments on the Lampung, Gallant and Grace facilities and the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income.\nIncome tax benefit was $2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.5 million from income tax expense of $2.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. During 2015, the Indonesian Minister of Finance introduced new regulations effective for 2016 that limited the amount of interest expense that was deductible for current income taxes where the taxpayer's debt to equity ratio exceeds 4:1. Certain industries, including the infrastructure industry, were exempted from the debt to equity ratio requirements. Although the \"infrastructure industry\" was not defined in the new regulations, additional guidance was expected to be provided by the Indonesian tax authorities during 2016. Because no subsequent guidance had been issued, the Partnership's subsidiary in Indonesia filed its 2016 tax return applying the limitations on the deductibility of interest expense. This increased taxable income and income tax expense of the Partnership's Indonesian subsidiary for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the accrued current income tax expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Following an evaluation of how the application of the infrastructure industry exemption was being applied, it was concluded that the infrastructure exemption did apply to the Indonesian subsidiary. Accordingly, the 2016 tax return was amended without the limitation of interest expense which reduced taxable income and eliminated the current income tax expense for 2016. The current income tax expense for the year end December 31, 2017 applied the same exemption. As a result of the amended 2016 tax return and application of the infrastructure industry exemption for the year end December 31, 2017, a one-time income tax benefit was recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Application of the infrastructure exemption in subsequent periods will result in lower current income tax expense than would have applied with the limitation on the deductibility of the interest expense.\nSegments\nThe Partnership has two operating segments. The segment profit measure is Segment EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other financial items (gains and losses on derivative instruments and other items, net). The two segments are the \"Majority held FSRUs\" and the \"Joint venture FSRUs.\" In addition, unallocated corporate costs that are considered to benefit the entire organization, interest income from advances to the Partnership's joint ventures and interest expense related to the seller's credit note and the outstanding balance on the $85 million sponsor credit facility are included in \"Other.\"\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Majority held FSRUs include the direct financing lease for the long-term time charter with PT PGN LNG Indonesia (\"PGN LNG\"), a subsidiary of PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk (\"PGN\") related to the PGN FSRU Lampung and the operating leases related to the 100% owned Höegh Gallant ‎that operates under a long-term charter with Höegh LNG Egypt LLC (\"EgyptCo\"), a subsidiary of Höegh LNG, and the Höegh Grace that operates under a long term time charter with Sociedad Portuaria El Cayao S.A. E.S.P. (\"SPEC\"). EgyptCo has a charter with the government-owned Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (\"EGAS\"). For the three months ended December 31, 2016, Majority held FSRUs includes the direct financing lease related to the PGN FSRU Lampung and the operating lease related to the Höegh Gallant.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Joint venture FSRUs include two 50% owned FSRUs, the Neptune and the GDF Suez Cape Ann, that operate under long-term charters with one charterer, GDF Suez Global LNG Supply SA, a subsidiary of ENGIE.\nThe Partnership measures its segment profit based on Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA is reconciled to operating income and net income for each segment in the tables included in \"Unaudited Segment Information for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\" beginning on page 21.\nSegment EBITDA for the Majority held FSRUs for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $27.2 million, an increase of $7.9 million from $19.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of the results of the Höegh Grace entities from January 1, 2017. Contributions to Segment EBITDA from the PGN FSRU Lampung also improved mainly due to higher one-off revenues as a result of the conclusion of an audit for the amount the charterer would reimburse for certain 2014 and 2015 costs which was largely offset by lower contributions to Segment EBITDA from the Höegh Gallant as a result of off-hire days and expenses associated with scheduled maintenance.\nSegment EBITDA for the Joint venture FSRUs for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $8.3 million, a decrease of $0.3 million from $8.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower project activities for the charterer resulting in lower revenues and somewhat lower expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the corresponding period of 2016. As of September 30, 2017, the joint ventures recorded accruals for the probable liability for boil-off claims from the charterer under the Neptune and the GDF Suez Cape Ann time charters. The Partnership's 50% share of the accrual was approximately $11.9 million recorded in the third quarter of 2017. The accrual was unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2017. The parties have begun the process to refer the claim to arbitration. As discussed further below, the settlement of the claim, if any, would be indemnified by Höegh LNG Holdings Ltd. (\"Höegh LNG\").\nFor Other, administrative expenses and Segment EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $1.7 million, a decrease of $0.4 million from $2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in expenses mainly related to lower audit and legal fees for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016. The higher audit and legal fees for the three months ended December 31, 2016, were mainly associated with the common unit offering in December 2016, preparation for the acquisition of the 51% interest in the Höegh Grace entities and the filing of financial statements for the Höegh Grace entities to be acquired.\nFinancing and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had cash and cash equivalents of $22.7 million and $33.2 million as an undrawn portion of the $85 million revolving credit facility. Current restricted cash for operating obligations of the PGN FSRU Lampung was $7.0 million and long-term restricted cash required under the Lampung facility was $13.6 million as of December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Partnership made quarterly repayments of $4.8 million on the Lampung facility, $3.3 million on the Gallant facility and $3.3 million on the Grace facility.\nThe Partnership's book value and outstanding principal of total long-term debt was $532.1 million and $537.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, including long-term debt financing of the FSRUs and $51.8 million on the revolving credit facility due to owners and affiliates.\nOn October 5, 2017, the Partnership issued 4,600,000 8.75% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred units (\"Series A preferred units\") for proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and expenses, of $110.9 million. The distribution rate on the Series A preferred unit is 8.75% per annum on the $25.00 value per unit (equivalent to $2.1875 per annum per unit). The distributions are cumulative from October 5, 2017 and are payable quarterly when, and if, declared by the Partnership's board of directors (the \"Board\") out of legally available funds for such purpose.\nOn October 6, 2017, the Partnership repaid the outstanding balances of $34.4 million and $24.3 million on the seller's credit note and revolving credit facility, respectively, from the proceeds of the Series A preferred unit offering.\nOn December 1, 2017, the Partnership acquired the remaining 49% ownership interest in the Höegh Grace entities from a subsidiary of Höegh LNG. The purchase price for the acquisition was $86.7 million, including certain post-closing adjustments for net working capital. The Partnership settled the purchase price with cash of $45.3 million from the issuance of the Series A preferred units and drew $41.4 million on the revolving credit facility.\nDuring December 2017, the Partnership drew $10.0 million for general partnership purposes and approximately $0.4 million for accrued interest on the revolving credit facility.\nThe long-term debt financing of the FSRUs is repayable in quarterly installments of $11.4 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Partnership's total current liabilities exceeded total current assets by $17.4 million, which is partly a result of mark-to market valuations of the Partnership's interest rate swaps (derivative instruments) of $2.0 million and the current portion of long-term debt of $45.5 million being classified current while the restricted cash of $13.6 million associated with the Lampung facility is classified as a long-term asset. The Partnership does not plan to terminate the interest rate swaps before their maturity and, as a result, the Partnership will not realize these liabilities. Further, the current portion of long-term debt reflects principal payments for the next twelve months which will be funded, for the most part, by future cash flows from operations. The Partnership does not intend to maintain a cash balance to fund the next twelve months' net liabilities. The Partnership believes its current resources, including the undrawn balance under the revolving credit facility, are sufficient to meet the Partnership's working capital requirements for its current business for the next twelve months.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership did not have material commitments for capital or other expenditures for its current business. For the joint ventures, the charterer plans to use the GDF Suez Cape Ann for a project in India expected to commence in 2018. The vessel will be drydocked and fitted with certain modifications prior to the project start which will be compensated by the charterer. The joint ventures also have a probable liability for exceeding historical minimum performance standards for a boil-off claim under the time charters. The Partnership's 50% share of the accrual was approximately $11.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The joint ventures will continue to monitor this issue and adjust accruals, as might be required, based upon additional information and further developments. It is estimated that the Partnership's 50% share of the excess boil-off claim could range from zero or negligible amounts to approximately $29 million. To the extent that the excess boil-off claims result in a settlement, the Partnership would be indemnified by Höegh LNG for its share of the cash impact of any settlement. However, other concessions or capital improvements, if any, would not be expected to be indemnified. Pending resolution of the boil-off claims, the joint ventures have suspended payment on their shareholder loans.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had outstanding interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $415.3 million to hedge against the interest rate risks of its long-term debt under the Lampung, Gallant and Grace facilities. The Partnership applies hedge accounting for derivative instruments related to those facilities. The Partnership receives interest based on three month US dollar LIBOR and pays fixed rates of 2.8%, 1.9% and 2.3% for the Lampung, Gallant and Grace facilities, respectively. The carrying value of the liability for derivative instruments was $3.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income. The gain on the derivative instruments for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.0 million, an increase of $0.3 million from $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The gain on derivative instruments for the three months ended December 31, 2017 related to the interest rate swaps for the Lampung, Gallant and Grace facilities, while the gain for the three months ended December 31, 2016 related to the Lampung and Gallant facilities.\nThe Partnership's share of the joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method. As a result, the Partnership's share of the joint ventures' cash, restricted cash, outstanding debt, interest rate swaps and other balance sheet items are reflected net on the line \"accumulated losses in joint ventures\" on the consolidated balance sheet and are not included in the balance sheet figures disclosed above.\nHöegh LNG made indemnification payments for certain 2014 invoices covering, among other things, the reimbursement of certain costs, and for non-budgeted expenses for 2014 and 2015 related to the PGN FSRU Lampung which were refundable to the extent that they were recovered from the charterer. As a result of the conclusion of the audit for the amount the charterer would reimburse for certain 2014 and 2015 for the PGN FSRU Lampung, the Partnership is refunding $4.0 million of the previous indemnification payments to Höegh LNG.\nOn November 14, 2017, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of $14.4 million, or $0.43 per common and subordinated unit, with respect to the third quarter of 2017, equivalent to $1.72 per unit on an annualized basis.\nOn January 26, 2018, the Partnership entered into a sale agreement with B. Riley FBR Inc. (the \"Agent\"). Under the terms of the sales agreement, the Partnership may offer and sell up to $120 million aggregate offering amount of \"at-the market\" common and Series A preferred units (the \"ATM program\"), from time to time, through the Agent.\nOn February 13, 2018, the Partnership drew $5.4 million on the revolving credit facility.\nOn February 14, 2018, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of $14.4 million, or $0.43 per common and subordinated unit, with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017, equivalent to $1.72 per unit on an annual basis.\nOn February 15, 2018, the Partnership paid a cash distribution of $3.7 million, or $0.78993 per Series A preferred unit, for the period commencing on October 5, 2017 to February 14, 2018.\nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $21.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $16.0 million compared with $5.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Before changes in working capital, net cash flows were $23.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $10.9 million compared with $12.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly attributable to the inclusion of the cash flows from the Höegh Grace entities for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Changes in working capital contributed negatively to net cash provided by operating activities by $2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with a negative contribution of $7.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The negative working capital impact was mainly due to repayment of $6.6 million to settle the working capital adjustment from the acquisition of the Höegh Gallant in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $44.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $46.0 million compared to $90.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the main expenditure was the cash payment of $45.3 million for the acquisition of the remaining 49% interest in the Höegh Grace entities. The rest of the purchase price of $41.4 million was a non-cash transaction financed by draws on the revolving credit facility. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, the cash used in investing activities primarily related to $91.8 million in cash designated for the January 2017 acquisition of a 51% ownership interest in the Höegh Grace entities.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $27.0 million, a decrease of $56.0 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $83.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, net proceeds of $110.9 million were received from the issuance of the series A preferred units compared with net proceeds of $111.5 million from the issuance of common units for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The main reasons for the decrease were higher repayments of $46.1 million of the seller's credit and the revolving credit facility, higher repayments of long-term debt of $3.3 million due to the inclusion of the Grace facility, the increase in cash distributions to common unitholders of $3.5 million, cash distributions to non-controlling interests of $3.6 million and higher repayments of a customer loan of $3.8 million, partially offset by higher draws on the revolving credit facility of $6.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nAs a result of the foregoing, cash and cash equivalents increased by $4.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and decreased by $1.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nOutlook\nFollowing the closing of the acquisition of the remaining 49% ownership interest in the Höegh Grace entities on December 1, 2017, management anticipates recommending to the Board an increase in the Partnership's distribution to common and subordinated units with respect to the quarter ending March 31, 2018. Any such increase would be conditioned upon, among other things, the absence of any material adverse developments or potentially attractive opportunities that would make such an increase inadvisable.\nPursuant to the omnibus agreement that the Partnership entered into with Höegh LNG at the time of the initial public offering, Höegh LNG is obligated to offer to the Partnership any floating storage and regasification unit (\"FSRU\") or LNG carrier operating under a charter of five or more years.\nHöegh LNG has an available FSRU, the Höegh Giant (HHI Hull No. 2552), which was delivered from the shipyard on April 27, 2017 and is operating on a short term contract that commenced on February 7, 2018 with Gas Natural SGD, SA (\"Gas Natural Fenosa\"). Höegh LNG has three FSRUs on order. Pursuant to the terms of the omnibus agreement, the Partnership will have the right to purchase the Höegh Giant, HHI Hull No. 2865, and HHI Hull No. 2909 and SHI Hull No.2220 (under a shipbuilding contract with Samsung Heavy Industries (\"SHI\")) following acceptance by the respective charterer of the related FSRU under a contract of five years or more, subject to reaching an agreement with Höegh LNG regarding the purchase price.\nHöegh LNG is or has been actively pursuing the following projects. The Partnership may have the opportunity in the future to acquire the FSRUs listed above, when allocated to and operating under a charter of five years or more, for one of the following projects:\nOn May 26, 2015, Höegh LNG signed a contract with Penco LNG to provide an FSRU to service the Penco-Lirquén LNG import terminal to be located in Concepción Bay, Chile. The contract is for a period of 20 years and is subject to Penco LNG's completing financing and obtaining necessary environmental approvals. In February 2017, Penco LNG informed Höegh LNG that the environmental approval had been halted by the legal system in Chile which is expected to delay permitting, the infrastructure project and the commencement of the FSRU contract. On December 1, 2016, Höegh LNG signed an FSRU contract with Quantum Power Ghana Gas Limited (\"Quantum Power\") for the Tema LNG import terminal located close to Accra in Ghana (\"Tema LNG Project\"). The contract is for a period of 20 years with a five-year extension option for the charterer. The contract is subject to Quantum Power obtaining government approval, financing and both parties' board approval. Since the government approval has not been obtained and the process remains unclear, there can be no assurance that the government approval will be obtained or the timeline for such an approval decision. On December 15, 2016, Höegh LNG signed an FSRU contract with Global Energy Infrastructure Limited (\"GEI\") for GEI's LNG import project in Port Qasim near Karachi, Pakistan, which was conditional on GEI putting in place the associated infrastructure required to connect the FSRU to domestic pipeline grid. A consortium was formed with the intention to build, finance and operate the infrastructure. However, in November 2017, the consortium concluded that no agreement with GEI could be reached and the consortium was consequently dissolved. On November 24, 2017, Höegh LNG announced that it had terminated the FSRU contract with GEI. On July 18, 2017, Höegh LNG signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatar Gas Transport Company Ltd., known as Nakilat, with the aim of jointly developing new FSRU projects, where the LNG is sourced from Qatar. The structure is expected to be joint ventures to own and operate FSRUs for the joint projects.\nThere can be no assurance that the Partnership will purchase any of these additional FSRUs.\nPresentation of Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nA presentation will be held today, Wednesday, February 28, 2018, at 08:30 A.M.

thousands of U.S. dollars)\nSegment information\nThere are two operating segments. The segment profit measure is Segment EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other financial items (gains and losses on derivative instruments and other items, net) less the non-controlling interest in Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA is reconciled to operating income and net income in the segment presentation below. The two segments are \"Majority held FSRUs\" and \"Joint venture FSRUs.\" In addition, unallocated corporate costs that are considered to benefit the entire organization, interest income from advances to joint ventures and interest expense related to the seller's credit note and the outstanding balance on the $85 million revolving credit facility are included in \"Other.\"\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Majority held FSRUs includes the direct financing lease related to the PGN FSRU Lampung, the operating leases related to the Höegh Gallant and the Höegh Grace. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, Majority held FSRUs includes the direct financing lease related to the PGN FSRU Lampung and the operating lease related to the Höegh Gallant.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, Joint Venture FSRUs include two 50% owned FSRUs, the Neptune and the GDF Suez Cape Ann, that operate under long term time charters with one charterer.\nThe accounting policies applied to the segments are the same as those applied in the financial statements, except that i) Joint venture FSRUs are presented under the proportional consolidation method for the segment note to the Partnership's financial statements and in the tables below, and under equity accounting for the consolidated financial statements and ii) non-controlling interest in Segment EBITDA is subtracted in the segment note and the tables below to reflect the Partnership's interest in Segment EBITDA as the Partnership's segment profit measure, Segment EBITDA. Under the proportional consolidation method, 50% of the Joint venture FSRUs' revenues, expenses and assets are reflected in the segment note. Management monitors the results of operations of joint ventures under the proportional consolidation method and not the equity method of accounting. On January 1, 2017, the Partnership began consolidating its acquired 51% interest in the Höegh Grace entities. Since the Partnership obtained control of the Höegh Grace entities, it consolidates 100% of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the Höegh Grace entities and the interest not owned by the Partnership was reflected as non-controlling interest in net income and non-controlling interest in total equity under US GAAP. Management monitored the results of operations of the Höegh Grace entities based on the Partnership's 51% interest in Segment EBITDA of such entities and, therefore, subtracted the non-controlling interest in Segment EBITDA to present Segment EBITDA. The adjustment to non-controlling interest in Segment EBITDA is reversed to reconcile to operating income and net income in the segment presentation below. On December 1, 2017, the Partnership acquired the remaining 49% ownership interest in the Höegh Grace entities and, as of that date, there is no longer a non-controlling interest in the Höegh Grace entities.

EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization and taxes. Segment EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, taxes and other financial items less non-controlling interest in Segment EBITDA. Other financial items consist of gains and losses on derivative instruments and other items, net (including foreign exchange gains and losses and withholding tax on interest expenses). Segment EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of financial statements, such as the Partnership's lenders, to assess its financial and operating performance. The Partnership believes that Segment EBITDA assists its management and investors by increasing the comparability of its performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies in the industry that provide Segment EBITDA information. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods or companies of interest, other financial items, depreciation and amortization and taxes, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net income between periods. The Partnership believes that including Segment EBITDA as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in (a) selecting between investing in it and other investment alternatives and (b) monitoring its ongoing financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold common units. Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income, and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, Segment EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The following tables reconcile Segment EBITDA for each of the segments and the Partnership as a whole to net income (loss), the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for the periods presented:\nThree months ended December 31, 2017\nJoint venture\nMajority\nFSRUs\nTotal\nheld\n(proportional\nSegment\nElimin-\nConsolidated\n(in thousands of U.S.

amortization in revenues for above market contracts less non-controlling interest in amortization in revenues for above market contracts, non-cash revenue: tax paid directly by charterer less non-controlling interest: non-cash revenue, amortization of deferred revenues for the joint ventures, interest income‎, interest expense less amortization of debt issuance cost and fair value of debt assumed, other items (net), unrealized foreign exchange losses (gains), current income tax expense, net of uncertain tax position less non-cash income tax: tax paid directly by charterer, non-controlling interest in finance and tax items and other adjustments such as indemnification paid or to be paid by Höegh LNG for the non-cash boil-off accrual, non-budgeted expenses, losses and estimated maintenance indemnified by, or refunded to, Höegh LNG, distributions on the Series A preferred units and replacement capital expenditures. Cash collections on the direct financing lease investment with respect to the PGN FSRU Lampung consist of the difference between the payments under time charter and the revenues recognized as a financing lease (representing the payment of the principal recorded as a receivable). Amortization in revenues for above market contracts consist of the non-cash amortization of the intangible for the above market time charter contract related to the acquisitions of the Höegh Gallant and Höegh Grace. Amortization of deferred revenues for the joint ventures accounted for under the equity method consist of non-cash amortization to revenues of charterer payments for modifications and drydocking to the vessels. Non-cash revenue: tax paid directly by charterer and non-cash income tax: tax paid directly by charterer consists of certain taxes paid by the charterer directly to the Colombian tax authorities on behalf of the Partnership's subsidiaries which is recorded as a component of time charter revenues and current income tax expenses. Estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, including estimated expenditures for drydocking, represent capital expenditures required to maintain over the long-term the operating capacity of, or the revenue generated by, the Partnership's capital assets.\nDistributable cash flow is presented starting with Segment EBITDA taken from the total segment reporting using the proportional consolidation method for the Partnership's 50% interests in the joint ventures as shown in Appendix A. Therefore, the adjustments to Segment EBITDA include the Partnership's share of the joint venture's adjustments. The Partnership believes distributable cash flow is an important liquidity measure used by management and investors in publicly traded partnerships to compare cash generating performance of the Partnership' cash generating assets from period to period by adjusting for cash and non-cash items that could potentially have a disparate effect between periods, and to compare the cash generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to limited partners. The Partnership also believes distributable cash flow benefits investors in comparing its cash generating performance to other companies that account for time charters as operating leases rather than financial leases, or that do not have non-cash amortization of intangibles or deferred revenue. Distributable cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of the Partnership's liquidity or cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Distributable cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net cash provided by operating activities and the measures may vary among companies. For example, distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances. Distributable cash flow also includes some items that do not affect net cash provided by operating activities. Therefore, distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Distributable cash flow is not the same measure as available cash or operating surplus, both of which are defined by the Partnership's partnership agreement. The first table below reconciles distributable cash flow to Segment EBITDA, which is reconciled to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure for Segment EBITDA, in Appendix A. Refer to Appendix A for the definition of Segment EBITDA. The second table below reconciles distributable cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure for liquidity.\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nThree months ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n33,702\nCash collection/Principal payment on direct financing lease\n900\nAmortization in revenues for above market contracts\n915\nNon-controlling interest: Amortization of above market contract\n(101)\nNon-cash revenue: Tax paid directly by charterer\n(229)\nNon-controlling interest: Non-cash revenue\n34\nEquity in earnings of JVs: Amortization of deferred revenue\n(588)\nInterest income (1)\n187\nInterest expense (1)\n(10,295)\nAmortization of debt issuance cost (1) and fair value of debt assumed\n242\nOther items, net\n(718)\nUnrealized foreign exchange losses (gains)\n47\nCurrent income tax benefit (expense), net of uncertain tax position\n659\nNon-cash income tax: Tax paid directly by charter\n229\nNon-controlling interest: Finance and tax items\n714\nOther adjustments:\nRefund to Höegh LNG of previous indemnifications for non-budgeted expenses\n(1,534)\nDistributions relating to Series A preferred units (2)\n(2,480)\nEstimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures\n(4,725)\nDistributable cash flow\n$\n16,959\n(1)\nThe Partnership's interest in the joint ventures' interest income, interest expense and amortization of debt issuance cost is $28, $3,437 and $44, respectively.\n(2)\nRepresents distributions payable on Series A preferred units related to the period from October 5, 2017 to December 31, 2017.\nReconciliation of distributable cash flows to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nThree months ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDistributable cash flow\n16,959\nEstimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures\n4,725\nRefund to Höegh LNG of previous indemnifications for non-budgeted expenses\n1,534\nDistributions relating to Series A preferred units\n2,480\nNon-controlling interest in Segment EBITDA\n3,438\nNon-controlling interest: Amortization of above market contract\n101\nNon-controlling interest: Finance and tax items\n(714)\nNon-controlling interest: Non-cash revenue\n(34)\nEquity in earnings of JVs: Amortization of deferred revenue\n588\nEquity in earnings of JVs: Amortization of debt issuance cost\n(44)\nEquity in earnings of JVs: Depreciation and amortization\n(2,435)\nEquity in earnings of JVs: Gain (loss) on derivative instruments\n3,681\nEquity in losses (earnings) of joint ventures\n(6,102)\nCash collection/Principal payment on direct financing lease\n(900)\nChanges in accrued interest expense and interest income\n266\nOther adjustments\n111\nChanges in working capital\n(2,133)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n21,521\nMedia contact:\nRichard Tyrrell\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\n+44 7919 058830\nwww.hoeghlngpartners.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hoegh-lng-partners-lp-reports-preliminary-financial-results-for-the-quarter-ended-december-31-2017-300605372.html\nSOURCE Hoegh LNG Partners LP",
