    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leap Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:LPTX), a biotechnology company developing targeted and immuno-oncology therapeutics, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Leap additionally announced that its Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, One Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110.\n“We had a very successful 2017 at Leap, our first year as a public company. We have advanced clinical development of both of our innovative cancer programs to explore novel combinations with immunotherapies and chemotherapies and have laid the foundation for a data-rich 2018,” said Christopher K. Mirabelli, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Leap. “We additionally strengthened our balance sheet to continue to grow the company and further advance our pipeline.”\n2017 Accomplishments\nDKN-01\nAnnounced parallel development strategy to evaluate DKN-01 in patients with documented alterations of the Wnt signaling pathway and to evaluate DKN-01 as a combination immunotherapy. Wnt Signaling Studies Initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating DKN-01 as a monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced endometrioid gynecologic malignancies. The study will enroll approximately 50% of patients with Wnt signaling abnormalities. Announced an investigator-sponsored clinical trial, DIAL-1, in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with activated Wnt signaling at the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz in Germany. Immunotherapy Studies: Enrolled first patient in combination study evaluating DKN-01 with anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with esophagogastric cancer. Announced an immunotherapy collaboration, DINAMIC, with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). The cooperative group sponsored clinical trial will evaluate DKN-01 in combination with atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ®) +/- paclitaxel in advanced esophagogastric malignancies and DKN-01 + atezolizumab in advanced biliary tract cancers at EORTC centers across Europe. Presented proof of concept clinical data of DKN-01 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract or esophagogastric cancers at major medical conferences including the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting and the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium. The data included encouraging overall response and disease control rates, progression-free survival data, and biomarker data.\nTRX518:\nFully enrolled the monotherapy cohorts of the 003 repeat-dose clinical trial evaluating TRX518 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Presented interim data from the repeat-dose monotherapy study, including robust disease control and signs of pharmacodynamic activity including CD8+ T cell activation. Initiated combination cohorts of study 003 evaluating TRX518 in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy or in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) or Opdivo® (nivolumab), anti-PD-1 therapies marketed by Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) or Bristol-Myers Squibb, respectively.\nBusiness:\nCompleted $18M private-placement financing with participation from Eli Lilly and Company and other existing and new investors. Completed a clinical collaboration agreement with Merck for the study of the combination of DKN-01 and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab).\n2018 Objectives\nDKN-01 Program Objectives\nPresent interim data from clinical trial evaluating DKN-01 and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer. Present interim data from the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating DKN-01 ± paclitaxel in patients with advanced gynecologic cancers enriched for patients with Wnt pathway alterations. Present final data from the combination study of DKN-01 with gemcitabine and cisplatin in advanced biliary tract cancers. Enroll first patient in the DIAL-1 clinical trial. Enroll first patient in the DINAMIC clinical trial.\nTRX518 Program Objectives\nPresent interim data from study of TRX518 in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), or Opdivo® (nivolumab). Present TRX518 clinical biomarker data from monotherapy studies.\nSelected Year-End and Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet loss was $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss was $6.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $5.7 million for the same period in 2016.\nResearch and development expenses were $22.5 million for the full year 2017, compared to $23.3 million for the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to reduced manufacturing expenses of our clinical product candidates. Research and development expenses were $4.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $7.4 million for the same period in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $9.8 million for the full year 2017, compared to $4.0 million for the same period in 2016.
