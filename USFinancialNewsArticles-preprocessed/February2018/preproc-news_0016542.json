    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is not looking for a conflict with Syrian government forces but has a right to self-defense, the Pentagon said on Thursday, after the U.S.-led coalition repelled an attack by pro-Syrian forces and, according to one account, killed more than 100 of them.\n“Our forces have the inherent right of self defense. We are not looking for a conflict with the regime,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told a news briefing.\nReporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali\n ",
