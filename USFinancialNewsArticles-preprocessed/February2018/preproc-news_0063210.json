    "text": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX) ( 0388.HK ) is still maintaining an “active” and “good conversation” with Saudi Aramco about its planned massive share sale, the head of HKEX said on Wednesday.\nSlideshow (2 Images) At a news conference after announcing its results, Charles Li, however, said HKEX doesn’t have visibility about Saudi Aramco’s listing plan.\nThe Saudi government says Aramco is worth $2 trillion and aims to list on one or more foreign stock exchanges in addition to Riyadh.\nIn an interview with Reuters in November, Li had said a Hong Kong listing by Aramco would help the oil giant secure huge Chinese demand for its planned $100 bln share sale.\nReporting by Sumeet Chatterjee; Writing by Anshuman Daga; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ",
