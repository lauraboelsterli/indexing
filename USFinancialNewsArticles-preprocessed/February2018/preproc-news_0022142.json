    "text": "MINNETONKA, Minn., Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sunrise Energy Ventures, a Minnesota-based solar development company, announced the City of Macomb has agreed to sell it a seventeen-acre parcel of land so the firm can develop a solar farm. The land, which is currently farmed, is located along East University Drive in a business park adjacent to an Ameren Illinois substationâ€”an ideal location for connecting directly to the electric grid.\nMacomb has approximately 20,000 residents and is home to Western Illinois University, NTN Bower (maker of precision roller bearings) and a Pella Window factory. Sunrise Energy Ventures will bring the first solar installation to Macomb, making renewable energy available to Ameren customers and others who wish to purchase solar power. The two (2) megawatt installation will generate enough power for approximately 300 homes per year.\nSunrise Energy Ventures worked with the city leaders to develop a mutually beneficial agreement for utilizing the city property for a solar installation. Mayor Inman said that the 17-acre lot was the last parcel available in the city's business park and the property has been underutilized since the business park opened in the 1990's.\n\"We are thrilled to bring solar to Macomb,\" said Dean Leischow, chief executive officer of Sunrise Energy Ventures. \"We know that solar makes communities attractive to businesses and individuals who are committed to clean energy sources.\"\nSunrise Energy Ventures plans to begin construction on the solar farm within the next eighteen months.\nAbout Sunrise Energy Ventures. Sunrise Energy Ventures is a solar energy development company bringing high-quality solar energy installations to communities across the United States and Canada. Under the leadership of CEO Dean Leischow, the company brings vast expertise, industry knowledge, and business acumen to build and deliver solar energy projects that provide communities a sustainable source of clean energy and investors a viable and high-value asset providing a meaningful and stable return on investment.\nMedia Contact:\nVal O'Reilly\n(952) 334-0404\nval@bettison.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sunrise-energy-ventures-announces-the-purchase-of-site-in-macomb-il-300594481.html\nSOURCE Sunrise Energy Ventures, LLC",
