Under the program, iRobot may purchase up to $50 million of its common stock beginning March 28, 2018 and ending December 28, 2018.\nUnder the repurchase program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through Rule 10b5-1 plans (which would permit the Company to repurchase shares when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws), open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
