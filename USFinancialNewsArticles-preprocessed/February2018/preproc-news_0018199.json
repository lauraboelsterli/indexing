    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 6:41 AM / in 24 minutes LIVE MARKETS-BAML's Bull & Bear indicator still says \"sell\" Reuters Staff \n* U.S. stocks plunged around 4 percent \n* Asian shares sink \n* European bourses seen opening lower \nFeb 9 (Reuters) - Welcome to the home for real time coverage of European equity markets brought to you by Reuters stocks reporters and anchored today by Julien Ponthus. Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: julien.ponthus.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net \nBAML‘S BULL & BEAR INDICATOR STILL SAYS SELL (0635 GMT) \nBank of America Merrill-Lynch’s indicator of market sentiment is down from 8.6 to 8.5 but that, according to its analysts, remains in “excess bullish” territory and still signals a “sell”. \nThe indicator had jumped of market sentiment jumped from 7.9 to 8.6 on Jan 30, driven up by record inflows to equities and bullish hedge fund risk appetite. \n(Julien Ponthus) \nMORNING CALL: EUROPE TO OPEN IN THE RED AFTER NEW WALL STREET SELL-OFF (0615 GMT) \nGood morning and welcome to Live Markets. \nEuropean bourses are expected to open in the red this morning after Wall Street’s fresh new sell-off. The bottom of the slide remains elusive but this current trend sure seems to be threatening to throw the market’s bull run off course. \nSpreadbetters are calling the DAX 23 points lower, the CAC 40 down 8 points, and the FTSE down 40 points. \nConsidering that U.S. stocks plunged around 4 percent on Thursday, this looks, so far, like a limited reaction from our side of the pond. . \n(Julien Ponthus)",
