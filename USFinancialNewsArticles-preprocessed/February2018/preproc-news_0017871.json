(the “Company” or “PJT Partners”) (NYSE:PJT) today reported Total Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $499.3 million compared with $499.4 million for 2016. GAAP Pretax Income and Adjusted Pretax Income were $10.1 million and $86.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $14.5 million and $93.3 million, respectively, for 2016.\nTotal Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $190.6 million compared with $173.5 million for 2016. GAAP Pretax Income and Adjusted Pretax Income were $25.7 million and $43.8 million, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $24.0 million and $42.9 million, respectively, for 2016.\nPaul J.

The decrease was primarily due to lower corporate private placement revenues.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Total Revenues were $190.6 million compared with $173.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 10%.\nAdvisory Revenues were $153.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $136.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 12%. The increase in Advisory Revenues was driven by higher average fees earned during the quarter, primarily as a result of several large revenue events during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPlacement Revenues were $33.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $36.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 6%. The decrease was primarily due to lower corporate private placement revenues.\nExpenses\nThe following tables set forth information relating to the Company’s expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 GAAP As Adjusted GAAP As Adjusted (Dollars in Millions) Expenses Compensation and Benefits $ 391.5 $ 320.2 $ 381.0 $ 315.2 % of Revenues 78.4 % 64.1 % 76.3 % 63.1 % Non-Compensation $ 97.7 $ 92.3 $ 103.9 $ 91.0 % of Revenues 19.6 % 18.5 % 20.8 % 18.2 % Total Expenses $ 489.2 $ 412.5 $ 484.9 $ 406.1 % of Revenues 98.0 % 82.6 % 97.1 % 81.3 % Pretax Income $ 10.1 $ 86.8 $ 14.5 $ 93.3 % of Revenues 2.0 % 17.4 % 2.9 % 18.7 % Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 GAAP As Adjusted GAAP As Adjusted (Dollars in Millions) Expenses Compensation and Benefits $ 140.3 $ 122.6 $ 125.0 $ 107.5 % of Revenues 73.6 % 64.3 % 72.1 % 62.0 % Non-Compensation $ 24.6 $ 24.1 $ 24.5 $ 23.1 % of Revenues 12.9 % 12.7 % 14.1 % 13.3 % Total Expenses $ 164.9 $ 146.7 $ 149.5 $ 130.6 % of Revenues 86.5 % 77.0 % 86.2 % 75.3 % Pretax Income $ 25.7 $ 43.8 $ 24.0 $ 42.9 % of Revenues 13.5 % 23.0 % 13.8 % 24.7 % Compensation and Benefits Expense\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016\nGAAP Compensation and Benefits Expense was $391.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $381.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted Compensation and Benefits Expense was $320.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $315.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in Compensation and Benefits Expense was primarily due to increased headcount.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016\nGAAP Compensation and Benefits Expense was $140.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $125.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted Compensation and Benefits Expense was $122.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $107.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in Compensation and Benefits Expense was primarily due to higher revenues and increased headcount.\nNon-Compensation Expense\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016\nGAAP Non-Compensation Expense was $97.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $103.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted Non-Compensation Expense was $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $91.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGAAP Non-Compensation Expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by decreases in Other Expenses and Depreciation and Amortization, and partially offset by increases in Travel and Related and Communications and Information Services. The decrease in Depreciation and Amortization is related to certain intangible assets identified in connection with the spin-off that were fully amortized in the prior year. Other Expenses were lower during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the absence of a non-recurring charge recorded during 2016 and lower bad debt expense.\nAdjusted Non-Compensation Expense increased slightly between the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, primarily due to increases in Travel and Related and Communications and Information Services being partially offset by a decrease in Other Expenses.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016\nGAAP Non-Compensation Expense was $24.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $24.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted Non-Compensation Expense was $24.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $23.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nGAAP Non-Compensation Expense was roughly flat during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016. Decreases in Other Expenses and Professional Fees were partially offset by increases in Travel and Related and Occupancy and Related. The decrease in Other Expenses is primarily related to a reduced payable to The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”) derived from a decrease in the net realized cash benefit from certain compensation-related tax deductions and lower bad debt expense.\nAdjusted Non-Compensation Expense increased slightly during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in Travel and Related and Occupancy and Related being partially offset by decreases in Other Expenses and Professional Fees.\nProvision for Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2017, PJT Partners Inc. owned 56.0% of PJT Partners Holdings LP. PJT Partners Inc. is subject to corporate U.S. federal and state income tax while PJT Partners Holdings LP is subject to New York City unincorporated business tax and other entity-level taxes imposed by certain state and foreign jurisdictions. Please refer to Note 11. “Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)” in the “Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements” in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for further information about the corporate ownership structure.\nIn calculating Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted, the Company has assumed that all outstanding Class A partnership units in PJT Partners Holdings LP (“Partnership Units”) (excluding the unvested partnership units that have yet to satisfy certain market conditions) have been exchanged into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, subjecting all of the Company’s income to corporate-level tax.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Legislation”) was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and lowers the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The estimated impact of Tax Legislation was an increase in income tax expense of $24.7 million due to the effects of the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets at a lower enacted corporate tax rate. Additionally, the Company recorded an adjustment related to the Amount Due Pursuant to Tax Receivable Agreement in the amount of $1.6 million in Interest Income and Other. The impact of Tax Legislation may differ from the estimated amounts recorded, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of the Company’s calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of Tax Legislation.\nThe effective tax rate for Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 32.3%, which excludes the tax benefits of the adjustments for transaction-related equity-based compensation expense, amortization expense, spin-off-related payables due to Blackstone as well as the impact of the deferred tax asset remeasurement related to the enactment of the Tax Legislation and return to provision adjustments. The decrease in tax rate from the year ended December 31, 2016 is due primarily to an increased tax benefit related to the deliveries of vested shares during 2017 at values in excess of their amortized cost.\nCapital Management and Balance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company held cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $182.7 million and there was no funded debt.\nPartnership Units may be presented to the Company for exchange on a quarterly basis and repurchased for cash, or at the Company’s election, for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 155,335 Partnership Units for cash at a price of $39.58 per Partnership Unit. An additional 533,799 Partnership Units have been presented to be exchanged, which the Company intends to repurchase for cash on February 14, 2018 at a price to be determined by the per share volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock on February 9, 2018.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn October 26, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock in an amount up to $100 million. Under this repurchase program, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 60,333 shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $38.12, or $2.3 million in aggregate, pursuant to this share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2017, the available amount remaining for repurchases under this program was $97.7 million.\nDividend\nThe Board of Directors of PJT Partners Inc. has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share of Class A common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 21, 2018 to Class A common stockholders of record on March 7, 2018.\nQuarterly Investor Call Details\nPJT Partners will host a conference call on February 7, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss its full year and fourth quarter 2017 results.

Forward-looking statements include certain information concerning future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “could” or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.\nForward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

These measures should not be considered substitutes for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes the following non-GAAP measures, when presented together with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to investors in understanding the Company’s operating results: Adjusted Pretax Income; Adjusted Net Income; Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted, in total and on a per-share basis; Adjusted Compensation and Benefits Expense and Adjusted Non-Compensation Expense. These non-GAAP measures, presented and discussed in this earnings release, remove the significant accounting impact of: (a) transaction-related equity-based compensation expense, including expense related to Partnership Units with both time-based vesting and market conditions as well as equity-based retention awards granted in connection with the spin-off; (b) intangible asset amortization associated with Blackstone’s initial public offering (“IPO”) and the acquisition of PJT Capital LP; and (c) the amount the Company has agreed to pay Blackstone related to the net realized cash benefit from certain compensation-related tax deductions. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and further detail regarding the adjustments are provided in the Appendix.\nTo help investors understand the effect of the Company’s ownership structure on its Adjusted Net Income, the Company has presented Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted. This measure illustrates the impact of taxes on Adjusted Pretax Income, assuming all Partnership Units (excluding the unvested partnership units that have yet to satisfy certain market conditions) were exchanged for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, resulting in all of the Company’s income becoming subject to corporate-level tax, considering both current and deferred income tax effects and the annualization of discrete permanent differences.\nAppendix\nGAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited)\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Data (unaudited)\nSummary of Shares Outstanding (unaudited)\nFootnotes\nPJT Partners Inc.\nGAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited)\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues Advisory $ 153,118 $ 136,250 $ 386,263 $ 377,610 Placement 33,873 36,038 102,785 114,968 Interest Income and Other 3,562 1,208 10,234 6,852 Total Revenues 190,553 173,496 499,282 499,430 Expenses Compensation and Benefits 140,256 125,024 391,514 381,000 Occupancy and Related 7,278 6,294 26,889 25,815 Travel and Related 4,292 2,725 13,617 11,480 Professional Fees 3,910 4,755 19,276 18,925 Communications and Information Services 2,947 2,205 10,770 8,875 Depreciation and Amortization 1,991 2,096 8,143 14,026 Other Expenses 4,216 6,415 19,019 24,809 Total Expenses 164,890 149,514 489,228 484,930 Income Before Provision for Taxes 25,663 23,982 10,054 14,500 Provision for Taxes 54,027 5,253 38,380 9,392 Net Income (Loss) (28,364 ) 18,729 (28,326 ) 5,108 Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests 9,081 11,984 4,228 8,142 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to PJT Partners Inc. $ (37,445 ) $ 6,745 $ (32,554 ) $ (3,034 ) Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Class A Common Stock — Basic and Diluted\n$ (1.98 ) $ 0.35 $ (1.73 ) $ (0.17 ) Weighted-Average Shares of Class A Common Stock Outstanding — Basic and Diluted\n18,899,800 18,324,043 18,858,010 18,292,717 PJT Partners Inc.\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Data (unaudited)\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Net Income (Loss) $ (28,364 ) $ 18,729 $ (28,326 ) $ 5,108 Less: GAAP Provision for Taxes 54,027 5,253 38,380 9,392 GAAP Pretax Income 25,663 23,982 10,054 14,500 Adjustments to GAAP Pretax Income Transaction-Related Compensation Expense (1) 17,681 17,540 71,343 65,849 Amortization of Intangible Assets (2) 584 666 2,418 8,870 Spin-Off-Related Payable Due to Blackstone (3) (79 ) 740 2,995 4,096 Adjusted Pretax Income 43,849 42,928 86,810 93,315 Adjusted Taxes (4) 38,446 7,881 45,476 19,258 Adjusted Net Income 5,403 35,047 41,334 74,057 If-Converted Adjustments Less: Adjusted Taxes (4) (38,446 ) (7,881 ) (45,476 ) (19,258 ) Add: If-Converted Taxes (5) 13,592 16,301 28,073 35,777 Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted $ 30,257 $ 26,627 $ 58,737 $ 57,538 GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Class A Common Stock — Basic and Diluted\n$ (1.98 ) $ 0.35 $ (1.73 ) $ (0.17 ) GAAP Weighted-Average Shares of Class A Common Stock Outstanding — Basic and Diluted\n18,899,800 18,324,043 18,858,010 18,292,717 Adjusted Net Income, If-Converted Per Share $ 0.79 $ 0.70 $ 1.54 $ 1.55 Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding, If-Converted 38,227,666 37,783,502 38,048,652 37,182,657 PJT Partners Inc.\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Data – continued (unaudited)\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Compensation and Benefits Expense $ 140,256 $ 125,024 $ 391,514 $ 381,000 Transaction-Related Compensation Expense (1) (17,681 ) (17,540 ) (71,343 ) (65,849 ) Adjusted Compensation and Benefits Expense $ 122,575 $ 107,484 $ 320,171 $ 315,151 Non-Compensation Expenses Occupancy and Related $ 7,278 $ 6,294 $ 26,889 $ 25,815 Travel and Related 4,292 2,725 13,617 11,480 Professional Fees 3,910 4,755 19,276 18,925 Communications and Information Services 2,947 2,205 10,770 8,875 Depreciation and Amortization 1,991 2,096 8,143 14,026 Other Expenses 4,216 6,415 19,019 24,809 GAAP Non-Compensation Expense 24,634 24,490 97,714 103,930 Amortization of Intangible Assets (2) (584 ) (666 ) (2,418 ) (8,870 ) Spin-Off-Related Payable Due to Blackstone (3) 79 (740 ) (2,995 ) (4,096 ) Adjusted Non-Compensation Expense $ 24,129 $ 23,084 $ 92,301 $ 90,964 PJT Partners Inc.\nSummary of Shares Outstanding (unaudited)\nThe following table provides a summary of weighted-average shares outstanding for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for both basic and diluted shares.

During the preceding 30 trading days, the Company’s stock price exceeded the initial share price threshold ($48); however, the market condition has not yet been satisfied. If the market condition is satisfied, an additional 1.25 million shares will be included in the Company’s share count.\nAdditionally, the Company intends to repurchase approximately 534,000 Partnership Units for cash as part of the February 2018 exchange and may continue to repurchase shares in the open market pursuant to its share repurchase program.\nFootnotes\n(1) This adjustment adds back to GAAP Pretax Income transaction-related equity-based compensation expense for Partnership Units with both time-based vesting and market conditions as well as equity-based retention awards granted in connection with the spin-off. (2) This adjustment adds back to GAAP Pretax Income amounts for the amortization of intangible assets that are associated with Blackstone’s IPO and amounts for the amortization of intangible assets identified in connection with the acquisition of PJT Capital LP on October 1, 2015. (3) This adjustment adds back to GAAP Pretax Income the amount the Company has agreed to pay Blackstone related to the net realized cash benefit from certain compensation-related tax deductions. Such expense is reflected in Other Expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. (4) Represents taxes on Adjusted Pretax Income, considering both current and deferred income tax effects for the current ownership structure. (5) Represents taxes on Adjusted Pretax Income, assuming all Partnership Units (excluding the unvested partnership units that have yet to satisfy market conditions) were exchanged for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, resulting in all of the Company’s income becoming subject to corporate-level tax, considering both current and deferred income tax effects, permanent differences, as well as the impact of the deferred tax asset remeasurement related to the enactment of the Tax Legislation and return to provision adjustments.\n(6) Represents number of dilutive shares calculated under the treasury method for the unvested, non-participating RSUs that have a remaining service requirement. (7) Excludes 6.3 million unvested Partnership Units as of December 31, 2017 that have yet to satisfy certain market conditions. The first share price threshold target with respect to the Earn-Out units will be deemed satisfied if the volume-weighted average price of a share of the Company’s Class A common stock reaches $48 over any 30 consecutive trading-day period ending prior to October 1, 2021.\n(8) Assumes all Partnership Units and unvested participating RSUs have been converted to shares of the Company’s Class A common stock.\nNote: Amounts presented in tables above may not add or recalculate due to rounding.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207005443/en/\nMedia Relations:\nJoele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher\nJulie Oakes, +1 212.355.4449\nPJT-JF@joelefrank.com\nor\nInvestor Relations:\nPJT Partners Inc.\nSharon Pearson, +1 212.364.7120\npearson@pjtpartners.com\nSource: PJT Partners Inc.",
