    "text": "February 6, 2018 / 5:31 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago At least two dead in magnitude 6.4 quake in Taiwan - Premier Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nTAIPEI (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck near the coastal city of Hualien in Taiwan late on Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, killing at least two people and causing several buildings to collapse. \nThe quake struck about 22 km (14 miles) northeast of Hualien shortly before midnight, and the epicentre was very shallow at just 1km, the USGS said. \n“Two people were unfortunately killed, and 114 have suffered light or severe injuries,” Taiwan’s Premier William Lai told an emergency government meeting. \nA number of aftershocks hit the area, but there was no word of any tsunami warning. \nHualien is a popular tourist destination on Taiwan’s eastern coast and home to about 100,000 people. \n“The president has asked the cabinet and related ministries to immediately launch the ‘disaster mechanism’ and to work at the fastest rate on disaster relief work,” President Tsai Ing-wen’s office said in a statement.

He said the government would provide further updates on the situation later on Wednesday morning. \nAmong the buildings toppled in the quake was the Marshal Hotel in Hualien, where three people were trapped inside, the government said.

Related Coverage \nOn Sunday an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 struck nearby. \nTaiwan, a self-ruled island that China considers part of its territory, is prone to earthquakes. \nMore than 100 were killed in a quake in southern Taiwan in 2016, and some Taiwanese remain scarred by a 1999 earthquake with 7.6 magnitude whose impact was felt across the island and in which more than 2,000 people died.
