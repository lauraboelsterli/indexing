The Guptas and their companies have not been charged with any crime and they say they are the victims of a politically motivated witch-hunt.\nBank of Baroda said on Monday it would shut its doors in South Africa at the end of March as part of a plan to rationalise its branches in international markets.\n“The branch will stop taking new / incremental deposits and disbursing loans with effect from 1st March 2018,” it said in a statement.\nThe South African Reserve Bank said it was in talks with the bank to ensure its “orderly withdrawal from South Africa so that no depositor is disadvantaged”.\nBaroda has about 3.9 billion rand ($325.99 million) worth of assets in South Africa, significantly smaller than 1.2 trillion rand and 979 billion rand at Standard Bank and FirstRand, respectively.\n“The business in South Africa is not very significant and will not have any major impact on the financials of the bank,” the parent company said in an emailed response to Reuters.\nSeparately, a source with knowledge of the decision said in addition to strategic shake-up, the Gupta scandal was among the reasons for the company’s decision to quit South Africa.\nBLOW FOR GUPTAS Baroda’s decision will deal another blow for Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments, which has interests in mining, hotels, computers and engineering, one industry source said.\n“It was inevitable for Baroda to pull the plug,” the industry source said.\nOakbay Investments was not immediately available for comment on Monday.\nBetween December 2015 and April 2016, all four major South African banks - Standard Bank, Nedbank, Barclays Africa and FirstRand - terminated the accounts of companies controlled by the Guptas, citing reputational risk.\nIn September, Oakbay lost a court bid to stop Bank of Baroda from closing its accounts.\n$1 = 11.9637 rand Additional reporting by Davidutta Tripathy in Mumbai; Editing by James Macharia and Jane Merriman\n ",
