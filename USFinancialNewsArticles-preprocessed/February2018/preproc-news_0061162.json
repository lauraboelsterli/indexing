(NASDAQ: SSYS), a global leader in applied additive technology solutions, announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nQ4 2017 Financial Results Summary:\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $179.3 million, compared to $175.3 million for the same period last year.\nGAAP gross margin was 48.7% for the quarter, compared to a GAAP gross margin of 47.3% for the same period last year.

Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $8.4 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to Non-GAAP net income of $7.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, reported for the same period last year. Net R&D expenses for the quarter amounted to $26.6 million, representing 14.8% of net revenues. The Company generated $21.0 million in cash from operations during the fourth quarter and ended the period with $328.8 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nFiscal 2017 Financial Results Summary:\nRevenue for fiscal 2017 was $668.4 million compared to $672.5 million for fiscal 2016. GAAP operating loss for fiscal 2017 was $30.5 million, compared to a loss of $86.7 million for fiscal 2016. Non-GAAP operating income was $36.7 million, compared to $29.0 million for fiscal 2016 GAAP net loss for fiscal 2017 was $40.0 million, or ($0.75) per diluted share, compared to a loss of $77.2 million, or ($1.48) per diluted share, for fiscal 2016. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2017 was $24.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $14.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, reported for fiscal 2016. The Company generated $61.9 million in cash from operations in fiscal 2017.\n“Our fourth quarter results reflect the momentum that we built throughout the year, which we attribute to the positive market reaction to several new product introductions, including our F123 Series launched in February, 2017 and the more recently commercialized H2000 and J700 Dental Solutions, as well as investments in specific go-to-market initiatives for our target verticals of aerospace, automotive, and healthcare,” said Ilan Levin, Chief Executive Officer of Stratasys. “Our improved profitability and healthy cash generation in the quarter demonstrates the success of our alignment of resources to support our strategic roadmap.”\nNew Metal Technology\nFor nearly 30 years Stratasys has been pioneering the development and adoption of 3D printing and additive manufacturing technologies, including the precise, repeatable, and reliable FDM and PolyJet 3D printing platforms.\nBuilding on its track record of innovation and leadership, Stratasys is today revealing the development of a new additive manufacturing process, designed from inception to address short-run metal manufacturing.\nThe innovative Stratasys platform was developed internally over the past several years, incorporating the Company’s proprietary jetting technology. The platform was designed from inception to provide the values of additive manufacturing for short-run production, while overcoming material limitations of currently available metal-based additive manufacturing systems. With this new technology, Stratasys believes it will offer customers a new ability to short-run manufacture metal parts made with commonly used powder metallurgy, starting with aluminum, at an economically competitive cost-per-part and throughput, with easy to implement post-processing and high part quality.\nFor more information, please reference the separate press release issued today by the Company .\nThe Company will unveil further details about this new technology at the RAPID + TCT 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Conference, taking place from April 23-26 in Fort Worth, Texas.\nBeginning in 2018, the Company is ramping up investment activity to accelerate long term development programs to expand its addressable markets, including the new metal additive manufacturing platform, as well as further advancements based on FDM and PolyJet technologies.\n“Following a period of incubation over the last several years, we are excited to share details of our technology roadmap, which we believe will deliver the promise of additive manufacturing to short-run metal part production,” continued Levin. “As a pioneer and leader in the additive manufacturing industry, Stratasys is increasing its investments in the development of innovative technologies and application knowledge to drive adoption through deeper customer engagement.”\nFinancial Guidance:\nStratasys today provided the following information regarding the company’s guidance for projected revenue and net income for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018:\nRevenue guidance of $670 to $700 million. Non-GAAP net income of $16 to $27 million, or $0.30 to $0.50 per diluted share. GAAP net loss of $41 to $25 million, or ($0.75) to ($0.46) per diluted share.\nStratasys provided the following additional guidelines regarding the company’s projected performance and strategic plans for 2018:\nNon-GAAP operating margins of 4.5% to 6%. Capital expenditures are projected at $40 to $50 million.\nThe Company’s guidance reflects increased investments in R&D, tools, materials, and additional resources aimed at expanding addressable markets by accelerating development efforts for the new metal additive manufacturing platform, further advancements based on our FDM and PolyJet technologies, and specific go-to-market initiatives in order to deepen customer engagement.\nGiven the expected ongoing negative impact of not recording a tax benefit on U.S. tax losses on the Company’s non-GAAP net income, the Company believes that the rate of growth in its non-GAAP operating income will be the best measure of performance.\nNon-GAAP earnings guidance excludes $32 to $34 million of projected amortization of intangible assets; $17 to $19 million of share-based compensation expense; and $7 to $9 million in reorganization and other related costs; and includes $4 to $5 million in tax expenses related to non-GAAP adjustments.\nStratasys Ltd. Q4 and Full Year 2017 Conference Call Details\nThe Company plans to hold the conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year financial results on Wednesday, February 28, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\nThe investor conference call will be available via live webcast on the Stratasys website at www.stratasys.com under the “Investors” tab; or directly at the following web address: https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/cvm4w4jn .\nTo participate by telephone, the domestic dial-in number is (866) 394-5776 and the international dial-in is (409) 350-3596.

These on current information that is, by its nature, subject to rapid and even abrupt change. Due to risks and uncertainties associated with Stratasys’ business, actual results could differ materially from those projected or implied by these . These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the degree of market acceptance of our 3D printers, high-performance systems and consumables, and the software and technology included in those systems; potential declines in the demand for, or the prices of, our products and services, or volume of our sales, due to decreased demand either for them specifically or in the 3D printing market generally; potential further charges against earnings that we could be required to take due to impairment of additional goodwill or other intangible assets; potential shifts in our product mix to lower-margin products or in our revenues mix towards our AM services business; any failure to adequately adapt our infrastructure and properly integrate the internal and external sources of our growth to generate intended benefits (including from the companies that we recently acquired); the impact of competition and new technologies; risks related to our relationships with our suppliers, resellers and independent sales agents, and our operations at our manufacturing sites; risks related to the international scope of our operations and regulatory compliance (including reporting, environmental, anti-corruption and other regulatory compliance) related to that scope of operations; risks related to the security of our information systems (including risks related to potential cyber-attacks); changes in the overall global economic environment or in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; changes in our strategy; costs and potential liability relating to litigation and regulatory proceedings; and those additional factors referred to in Item 3.D “Key Information - Risk Factors”, Item 4, “Information on the Company”, Item 5, “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects,” and all other parts of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “ 2017 Annual Report ”), which report is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) on the same day on which this press release is being issued. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made throughout our 2017 Annual Report and our other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, which are designed to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any guidance provided, and other made, in this press release are made as of the date hereof, and Stratasys undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nUse of non-GAAP financial measures\nThe non-GAAP data included herein, which excludes certain items as described below, are non-GAAP financial measures. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful information for investors and shareholders of our Company in gauging our results of operations (x) on an ongoing basis after excluding merger and acquisition related expense and reorganization-related charges, and (y) excluding non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expenses, acquired intangible assets amortization, impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, changes in fair value of obligations in connection with acquisitions and the corresponding tax effect of those items. We also exclude, when applicable, non-recurring changes of non-cash valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, as well as, non-recurring significant tax charges or benefits that relate to prior periods which we do not believe are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. These non-GAAP adjustments either do not reflect actual cash outlays that impact our liquidity and our financial condition or have a non-recurring impact on the statement of operations, as assessed by management. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses our performance for internal planning and forecasting purposes. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of our results of operations without including all items indicated above during a period, which may not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in our industry. Investors and other readers should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared Reconciliation between results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in a table below.\nStratasys Ltd.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share data)\nDecember 31, December 31, 2017 2016 ASSETS Current assets $ 328,761 $ 280,328 Accounts receivable, net 132,671 120,411 Inventories 115,717 117,521 Net investment in sales-type leases 7,208 11,717 Prepaid expenses 7,696 7,571 Other current assets 22,858 15,491 Total current assets 614,911 553,039 Non-current assets Net investment in sales-type leases - long term 4,439 12,126 Property, plant and equipment, net 199,951 208,415 Goodwill 387,108 385,629 Other intangible assets, net 142,122 177,458 Other non-current assets 31,219 29,382 Total non-current assets 764,839 813,010 Total assets $ 1,379,750 $ 1,366,049 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 39,849 $ 40,933 Current portion of long term-debt 5,143 3,714 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 30,041 32,207 Accrued compensation and related benefits 35,356 34,186 Obligations in connection with acquisitions - 3,619 Deferred revenues 52,908 49,952 Total current liabilities 163,297 164,611 Non-current liabilities Long-term debt 27,143 22,286 Deferred tax liabilities 7,069 5,952 Deferred revenues - long-term 15,200 12,922 Other non-current liabilities 32,899 22,251 Total non-current liabilities 82,311 63,411 Total liabilities 245,608 228,022 Redeemable non-controlling interests 1,635 2,029 Equity Ordinary shares, NIS 0.01 nominal value, authorized 180,000 thousands shares; 53,631 thousands shares and 52,639 thousands shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively\n145 142 Additional paid-in capital 2,663,274 2,633,129 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (7,023 ) (13,479 ) Accumulated deficit (1,523,906 ) (1,483,925 ) Equity attributable to Stratasys Ltd. 1,132,490 1,135,867 Non-controlling interest 17 131 Total equity 1,132,507 1,135,998 Total liabilities and equity $ 1,379,750 $ 1,366,049 Stratasys Ltd.
