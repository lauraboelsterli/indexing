Net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased by 3.6% to $762.3 million, compared to $735.5 million for the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased by 59.4% to $20.7 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared to net income of $13.0 million, or $0.49 per diluted share for the prior year quarter.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which among other changes, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate. This rate reduction took effect on January 1, 2018, and the Company expects its corporate income tax rate for 2018 to range from 27% to 29%. The Company was also required to adjust its net deferred tax balance, which resulted in the Company recording a non-cash income tax benefit of $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, the Company recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, a special charge of $2.7 million related to a one-time cash bonus paid to all non-executive employees. Earnings per share, adjusted for the reduction of federal income tax expense and the special bonus described above, was $0.54 cents per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.52 cents per share for the prior year quarter.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2.9 billion, an increase of $219.3 million or 8.1%, compared to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $54.9 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $48.1 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense and rebranding, acquisition and restructuring costs (“Adjusted EBITDA”), a non-GAAP measure, totaled $94.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $95.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nQuarterly Performance by Segment :\nNet sales for the Business Solutions (SMB) segment increased by 7.6% to $298.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the prior year quarter. Desktop, servers, and software products experienced strong revenue growth in this segment with an increase of 31%, 26%, and 15%, respectively. Gross margin decreased by 17 basis points due to an increase in sales of velocity products, such as desktops and notebooks. Net sales for the Enterprise Solutions (Large Account) segment increased by 7.2% to $308.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the prior year quarter. Storage, software, and servers experienced solid growth during the quarter at 37%, 16%, and 8%, respectively. Gross margin decreased by 43 basis points primarily due to a continued competitive market environment. Net sales to the Public Sector Solutions segment decreased by 8.8% to $155.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the prior year quarter. Sales to state and local government and educational institutions decreased by 5.1%, compared to the prior year quarter, and sales to the federal government decreased by 11.9%. Gross margin decreased by 56 basis points primarily due to an ongoing competitive market environment.\nQuarterly Sales by Product Mix :\nSoftware sales, the Company’s largest product category, increased by 20% year over year and accounted for 24% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 21% of net sales in the prior year quarter. We experienced solid growth in cloud-based offerings, security, and office productivity. Notebook/mobility sales decreased slightly year over year and accounted for 21% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 22% of net sales in the prior year quarter. Sales of this product category grew year over year in Business Solutions and Enterprise Solutions, but were offset by lower notebook sales made under federal contracts in our Public Sector, compared to the prior year quarter. Desktop sales increased slightly year over year and accounted for 11% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016. Desktop sales to federal government customers in the Public Sector declined year over year but were offset by strong year-over-year growth in the Business Solutions segment. Servers increased by 22% year over year and accounted for 5% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 4% of net sales in the prior year quarter. Both Business Solutions and Enterprise Solutions experienced strong year-over-year growth in server sales.\nOverall gross profit increased by $1.4 million, or 1.4%, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the prior year quarter. Consolidated gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 13.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 13.3% for the prior year quarter. The decline in gross margin was attributed to higher sales of velocity products and an ongoing competitive marketplace.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $77.6 million from $77.2 million in the prior year quarter due to increased variable compensation on our higher gross profits, as well as the one-time bonus discussed above. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 10.2%, compared to 10.3% in the prior year quarter. We continue to invest in technical solution sales capabilities and expect SG&A expenses to rise accordingly. However, we are highly focused on improving efficiencies and streamlining wherever possible.\nTotal cash was $50.0 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $49.2 million at December 31, 2016. In January 2018, we paid a 34 cent per share special dividend to shareholders, which totaled $9.1 million. Days sales outstanding were 48 days at December 31, 2017, unchanged from the prior year end, and inventory turns were 24 turns in the fourth quarter of 2017, up slightly from 22 days in the prior year quarter.\n“I was pleased to see continued growth in our four strategic vertical markets; manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and finance. We also saw strong growth in software and workforce productivity during the quarter,” said Tim McGrath, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe our team and the strategies we have in place position Connection well to gain market share and increase long-term shareholder value,” concluded Mr. McGrath.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures.
