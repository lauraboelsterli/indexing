It isn’t clear specifically whose data the centers would house or who would control them. \nSenior executives at Aramco and Alphabet GOOG, -0.22% GOOGL, -0.16% have been in talks for months on the potential joint venture, these people said. The talks have included Alphabet Chief Executive Larry Page and have been encouraged by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is enamored with Silicon Valley and wants to bring more tech expertise to the kingdom, some of the people said. Prince Mohammed has been leading the kingdom’s plan to take Aramco public.",
