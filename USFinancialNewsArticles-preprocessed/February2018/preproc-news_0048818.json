    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- New York REIT, Inc. (NYSE: NYRT) (the \"Company\" or \"NYRT\"), which is liquidating and winding down pursuant to a plan of liquidation, announced that it has closed on the previously announced sales of its properties located at 306 East 61 st Street and One Jackson Square, New York, New York as well as its 2091 Coney Island Avenue, Brooklyn, New York property in three separate transactions to unaffiliated third parties.\nThe 306 East 61 st Street property was sold for a total of $47.0 million. The 306 East 61 st Street property was encumbered by a $19 million mortgage loan which was fully satisfied at closing. After satisfaction of debt, pro-rations and closing costs, NYRT received net proceeds of approximately $26.5 million. The selling price is approximately $7.0 million higher than the Company's last reported net assets in liquidation value as of September 30, 2017.\nThe One Jackson Square property was sold for a total of $31.0 million. The One Jackson Square property was part of the collateral for the Company's cross collateralized and secured loan. In connection with the sale, the Company paid approximately $13.0 million on account of the loan as required by the loan documents, resulting in a remaining outstanding principal balance on the loan of approximately $41.2 million. After satisfaction of debt, pro-rations and closing costs, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $16.5 million. The selling price is consistent with the Company's last reported net assets in liquidation value as of September 30, 2017.\nThe 2091 Coney Island Avenue property, which is part of 1100 Kings Highway, was sold for a total of $3.8 million. The 2091 Coney Island property was collateral for the $20.2 million 1100 Kings Highway loan and required a $4.4 million pay down at closing to release the property from the collateral. The selling price is consistent with the Company's last reported net assets in liquidation value as of September 30, 2017.\nThe Company has also announced that it has entered into three separate contracts to sell its 416 Washington Street property, its remaining 1100 Kings Highway property and its properties located at 350 Bleecker Street and 367-387 Bleecker Street to third party buyers for an aggregate amount of $73.2 million. In the aggregate, the properties are encumbered by approximately $42.4 million of mortgage debt which will be fully satisfied at the respective closings.\nIf consummated, the sales of the properties are expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. The consummation of the sales are subject to customary closing conditions for sales of real property in Brooklyn, New York and New York, New York. The aggregate sales price of $73.2 million is consistent with the Company's last reported net assets in liquidation value as of September 30, 2017.\nAbout NYRT\nNYRT is a publicly traded real estate investment trust listed on the NYSE that owns income-producing commercial real estate, including office and retail properties, located in New York City.
