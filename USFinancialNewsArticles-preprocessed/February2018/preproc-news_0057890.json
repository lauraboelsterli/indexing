Importantly, our growth in assets and earnings was accompanied by attractive credit spreads, which were achieved while targeting transitional loans with shorter borrower business plans. We are off to a strong start in 2018, generating solid growth in assets and strengthening our liabilities by issuing a $932.4 million CRE CLO to provide low cost, matched-term funding for almost one-third of our high-quality loan portfolio. Our performance in this highly competitive environment demonstrates the importance of our long term lending, credit and capital markets experience.\"\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, GAAP net income and Core Earnings increased to $24.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share, compared to $20.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share, during the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The increase was due primarily to net loan portfolio growth of $352.4 million and increased LIBOR during the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, GAAP net income and Core Earnings increased to $94.4 million, or $1.74 per diluted common share, compared to $70.0 million, or $1.69 per diluted common share, during the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was due primarily to net loan portfolio growth of $727.0 million, an increase in LIBOR, and a decrease in overall funding costs. This increase was partially offset by an increase in Management Fees and Incentive Management Fees of $5.3 million due primarily to a $211.6 million increase in stockholders’ equity resulting from the Company’s initial public offering in July 2017.\nINVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS\nThe following loan investments closed during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017:\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company originated and closed seven first mortgage loans with a total commitment amount of $494.58 million, an initial funding amount of $451.77 million, and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 63.7%.

1.62 1. Represents GAAP net income attributable to our common and Class A common stockholders. 2. We use Core Earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations. Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our stockholders, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss), and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) unrealized gains (losses), and (iv) certain non-cash items. Core Earnings may also be adjusted from time to time to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges as determined by our Manager, subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors. The exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of Core Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments. We believe that Core Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. This adjusted measure helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations. Although pursuant to the Management Agreement we calculate the incentive and base management fees due to our Manager using Core Earnings before incentive fees expense, we report Core Earnings after incentive fee expense, because we believe this is a more meaningful presentation of the economic performance of our common and Class A common stock. Core Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, or an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other companies.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180226006611/en/\nTPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.\nInvestor Relations\n212-405-8500\nIR@tpgrefinance.com\nor\nMedia\nLuke Barrett, 415-743-1550\nmedia@tpg.com\nSource: TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.",
