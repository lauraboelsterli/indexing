    "text": "Daniel Gafford scored 19 points as Arkansas defeated Ole Miss 75-64 in an SEC game Tuesday night in Oxford, Miss.\nDarious Hall added 14 points and 11 rebounds and Anton Beard and Jaylen Barford scored 13 each for Arkansas (18-8, 7-6), which completed a season sweep, having beaten Ole Miss 97-93 on Jan. 20 in Fayetteville, Ark. The Razorbacks host No. 21 Texas A&M on Saturday.\nDeandre Burnett scored 24 and Markel Crawford had 17 to lead Ole Miss (11-15, 4-9), which lost its fifth game in a row. The Rebels, who were playing their first game since Andy Kennedy announced Monday that he is resigning at the end of the season after 12 seasons as Ole Miss coach, visit Mississippi State on Saturday.\nBurnett converted a three-point play and made a 3-pointer to lead a Rebels push that cut the Razorbacks’ nine-point halftime lead to two in the first three minutes of the second half.\nOle Miss twice got within one point before Arkansas rebuilt the lead to 48-42 midway through the second half.\nDevontae Shuler’s 3-pointer again cut the margin to one, but Hall made two 3-pointers and Beard made one during an 11-0 run that gave the Razorbacks a 64-52 lead with 5:45 left. They led by as many as 18 as the Rebels made just four field goals in the final eight minutes.\nOle Miss scored the first five points of the game and had an 8-2 lead before Arkansas got untracked offensively.\nBeard made two 3-pointers and Barford made one before Barford’s pair of free throws gave the Razorbacks their first lead at 19-18.\nAfter Burnett’s free throw tied the score, Arkansas scored six consecutive points for a 25-19 lead.\nBurnett made another free throw before Hall made a 3-pointer to start a 9-3 run that left the Razorbacks with a 34-23 halftime lead. Burnett had 12 first-half points and made 3 of 8 field goals, but his teammates were a combined 2 for 21 from the floor.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
