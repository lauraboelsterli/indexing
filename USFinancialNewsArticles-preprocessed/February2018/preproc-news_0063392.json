    "text": "Q4 2017: Year 2017: Net Sales: $127.0 million $449.4 million Income from operations: $2.5 million $7.8 million Net income: $1.1 million $5.1 million Diluted earnings per share: $0.25 per share $1.13 per share Dividend declared - $0.17 per share\nProvides Expected Adjustments Related to Adoption of New Revenue Standard Effective January 1, 2018\nEATONTOWN, N.J., Wayside Technology Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:WSTG) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The results will be discussed in a conference call to be held on Wednesday, February 28, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. EST. The dial-in telephone number is (844) 683-0552 and the pass code is “WSTG.” This conference call will be webcast by NASDAQ OMX and can be accessed at Wayside Technology’s website at www.waysidetechnology.com/site/content/webcasts .\n“2017 was another strong year for Wayside, especially as compared to a strong 2016. While our contribution from extended payment sales was down versus the prior year, we view these transactions as an opportunistic way to deploy excess cash resources when they are available, which varies from period to period,” said Simon F. Nynens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are excited about the recent additions of Dale Foster and Charles Bass to our management team, as well as the addition of Jeff Geygan to our Board.”\n2017 net income includes income tax charges of $0.2 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and transition tax for foreign unrepatriated earnings under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs plan and approximately $0.4 million related to a provision for state taxes for states with economic nexus statutes and other adjustments. These adjustments impact diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.14. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is expected to reduce our effective tax rate in 2017 to a range of 24%-26%.\nThe Company paid $3.1 million in dividends and utilized $3.0 million in stock buybacks during 2017. Stockholders’ equity was $38.7 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $37.6 million at December 31, 2016. Total working capital plus accounts receivable-long term was $36.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $35.1 million at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents was $5.5 million at December 31, 2017 and $13.5 million at December 31, 2016, representing 14% and 36% of equity, respectively.\nJeffrey R. Geygan joins our Board of Directors effective today, February 27, 2018. Jeffrey is President and CEO of Global Value Investment Corp., an investment research and advisory services firm he founded in 2007. The firm manages assets for individual and institutional clients across the United Sates while investing on a global basis. Prior to founding Global Value Investment Corp., Mr. Geygan served as a Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Financial Services, Inc. He has over 30 years of experience in the finance industry and is an expert in financial statement analysis.\nMr. Geygan has taught undergraduate and graduate-level courses at IE University in Madrid, Spain, the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee Lubar School of Business, and the College of Charleston. He is a frequent speaker at a variety of academic institutions. He serves on the Advisory Board of the University of Wisconsin – Madison Department of Economics as well as the Service Heat Treat Corporation, a Milwaukee, WI based industrial business. Mr. Geygan earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from the University of Wisconsin – Madison.\n“I am excited to join the board of Wayside and contribute to the success of the organization as it manages the challenges of future growth and profitability,” said Mr Geygan. Simon Nynens added, “I am looking forward to the insights Jeff provides from the perspective of an investor in our company as we strive to build long term value for our stakeholders.”\nOperating Results:\nNet sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 6% to $127 million compared to $120 million for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 14% to $117 million, compared to $102 million for the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased 44% to $10 million, compared to $18 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in TechXtend sales was primarily driven by extended payment term sales.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 7% to $449 million compared to $418 million for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 13% to $417 million, compared to $370 million for the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment net sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 34% to $32 million, compared to $49 million, for the same period in 2016.\nGross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased 6% to $7.5 million compared to $8.0 million for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased slightly to $6.3 million, compared to $6.2 million in the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 34% to $1.2 million, compared to $1.8 million in 2016.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 1% to $27.1 million, compared to $27.3 million for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 4% to $23.2 million, compared to $22.3 million for the same period in 2016. TechXtend gross profit decreased 22% to $3.9 million compared to $5.0 million in the prior year due to decreased extended payment term sales.\nGross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 6.0%, compared to 6.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 5.6%, compared to 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 2.0 percentage points to 12.2%, compared to 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased slightly to $5.0 million, compared to $5.1 million for the same quarter of 2016 due to lower personnel related expenses. Total SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 3% to $19.3 million, compared to $18.7 million in the same period in 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher employee related and other expenses to support our growth and compliance as a public company. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.3% in 2017 compared to 4.5% in 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.6 million and $3.5 million, respectively, compared to $1.0 and $3.0 in the prior year. The 2017 tax expense includes charges of $0.2 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and transition tax for foreign unrepatriated earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and approximately $0.4 million related to a provision for state taxes for states with economic nexus statutes and other adjustments. The new US tax law is expected to significantly benefit the 2018 tax rate, with an expected adjusted tax rate of approximately 24% to 26%.\nNet income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased 43% to $1.1 million compared to $2.0 million during the prior year. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 14% to $5.1 million compared to $5.9 million during the prior year. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the income tax charges and the decline in gross margin from our TechXtend segment, resulting from lower extended payment term sales discussed above.\nDiluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased 42% to $0.25, compared to $0.43 for the same period in 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 10% to $1.13, compared to $1.25, for the year ended December 31, 2016, on a restated basis.\nOn February 26, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of its common stock payable March 12, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 5, 2018.\nAdjustments to Historical results upon Retrospective adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company will adopt ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective January 1, 2018 using the retrospective adoption method. Under the retrospective adoption method, the Company will present revenue for current and comparative periods on an adjusted basis, reflecting the new accounting standard. The most significant impact of adopting the standard relates to the recognition of revenue for third party subscriptions, maintenance and services net of the related cost of sales. Historically the Company has accounted for most sales on a gross basis, with third party costs included in cost of sales.\nThe change from gross sale to net reporting has no impact on gross profit, net income or cash flows though it will increase gross profit as a percentage of sales. The adoption of the standard is expected to result in a reduction of revenue, and corresponding reduction of cost of sales of $288.8 million, $253.5 million and $218.4 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The attached tables present the expected impact of the adoption on historical results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 as if the standard had been adopted in the earliest period presented. Additional information will be available in the Company’s annual report filed on Form 10K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout Wayside Technology Group, Inc.\nWayside Technology Group, Inc.
