    "text": "Broad portfolio of services delivers revenue growth and earnings\nOperating Revenues of $1.2 billion, an increase of 11% compared to fourth quarter 2016 Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.60, compared to fourth quarter 2016 of $0.30 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.33, compared to fourth quarter 2016 of $0.31 Recently announced a 20% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.06 Full year 2018 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share guidance of $1.32 to $1.44\nGREEN BAY, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Schneider National, Inc. (NYSE: SNDR) (“Schneider” or the “Company”), a leading transportation and logistics services company providing a broad portfolio of premier truckload, intermodal and logistics solutions and operating one of the largest for-hire trucking fleets in North America, today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"I'm pleased with the performance of all our business segments in the quarter,\" noted Chris Lofgren, Chief Executive Officer of Schneider. \"A tight supply and demand environment existed in the fourth quarter and our price improved across the board - contract, tier and spot - as customers responded to driver capacity constraints in the market. The actions we took in the third quarter to build our driver fleet favorably impacted fourth quarter results. Our Quest platform enabled us to have a balanced approach with our customers, consistent with our strategy of resiliency through cycles, allowing us to manage their commitments, and at the same time, exercise choice leading to improved contribution. As expected, having three complementary segments of scale allowed us to service our customers' diverse needs in the quarter.\"\nResults of Operations (unaudited)\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the Company’s results of operations:\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31 Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating revenues $ 1,191.2 $ 1,069.9 $ 4,383.6 $ 4,045.7 Revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) (1) $ 1,081.7 $ 985.6 $ 3,997.3 $ 3,751.7 Income from operations $ 93.7 $ 87.9 $ 280.3 $ 290.4 Adjusted income from operations $ 99.9 $ 89.0 $ 281.7 $ 293.1 Operating ratio 92.1 % 91.8 % 93.6 % 92.8 % Adjusted operating ratio 90.8 % 91.0 % 93.0 % 92.2 % Net income $ 283.9 $ 47.8 $ 389.9 $ 156.9 Adjusted net income $ 58.1 $ 48.5 $ 161.2 $ 158.5 Adjusted EBITDA $ 171.9 $ 157.3 $ 560.7 $ 559.1 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.60 $ 0.30 $ 2.28 $ 1.00 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 0.33 $ 0.31 $ 0.94 $ 1.01 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 177.1 156.6 171.3 156.8 (1) Revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) is a non-GAAP financial measure that was previously titled \"adjusted enterprise revenues (excluding fuel surcharge).\"\nResults of Operations - Enterprise\nEnterprise operating revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1,191.2 million, an increase of $121.3 million, or 11%, compared to the same quarter in 2016. All of the Company's segments reported revenue growth in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to improved market dynamics and the additional drivers as a result of recruiting efforts in the third quarter of 2017. The Company's leasing business and additional fuel surcharge revenue also contributed to operating revenue growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRevenues (excluding fuel surcharge) for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1,081.7 million, an increase of $96.1 million, or 10%, compared to the same quarter in 2016. The improved economy, effective freight selection, and tightened supply resulted in improved pricing and demand in the quarter. The Company believes that some of the supply tightening was due to the enactment of the ELD (electronic logging device) mandate on December 18, 2017. Revenue management utilizing the Quest platform enabled the Company to leverage market and network conditions and resulted in increased revenue per truck per week and increased revenue per order. In addition to the pure price impact, gains from productivity and out of cycle contract discussions, favorably impacted results for the quarter.\nEnterprise income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $93.7 million, an increase of $5.8 million, or 7%, compared to the same quarter in 2016. Price and productivity increased throughout the quarter, partially offset by increased driver costs, increased depreciation and the continuing First to Final Mile build out. From a driver cost perspective, driver pay and driver recruiting costs increased compared to the same quarter in 2016; however, both were in line with expectations. Driver recruiting costs decreased sequentially from third quarter 2017, having increased the driver fleet size in the third quarter, just ahead of the fourth quarter seasonal demand surge.\nAdjusted income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $99.9 million, an increase of $10.9 million, or 12%, compared to the same quarter in 2016. The Company adjusted its income from operations by $6.6 million for the duplicate chassis costs related to the cost of idle rental units due to its conversion to an owned chassis model. The Company completed its conversion to owned chassis in December 2017. The Company also adjusted its income from operations to exclude other material items that do not reflect its core operating performance. See the \"Reconciliation of Non - GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this release for additional details.\nNet interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $2.0 million compared to the same quarter in 2016, due to lower debt levels. The effective income tax rate was (214.8%) for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 40.8% for the same quarter in 2016. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company reduced its net deferred tax liability by $229.5 million due to the revaluing of the deferred tax balances at the newly enacted 21% federal income tax rate. The Company's adjusted effective tax rate, before the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 39.6%. The Company anticipates its ongoing effective tax rate to be between 25% – 26%.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $283.9 million, or $1.60, on a weighted average diluted per share basis, an increase of $236.1 million compared to the same quarter in 2016. The impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.30. Full year 2017 diluted earnings per share was $2.28. Net income as a percent of operating revenues was 23.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $58.1 million, or $0.33, on a weighted average diluted per share basis, an increase of $9.6 million, or 19.8%, compared to the same quarter in 2016. The impact on fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of additional shares due to the Company's initial public offering was ($0.04) compared to fourth quarter 2016. Full year 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.94.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $171.9 million, an increase of $14.6 million, or 9%, compared to the same quarter in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) was 15.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 16.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCash Flow and Capitalization\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had a total of $440.6 million outstanding on various debt instruments compared to $699.4 million as of December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $238.5 million compared to $130.8 million at December 31, 2016. The Company's net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $107.7 million was primarily due to proceeds from the IPO and the increase in free cash flow, as explained below, partially offset by debt repayments.\nThe Company’s cash provided by operating activities for the year ending December 31, 2017 increased $6.0 million, compared to the same period in 2016. Free cash flow increased $61.2 million compared to the same period in 2016. Capital expenditures decreased year over year due to lower purchases of transportation equipment, which was the result of a combination of factors, including the acceleration of purchases in 2016. The used equipment market stabilized in 2017, albeit at weak levels. Total proceeds from the sale of used equipment increased; however, proceeds per unit decreased compared to 2016.\nThe Company declared a $0.05 dividend payable to shareholders of record as of December 15, 2017. This dividend was paid on January 8, 2018. On January 30, 2018, the Company declared a $0.06 dividend payable to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2018. This dividend is expected to be paid on April 9, 2018.\nResults of Operations – Reportable Segments\nTruckload\nRevenues (excluding fuel surcharge): $570.6 million; an increase of 6% compared to fourth quarter 2016 Income from Operations: $63.4 million; flat compared to fourth quarter 2016\nTruckload revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to productivity and price. Improved truck productivity and effective freight selection using the Company's Quest platform resulted in revenue per truck per week of $3,797, an increase of $193, or 5.3%, compared to the same quarter in 2016, and a sequential increase of $183, or 5.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2017. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, for-hire standard revenue per truck per week increased 7.6%, due to increased price and truck productivity, while Dedicated standard revenue per truck per week increased 4.0%.\nTruckload income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was flat with fourth quarter of 2016. Freight selection and truck productivity improved in the quarter and was offset by increased driver expenses, First to Final Mile build out, fuel costs, and reduced gains on sales of equipment. The Company's investments in driver recruiting and retention initiatives and equipment management actions made earlier in year yielded positive results in the fourth quarter. While total driver count increased slightly compared to 2016, it decreased sequentially compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nIntermodal\nRevenues (excluding fuel surcharge): $208.6 million; an increase of 5% compared to fourth quarter 2016 Income from Operations: $22.2 million; an increase of 54% compared to fourth quarter 2016\nIntermodal revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 due to a 3.9% increase in orders and a 1.5% increase in revenue per order. For the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue per order was $2,008, a sequential increase of $132, or 7.0%, compared to the third quarter of 2017 due to revenue management utilizing the Company's Quest platform and an improved pricing market. Market conditions in the quarter resulted in Intermodal pricing movement mirroring that of Truckload. Intermodal's management of containers resulted in container productivity improvement of 4.6% compared to the same quarter in 2016.\nIntermodal income from operations increased 54% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016. Intermodal operating ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 89.3%, before the impact of duplicate chassis costs, primarily due to asset productivity, driver productivity, price, and volumes offset by duplicative costs from the conversion of leased to owned chassis. Duplicate chassis costs, which represent the cost of idle rental units, had a negative impact of $6.6 million, or approximately 320 basis points, on Intermodal's fourth quarter 2017 operating ratio. Total dray driver count increased by nearly 200 compared to 2016, and drays performed on company equipment improved 120 basis points. As a result, Intermodal has been able to mitigate the high inflationary costs of third party dray resources. As of the end of 2017, this business is now an owned container, owned chassis, and primarily company drayage intermodal provider. Intermodal has realized improved productivity and driver retention, and decreased safety, recruiting, and maintenance costs, as a result of the conversion to owned chassis.\nLogistics\nRevenues (excluding fuel surcharge): $249.5 million; an increase of 26% compared to fourth quarter 2016 Income from Operations: $13.4 million; an increase of 48% compared to fourth quarter 2016\nLogistics revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016. Market volatility, seasonality, and enactment of the ELD mandate resulted in growth of the Company’s brokerage business as evidenced by strong spot and contract pricing and brokerage volume growth of 16.7% compared to the same period in 2016. Brokerage revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) were 76% of Logistics revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 69% for the same quarter in 2016. The Quest platform allowed Logistics to quickly adapt to changing market conditions.\nLogistics income from operations increased 48% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016, primarily due to brokerage growth and the expansion of gross margins in the quarter. Market volatility and tightened capacity, some of which was due to the ELD enactment, resulted in a strong pricing position in the quarter.\nBusiness Outlook\nLofgren commented, \"We are encouraged by market indicators. In early 2018, we will continue to address the price improvement necessary to recover the driver investments already incurred in 2017, and those we expect in 2018. We anticipate the ELD implementation will have a measurable impact on driver capacity, and we will closely monitor actions being taken by carriers to recruit and retain drivers. The anticipated market conditions, our professional driver workforce, the Quest platform, and our broad portfolio of services, position us well for 2018. We anticipate our full year 2018 adjusted diluted earnings to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.44 and net capital expenditures in the range of $325 million to $375 million.\"\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have presented certain non-GAAP financial measures, including revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted effective tax rate, and free cash flow. Management believes the use of non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding our business, as further described below. The non-GAAP information provided is used by our management and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies. The non-GAAP measures used herein have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP.\nA reconciliation of net income per share to adjusted diluted earnings per share, as projected for 2018, is not provided. Schneider does not forecast net income per share as we cannot, without unreasonable effort, estimate or predict with certainty, various components of net income. The components of net income that we cannot predict include expenses for items that do not relate to our core operating performance, such as costs related to potential future acquisitions and the related tax impact of those items, or the effect of changes in tax law. Further, in the future, other items with similar characteristics to those currently included in adjusted net income, that have a similar impact on the comparability of periods, and which are not known at this time, may exist and impact adjusted net income.\nAbout Schneider National, Inc.\nWe are a leading transportation and logistics services company providing a broad portfolio of premier truckload, intermodal and logistics solutions and operate one of the largest for-hire trucking fleets in North America. We believe we have developed a differentiated business model that is difficult to replicate due to our scale, breadth of complementary service offerings and proprietary technology platform.

We also provide below reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes the use of each of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding our business by (a) removing the impact of items from our operating results that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance, (b) providing investors with the same information our management uses internally to assess our core operating performance and (c) presenting comparable financial results between periods. In addition, in the case of revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), we believe the measure is useful to investors because it isolates volume, price, and cost changes directly related to industry demand and the way we operate our business from the exogenous factor of fluctuating fuel prices and the programs we have in place to manage fuel price fluctuations. Fuel-related costs and their impact on our industry are important to our results of operations, but they are often independent of other, more germane factors affecting our results of operations and our industry. With respect to free cash flow, we believe the measure provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to fund our business after payment of capital expenditures related to the necessary components of ongoing operations. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. We use free cash flow as a measure to assess overall liquidity.\nAlthough we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, they have limitations as analytical tools and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies. You should not consider the non-GAAP measures in this release in isolation or as substitutes for, or alternatives to, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. The exclusion of unusual or non-recurring items or other adjustments reflected in the non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or non-recurring items or by other items similar to such adjustments. Our management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results in addition to using the non-GAAP measures.\nRevenues (excluding fuel surcharge)\nRevenues (excluding fuel surcharge) is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as operating revenues less fuel surcharge revenues.
