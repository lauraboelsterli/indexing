    "text": "After the New York Mets finished their inaugural 1962 season with an historically disastrous 40-120 record , manager Casey Stengel consoled the team with this famous bit of humor:\n\"Fellers, don't feel bad. This was a team effort. No one or two players could have done all this.\"\nIt's the same way in Washington when it comes to our $20.6 trillion debt and the wild, irresponsible spending that created it. No one party, president or ideology could have done all this. No matter how deep the partisan divide appears to be in American politics, each side works together consciously and unconsciously to sink the nation into an ever-deepening ocean of bills we can't pay.\nThe Obama years saw the biggest explosion in the total debt. On January 20, 2009, when he was sworn in, the debt was $10.6 trillion. On January 20, 2017 it was $19.9 trillion. But his predecessor, President George W. Bush presided over a much larger increase in the debt percentage wise during his term when the figure basically doubled from about $5.5 trillion to that near $11 trillion dollar number in 2009.\nSince 1970, we've had a grand total of four years that didn't have the federal government finishing up in the red. Those years were 1998-2001 when the Clinton administration and the Republican Congress made a welfare reform deal, lowered capital gains taxes, and federal revenues soared thanks to a tech sector surge.\nNow, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he and Democrat Senate leaders have made a deal that could help the nation avoid shutdown wars for at least that long.\nGreat news, right?\nWrong.\nIt turns out that near-deal is nothing like the Clinton-Newt Gingrich pact of the late 1990s. Instead, this is built on a mutual wink and nod from both sides to keep spending money like crazy. The Republicans, at President Donald Trump 's behest, are looking to increase military spending by more than $150 billion over the two-year budget period. The Democrats are getting a smaller – but still-massive – increases in domestic spending.\nThe deal is not a sure thing, as the deficit hawk members of the so-called House Freedom Caucus are vowing to defeat it. But unlike the tax reform plan, this budget plan would presumably get Democrat votes and could pass regardless of any Freedom Caucus protest.\nIf enough of those anti-spending Republicans don't get on board, it would then be up to House Speaker Paul Ryan and McConnell to dare to bring the possible bill up for a vote despite so much opposition from their own party.\nThat bit of vote-counting intrigue is a drama that will play out over the next couple of days. But what's not really in doubt is that the majority of Congress and the White House are just fine with driving our deficits and debt higher.\nNothing seems to be able to stop this spending wave, including a recent spike in interest rates that will make borrowing to pay our bills a more costly and troubling exercise than government shutdowns.\nJust as worrisome is the fact that this is yet another budget deal that further delays the most important fiscal reforms America has needed for decades. That is, we need to radically reform the \"Big Three\" spending components that are the most unsustainable: Defense, Social Security and Medicare.\nThe long-held conventional wisdom is that each of those items are a \"third rail\" issue that no politician can touch. But there's a lot of evidence that the American people are in favor of fair reforms to Defense ,",
