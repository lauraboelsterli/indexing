GLOBAL TOP NEWS •Amazon posts largest profit in its history on sales, tax boost Amazon.com reported a profit near $2 billion, the largest in its history, as the online retailer drew millions of new customers to its Prime fast-shipping club for the holiday season and as changes to U.S. tax law added to its bottom line. •Strong iPhone prices, cash plans buoy Apple shares after muted outlook Stronger iPhone prices and hints by Apple that it could return more than half of its $285 billion in cash to shareholders eased concerns among investors, even as the world's biggest technology company gave a disappointing revenue outlook for the current quarter. •Alphabet's earnings miss profit estimates as spending grows Google parent Alphabet missed quarterly profit forecasts as steady ad sales growth was offset by increased spending to promote its consumer gadgets, YouTube video app and cloud computing services, the U.S. technology company said. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) •The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,926.00, trading down 1.09 percent from its previous close. •The Indian rupee will likely open flat to weaker against the dollar, in line with most Asian peers, tracking a sell-off across most global shares that may spillover to the local equities. •Indian government bonds are likely to extend their fall as investors await a fresh supply of notes through a weekly auction. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.57 percent -7.63 percent band till the auction result. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street stocks gave up early gains on Thursday as bond yields rose and technology stocks retreated ahead of a host of high-profile earnings. • The euro neared multi-year peaks as talk of policy tightening in Europe and expectations that inflation is set to gear higher drove up borrowing costs globally. • The dollar nursed losses against a basket of currencies and was on track for a weekly fall as investors focused on renewed economic strength in the eurozone. • The U.S. Treasuries market started February on a sour note with the 10-year yield hitting a near four-year peak on Thursday as investors booked profits on curve-related bets ahead of Friday's jobs report. • U.S. oil rose for a third day after a survey showed strong compliance with output cuts by OPEC and others including Russia, offsetting concerns about surging U.S. production. • Gold prices inched down ahead of U.S. jobs data due later in the day as traders looked for guidance on the course of monetary policy for the remainder of the year.
