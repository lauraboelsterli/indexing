Entering the game on a 5-for-44 streak from 3-point range, Hardaway had 17 points in the first quarter and 32 by halftime, shooting 12 of 14 from the field. He finished 14 of 24.\nNew York led 39-26 after the first quarter and 72-51 at the half before its offense went cold to open the third quarter. Washington went on a 9-0 run to start the second half and eventually tied the game at 83 with 3:32 left in the third quarter, as all five starters scored multiple field goals during the run.\nThe Wizards, who entered the game with 26 or more assists in seven of their previous eight games, again topped the lofty mark on Wednesday. Washington had 31 assists, including 11 by forward Tomas Satoransky. Ian Mahinmi added 17 points off the bench for the Wizards, who shot 54.5 percent from the field.\nMichael Beasley amassed 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Knicks, who shot just 46.4 percent from the field despite their hot start.\nNew York travels to Orlando next Thursday after the All-Star break before returning to Madison Square Garden for a brutal two-game set with the Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors on Feb. 24 and 26.\nWashington, which leads the Southeast Division, concludes a three-game road trip on Feb. 22 against the Cleveland Cavaliers after a weeklong layoff.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
