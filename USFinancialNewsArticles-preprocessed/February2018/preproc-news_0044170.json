    "text": "TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLMN) today reported results for the fourth quarter 2017 (\"Q4 2017\") and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (\"Fiscal Year 2017\") compared to the fourth quarter 2016 (\"Q4 2016\") and fiscal year ended December 25, 2016 (\"Fiscal Year 2016\"). In 2017, the fourth quarter and fiscal year included an additional operating week (\"53 rd week\") compared to Fiscal Year 2016.\nHighlights for Q4 2017 include the following:\nComparable restaurant sales were up 4.7% at U.S. Outback Steakhouse with traffic up 4.3% (1) ; Combined U.S. comparable restaurant sales were up 3.3% with traffic up 1.8% (1) ; Comparable restaurant sales were up 4.9% for Outback Steakhouse in Brazil; and Opened seven new restaurants, including four in international markets.\nHighlights for Fiscal Year 2017 include the following:\nComparable restaurant sales were up 1.8% at U.S. Outback Steakhouse with traffic up 0.3% (1) ; Combined U.S. comparable restaurant sales were up 0.5% with traffic down 1.3% (1) ; Comparable restaurant sales were up 6.3% for Outback Steakhouse in Brazil; Opened 31 new restaurants, including 23 in international markets; and Repurchased 13.8 million shares of common stock for a total of $273 million.\n(1)\nFor Q4 2017, comparable restaurant sales compare the 14 weeks from September 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017 to the 14 weeks from September 26, 2016 through January 1, 2017. For Fiscal Year 2017, comparable restaurant sales compare the 53 weeks from December 26, 2016 through December 31, 2017 to the 53 weeks from December 28, 2015 through January 1, 2017.\nDiluted EPS and Adjusted Diluted EPS\nThe following table reconciles Diluted earnings (loss) per share to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the periods as indicated below.\nQ4\nFISCAL YEAR\n2017\n2016\nCHANGE\n2017\n2016\nCHANGE\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share\n$\n0.17\n$\n(0.04)\n$\n0.21\n$\n1.01\n$\n0.37\n$\n0.64\nAdjustments\n0.24\n0.33\n(0.09)\n0.35\n0.88\n(0.53)\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\n$\n0.41\n$\n0.29\n$\n0.12\n$\n1.36\n$\n1.25\n$\n0.11\nSee Non-GAAP Measures later in this release.\nCEO Comments\n\"By all measures the fourth quarter was an excellent finish to 2017 for Bloomin' Brands,\" said Liz Smith, CEO. \"Outback's Q4 sales and traffic performance were well ahead of the industry, and reflect the ongoing impact of our investments in the customer experience. We are pleased with how our brands are performing so far in early 2018, particularly at Outback where momentum continues.\"\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\n(dollars in millions)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nCHANGE\nTotal revenues\n$\n1,087.6\n$\n1,004.1\n8.3\n%\nU.S. GAAP restaurant-level operating margin\n16.3\n%\n15.2\n%\n1.1\n%\nAdjusted restaurant-level operating margin (1)\n16.3\n%\n15.1\n%\n1.2\n%\nU.S. GAAP operating income margin\n2.9\n%\n(0.4)\n%\n3.3\n%\nAdjusted operating income margin (1)\n5.3\n%\n5.5\n%\n(0.2)\n%\n(1) See Non-GAAP Measures later in this release.\nThe increase in total revenues was primarily due to $80.4 million of revenues from the 53 rd week of 2017, higher comparable restaurant sales and an increase in franchise and other revenues, partially offset by decreases from refranchising internationally and domestically and the net impact of restaurant closures and new restaurant openings. The increase in U.S. GAAP operating income margin was primarily due to: (i) the impact of the 53 rd week in 2017, (ii) net year-over-year impact of closure and restructuring initiatives, (iii) the impact of certain cost savings initiatives and (iv) lower advertising expense. These increases were partially offset by increases in incentive compensation expense and higher labor costs. The largest contributor to our decline in Q4 2017 adjusted operating income margin was an increase in incentive compensation expense driven by improved sales and profit performance. In Q4 2017, we recorded $15.3 million of incentive compensation expense as compared to a $9.0 million reversal of incentive compensation expense in Q4 2016, resulting in a $24.3 million dollar change in year-over-year incentive compensation expense.\nFourth Quarter Comparable Restaurant Sales (1)\nFOURTEEN WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017\nCOMPANY-OWNED\nComparable restaurant sales (stores open 18 months or more):\nU.S.\nOutback Steakhouse\n4.7\n%\nCarrabba's Italian Grill\n1.3\n%\nBonefish Grill\n0.6\n%\nFleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar\n3.1\n%\nCombined U.S.\n3.3\n%\nInternational\nOutback Steakhouse - Brazil\n4.9\n%\n(1)\nFor Q4 2017, comparable restaurant sales compare the 14 weeks from September 25, 2017 through December 31, 2017 to the 14 weeks from September 26, 2016 through January 1, 2017.\nDividend Declaration and Share Repurchases\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share to be paid on March 14, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 5, 2018.\nOn April 21, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a $250 million share repurchase program. As of February 16, 2018, we had $55 million remaining under this authorization. On February 16, 2018, our Board of Directors canceled the remaining authorization and approved a new $150.0 million authorization. This authorization will expire on August 16, 2019.\nFiscal 2018 Financial Outlook\nThe following table presents our expectations for selected fiscal 2018 financial reporting and operating results. Please note the following as it relates to these expectations:\nFiscal Year 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 11% to 16%, excluding the 53 rd week that was included in the 2017 financial results. The 53 rd week was estimated to have positively impacted Fiscal Year 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.11. We are in the process of finalizing the anticipated financial impact from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. The Fiscal 2018 Financial Outlook currently excludes the impact of this new standard. The adoption of the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\" is expected to improve our adjusted effective income tax rate by approximately 8% to 9% relative to Fiscal Year 2017. We intend to reinvest approximately 50% of our tax savings into additional field compensation, enhancements to our health and 401(k) benefits, as well as leadership development and other training programs for our employees.\nFinancial Results:\nCurrent Outlook\nU.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share (1)\n$1.28 to $1.35\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (1)\n$1.38 to $1.45\nU.S. GAAP effective income tax rate (1)\n9% to 10%\nAdjusted effective income tax rate (1)\n11% to 12%\nOther Selected Financial Data:\nCombined U.S. comparable restaurant sales (2)\n1% to 2%\nCommodity inflation\n3.0% to 3.5%\nCapital expenditures\nApprox. $200M\nNumber of new system-wide restaurants\nApprox. 20\n(1) The primary difference between our U.S. GAAP outlook and our adjusted outlook for both diluted earnings per share and effective income tax rate is driven by anticipated adjustments in connection with our relocation and store closure initiatives.\n(2) Combined U.S. comparable restaurant sales outlook is based on a comparable calendar basis. For 2018, this will compare the 52 weeks from January 1, 2018 through December 30, 2018 to the 52 weeks from January 2, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of our 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook. In this table we have removed the impact of the 53 rd week from 2017 results to improve comparability.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share outlook reconciliation\n2017\n2018 Outlook\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\n$1.36\n$1.38 to $1.45\nImpact of 53 rd week on adjusted diluted earnings per share\nApprox. (0.11)\n-\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share on a 52 week basis\n$1.25\n$1.38 to $1.45\nYear-over-year growth %\nApprox. 11% to 16%\nThe following table provides a comparison of the calendar days included in our 2018 calendar as compared to 2017. The dates are provided by quarter and for the full year on both a Fiscal Calendar Basis and on a Comparable Calendar Basis.\nWe will report our financial statements for 2018 on a Fiscal Calendar Basis. Due to the 53 rd week in Fiscal 2017, our financial statement comparisons will be 1 week different year over year. We expect the largest impacts from this shift to occur in Q1 2018 as well as Q4 2018.\nWe will report our comparable restaurant sales on a Comparable Calendar Basis. We believe this will provide the most accurate assessment of our comparable restaurant sales results.\nFiscal and Comparable Calendar Calculation Dates\nFiscal Calendar Basis\nComparable Calendar Basis\nQ1\nJanuary 1, 2018 - April 1, 2018\nJanuary 1, 2018 - April 1, 2018\nvs.\nvs.\nDecember 26, 2016 - March 26, 2017\nJanuary 2, 2017 - April 2, 2017\nQ2\nApril 2, 2018 - July 1, 2018\nApril 2, 2018 - July 1, 2018\nvs.\nvs.\nMarch 27, 2017 - June 25, 2017\nApril 3, 2017 - July 2, 2017\nQ3\nJuly 2, 2018 - September 30, 2018\nJuly 2, 2018 - September 30, 2018\nvs.\nvs.\nJune 26, 2017 - September 24, 2017\nJuly 3, 2017 - October 1, 2017\nQ4\nOctober 1, 2018 - December 30, 2018\nOctober 1, 2018 - December 30, 2018\nvs.\nvs.\nSeptember 25, 2017 - December 31, 2017\nOctober 2, 2017 - December 31, 2017\nTotal Year\nJanuary 1, 2018 - December 30, 2018\nJanuary 1, 2018 - December 30, 2018\nvs.\nvs.\nDecember 26, 2016 - December 31, 2017\nJanuary 2, 2017 - December 31, 2017\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call today, February 22nd at 9:00 AM ET. The conference call can be accessed live over the telephone by dialing (877) 407-9039 or (201) 689-8470 for international participants. A replay will be available beginning two hours after the call and can be accessed by dialing (844) 512-2921 or (412) 317-6671 for international callers. The replay will be available through Thursday, March 1, 2018. The conference ID for the live call and replay is 13675820. The call will also be webcast live from the Company's website at http://www.bloominbrands.com under the Investors section. A replay of this webcast will be available on the Company's website after the call.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release and related tables include certain non-GAAP measures, which present operating results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the following: (i) Adjusted restaurant-level operating margin, (ii) Adjusted income from operations and the corresponding margin, (iii) Adjusted net income, (iv) Adjusted diluted earnings per share, (v) Adjusted segment restaurant-level operating margin and (vi) Adjusted segment income from operations and the corresponding margin.\nWe believe that our use of non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies within the restaurant industry by isolating the effects of certain items that may vary from period to period without correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they form part of the basis for how our management team and Board of Directors evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and administer employee incentive plans.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace U.S. GAAP financial measures, and they are not necessarily standardized or comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We maintain internal guidelines with respect to the types of adjustments we include in our non-GAAP measures. These guidelines endeavor to differentiate between types of gains and expenses that are reflective of our core operations in a period, and those that may vary from period to period without correlation to our core performance in that period. However, implementation of these guidelines necessarily involves the application of judgment, and the treatment of any items not directly addressed by, or changes to, our guidelines will be considered by our disclosure committee. You should refer to the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures in tables four, five and six included later in this release for descriptions of the actual adjustments made in the current period and the corresponding prior period.\nAs previously announced, based on a review of our non-GAAP presentations, we determined that, commencing with our results for the first fiscal quarter of 2017, when presenting non-GAAP measures, we will no longer adjust for expenses incurred in connection with our remodel program or intangible amortization recorded as a result of the acquisition of our Brazil operations. We recast historical comparable periods to conform to the revised presentation.\nIn this release, we have also included forward-looking non-GAAP information under the caption \"Fiscal 2018 Financial Outlook\". This relates to our current expectations for fiscal year 2018 adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted effective income tax rate. We have also provided information with respect to our expectations for the corresponding GAAP measures.\nThe differences between our disclosed GAAP and non-GAAP expectations are described to the extent practicable under \"Fiscal 2018 Financial Outlook\". However, in addition to the general cautionary language regarding all forward-looking statements included elsewhere in this release, we note that, because the items we adjust for in our non-GAAP measures may vary from period to period without correlation to our core performance, they are by nature more difficult to predict and estimate, so additional adjustments may occur in the remainder of the fiscal year and they may significantly impact our GAAP results.\nAbout Bloomin' Brands, Inc.\nBloomin' Brands, Inc. is one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world with a portfolio of leading, differentiated restaurant concepts.

The Company operates successfully with negative working capital because cash collected on Restaurant sales is typically received before payment is due on its current liabilities, and its inventory turnover rates require relatively low investment in inventories. Additionally, ongoing cash flows from restaurant operations and gift card sales are used to service debt obligations and to make capital expenditures.\n(3) During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 13.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock.\nTABLE FOUR\nBLOOMIN' BRANDS, INC\nRESTAURANT-LEVEL OPERATING MARGIN NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n(UNAUDITED)\nFOURTEEN WEEKS ENDED\nTHIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED\n(UNFAVORABLE)\nFAVORABLE CHANGE\nIN ADJUSTED\nDECEMBER 31, 2017\nDECEMBER 25, 2016\nConsolidated:\nU.S. GAAP\nADJUSTED\nU.S. GAAP\nADJUSTED (1)\nQUARTER TO DATE\nRestaurant sales\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\nCost of sales\n30.9\n%\n30.9\n%\n31.2\n%\n31.2\n%\n0.3\n%\nLabor and other related\n29.0\n%\n29.0\n%\n29.0\n%\n29.0\n%\n—\n%\nOther restaurant operating\n23.8\n%\n23.8\n%\n24.6\n%\n24.7\n%\n0.9\n%\nRestaurant-level operating margin (2)\n16.3\n%\n16.3\n%\n15.2\n%\n15.1\n%\n1.2\n%\nSegments:\nRestaurant-level operating margin - U.S. (2)\n16.2\n%\n16.2\n%\n14.5\n%\n14.4\n%\n1.8\n%\nRestaurant-level operating margin - International (2)\n20.5\n%\n20.5\n%\n21.6\n%\n21.5\n%\n(1.0)\n%\nFISCAL YEAR ENDED\nFISCAL YEAR ENDED\n(UNFAVORABLE) FAVORABLE CHANGE IN ADJUSTED\nDECEMBER 31, 2017\nDECEMBER 25, 2016\nConsolidated:\nU.S. GAAP\nADJUSTED (3)\nU.S. GAAP\nADJUSTED (1)\nYEAR TO DATE\nRestaurant sales\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\nCost of sales\n31.6\n%\n31.6\n%\n32.1\n%\n32.1\n%\n0.5\n%\nLabor and other related\n29.3\n%\n29.3\n%\n28.7\n%\n28.7\n%\n(0.6)\n%\nOther restaurant operating\n23.5\n%\n23.6\n%\n23.5\n%\n23.6\n%\n—\n%\nRestaurant-level operating margin (2)\n15.7\n%\n15.5\n%\n15.8\n%\n15.7\n%\n(0.2)\n%\nSegments:\nRestaurant-level operating margin - U.S. (2)\n15.1\n%\n14.9\n%\n15.4\n%\n15.4\n%\n(0.5)\n%\nRestaurant-level operating margin - International (2)\n20.6\n%\n20.6\n%\n18.8\n%\n18.7\n%\n1.9\n%\n(1) Includes adjustments for the reversal of $3.2 million and $5.8 million of deferred rent liabilities for the thirteen weeks and fiscal year\nended December 25, 2016, respectively, related to approved closure initiatives, partially offset by $2.3 million in both periods of legal\nsettlement costs related to the Sears matter, recorded in Other restaurant operating, within the U.S segment.
