    "text": "BOSTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Two former Morgan Stanley advisers have agreed to plead guilty to U.S. charges that they misused client funds to make their own investments in a wind farm project, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday.\nFederal prosecutors in Boston said James Polese, 51, and Cornelius Peterson, 28, misappropriated $500,000 to invest in and support the wind farm project. Polese also used funds from a clientâ€™s account to pay for personal expenses, prosecutors said. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston)\n ",
