At this level, they don’t provide competition for the equity market. We still have a long way to go before they’re competitive to the equity market. This is something going to be watched very closely by investors in all asset classes,” Krosby said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 172.25 points, or 0.69 percent, to 25,085.02, the S&P 500 gained 6.92 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,702.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.95 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,096.93.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 2.02 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.40 percent.\nEmerging market stocks lost 0.32 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.44 percent lower.\nIn the energy market, oil prices fell 2 percent. U.S. crude fell 2.5 percent to settle at $61.79 per barrel and Brent dropped 2 percent to $65.51. U.S. data showed an unexpected build in refined products, fanning fears of oversupply headed into the slow-demand season.\nLike many others, BlackRock analysts described the rout as a buying opportunity, seeing the leveraged products moves as essentially driven by jitters over recent equity gains on one hand, and the possibility of higher interest rates on the other.\nStrategists also point out that the improving global economic outlook is a positive for stocks overall.\nDOLLAR UP, GOLD SLIPS The U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies amid the gains on Wall Street.\nThe dollar index rose 0.76 percent, with the euro down 0.82 percent to $1.2275.\nGold slipped as the U.S. dollar strengthened. Spot gold dropped 0.9 percent at $1,313.67 per ounce.\nAdditional reporting by Karen Brettell in New York and Sujata Rao in London; Editing by Nick Zieminski and James Dalgleish\n ",
