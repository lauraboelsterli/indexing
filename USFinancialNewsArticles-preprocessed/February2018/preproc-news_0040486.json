(NASDAQ:ECOL) (“the Company”) today reported total revenue of $133.7 million and net income of $30.8 million, or $1.40 per diluted share (including approximately $1.08 per diluted share related to favorable tax reform related adjustments partially offset by a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge $8.9 million, or $0.41 per diluted share) for the quarter-ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted earnings per share, which also excludes foreign currency translation gains and losses and business development expenses, was $0.73 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 103%.\n“The underlying strength in the industrial economy and within many of our customers’ operations helped drive volumes and led to solid performance in the fourth quarter,” commented Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Feeler. “Our Base Business was stronger than expected, growing 11% over the fourth quarter last year. Contributing to this growth was strength in the Gulf Coast that rebounded from the hurricane that affected the region in the third quarter. Many of our customers that were affected by Hurricane Harvey saw business return to normal levels in the fourth quarter, driving higher volumes of Base Business into our Texas facility. Even after accounting for volumes that were likely rolled over from the third quarter, we believe Base Business increased approximately 8% in the fourth quarter of 2017, a healthy gain over the fourth quarter of 2016 and a positive sign as we look ahead to 2018. Event Business growth was also strong in the fourth quarter, up 36% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Our Field and Industrial Services segment also performed well, posting 14% revenue growth over the same quarter last year.”\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $133.7 million was up 14% from $117.2 million in the same quarter last year. Revenue for the Environmental Services (“ES”) segment was $97.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $85.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase consisted of 15% growth in treatment and disposal (“T&D”) revenue and 11% growth in transportation revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for the Field and Industrial Services (“FIS”) segment was $35.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 up 14% from $31.5 million in the same period of 2016, reflecting stronger overall market conditions.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $47.6 million, up 32% from $36.1 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit for the ES segment was $42.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $32.1 million in the same quarter of 2016. T&D gross margin for the ES segment was 47% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 41% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 included the receipt of $2.6 million in business interruption insurance proceeds. Gross profit for the FIS segment in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.2 million. This compares to gross profit of $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing year-over-year improvement of 29%.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $22.3 million compared with $19.9 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was due to higher labor and incentive compensation costs and higher consulting and professional services, partially offset by lower bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn connection with its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the assets associated with its airport recovery business and, as a result, recorded a non-cash goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The charge primarily stemmed from continued unfavorable winter weather conditions resulting in reduced collection of deicing fluid and depressed commodity prices for recovered solvent.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $16.4 million and includes the $8.9 million impairment charge. This compares to $16.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impairment charge, operating income grew 56% over the same quarter last year.\nNet interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.8 million, down from $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was the result of a lower interest rate on our new credit facility and reduced debt levels in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017, when excluding the non-deductible impairment charge and the impact of tax reform was 36.0%, up from 35.5% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to a higher U.S. effective tax rate, partially offset by a higher proportion of earnings from our Canadian operations in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are taxed at a lower corporate tax rate.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $30.8 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. A significant portion of the increase in net income and diluted earnings per share relates to adjustments to income tax expense associated with adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities as a result of tax reform. Tax reform favorably impacted net income by approximately $23.8 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately $1.08. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes non-cash impairment charges, the impact of tax reform, foreign currency translation losses and business development expenses, was $0.73 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.36 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $35.7 million, up 31% from $27.3 million in the same period last year. Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA, which excludes business development expenses, was $35.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $27.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nReconciliations of earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share and net income to adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA are attached as Exhibit A to this release.\n2017 RESULTS\nTotal revenue for 2017 grew 6% to $504.0 million compared to $477.7 million in 2016. ES segment revenue was $366.3 million for 2017, up from $337.8 million in 2016. This consisted of an 8% increase in T&D revenue and an 8% increase in transportation revenue compared to last year. Revenue for the FIS segment was $137.7 million in 2017 compared to $139.9 million in 2016, reflecting the expiration of a contract that was not renewed and softer overall market conditions for industrial and remediation services.\nGross profit for 2017 was $153.1 million, up from $147.6 million in 2016. Gross profit for the ES segment was $135.0 million in 2017, up from $126.8 million in 2016. T&D gross margin for the ES segment was 40% in 2017, down from 42% in 2016, partially due to the March 2017 temporary shutdown of one of our large treatment facilities due to wind damage and expenses associated with the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and Florida. Gross profit for the FIS segment in 2017 was $18.2 million. This compares to $20.8 million in 2016. The decline was due to lower route density in our small quantity generation services as we replace lost business from the prior year as well as overall softer market conditions and a less favorable service mix in our industrial service and remediation business.\nSG&A expense for 2017 was $84.5 million compared with $77.6 million in the same period last year. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to higher labor and incentive compensation and higher property taxes, partially offset by lower bad debt expense in 2017 compared to 2016.\nOperating income was $59.8 million for 2017, down 15% from $70.0 million in 2016. Excluding the non-cash goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $8.9 million taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with our airport recovery business, operating income declined 2% over 2016.\nNet interest expense for 2017 was $18.1 million, up from $17.2 million in 2016. Interest expense for 2017 included the non-cash charge of $5.5 million associated with the write-off of deferred financing fees related to a former credit facility that was refinanced in April 2017. Excluding the non-cash deferred financing fees charge, interest expense decreased compared to 2016 resulting from a lower interest rate on our new credit facility and reduced debt levels.\nThe Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate for 2017, when excluding the non-deductible impairment charge and the impact of tax reform, was 36.0%, down from 38.1% for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings from our Canadian operations in 2017, which are taxed at a lower corporate tax rate.\nNet income was $49.4 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, in 2017 compared to $34.3 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in 2016. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes non-cash impairment charges, the impact of tax reform, foreign currency translation gains and losses, the gain on sale of divested businesses, the non-cash write-off of deferred financing fees, and business development expenses, was $1.72 per diluted share for 2017 compared to $1.53 per diluted share for 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $113.8 million in 2017, up 1% from $112.8 million in 2016. Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA, which excludes business and business development expenses, was $114.3 million in 2017 compared to $113.4 million in 2016.\nReconciliations of earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share and net income to adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA are attached as Exhibit A to this release.\n2018 OUTLOOK\n\"The strong momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter is expected to continue into 2018, supported by the positive macro trends seen throughout the U.S. economy since late 2016 and the improving outlook for many of our customers,” commented Feeler. “As a result, we expect to see our Environmental Services Base Business grow 3-5% for 2018. Our strong Environmental Services Event Business pipeline continues to support our belief that we will be able to replace completed 2017 projects and show continued growth in 2018. We also expect to report gains in our Field and Industrial Services segment in 2018 as we execute on contract wins from 2017.\"\nBased on current business conditions, management is projecting 2018 earnings per diluted share between $2.15 and $2.34, which includes approximately $0.26 per diluted share attributable to the lower U.S. tax rate. We expect that our adjusted EBITDA will range from $122 million to $128 million, reflecting growth of up to 12%, compared to 2017 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $114.3 million.\n2018 revenue is anticipated to range from $530 million to $553 million, compared to $504 million in 2017. This is expected to be comprised of ES segment revenue between $385 and $393 million and FIS segment revenue between $145 and $160 million.\nWe anticipate our consolidated effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 27%, reflecting the lower U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of tax reform.\nThe following table reconciles our projected net income to our adjusted EBITDA guidance range:\nFor the Year Ending December 31, 2018 (in thousands) Low High Net Income $ 47,000 $ 51,200 Income tax expense 17,400 18,900 Interest expense 10,400 10,400 Other income (300 ) (300 ) Depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment 29,400 29,700 Amortization of intangible assets 9,600 9,600 Stock-based compensation 4,200 4,200 Accretion of closure & post-closure obligations 4,300 4,300 Adjusted EBITDA $ 122,000 $ 128,000 Projections exclude any foreign currency translation gains or losses, business development expenses or other unusual transactions.\n2018 capital spending is estimated to range from $39 to $42 million, including 2017 carryover amounts. This compares to the $36.2 million spent in 2017. Approximately 40% of our 2018 capital expenditures will focus on constructing additional landfill disposal space. Approximately 20% will be focused on high return-on-investment growth projects with the balance focused on improving infrastructure, replacing equipment at our operating facilities and continuing our information system investment.\nFactoring in the above guidance, we anticipate strong free cash flow generation in 2018, approximating $56 million to $60 million and representing over 15% growth over 2017.\nDIVIDEND\nOn January 2, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per common share for stockholders of record on January 19, 2018. The $3.9 million dividend was paid on January 26, 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nUS Ecology, Inc. will hold an investor conference call on Friday, February 16, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (8:00 a.m. Mountain Standard Time) to discuss these results and its current financial position and business outlook.

Because adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations they may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Items excluded from adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our business development expenses, which may vary significantly quarter to quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, interest income, income tax expense/benefit, depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation, accretion of closure and post-closure liabilities, foreign currency gain/loss, non-cash impairment charges and other income/expense, which are not considered part of usual business operations.\nPro Forma adjusted EBITDA\nThe Company defines Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA as adjusted EBITDA (see definition above) plus business development expenses incurred during the period. We believe Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA is helpful in understanding our business and how it relates to our 2018 guidance which does not include business development expenses.\nThe following reconciliation itemizes the differences between reported net income and adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income $ 30,766 $ 7,683 $ 49,365 $ 34,252 Income tax (benefit) expense (16,860 ) 4,221 (6,395 ) 21,049 Interest expense 2,770 4,167 18,157 17,317 Interest income (13 ) (6 ) (62 ) (96 ) Foreign currency (gain) loss 5 330 (516 ) 138 Other income (254 ) (151 ) (791 ) (2,631 ) Impairment charges 8,903 - 8,903 - Depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment 7,295 6,743 28,302 25,304 Amortization of intangible assets 2,303 2,668 9,888 10,575 Stock-based compensation 978 744 3,933 2,925 Accretion and non-cash adjustments of closure & post-closure obligations (219 ) 872 3,026 3,953 Adjusted EBITDA $ 35,674 $ 27,271 $ 113,810 $ 112,786 Business development expenses 117 138 500 637 Pro Forma adjusted EBITDA $ 35,791 $ 27,409 $ 114,310 $ 113,423 Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share\nThe Company defines adjusted earnings per diluted share as net income adjusted for the after-tax impact of the non-cash impairment charges, the impact of tax reform, the after-tax impact of the non-cash write-off of deferred financing fees related to our former credit agreement, the after-tax impact of business development costs, gains and losses on sale of divested businesses and non-cash foreign currency translation gains or losses, divided by the number of diluted shares used in the earnings per share calculation.\nImpairment charges excluded from the earnings per diluted share calculation are related to the Company’s annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment. The foreign currency translation gains or losses excluded from the earnings per diluted share calculation are related to intercompany loans between our Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent which have been established as part of our tax and treasury management strategy. These intercompany loans are payable in Canadian dollars (“CAD”) requiring us to revalue the outstanding loan balance through our consolidated income statement based on the CAD/United States currency movements from period to period. Business development costs relate to expenses incurred to evaluate businesses for potential acquisition or costs related to closing and integrating successfully acquired businesses. The non-cash write-off of deferred financing fees relates to the write-off of the remaining unamortized fees associated with our former credit agreement which was refinanced in April 2017.\nWe believe excluding non-cash impairment charges, the impact of tax reform, the after-tax impact of the non-cash write-off of deferred financing fees related to our former credit agreement, the after-tax impact of business development costs, gains and losses on sale of divested businesses and non-cash foreign currency translation gains or losses provides meaningful information to investors regarding the operational and financial performance of the Company.\nThe following reconciliation itemizes the differences between reported net income and earnings per diluted share to adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n(in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Income\nbefore\nincome taxes Income tax\n(expense)/\nbenefit Net income per share Income\nbefore\nincome taxes Income tax\nexpense Net income per share As Reported $ 13,906 $ 16,860 $ 30,766 $ 1.40 $ 11,904 $ (4,221 ) $ 7,683 $ 0.35 Adjustments: Plus: Impairment charges 8,903 - 8,903 0.41 - - - - Less: Impact of tax reform - (23,778 ) (23,778 ) (1.08 ) - - - - Plus: Business development costs 117 (42 ) 75 - 138 (49 ) 89 - Non-cash foreign currency translation loss 73 (26 ) 47 - 411 (146 ) 265 0.01 As Adjusted $ 22,999 $ (6,986 ) $ 16,013 $ 0.73 $ 12,453 $ (4,416 ) $ 8,037 $ 0.36 Shares used in earnings per diluted share calculation 21,930 21,814 (in thousands, except per share data) For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Income\nbefore\nincome taxes Income tax\n(expense)/\nbenefit Net income per share Income\nbefore\nincome taxes Income tax\nexpense Net income per share As Reported $ 42,970 $ 6,395 $ 49,365 $ 2.25 $ 55,301 $ (21,049 ) $ 34,252 $ 1.57 Adjustments: Plus: Impairment charges 8,903 - 8,903 0.41 - - - - Less: Impact of tax reform - (23,778 ) (23,778 ) (1.08 ) - - - - Plus: Non-cash write-off of deferred financing fees related to former credit agreement 5,461 (1,972 ) 3,489 0.16 - - - - Plus: Business development costs 500 (181 ) 319 0.01 637 (242 ) 395 0.02 Less: Gain on sale of divested business - - - - (2,034 ) 774 (1,260 ) (0.06 ) Non-cash foreign currency translation (gain) loss (1,124 ) 406 (718 ) (0.03 ) 88 (33 ) 55 - As Adjusted $ 56,710 $ (19,130 ) $ 37,580 $ 1.72 $ 53,992 $ (20,550 ) $ 33,442 $ 1.53 Shares used in earnings per diluted share calculation 21,902 21,789 Contact: Alison Ziegler, Darrow Associates (201) 220-2678\naziegler@darrowir.com www.usecology.com\nSource:US Ecology, Inc.",
