In its response, Snapchat did not agree to the petitioners' demand but promised to roll out a new update in the coming weeks that will bring some changes to the 'Friends and Discover' section in the app. ( bit.ly/2FjMWjo ) FILE PHOTO: The Snapchat app logo is seen on a smartphone in this picture illustration taken September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo Last week, Chief Executive Evan Spiegel told an investor conference in San Francisco that he was pleased with the redesign and thought it was a more logical setup for users. The petition titled ‘Remove the new Snapchat Update’, which has been signed by over 1.2 million people so far, said the new update made many features difficult to use. The petition said it aimed to convince Snap Inc to change the app back to the version prior to the 2018 update. Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta",
