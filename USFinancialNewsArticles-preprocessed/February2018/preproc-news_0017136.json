    "text": "Feb 7 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.\nTHE GLOBE AND MAIL ** Premier Rachel Notley has instructed Alberta's alcohol regulator to block about C$70 million ($56 million) worth of wine imports from British Columbia in retaliation for proposed rules that would effectively prevent Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. ( tgam.ca/2Ep67Kl )\n** Barrick Gold Corp says it will incur a pretax charge of C$429 million ($343 million) in its upcoming fourth-quarter results as a result of downgrading a portion of its gold reserves at its troubled Pascua-Lama project. ( tgam.ca/2Es6mok )\n** WestJet Airlines Ltd plans to increase capacity in the first quarter and full year of 2018 as it expands domestically, internationally and with its ultralow-cost carrier taking flight later this year. ( tgam.ca/2Es7xnK )\nNATIONAL POST ** Nutrien Ltd, the newly formed company from the merger of Potash Corp of Saskatchewan and Agrium Inc, is well on course to achieve savings of half a billion dollars in synergies annually, according to its CEO Chuck Magro. ( bit.ly/2EnDAVz )\n** Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is once more asking America's tech giants for coveted online streaming data to help it plot the future of Canadian content consumption, a move that could test its clout with U.S. companies that previously refused to hand over their subscriber information.
