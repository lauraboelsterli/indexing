    "text": "SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Essex Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ESS) announced today its fourth quarter 2017 earnings results and related business activities.\nNet Income and Funds from Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 are detailed below. Core FFO excludes acquisition and investment related costs and certain non-routine items.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n% % 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Per Diluted Share\nNet Income $ 1.57 $ 2.98 -47.3 % $ 6.57 $ 6.27 4.8 % Total FFO $ 3.01 $ 2.85 5.6 % $ 11.91 $ 11.12 7.1 % Core FFO $ 3.01 $ 2.81 7.1 % $ 11.91 $ 11.04 7.9 % Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Highlights:\nReported Net Income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $1.57, compared to $2.98 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease is primarily due to gains on sale of real estate that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016. Grew Core FFO per diluted share by 7.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and 7.9% for the full-year 2017. Achieved same-property gross revenue and net operating income (“NOI”) growth of 3.0% and 3.4%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full-year, achieved same-property gross revenue and NOI growth near the high-end of the guidance range of 3.7% and 4.2%, respectively. Sold two communities during the fourth quarter of 2017 for a total contract price of $160.3 million. For the full-year, the Company sold four communities for a total contract price of $375.8 million. Acquired one community during the fourth quarter of 2017 for a total contract price of $59.0 million. For the full-year, the Company acquired five communities for a total contract price of $566.8 million, near the high-end of the guidance range. Originated $64.5 million in three preferred equity developments during the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full-year, the Company committed $167.0 million in nine preferred equity and subordinated debt investments, exceeding the original guidance range for the year.\n“Essex delivered another year of solid growth in 2017 with Core FFO growth of 7.9%, which exceeded the high-end of our initial guidance range for the year. The Essex team responded skillfully to challenging market conditions by focusing on occupancy, other income, expense management and investment transactions. Looking forward to 2018, we expect demand for housing will outpace supply in our coastal markets of California and Washington which will lead to market rent growth near long-term averages. We believe the West Coast will continue to outperform the nation in both rent growth and job growth in 2018,” commented Michael Schall, President and CEO of the Company.\nSAME-PROPERTY OPERATIONS\nSame-property operating results exclude any properties that are not comparable for the periods presented. The table below illustrates the percentage change in same-property gross revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and the sequential percentage change for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017, by submarket for the Company:\nQ4 2017 vs.\nQ4 2016\nQ4 2017 vs.\nQ3 2017\n% of Total Gross\nRevenues\nGross\nRevenues\nQ4 2017\nRevenues\nSouthern California Los Angeles County 1.8% -0.1% 19.9% Orange County 3.8% 0.5% 11.6% San Diego County 3.7% 0.3% 9.2% Ventura County 4.4% 0.4% 4.5% Other Southern California 2.3% 0.7% 0.5% Total Southern California 2.9% 0.2% 45.7% Northern California Santa Clara County 2.0% 0.1% 15.7% Alameda County 4.8% 0.1% 7.3% San Mateo County 0.7% -0.3% 5.1% Contra Costa County 2.4% 0.9% 5.1% San Francisco 2.1% -0.5% 2.0% Other Northern California 6.7% 6.6% 0.3% Total Northern California 2.5% 0.2% 35.5% Seattle Metro 4.0% 0.0% 18.8% Same-Property Portfolio 3.0% 0.1% 100.0%\nYear-Over-Year Growth Year-Over-Year Growth Q4 2017 compared to Q4 2016 YTD 2017 compared to YTD 2016 Gross Revenues\nOperating Expenses\nNOI Gross Revenues\nOperating Expenses\nNOI Southern California 2.9% 1.4% 3.7% 3.8% 1.9% 4.6% Northern California 2.5% -0.8% 3.8% 2.6% 1.5% 3.0% Seattle Metro 4.0% 8.7% 1.9% 5.8% 6.5% 5.5% Same-Property Portfolio 3.0% 2.0% 3.4% 3.7% 2.7% 4.2%\nSequential Growth Q4 2017 compared to Q3 2017 Gross Revenues\nOperating Expenses\nNOI Southern California 0.2% 0.1% 0.2% Northern California 0.2% -2.3% 1.1% Seattle Metro 0.0% 0.1% 0.0% Same-Property Portfolio 0.1% -0.7% 0.5% Financial Occupancies Quarter Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2016 Southern California 96.9% 96.8% 96.7% Northern California 96.9% 96.9% 96.5% Seattle Metro 96.4% 96.2% 96.7% Same-Property Portfolio 96.8% 96.7% 96.6% INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nIn October 2017, the Wesco I, LLC (“Wesco I”) joint venture operating agreement was amended to extend the venture. As part of the amendment, the Company and joint venture partner agreed that the Company earned a promote interest of $38.0 million.

The Company’s share of the total gain on the sale was $34.8 million, which has been excluded from the calculation of Total FFO and Core FFO.\nOTHER INVESTMENTS\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company originated $64.5 million in three preferred equity investments in multifamily developments located in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, and Bellevue, WA. The total investment has an average preferred return of 11.1% and all of the investments mature in 2021.\nDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company began construction on a new development in Hollywood, CA.

Generally, FFO adjusts the net income of equity REITs for non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of rental properties, impairment charges, gains on sales of real estate and extraordinary items. Management considers FFO and FFO which excludes merger, integration and acquisition costs and items that are not routine or not related to the Company’s core business activities, which is referred to as “Core FFO”, to be useful financial performance measures of an equity REIT because, together with net income and cash flows, FFO and Core FFO provide investors with additional bases to evaluate the operating performance and ability of a REIT to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and the ability to pay dividends.\nFFO and Core FFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and are not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the REIT's operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Core FFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders. FFO and Core FFO also do not represent cash flows generated from operating, investing or financing activities as defined under GAAP. Management has consistently applied the NAREIT definition of FFO to all periods presented. However, there is judgment involved and other REITs’ calculation of FFO may vary from the NAREIT definition for this measure, and thus their disclosures of FFO may not be comparable to the Company’s calculation.\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s calculation of diluted FFO and Core FFO for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except for share and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nFunds from Operations attributable to common stockholders and unitholders 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income available to common stockholders $ 103,613 $ 195,569 $ 433,059 $ 411,124 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 117,988 111,835 468,881 441,682 Gains not included in FFO (34,779 ) (134,303 ) (159,901 ) (167,607 ) Deferred tax expense on gain on sale of real estate and land – Taxable REIT Subsidiary activity - 131 - 4,410 Depreciation and amortization add back from unconsolidated co-investments 15,196 13,619 55,531 50,956 Noncontrolling interest related to Operating Partnership units 3,536 6,632 14,825 14,089 Depreciation attributable to third party ownership and other (212 ) (6 ) (286 ) (9 ) Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders and unitholders $ 205,342 $ 193,477 $ 812,109 $ 754,645 FFO per share – diluted $ 3.01 $ 2.85 $ 11.91 $ 11.12 Acquisition and investment related costs $ 415 $ 462 $ 1,569 $ 1,841 Gain on sale of marketable securities and other investments (259 ) (2,843 ) (1,909 ) (5,719 ) Interest rate hedge ineffectiveness (1) (59 ) (250 ) (78 ) (250 ) Loss on early retirement of debt 1,796 395 1,796 606 Income from early redemption of preferred equity investments (100 ) - (356 ) - Excess of redemption value of preferred stock over the carrying value - - - 2,541 Insurance reimbursements, legal settlements and other, net (1,418 ) (429 ) (1,108 ) (4,470 ) Core Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders and unitholders $ 205,717 $ 190,812 $ 812,023 $ 749,194 Core FFO per share – diluted $ 3.01 $ 2.81 $ 11.91 $ 11.04 Weighted average number of shares outstanding diluted (2) 68,321,214 67,915,332 68,194,472 67,889,505 (1) Interest rate swaps are generally adjusted to fair value through other comprehensive income (loss). However, because certain of our interest rate swaps do not have a 0% LIBOR floor, while related hedged debt in these cases is subject to a 0% LIBOR floor, the portion of the change in fair value of these interest rate swaps attributable to this mismatch is recorded as noncash interest rate hedge ineffectiveness through interest expense. (2) Assumes conversion of all outstanding limited partnership units in Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) into shares of the Company’s common stock and excludes all DownREIT limited partnership units for which the Operating Partnership has the ability and intention to redeem the units for cash and does not consider them to be common stock equivalents. NET OPERATING INCOME (“NOI”) AND SAME-PROPERTY NOI RECONCILIATIONS\nNet Operating Income (\"NOI\") and Same-Property NOI are considered by management to be important supplemental performance measures to earnings from operations included in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. The presentation of same-property NOI assists with the presentation of the Company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. The Company defines same-property NOI as same-property revenue less same-property operating expenses, including property taxes. Please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to NOI and same-property NOI, which in the table below is the NOI for stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Earnings from operations $ 112,375 $ 105,520 $ 446,522 $ 420,800 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 117,988 111,835 468,881 441,682 Management and other fees (2,647 ) (2,133 ) (9,574 ) (8,278 ) from affiliates General and administrative 10,659 12,224 41,385 40,751 Acquisition and investment related costs 415 462 1,569 1,841 NOI 238,790 227,908 948,783 896,796 Less: Non-same property NOI (22,414 ) (18,622 ) (91,096 ) (73,549 ) Same-Property NOI $ 216,376 $ 209,286 $ 857,687 $ 823,247 SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995:\nThis press release includes “ ” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
