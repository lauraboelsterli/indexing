    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Oliver Rowland has been appointed “official young driver” for Williams even though, at 25, he is older than both of those who will be racing for the Formula One team this season.\nThe former champions have Canadian Lance Stroll, 19, and Russian rookie Sergey Sirotkin, 22, as their confirmed race drivers.\nWilliams said Rowland, who was third overall in Formula Two last season and will race in this year’s World Endurance Championship, would help in the simulator and drive the FW41 car at a young driver test.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis\n ",
