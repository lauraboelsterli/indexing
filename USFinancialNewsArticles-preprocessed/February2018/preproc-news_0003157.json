    "text": "DENVER, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kutak Rock is pleased to announce that seven attorneys have joined its Denver office. The attorneys make the move from former Denver law firm Lowe, Fell & Skogg (LFS), effective February 1, growing Kutak Rock's Denver attorney count to 91 and the firm's overall count to 525. The additions further strengthen the firm's banking and finance, corporate law, commercial real estate, eminent domain and litigation capabilities.\nThe attorneys joining Kutak Rock include Henry Lowe, David Fell, Kenneth Skogg, Heather McKee, Elizabeth Peros, Dana Baggs and Aren A. Sharifi .\n\"The addition of the LFS attorneys deepens our corporate bench, bringing new and additional transactional clients and capabilities to the firm,\" said Tiffanie Stasiak, managing partner for Kutak Rock's Denver office. \"Also, LFS' profile in the area of eminent domain creates strong synergies as we share many clients in common. I am confident that our new colleagues will be a great fit and a tremendous asset to the Denver office and the firm. We are excited to welcome them.\"\n\"We were seeking a firm that could provide a collegial environment along with well-aligned client principles and a national platform. Our decision to join Kutak Rock makes business and client sense. Kutak Rock's values and goals and its focus on efficient, nimble and responsive service are a match for our own,\" said Henry I. (Sandy) Lowe. \"We're proud to bring our team's experience to Kutak Rock and we are confident this is the right move for us and our clients we will now collectively serve.\"\nJay Selanders, Chair of Kutak Rock, comments, \"We give much thought and consideration to our firm's growth. Whether it's welcoming a single attorney, adding a group of new attorneys or opening an office in a new market, our focus remains the sameâ€”hiring talented, experienced and personable attorneys, while honoring and upholding our values and maintaining the culture of the firm. Our newest colleagues represent who we are as practitioners and as a firm, and I welcome them warmly to Kutak Rock.\"\nFor more than 40 years, Kutak Rock's Denver office has represented clients in the Rocky Mountain region and nationally in the full range of business and governmental matters, including business and corporate transactions, commercial litigation, public finance, and real estate law.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kutak-rock-expands-denver-office-with-seven-attorneys-from-local-firm-300592406.html\nSOURCE Kutak Rock LLP",
