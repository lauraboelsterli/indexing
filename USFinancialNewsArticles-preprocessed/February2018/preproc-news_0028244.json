    "text": "9 Hours Ago | 01:13 \nA start-up called Youbionic wants to elevate people's abilities by giving them a set of extra hands. The company's double-handed, 3D-printed prosthetic is controlled by flex sensors on the user's fingers. Each hand has six actuators that allow it to pinch and close. \nYoubionic launched in 2014 with a single-handed prosthetic. The company says that it's now working to modify its two-handed wearable to perform everyday tasks such as turning a handle and typing on a keyboard. \nConsumers can either buy the 3D-printing files for the prosthetic on the Youbionic website for $244, or order the fully printed wearable for $2,200.
