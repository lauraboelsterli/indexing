    "text": "PARIS, Feb 27 (Reuters) -\n* The French finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited (JNFL) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) had together paid up a 500 million euro capital increase for French state-owned nuclear group Orano, formerly called Areva.\n* The capital increase will give each of the Japanese companies a five percent stake in Orano. The rest of the firmâ€™s capital is held by the state, of which 45.8 percent directly, 4.2 percent through state nuclear agency CEA and 40 percent through state-owned legacy Areva SA.\n* The operation finalises the restructuring and split-up of former integrated nuclear group Areva, which started in the summer of 2015.
