    "text": "Published: Feb 4, 2018 4:28 p.m. ET Share \nApple adding new subscribers at higher rate Bloomberg News Apple Music told The Wall Street Journal it now has 36 million subscribers, up from the 30 million it last reported in September. \nBy Anne Steele \nMonths before its hotly anticipated public stock offering, Spotify AB’s lead in music streaming is shrinking, at least in the U.S. \nApple Inc.’s AAPL, -4.34% Apple Music is adding subscriber accounts in the U.S. at a higher rate than Spotify, and is on track to pass the No. 1 streaming service this summer, according to people in the record business familiar with figures reported by the two services. \nRead: Apple earnings show iPhone ‘supercycle’ isn’t happening, and that’s OK \nSpotify is widely considered the dominant force in the streaming world, with Apple at a distant second. To be sure, Spotify is larger globally and continues to grow slightly faster. But that the No. 2 streaming service is quietly gaining ground in the largest music-subscription market in the world signals Spotify now has significant competition. \nApple’s subscriber-account base in the U.S. has been growing about 5% monthly, versus Spotify’s 2% clip, according to the people familiar with the numbers. Assuming those growth rates continue, Apple will overtake Spotify in accounts this summer. Apple’s popular devices have helped add subscribers to its music service, which is preloaded on all iPhones, Apple Watches and other hardware the company sells.",
