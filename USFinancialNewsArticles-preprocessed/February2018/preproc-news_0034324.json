    "text": "LIMA, Feb 13 (Reuters) - The “Lima Group” of Latin American nations plus Canada on Tuesday criticized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s decision to hold a presidential election on April 22 and urged him to reconsider the date.\nIn a statement, the countries said there could not be free and fair elections in Venezuela as long as there were political prisoners.\nPeru’s foreign minister also told a news conference that Maduro would not be welcome at the Summit of the Americas to be held in Lima in April.
