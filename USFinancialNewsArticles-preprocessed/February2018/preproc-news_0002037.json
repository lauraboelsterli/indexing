    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., Feb. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (“Patriot”, “Bancorp”) (NASDAQ:PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), today announced quarterly pre-tax earnings of $1.1 million and quarterly net income of $600 thousand, or $0.15 per fully diluted share.\nFull year pre-tax income in 2017 was $7.0 million, $3.9 million higher than the $3.1 million reported in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $4.1 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, more than double the prior year results of $1.9 million, or $0.49 per fully diluted share.\nCEO Michael Carrazza stated: “2017’s full year results represent a major earnings achievement for Patriot, and marks the strongest earnings year in Patriot’s history. This is further confirmation that the growth blueprint put in place is yielding successful, value enhancing results. We remain keenly focused on pursuing certain strategic initiatives that support growth and diversification of our banking franchise.”\nRichard Muskus, Patriot’s President added, “We have a strong loan pipeline, a dedicated team of highly qualified lending and branch management professionals, and prudent underwriting standards. We will continue to add to our product lines and enhance service offerings to our customers. These are the primary areas of focus and will continue to add to our profitability and franchise value.”\nThe reported fourth quarter net income, which included $601 thousand of non-recurring special project costs, compares to net income of $1 million, $0.26 per fully diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017 and $1 million, $0.27 per share, for the same quarter a year ago.\nWith respect to income taxes, a net provision of $502 thousand was taken in the fourth quarter. This net tax provision was comprised of two significant and mostly offsetting adjustments. The provision increased by $2.81 million as a result of a reduction in value of the Company’s deferred tax asset due to the change in corporate tax rates to 21% enacted in December of 2017. At the same time, the income tax provision was reduced by $2.77 million, as a result of the recognition of deferred tax benefits due to a change in the classification of certain prior period tax losses that were previously deemed to have been subject to IRC Section 382 limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2017 shareholders’ equity was $66.7 million, an increase of $4.2 million from a year ago. The Company’s book value per share increased to $17.12 at December 31, 2017 as compared to $16.08 a year ago.\nPatriot Bank’s deposits continued to rise and are up 20% year-over-year, with loan growth of 24% from the prior year fueling a strong growth in net interest income. Net interest income climbed 19% from the fourth quarter of 2016 and is 16% higher in the full year period.\nIn addition to the announcement of quarterly earnings, Patriot also announced today the declaration of its third consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share which will be paid February 16, 2018.\nThe comparative results for the full year 2016 and 2017 include the impact of a troubled loan that was ultimately resolved. In the second quarter of 2016, the Bank recorded a significant loan loss provision, but aggressively worked towards a recovery, which was successfully accomplished in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of the loan loss provision, which primarily consisted of losses and recoveries related to this loan, net income for the year was 6% higher than in 2016.\nDuring the year, total assets grew by $95 million (13%), to $852 million, up from $757 million. Loans totaled $720 million as of year-end 2017, up 1% from the $710 million reported at September 30, 2017, and up 24% from the $582 million reported at December 31, 2016.\nDeposits increased during the quarter to $637 million and were up 20% year-over-year as compared with $529 million at the end of 2016. Deposit growth remains a key initiative to keep pace with Patriot’s overall growth prospects.\nNet interest income was $7.0 million in the quarter, essentially unchanged from the third quarter of 2017 and up 19% from the corresponding 2016 period. Net interest income of $25.9 million in the year-to-date period was 16% higher than the $22.4 million in the year ending December 31, 2016. Net interest margin was 3.51% for the quarter and 3.58% for the 2017 year-to-date period, as compared to 3.65 % in the prior quarter and 3.78% in 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses in the quarter was $87 thousand, with overall credit quality remaining strong. The year-to-date credit in the provision of $857 thousand reflects the previously noted recovery. The provision for loan losses was $150 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-interest income was $432 thousand in the quarter, 12% higher than the prior quarter. Year-to-date non-interest income of $1.4 million was 7% lower than the prior year.\nNon-interest expense increased $1 million over the prior quarter and year-to-date non-interest expenses increased $2.8 million over the same period in 2016. The quarter and full year expenses were impacted by non-recurring project costs of $601 thousand in the quarter ($640 thousand for the full year) associated with the pending Prime acquisition and an income tax related consulting project.\nThe Bank’s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its “well capitalized” regulatory status. As of December 31, 2017, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.36%, Tier 1 risk based capital was 10.55% and total risk based capital was 11.41%.\nAbout the Company\nPatriot National Bancorp, Inc. is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut and the Bank has full service branches in Connecticut and New York.\nSince opening its doors in 1994, the Company’s mission has been to serve our local communities by helping our neighbors and neighborhood businesses thrive. All lending is handled locally and is specific to each borrower, and the commitment to local businesses goes further to connect, support and grow businesses in both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors, along with municipalities.
