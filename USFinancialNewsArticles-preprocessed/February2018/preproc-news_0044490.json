    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TrueProfile LTD , a division of Capital Preferences and provider of a unique platform for financial advisors that reveals their clients' true risk tolerance, loss aversion and decision consistency as defined by economic science, announced that Jeff Miller and Steve Schultz have joined the firm's advisory board.\n\"We are thrilled to have Jeff Miller and Steve Schultz on the TrueProfile advisory board,\" said Capital Preferences founder and Group CEO Bernard Del Rey. \"Having built careers in the financial technology and advisory space, they know first-hand the challenges facing advisors, especially when it comes to the 'know your client' imperative. The insights they bring to our strategic planning process will be invaluable.\"\nJEFF MILLER\nJeff Miller is President and COO for Truelytics, a fast-growing business analytics firm in the wealth management space. Previously, Miller was the head of Advice and Platforms at UBS, with responsibility for fee-based advisory, financial planning and nearly all products and tools used by financial advisors at UBS in the U.S. Before joining UBS, he held senior leadership positions at Mercer, Putnam and Smith Barney. At Mercer, he was Global Executive Committee member, President and Group Executive of Mercer Global Outsourcing, President of Mercer Trust Company, and Head of Mercer's Global Operations and Shared Services Group. At Putnam Investments, Miller served as Head of Europe Distribution, US Defined Contribution, Variable Annuities and Private Asset Management. At Smith Barney, he served as Head of Defined Contribution and Retirement Plan Services, and as a financial advisor.\nMiller began his career as an attorney in Washington, D.C. He received his BSBA from Boston University's School of Management and his Juris Doctor from American University's Washington College of Law.\n\"Deeper client understanding is the only sustainable advantage for today's financial advisors, but it can be extremely challenging to achieve,\" said Miller. \"When it comes to identifying the client's true risk and loss tolerance, actions speak louder than words. A technology solution that can accurately reveal and measure the client's preferences is finally available with TrueProfile. It will have a profound impact on the financial advice industry.\"\nSTEVE SCHULTZ\nSteve Schultz was most recently Chief Operating Officer at Check (acquired by Intuit in 2014), where he launched its first mobile payment product in 2011, led strategic partnerships, built the company's distribution team and ran all sales operations. Previously, Schultz held leadership roles in product and general management at Yahoo! Finance. He currently advises financial technology firms Finxera, Tapingo and SigFig. Schultz holds a B.S. in economics from University of California, Davis, and an MBA from the Haas School at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\"TrueProfile and Capital Preferences are doing critical work to help financial advisors' clients achieve better outcomes,\" said Schultz. \"In the past, so much of the risk profiling was focused on clearing a regulatory 'hurdle.' The academic research underlying TrueProfile will help advisors bridge the gap between a worried, often under-funded investor and the largely misunderstood financial markets products they need to meet financial goals. Their outstanding research focus and excellent technology make for a winning combination. This is just the beginning for this talented team and I'm excited to join them on the journey.\"\nTRUEPROFILE HELPS ENTERPRISES CREATE ORIGINAL INSIGHT\nWhile the information gathered from clients' TrueProfile responses will be invaluable for financial advisors, it will be a game-changer for big firms. Currently, much of their client data is transactional in nature and is becoming commoditized. TrueProfile data will enable financial services enterprises to create proprietary, original insights about clients' needs and wants. Applying predictive analytics to the data will enable these firms to anticipate client behaviors and craft effective strategies for managing client engagement, which will serve to boost client loyalty and acquisition.\nBeyond financial advice, TrueProfile's methodology holds promising applications in other areas, like credit underwriting and human capital management.
