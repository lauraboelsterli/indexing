    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The Chicago Stock Exchange said on Friday it was evaluating its options after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission blocked the sale of the bourse to a group of U.S. and China-based investors due to the opaque nature of the buyers and their funds.\nThe SEC’s decision brought to an end a two-year effort to sell the exchange, known as CHX, to a consortium of investors that was led by China’s Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group and its U.S. affiliate North American Casin Holdings.
