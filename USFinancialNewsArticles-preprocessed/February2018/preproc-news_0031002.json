    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Workey, the next-gen AI solution for recruitment and career enhancement, today announced it is changing its name to Gloat. The company continues to be committed to revolutionizing the recruitment process.\nGloat provides smart recommendations on what an individual's next career steps could be by using advanced AI to analyze unique and complex career histories, while simultaneously comparing the user's information to the career paths of millions of others. This knowledge provides users the opportunity to make informed data-driven decisions and even pursue prospects previously unimagined.\nThe anonymity provided by Gloat also facilitates a safe place for the passive seekers to easily discover and explore their options. Based on the results and recommendations generated, passive talent as well as active talent can effectively assess offers before the companies even know their names. This in turn, significantly widens and enhances the pool of potential employees. Anonymity further mitigates against decisions based on gender, age or ethnic bias, tackling a key social problem that remains to this day.\nDubbed as the Tinder for Recruitment the company is already working with over 500 companies, including tech giants such as WeWork, Dell EMC, Oracle, and Yahoo, significantly bolstering opportunities for candidates looking to advance their careers.\n\"It's important for people to take pride in their accomplishments,\" said Ben Reuveni, Co-Founder and CEO of Gloat. \"Whether you are fresh out of college or deeply ensconced in your career, taking the next step can be daunting. We want to remind you to celebrate all that you are and all that you've accomplished. We urge you to revitalize your career strategy with a fresh attitude. We want this name change to tell our users to go ahead and gloat about success on your own terms.\"\nAbout Gloat:\nGloat is an anonymous social recruitment and career enhancement platform and application, revolutionizing HR through advanced AI and machine learning based in Tel Aviv and New York. Gloat's platform is capable of profiling 80% of today's workforce, to provide data-driven recommendations on what could be a person's next career step. The company has also recently launched its iOS application, enabling users to simply swipe through their smart matches, in a similar way to popular dating apps.
