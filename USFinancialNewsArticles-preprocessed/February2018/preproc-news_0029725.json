    "text": "U.S. and Systemwide Comparable RevPAR Increased 3.0% and 3.8%, Respectively\nInitiates Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.15 per Share\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hyatt Hotels Corporation (\"Hyatt\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: H) today reported fourth quarter 2017 financial results. Net income attributable to Hyatt was $76 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $41 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $217 million gain from the sale of Avendra, LLC, an equity method investment, and $110 million of incremental tax attributable to recent U.S. tax reform. Adjusted net income attributable to Hyatt was $29 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $39 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Refer to the table on page 4 of the schedules for a summary of special items impacting Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share in the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nMark S. Hoplamazian, president and chief executive officer of Hyatt Hotels Corporation, said, \"We had a strong finish to the year, delivering full-year comparable RevPAR growth of 3.3% and net hotel rooms growth of 7.0%, fueled by a record-setting 71 new hotels added to our system in 2017. Double-digit growth in management and franchising fees more than offset an earnings decline in our owned and leased segment, which reflected more than $900 million in asset dispositions.\"\nFourth quarter of 2017 financial results as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 are as follows:\nNet income increased 87.4% to $76 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.0% to $179 million, up 3.0% in constant currency. Comparable systemwide RevPAR increased 3.8%, including an increase of 4.1% at comparable owned and leased hotels.

The Company repurchased 12,186,308 shares of common stock for $723 million in 2017, compared to 5,631,557 shares for $272 million in 2016.\nMr. Hoplamazian continued, \"We believe we are well-positioned to execute our long-term growth strategy of maximizing our core business focused on high-end travelers, integrating new growth platforms and optimizing capital deployment. Plans to sell roughly $1.5 billion of real estate by the end of 2020 are underway. We remain confident that these actions will support growth in our business and further unlock shareholder value, as evidenced by our initiation of a quarterly cash dividend as well as the increase in our share repurchase authorization.\"\nFourth quarter of 2017 financial results as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 are as follows:\nOwned and Leased Hotels Segment\nTotal owned and leased hotels segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8.1% (8.8% in constant currency) including a 34.0% decrease in pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA.

Six hotels, representing 1,520 rooms, were removed from the portfolio during the 2017 fiscal year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had executed management or franchise contracts for approximately 330 hotels (approximately 70,000 rooms), compared to the expectation for 315 hotels and 69,000 rooms as of September 30, 2017. The pipeline of executed contracts represent important potential entry into several new countries and expansion into new markets or markets in which Hyatt is under-represented. Refer to the table on page 18 of the schedules for a breakdown of the pipeline.\nDIVIDEND / SHARE REPURCHASE\nAs part of the Company's commitment to return meaningful capital to shareholders, the Company is initiating a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, representing an annualized dividend of $0.60 per share. The initial dividend will be payable on March 29, 2018 to Class A and Class B shareholders on record as of March 22, 2018.\nDuring the 2017 fiscal year, the Company repurchased a record $723 million of shares, consisting of 12,186,308 shares of common stock (9,096,871 Class A shares and 3,089,437 Class B shares), at a weighted average price of $59.34 per share. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 2,693,579 shares of common stock (1,417,601 Class A shares and 1,275,978 Class B shares) for an aggregate purchase price of $188 million. The Company ended the fourth quarter with 48,231,149 Class A and 70,753,837 Class B shares issued and outstanding.\nFrom January 1 through February 9, 2018, the Company repurchased 277,760 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $23 million. This includes a final tranche of Class A shares that settled as part of a November 2017 accelerated share repurchase program. As of February 9, 2018, the Company had approximately $861 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.\nCAPITAL STRATEGY UPDATE\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company completed the following transactions:\nSold Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch (493 rooms) and Royal Palms Resort and Spa in Phoenix, Arizona (119 rooms) for approximately $305 million. The hotels continue to be Hyatt-branded under long-term management agreements. Sold Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel & Spa on Del Monte Golf Course (550 rooms) for approximately $58 million. The sale was part of the Company's ongoing asset recycling strategy. The hotel continues to be Hyatt-branded under a long-term franchise agreement.\nThe Company continues to execute plans to sell approximately $1.5 billion of real estate by the end of 2020 as part of its long-term growth strategy. The disposition of Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch and Royal Palms Resort and Spa in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects progress towards this goal. Additional properties are being actively marketed for sale.\nBALANCE SHEET / OTHER ITEMS\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company reported the following:\nTotal debt of $1.5 billion. Pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality venture debt of $580 million, substantially all of which is non-recourse to Hyatt and a portion of which Hyatt guarantees pursuant to separate agreements. Cash and cash equivalents, including investments in highly-rated money market funds and similar investments, of $503 million, short-term investments of $49 million and restricted cash of $234 million. Undrawn borrowing availability of $1.5 billion under its revolving credit facility.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nThe Company is providing the following information for the 2018 fiscal year:\nNet income is expected to be approximately $176 million to $215 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $805 million to $825 million. These estimates also include a favorable impact from foreign currency of approximately $0 (low end of the forecast) to $5 million (high end of the forecast). Refer to the table on page 3 of the schedules for a reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA. Comparable systemwide RevPAR is expected to increase approximately 1% to 3%, as compared to fiscal year 2017. Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately $300 million. This excludes approximately $35 million to $36 million of stock-based compensation expense and any potential expenses related to benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $367 million to $371 million. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $75 million to $76 million. Other income (loss), net is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $65 million to $75 million related to performance guarantee expense for the four managed hotels in France. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27% to 31%, reflecting estimated impacts from recent U.S. tax reform. The Company expects to grow units, on a net rooms basis, by approximately 6.0% to 6.5%, reflecting approximately 60 new hotel openings. The Company expects to return at least $300 million to shareholders through a combination of cash dividends on its common stock and share repurchases.\nThe above does not reflect anticipated changes resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018. The Company is in the process of finalizing the adoption impact and restatement of prior year results. As previously disclosed, the most material non-cash impact to Adjusted EBITDA relates to the change in accounting for deferred gains which would result in a reduction of $25 million in 2017 and an anticipated reduction of approximately $31 million in 2018.\nThe Company plans to update its 2018 Outlook in connection with its first quarter earnings release to reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition standard.\nThe Company's outlook is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. There can be no assurance that Hyatt will achieve these results.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nThe Company will hold an extended investor conference call tomorrow, February 15, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. CT.

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA, as the Company defines them, are non-GAAP measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation plus its pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA based on its ownership percentage of each venture, adjusted to exclude the following items:\ninterest expense; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; equity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures; stock-based compensation expense; gains (losses) on sales of real estate; and other income (loss), net.\nWe calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by adding the Adjusted EBITDA of each of our reportable segments and eliminations to corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA. Our board of directors and executive management team focus on Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance and compensation measure both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Our president and chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, also evaluates the performance of each of our reportable segments and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, by assessing the Adjusted EBITDA of each segment. In addition, the compensation committee of our board of directors determines the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management based in part on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, segment Adjusted EBITDA or some combination of both. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that the Company uses internally for purposes of assessing operating performance and making compensation decisions.\nAdjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not substitutes for net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation, net income, or any other measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). There are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named non-GAAP measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business. Our management addresses these limitations by reference to its GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues, net of other revenues from managed and franchised properties. Other revenues from managed and franchised properties reflect reimbursed costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised hotel property owners. We believe Adjusted EBITDA margin is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that the Company uses internally for purposes of assessing operating performance.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted net income, as we definite it, is a non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted net income as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation excluding special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of ongoing operations. We believe Adjusted net income provides meaningful comparisons of ongoing operating results.\nAdjusted Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses\nAdjusted SG&A expenses, as we define it, is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted SG&A expenses exclude the impact of expenses related to benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted SG&A expenses assist us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis since it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations, both on a segment and consolidated basis.\nComparable Owned and Leased Hotels Operating Margin\nWe define comparable owned and leased hotels operating margin as the difference between comparable owned and leased hotels revenues and comparable owned and leased hotels expenses. Comparable owned and leased hotels revenues is calculated by removing non-comparable hotels revenues from owned and leased hotels revenues as reported in our consolidated statements of income. Comparable owned and leased hotels expenses is calculated by removing both non-comparable owned and leased hotels expenses and the impact of expenses funded through rabbi trusts from owned and leased hotels expenses as reported in our consolidated statements of income. We believe comparable owned and leased hotels operating margin is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that the Company uses internally for purposes of assessing operating performance.\nComparable Hotels\n\"Comparable systemwide hotels\" represents all properties we manage or franchise (including owned and leased properties) and that are operated for the entirety of the periods being compared and that have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption, or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. We may use variations of comparable systemwide hotels to specifically refer to comparable systemwide Americas full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the Americas management and franchising segment, comparable systemwide ASPAC full service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the ASPAC management and franchising segment, or comparable systemwide EAME/SW Asia full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the EAME/SW Asia management and franchising segment. \"Comparable operated hotels\" is defined the same as \"comparable systemwide hotels\" with the exception that it is limited to only those hotels we manage or operate and excludes hotels we franchise. \"Comparable owned and leased hotels\" represents all properties we own or lease and that are operated and consolidated for the entirety of the periods being compared and have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption, or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. Comparable systemwide hotels and comparable owned and leased hotels are commonly used as a basis of measurement in our industry. \"Non-comparable systemwide hotels\" or \"non-comparable owned and leased hotels\" represent all hotels that do not meet the respective definition of \"comparable\" as defined above.\nConstant Dollar Currency\nWe report the results of our operations both on an as reported basis, as well as on a constant dollar basis. Constant dollar currency, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates between comparative periods. We believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding our results as it removes currency fluctuations from our operating results. We calculate constant dollar currency by restating prior-period local currency financial results at the current period’s exchange rates. These adjusted amounts are then compared to our current period reported amounts to provide operationally driven variances in our results.\nRevenue per Available Room (RevPAR)\nRevPAR is the product of the average daily rate (ADR) and the average daily occupancy percentage. RevPAR does not include non-room revenues, which consist of ancillary revenues generated by a hotel property, such as food and beverage, parking, and other guest service revenues. Our management uses RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room revenues from comparable properties and to evaluate hotel performance on a regional and segment basis. RevPAR is a commonly used performance measure in our industry. RevPAR changes driven predominantly by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental profitability than do changes driven predominantly by changes in average room rates. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities, and room amenity costs), and could also result in increased ancillary revenues (including food and beverage). In contrast, changes in average room rates typically have a greater impact on margins and profitability as there is no substantial effect on variable costs.\nAverage Daily Rate (ADR)\nADR represents hotel room revenues, divided by the total number of rooms sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in our industry, and we use ADR to assess the pricing levels we are able to generate by customer group, as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels. Occupancy measures the utilization of a hotel's available capacity. We use occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help us determine achievable ADR levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.\nPipeline\nPipeline reflects fully executed management and franchise agreements.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nForward-Looking Statements in this press release, which are not historical facts, are within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
