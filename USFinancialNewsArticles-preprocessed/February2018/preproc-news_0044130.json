Elliott Sigal, M.D., Ph.D., Geoff McDonough, M.D., and Laurie Stelzer will work with the other members of the Surface board of directors to guide the company as it advances its broad portfolio of immuno-oncology therapies.\n“The Surface team is delighted to welcome Elliott, Geoff and Laurie to our board of directors,” said Jeff Goater, chief executive officer of Surface Oncology. “They are accomplished biopharma leaders and their considerable experience will be invaluable as we continue our evolution into a clinical stage company.”\nDr. Sigal is a Venture Partner and Senior Advisor at NEA Ventures and has been a member of Surface Oncology’s Scientific Advisory Board since 2014.

In 2012, Dr. Sigal was named the best R&D chief in the pharmaceutical industry by Scrip Intelligence. He is co-chair of Amgen’s Scientific Advisory Network and a member of the board of directors of Adaptimmune, Spark Therapeutics, and the Melanoma Research Alliance.\nDr. McDonough is president and CEO of Generation Bio which he helped launch earlier this year.

He also held a variety of senior roles at Genzyme Corporation, including president of Genzyme Europe where he was responsible for overseeing operations in 55 countries and a portfolio of 15 products. Dr. McDonough earned his medical degree from Harvard Medical School and completed his residency training in internal medicine and pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston Children's Hospital.\nMs. Stelzer is chief financial officer at Halozyme Therapeutics.
