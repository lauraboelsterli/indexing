Alfred N‘Diaye and Helder Costa put the runaway leaders 2-0 up with three-quarters of the game still to go. \nConor Washington pulled one back soon after halftime, but the Londoners were unable to find an equaliser.

Slideshow (9 Images) \nFulham failed to close the gap when Adam Le Fondre’s equaliser earned Bolton Wanderers a share of the points in a 1-1 draw at the Macron Stadium after Matt Targett had given fifth-placed Fulham an early lead. \nSheffield United and Middlesbrough remained hot on the heels of those sides in the playoff places after 2-1 home victories over Leeds United and Reading respectively, but Preston North End faltered, being held 1-1 by Brentford. \nBarnsley drew 1-1 with Sheffield Wednesday in the South Yorkshire derby, but Hull City’s 2-0 victory at Nottingham Forest sent Barnsley into the bottom three. \nBurton Albion remained bottom after a goalless draw at Ipswich Town.
