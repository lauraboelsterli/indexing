    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Snow fell over swathes of Britain on Tuesday as freezing weather dubbed “the Beast from the East” swept in from Siberia, forcing some schools to close and snarling the travel plans of thousands.\nParts of eastern Britain have seen up to 10 cm of snow this week and temperatures could fall toward minus 10 Celsius in some rural areas, Britain’s weather service said.\nSlideshow (8 Images) “Bitterly cold easterly winds maintain their grip across the UK and we will see further snow showers in some places,” said Aidan McGivern, a meteorologist at the Met Office. “It is bitterly cold out there.”\nTrain services and some flights were canceled while police warned drivers to take care as they battled blizzards and ice.\nIn London, snow covered some parts of Westminster and a blizzard briefly swept through the Canary Wharf financial district.\nThe freezing weather was expected to last for the rest of the week.\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
