MDP, +0.91% and Time Warner Inc.’s TWX, -0.01% CNN were involved in the early development of the technology and have already begun creating such stories for the mobile web. \nAMP stories are reminiscent of the immersive, vertical stories pioneered by Snap Inc.’s SNAP, +1.72% Snapchat, which spurred copycat features from social-media rivals. In 2016, Facebook Inc.’s FB, -0.90% Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a swipeable product that has also gained traction among many publishers. \nWith publishers eager to make money from the rising tide of consumers viewing content on mobile devices, tech companies also have introduced products designed to aggregate news and speed the loading of articles on mobile, including Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.42% Apple News app and Facebook’s Instant Articles. \nUnlike those products, however, AMP stories doesn’t yet allow advertising to be incorporated. Google is in the process of building support for ads but didn’t disclose a time frame. Meanwhile, the lack of monetization on AMP stories threatens to slow its adoption among publishers. ",
