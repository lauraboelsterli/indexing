These results conclude a pivotal year for Adesto as we gained significant momentum ramping production of past design wins, resulting in three consecutive quarters of revenue growing by over 30% year-over-year and 27.6% for the full year.\n“We are equally excited about our growth prospects in 2018 and beyond as we layered on a record number of design wins this past year, which should add to our current momentum. In fact, the annual revenue run rate potential of our secured design wins for 2017 increased by over 85% from 2016 and four times over that of 2015. We believe this is a clear indication that the growth we experienced in 2017 will carry forward into 2018 and beyond. We are seeing a number of new IoT and embedded applications coming to market that are benefitting from our low-power smart memory devices, including voice-activated home appliances, touch-sensors, asset trackers, smart lighting as well as health monitors.\n“Finally, we significantly improved our balance sheet and financial position during the year, ending with more than $30 million in cash and giving us the capital and resources necessary to grow our existing business. With operating expenses well under control and gross margins remaining within our targeted range, we are well positioned to deliver improving profits and cash flow. We are starting out the year with expectations to achieve our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue increasing 30% year-over-year and strong growth anticipated throughout the year as we expect to reach GAAP profitability in 2018.”\nFourth Quarter and 2017 Results\nRevenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was a record $16.2 million, an increase of 31.0% from $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase of 6.0% from $15.2 million last quarter.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our past financial performance and future results. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our business strategies and assess operational efficiencies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments based on the following items:\nStock-based compensation expenses: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures. Although stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees’ compensation affecting their performance, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is a non-cash expense, and it is not part of our core operations. Investors should note that the use of acquisition-related intangible assets contributed to revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to future period revenues as well. Gains from dispute settlements: We have excluded the effect of the gain on settlement of an alleged liability with a former foundry supplier from our non-GAAP financial measures. The gain on settlement is a non-cash gain, is not a recurring event and is not part of our core operations and was excluded when evaluating our financial performance.\nOur non-GAAP Financial Measures are described as follows:\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is GAAP net loss as reported on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and gains from dispute settlements. Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by weighted average shares outstanding and, if dilutive, incremental shares based upon the conversion of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and warrants. Non-GAAP operating expense. Non-GAAP operating expenses are GAAP operating expenses as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and gains from dispute settlements. Adjusted EBITDA is GAAP net loss as reported on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of the same items excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP net income (loss) as well as interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and our provision for income taxes.\nFor reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled, “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nAbout Adesto Technologies\nAdesto Technologies (NASDAQ:IOTS) is a leading provider of application-specific, ultra-low power and smart non-volatile memory products.
