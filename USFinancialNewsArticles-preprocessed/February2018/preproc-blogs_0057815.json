    "text": "General Electric to restate two years of earnings Published 41 Mins Ago Alwyn Scott | Reuters Technicians build LEAP engines for jetliners at a new, highly automated General Electric (GE) factory. \nGeneral Electric will restate its earnings for 2016 and 2017 as it adopts a new accounting standard, according to a regulatory filing Friday. \nThe updated accounting standard, which will take into account revenue from long-term contracts, will result in a 13 cent cut in reported earnings per share for 2016 and a cut of 16 cents per share for 2017, according to the company's 10-K filing. \nThe company will restate earnings when it reports 2018 results, GE said in the filing. GE reports first-quarter earnings on April 20. \nGE is adopting the new accounting standards as the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating GE over its accounting for long-term service contracts. \nGE also is facing potential legal action by the U.S. Department of Justice over allegations that its GE Capital unit and now-defunct WMC Mortgage Corp. unit violated U.S. law in connection with subprime mortgages, according to the filing. \nThe Financial Times first reported that GE plans to restate earnings.
