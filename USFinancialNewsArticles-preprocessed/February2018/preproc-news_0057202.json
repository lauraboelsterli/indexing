    "text": "HORSHAM, Pa., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) ( www.tollbrothers.com ), the nation’s leading builder of luxury homes, today announced results for its first quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nFY 2018’s First Quarter Financial Highlights (Compared to FY 2017’s First Quarter):\nNet income was $132.1 million, or $0.83 per share diluted, compared to net income of $70.4 million, or $0.42 per share diluted in FY 2017’s first quarter. Pre-tax income was $131.6 million, compared to $109.8 million Revenues were $1.18 billion - up 28%; home building deliveries were 1,423 units - up 20% Net signed contract value was $1.69 billion - up 36%; contract units were 1,822 - up 20% Backlog value at first-quarter end rose to $5.58 billion - up 28%; units totaled 6,250 - up 21% Gross margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 20.5% Adjusted Gross Margin, which excludes interest and inventory write-downs (“Adjusted Gross Margin”), was 23.7% SG&A, as a percentage of revenues, was 13.4% Income from operations was 7.1% of revenues Other income and Income from unconsolidated entities was $47.9 million As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, FY 2018’s first-quarter net income was favorably impacted by a $31.2 million tax benefit associated with the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liability\nIn Addition:\nThe Company repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $47.43 per share for a total purchase price of approximately $210.0 million in its first quarter The Company has repurchased an additional approximately 1.4 million shares at an average price of $46.07 per share for a total purchase price of approximately $65.3 million in the second quarter to date\nFY 2018 Financial Guidance (Subject to the Forward-Looking Statement Below):\nFull FY 2018 deliveries of between 7,800 and 8,600 units with an average price of between $820,000 and $860,000; second-quarter deliveries of between 1,825 and 1,925 units with an average price of between $825,000 and $850,000 FY Adjusted Gross Margin of between 23.75% and 24.25% of revenues; second-quarter Adjusted Gross Margin of 22.8% FY SG&A, as a percentage of FY revenues, of approximately 10.0%; second-quarter SG&A, as a percentage of second quarter revenues, of approximately 10.6% FY Other income and Income from unconsolidated entities of between $130 million and $170 million, with approximately $15 million in the second quarter FY tax rate of between 23% and 25%; second quarter tax rate of approximately 27.5%\nDouglas C. Yearley, Jr., Toll Brothers’ chief executive officer, stated: “We are very pleased with our first quarter results across all metrics as our revenues, contracts, backlog, earnings and profit margin met or exceeded our expectations.\n“Demand remained very strong this quarter. The California and Western regions led the way with 93% and 36% growth, respectively, in the value of contracts signed, compared to one year ago. The South was up 17% and the North was up 15%. Only in the Mid-Atlantic did we see a decline. City Living, which is primarily in metro New York City, saw growth, with the value of contracts in our wholly-owned projects up 25% and the value of contracts in our City Living joint ventured projects up as well.\n“We saw a significant acceleration in contracts per community this quarter compared to one year ago - an annualized pace of 24 sales per community up from 19 in last year’s first quarter. Even so, we have yet to reach historical norms of annualized sales paces in the high 20’s.\n“As previously guided, we had an expected dip in community count in the first quarter, which will continue in the second quarter. This should reverse itself in the back half of the fiscal year, which should translate to community count growth at the end of FY 2018, compared to FYE 2017.\n“Based on our great brand, strong first-quarter backlog, healthy demand and our well-located land positions for future expansion, we believe FY 2018 will be another year of growth for Toll Brothers.\n“The quality of our homes and our brand were recently recognized by a number of business and industry leaders. In January, we were named by Fortune Magazine as World’s Most Admired Home Building Company for the fourth consecutive year. Toll Brothers homes, communities, design studios, and teams across the country were also recently recognized with 40 national awards by the National Association of Home Builders, Pacific Coast Builders Conference and others. This includes our Sullivan model at Adero Canyon in Arizona, which was named National Home of the Year at the PCBC Gold Nugget Awards. These honors reflect the tremendous effort and commitment to excellence of the entire Toll Brothers team, and our focus on providing our home buyers and renters with the highest levels of quality, value and service. We salute them and thank them for their amazing hard work.”\nMartin P. Connor, Toll Brothers’ chief financial officer, stated: “Tax reform had a positive impact on our first quarter results as the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability resulted in a $31.2 million one-time benefit. Including this benefit, we project our full fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate will drop to between 23% and 25%, from the estimate of 37% before tax reform. This lowered tax expense, coupled with continued strong operations, will contribute to an approximately 300 basis point improvement in our return on equity for FY 2018. And for the longer term, we project our effective annual tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% for FY 2019 and beyond.\n“We are monetizing some of the value we have created in our rental business as we generate profits by periodically refinancing or selectively selling assets once they have achieved stabilized occupancy. This first quarter, we completed the sale of our 1,500-bed student housing property within a joint venture at the University of Maryland, which generated a $30 million gain for Toll Brothers. As our pipeline of stabilized projects grows, we expect to continue to generate additional earnings from our Toll Brothers Apartment Living assets.”\nRobert I. Toll, executive chairman, stated: “The new home industry appears to be building momentum with the national home ownership rate rising over the past year. Wages are increasing, home equity is building, consumer confidence is strong, the economy is improving and demand for housing is accelerating. Meanwhile, the supply of new homes is in short supply as production lags demand in many markets. These trends indicate a positive landscape for the new home market, and particularly for Toll Brothers, in the coming years.”\nToll Brothers’ financial highlights for the FY 2018 first quarter ended January 31, 2018 (unaudited):\nFY 2018’s first-quarter net income of $132.1 million, or $0.83 per share diluted, increased 88% and 98%, respectively, compared to FY 2017’s first-quarter net income of $70.4 million, or $0.42 per share diluted. FY 2018’s tax expense was favorably impacted by a $31.2 million benefit associated with the revaluation of the net deferred tax liability under the tax reform’s lower tax rate.

The average price of net signed contracts was $927,800, compared to $816,700 in FY 2017’s first quarter, driven by strong contract results in California.\nOn a per-community basis, FY 2018’s first-quarter net signed contracts were 5.97 units per community, compared to first-quarter totals of 4.73 in FY 2017, 4.34 in FY 2016, 4.09 in FY 2015, and 3.95 in FY 2014.

Other income and Income from unconsolidated entities in FY 2018’s first quarter totaled $47.9 million, compared to $59.1 million in FY 2017’s same quarter.\nFY 2018’s first-quarter cancellation rate (current-quarter cancellations divided by current-quarter signed contracts) was 5.3%, compared to 5.8%, in FY 2017’s first quarter. As a percentage of beginning-quarter backlog, FY 2018’s first-quarter cancellation rate was 1.7%, compared to 2.0% in FY 2017’s first quarter. The Company ended its FY 2018 first quarter with $508.3 million in cash, compared to $712.8 million in cash at FYE 2017, and $373.5 million in cash at FY 2017’s first-quarter end. At FY 2018’s first-quarter end, the Company also had $1.15 billion available under its $1.295 billion, 20-bank credit facility, which matures in May 2021 .\nDuring the first quarter of FY 2018, the Company has repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $47.43, for a total purchase price of $210.0 million. Since the start of the second quarter of FY 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $46.07, for a total purchase price of $65.3 million. In January, the Company issued $400 million of 4.35% Senior Notes due 2028. This was the lowest interest rate the Company has paid on a 10-year bond.\nThe Company’s Stockholders’ Equity at FY 2018’s first-quarter end was $4.46 billion, compared to $4.32 billion at FY 2017’s first-quarter end .\nThe Company ended its FY 2018 first quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 44.2%, compared to 41.5% at FYE 2017 and 45.7% at FY 2017’s first-quarter end. The Company ended FY 2018’s first quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio (1) of 40.1%, compared to 34.5% at FYE 2017, and 42.6% at FY 2017’s first-quarter end.\nThe Company ended FY 2018’s first quarter with approximately 49,500 lots owned and optioned, compared to 48,300 one quarter earlier, and 47,800 one year earlier. Approximately 32,100 of these 49,500 lots were owned, of which approximately 17,600 lots, including those in backlog, were substantially improved.\nIn the first quarter of FY 2018, the Company purchased 2,109 lots for $326.6 million. The Company ended FY 2018’s first quarter with 295 selling communities, compared to 305 at FYE 2017 and 321 at FY 2017’s first-quarter end. Based on FY 2018’s first-quarter-end backlog and the pace of activity at its communities, the Company now estimates it will deliver between 7,800 and 8,600 homes in FY 2018, compared to previous guidance of 7,700 and 8,700 units. It now believes the average delivered price for FY 2018 will be between $820,000 and $860,000 per home. This translates to projected revenues of between $6.40 billion and $7.40 billion in FY 2018, compared to $5.82 billion in FY 2017. The Company expects its FY 2018 tax rate to be between 23% and 25%.\nThe Company reaffirms its previous guidance for full FY 2018 Adjusted Gross Margin of between 23.75% and 24.25%, SG&A as a percentage of revenues of approximately 10.0% and Other income and Income from unconsolidated entities of between $130 million and $170 million.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies in the homebuilding business.\nThe Company’s management considers these non-GAAP financial measures as we make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance, including against other homebuilders that may use similar non-GAAP financial measures. The Company’s management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in understanding our operations and leverage and may be helpful in comparing the Company to other homebuilders to the extent they provide similar information.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s gross margin as a percentage of revenues (calculated in accordance with GAAP) to the Company’s Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP financial measure). Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated as (i) gross margin plus interest recognized in cost of sales plus inventory write-downs divided by (ii) revenues.\nAdjusted Gross Margin Reconciliation (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) Three Months Ended\nJanuary 31, 2018 2017 Revenues $ 1,175,468 $ 920,730 Cost of revenues 934,480 733,002 Gross margin 240,988 187,728 Add: Interest recognized in cost of sales 33,885 27,928 Inventory write-downs 3,853 4,661 Adjusted gross margin $ 278,726 $ 220,317 Gross margin as a percentage of revenues 20.5 % 20.4 % Adjusted Gross Margin 23.7 % 23.9 % The Company’s management believes Adjusted Gross Margin is a useful financial measure to investors because it allows them to evaluate the performance of our homebuilding operations without the often varying effects of capitalized interest costs and inventory impairments. The use of Adjusted Gross Margin also assists the Company’s management in assessing the profitability of our homebuilding operations and making strategic decisions regarding community location and product mix.\nForward-looking Adjusted Gross Margin\nThe Company has not provided projected second quarter and full year fiscal 2018 gross margin or a GAAP reconciliation for forward-looking Adjusted Gross Margin because such measure cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis, since inventory write-downs are based on future activity and observation and therefore cannot be projected for the second quarter or the full fiscal year. The variability of these charges may have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our second quarter and full year fiscal 2018 gross margin.\nNet Debt-to-Capital Ratio\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s ratio of debt to capital (calculated in accordance with GAAP) to the Company’s net debt-to-capital ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure). The net debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as (i) total debt minus mortgage warehouse loans minus cash and cash equivalents divided by (ii) total debt minus mortgage warehouse loans minus cash and cash equivalents plus stockholders’ equity.\nNet Debt-to-Capital Ratio Reconciliation (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 October 31, 2017 Loans payable $ 631,791 $ 879,894 $ 637,416 Senior notes 2,859,689 2,695,524 2,462,463 Mortgage company loan facility 38,344 57,040 120,145 Total debt 3,529,824 3,632,458 3,220,024 Total stockholders' equity 4,458,994 4,315,114 4,531,194 Total capital $ 7,988,818 $ 7,947,572 $ 7,751,218 Ratio of debt-to-capital 44.2 % 45.7 % 41.5 % Total debt $ 3,529,824 $ 3,632,458 $ 3,220,024 Less: Mortgage company loan facility (38,344 ) (57,040 ) (120,145 ) Cash and cash equivalents (508,277 ) (373,469 ) (712,829 ) Total net debt 2,983,203 3,201,949 2,387,050 Total stockholders' equity 4,458,994 4,315,114 4,531,194 Total net capital $ 7,442,197 $ 7,517,063 $ 6,918,244 Net debt-to-capital ratio 40.1 % 42.6 % 34.5 % The Company’s management uses the net debt-to-capital ratio as an indicator of its overall leverage and believes it is a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in the Company’s operations.\nCONTACT:\nFrederick N.
