    "text": "HONG KONG, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd shares jumped as much as 8.8 percent after its chairman Li Shufu said he had built up a near 10 percent stake in Germany’s Daimler - a $9 billion bet that he can access the Mercedes-Benz owner’s technology.\nThe stock surged as high as to HK$26 in early trade, its highest level since Jan. 24. That compared with a 0.8 percent rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.\nLi is expected to meet Daimler executives in Stuttgart on Monday, a source familiar with the matter has said, and hopes to meet top German government officials in Berlin.
