    "text": "LATROBE, Pa., Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Commercial National Financial Corporation (OTCQX: CNAF), parent company of Commercial Bank & Trust of PA, has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share payable March 9 to shareholders of record as of March 2.\nDirect and beneficial ownership by executive officers and directors of the Company's outstanding shares totaled 700,192 shares, or 24.47% on December 31, 2017.\nAs disclosed each year in the Annual Report to Shareholders, on December 31, 2017, the Company employed 99 people in full-time and part-time positions. Forty-seven (47) employees are represented by the United Auto Workers, Local 1799. Of that bargaining unit total, Thirty-five (35) employees are full-time and twelve (12) employees are part-time. The Company has had unionized employees since 1972. In 2013, the Company and the bargaining unit entered into a labor agreement that will expire in February 2019. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the National Labor Relations Board both afford protection to the organized status of pre-existing collective bargaining units. The Company has been advised that bargaining unit status may limit the Company's strategic options relative to those of non-unionized insured depository institutions. The Company continues to consider this as a factor in its strategic and capital management decisions.\nThe Company operates nine community banking facilities in Greensburg, Hempfield Township, Latrobe, Ligonier, North Huntingdon, Unity Township and West Newton, Pennsylvania and also maintains a commercial business development sales force throughout its entire market area. The company operates an asset management & trust division headquartered in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. Commercial Bank & Trust of PA also serves its customer base from an Internet banking site ( www.cbthebank.com ) and an automated TouchTone Teller banking system.\nForward Looking Statements\nAny statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.
