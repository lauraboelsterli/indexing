    "text": "SHENZHEN, China, Xunlei Limited (“Xunlei” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:XNET), a leading cloud-based acceleration technology company in China, today provided the following update on the previously announced outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Company expects total revenue to be between US$80 million and US$$88 million, or about 103% to 123% increase from the same period last year, and 69% to 86% increase from the previous quarter. On November 16, 2017, the Company announced that it had expected total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 to be between US$55 million and US$60 million.\nThe Company expects to release its unaudited fourth quarter and full year 2017 results in the third week of March 2018.\nMr. Lei Chen, Chief Executive Officer of Xunlei, commented “we expect to exceed our previously announced revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company expects to report revenue from our internet value-added services between US$34 million and US$42 million, up approximately 467% to 600% from the same period of last year. The Company also expects to report increased revenue from our subscription and advertising product lines sequentially as well. I am very pleased that our products and services were well received.”\nAbout Xunlei\nXunlei Limited (\"Xunlei\") is a leading cloud-based acceleration technology company in China. Xunlei operates a powerful internet platform in China based on cloud computing to provide users with quick and easy access to digital media content through its core products and services, Xunlei Accelerator and the cloud acceleration subscription services.

These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates\" and similar statements. Among other things, the management's quotations, the \"Outlook\" and \"Guidance\" sections in this press release, as well as the Company's strategic, operational and acquisition plans, contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company and the industry. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: the Company's ability to continue to innovate and provide attractive products and services to retain and grow its user base; the Company's ability to keep up with technological developments and users' changing demands in the internet industry; the Company's ability to convert its users into subscribers of its premium services; the Company's ability to deal with existing and potential copyright infringement claims and other related claims; the Company’s ability to react to the governmental actions for its scrutiny of internet content in China and the Company's ability to compete effectively. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot assure you that its expectations will turn out to be correct, and investors are cautioned that actual results may differ materially from the anticipated results. Further information regarding risks and uncertainties faced by the Company is included in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All information provided in this press release is as of the date of the press release, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent occurring events or circumstances, or changes in its expectations, except as may be required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Xunlei's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), Xunlei uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission: (1) non-GAAP operating income/(loss), (2) non-GAAP net income/(loss) from continuing operations, (3) non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share for common shares attributable to continuing operations, and (4) non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS attributable to continuing operations. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nXunlei believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding the Company’s operating performance by excluding share-based compensation expenses, which is not expected to result in future cash payments. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Xunlei's historical performance and assist the Company’s financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charge that has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Xunlei’s results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying reconciliation tables at the end of this release include details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has presented\nCONTACT: IR Contact:\nXunlei Limited\nEmail: ir@xunlei.com\nTel: +86 755 8633 8443\nWebsite: http://ir.xunlei.com\nSource:Xunlei Limited",
