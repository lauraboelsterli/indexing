    "text": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The National Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, (NH-ISAC), a member-owned non-profit that is the health and public health (HPH) sector’s trusted community for sharing cyber and physical security information, is pleased to announce it has merged with SAFE-BioPharma Association as of January 1, 2018.\nSince the healthcare industry continues to be a lucrative target for cybercriminals and most healthcare organizations rely heavily on electronic transactions over the internet, there is a strong need to trust the cyber identity of each person with whom they do business.\nSAFE-BioPharma Association was established to provide global, high-assurance identity trust for cyber-transactions in the biopharmaceutical industry. The SAFE-BioPharma® digital identity and signature standards were crafted to mitigate risk associated with electronic transactions by protecting intellectual property and patient data using secure, enforceable, and regulatory compliant mechanisms. A single SAFE-BioPharma-certified credential can be used and trusted within multiple platforms across the healthcare sector and is recognized by all U.S. Government agencies and the European Union.\n\"Weak identity trust – hijacked user names and passwords – is the major cause of health care breaches. Identity credentials that comply with SAFE-BioPharma standards require use of two-factor authentication, which proves with greater certainty the user's actual identity,\" explained Terrence Rice, Chairman, SAFE-BioPharma Association and VP, IT Risk Management and CISO, Merck & Co.\n“With the retirement of Mollie Shields-Uehling, SAFE-BioPharma’s President and CEO and the strength of NH-ISAC’s diverse, global membership and initiatives already underway in the identity and access management (IAM) space, merging the efforts of the two organizations made complete sense,” says NH-ISAC’s President, Denise Anderson. “We aim to broaden the reach of IAM across the healthcare community so that the entire sector will benefit.”\nSAFE-BioPharma Identity and Access Management services will be available to NH-ISAC members through NH-ISAC’s CYBERFIT® suite of services.\nFor more information on NH-ISAC and its services, visit https://nhisac.org/ .\nABOUT NH-ISAC – National Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center ,\n(NH-ISAC), is a global, non-profit, member-driven organization offering healthcare stakeholders a trusted community and forum for coordinating, collaborating and sharing vital Physical and Cyber Threat Intelligence and best practices with each other. Members use this information to extend their security operations team and to create situational awareness, inform risk-based decision-making and mitigate against threats. Membership is open to private & public hospitals, ambulatory providers, health insurance payers, pharmaceutical/biotech manufacturers, laboratory, diagnostic, medical device manufacturers, medical schools, medical R&D organizations and other relevant health care stakeholders. Joining NH-ISAC is one of the best ways health care and public health firms can actively participate to protect the industry and its vital role in critical infrastructure.
