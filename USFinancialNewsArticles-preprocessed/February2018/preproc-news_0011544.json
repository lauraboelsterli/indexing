The Bank was originally founded in 2002 by business and professional individuals who envisioned a truly local bank to serve the financial needs of the community.\nIn 2008, during the midst of the U.S. banking crisis, the bank was recapitalized by a group of forward-thinking, locally-based business people to provide local businesses, municipalities, non-profits, and consumers with high quality banking products combined with old-fashioned personal service which, due to the crisis, was severely lacking in the Hudson Valley Region. Today, in a little over 15 years from its humble beginnings, Greater Hudson Bank has grown to 6 branches, over 70 employees, and approximately $500 million in assets.\nGreater Hudson Bank is recognized throughout the industry for its financial strength and quality, but what truly distinguishes the Bank is its personalized service and long-term relationships with its customers. Greater Hudson Bank strives to be the preeminent bank for businesses, municipalities and non-profits and remains committed to remaining independent.\nAbout VirtualInvestorConferences.com\nSince 2010, VirtualInvestorConferences.com , created by BetterInvesting (NAIC) and PRNewswire , has been the only monthly virtual investor conference series that provides an interactive forum for presenting companies to meet directly with investors using a graphically-enhanced online platform.\nDesigned to replicate the look and feel of location-based investor conferences, Virtual Investor Conferences unites PR Newswire's leading-edge online conferencing and investor communications capabilities with BetterInvesting's extensive retail investor audience network.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/greater-hudson-bank-to-webcast-live-at-virtualinvestorconferencescom-february-8-300593215.html\nSOURCE Greater Hudson Bank",
