    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland Group ( RBS.L ) said on Friday it paid women on average 37 percent less than men, the latest big bank to disclose how a concentration of males in senior roles skews pay in the financial industry.\nThe disclosure means the average hourly wage for a woman at the bank was 37 percent less, largely as a result of men occupying more senior, higher-paying roles.\nRBS said women held 37 percent of jobs in its top three layers of management, and the bank is on track to have a fully balanced workforce at all levels by 2030.\nRBS is the latest bank to disclose a wide gender pay gap, after Barclays ( BARC.L ) on Thursday said women in its international division on average earn half of what men do, drawing criticism from lawmakers.\nRBS reported its first profit in a decade on Friday, and cut pay for its Chief Executive Ross McEwan by 6 percent for failing to hit targets on improving customersâ€™ trust in the bank.\nOther organizations to have made such disclosures include U.S. investment banks like Citigroup ( C.N ), Wells Fargo ( WFC.N ) and Bank of America ( BAC.N ), as well as the Bank of England.\nOther major British lenders Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) said this week they will publish their pay gaps before the April deadline.\nReporting by Lawrence White; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ",
