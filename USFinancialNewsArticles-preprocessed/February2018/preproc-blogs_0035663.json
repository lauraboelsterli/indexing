A little over four years after his prior firm, SAC Capital Advisors, pleaded guilty to criminal insider trading, Cohen’s representatives have recently been in discussions with potential investors about raising a new multibillion-dollar hedge fund, according to people close to the firm. \nBy Rob Copeland \nA female employee at Steven A. Cohen’s private investment firm filed a discrimination lawsuit Monday, alleging unfair pay practices and a pervasively sexist work environment. \nLauren Bonner, an internal recruiter at Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, accused the firm of paying her as much as two-thirds less than her male counterparts. Bonner was slated to earn $450,000 last year, including a bonus, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan. \nBonner also alleged a string of day-to-day offenses suffered while working at Point72, including being forced to gather several times in a room where Point72’s president, Douglas Haynes, had allegedly written “PUSSY” on a whiteboard. Separately, Bonner alleged that another top Point72 executive, who wasn’t named as a defendant in the lawsuit, said there were “no girls allowed” in certain meetings. \nThe lawsuit asks for unspecified damages and a jury trial. \nA spokesman for Point72 and Cohen said in a statement: “The firm emphatically denies these allegations and will defend itself in a more appropriate venue than the media. We stand by our record of hiring and developing women.”",
