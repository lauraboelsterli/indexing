    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. (“Tactile Medical”) (Nasdaq:TCMD), a medical technology company focused on developing medical devices for the treatment of chronic diseases at home, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFull Year 2017 Summary:\nFull year 2017 revenues increased 29% year-over-year, to $109.3 million, compared to $84.5 million in 2016. Flexitouch revenues increased 37% year-over-year, to $100.3 million, compared to $73.4 million in 2016. Operating income of $3.9 million, compared to operating income of $4.3 million in 2016. Net income of $5.9 million, compared to net income of $2.9 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA of $9.9 million compared to $7.0 million in 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Summary:\nFourth quarter revenues increased 23% year-over-year, to $34.9 million, compared to $28.5 million in fourth quarter 2016. Flexitouch revenues increased 28% year-over-year, to $32.4 million, compared to $25.4 million in fourth quarter 2016. Operating income of $4.9 million, compared to operating income of $3.3 million in fourth quarter 2016. Net income of $2.2 million, compared to net income of $2.4 million in fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million compared to $4.4 million in fourth quarter 2016. On December 7, 2017 the Company announced the publication of a functional use study in the medical journal “Head & Neck” that assessed the Company’s Flexitouch system for the treatment of lymphedema of the head and neck. Researchers concluded that Flexitouch is safe, easy to use, and well tolerated, while demonstrating edema reduction after a single 32 minute treatment session.\n“2017 was a year of exceptional performance, driven by record sales of our Flexitouch system,” said Gerald R. Mattys, Chief Executive Officer of Tactile Medical. “Our Flexitouch sales throughout 2017 – and in the fourth quarter – reflected the Company’s strong execution on our primary growth drivers: field sales team expansion, focused account targeting and increased in-network coverage with payers. Our growth was also fueled by increased market awareness of chronic swelling conditions and how Tactile Medical’s innovative continuity of care, service and support can improve outcomes, reduce costs and significantly improve quality of life for patients.”\nMr. Mattys continued, “We expect continued progress in expanding our sales team and increasing awareness to result in strong growth and improving profitability in 2018. Specifically, our 2018 outlook calls for total revenue growth this year in a range of 20% - 22%. Additionally, we remain committed to leveraging the strong top-line growth into improved profitability again this year. The long-term growth opportunities for Tactile Medical remain very compelling, and our entire organization is focused on our mission to help people suffering from chronic diseases live better and care for themselves at home.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $6.4 million, or 23%, to $34.9 million, compared to $28.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues was attributable to an increase of $7.0 million, or 28%, in sales of the Flexitouch system, which was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $0.6 million, or 19%, in sales of the Entre and Actitouch systems. The increase in Flexitouch system sales was largely driven by expansion of the Company’s sales force, increased physician and patient awareness of the treatment options for lymphedema, and increased contractual coverage with national and regional insurance payers.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $5.1 million, or 24%, to $26.1 million, compared to $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin was 74.7% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 73.6% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $3.5 million, or 20%, to $21.1 million, compared to $17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by an increase of $2.7 million, or 28% year-over-year, in sales and marketing expenses due to continued investment in field sales team expansion. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was also impacted by a $0.5 million, or 8% year-over-year, increase in reimbursement, general and administrative expenses and a $0.2 million, or 17% year-over-year, increase in research and development expenses.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $1.6 million, or 50%, to $4.9 million, compared to $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPre-tax income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $1.7 million, or 52%, to $5.0 million, compared to $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.8 million, compared to income tax expense of $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 income tax expense included approximately $1.2 million of incremental expense associated with revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $0.1 million, or 6%, to $2.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $2.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Weighted average shares used to compute diluted net income per share were 19.1 million and 18.7 million for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased approximately $2.4 million, or 53%, to $6.8 million, compared to $4.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues for the full year 2017 increased $24.7 million, or 29%, to $109.3 million, compared to $84.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues was driven by an increase of approximately $26.9 million, or 37%, year-over-year in sales of the Flexitouch system, which was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $2.2 million, or 20%, year-over-year in sales of the Entre and Actitouch systems, compared to 2016.\nNet income for 2017 increased $3.0 million, to $5.9 million, compared to net income of approximately $2.9 million for 2016. Net income attributable to common stockholders for 2017 was $5.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to a net income attributable to common stockholders of $1.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for 2016. Net income attributable to common stockholders for 2016 included the accrual of convertible preferred stock dividends of $1.2 million, which did not occur in 2017. Weighted average shares used to compute diluted net income per share were 18.9 million and 10.8 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2017 increased approximately $2.9 million, or 42%, to $9.9 million, compared to $7.0 million for 2016.\nCash Position\nAt December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $43.9 million, compared to $41.7 million at December 31, 2016. The Company had no debt outstanding at December 31, 2017.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nFor 2018, the Company expects revenues in the range of $131 million to $133 million, representing growth of 20% to 22% year-over-year, compared to revenues of $109.3 million in 2017.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 26 to discuss the results of the quarter and the year with a question and answer session.

Adjusted EBITDA in this release represents net income less interest income, net, and income tax expense, plus income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because the Company believes it is a useful indicator of its operating performance. Management uses the measure principally as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s annual operating budget and financial projections. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors as supplemental information because it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in its industry. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to its management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to, or superior to, net income or loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed to imply that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, the measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on the Company’s GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. The Company’s definition of this measure is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nThe following table contains a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income.\nTactile Systems Technology, Inc.
