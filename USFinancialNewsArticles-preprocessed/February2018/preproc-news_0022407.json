    "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aytu BioScience, Inc. (NASDAQ: AYTU), a specialty life sciences company focused on global commercialization of novel products in the field of urology, today provided an overview of its business, including the Company's operational and financial results for its fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Company will host a live conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. ET. Conference call details are provided at the end of this press release.\n\"I am pleased to report Aytu's second quarter results, which reflect strong unit sales growth and cost management. Natesto prescriptions increased 23% over our first quarter of this fiscal year to 2,501, which is up 317% over the same quarter last year, while at the same time we reduced our sequential quarter cash burn,\" commented Josh Disbrow, Chief Executive Officer of Aytu BioScience.\nMr. Disbrow continued, \"While we are satisfied with Natesto unit sales growth, and cash management, our dollar net sales figure is temporarily not at the same growth rate as unit sales. The reason for the temporary disparity is due to discounting and coupon incentives which are used to increase sales to first time Natesto patients. However, we expect to be able to accelerate growth and reduce the level of discounting we have experienced with three targeted strategic actions. The first action is to roll out our recently piloted Natesto Support Program, which allows us to capture more prescription reimbursement, yielding more revenue for each new prescription. The Natesto Support Program is also expected to lead to a higher refill rate on new prescriptions. Second, we are pursuing third party payers to more broadly cover Natesto, and third, we are continuing to invest in increasing the body of clinical evidence supporting Natesto's distinct efficacy and safety profile.\"\nMr. Disbrow concluded, \"During the quarter we also had a number of additional operational highlights. First, we continued to grow our business internationally for our MiOXSYS male infertility device, now sold in 36 countries worldwide. Second, we uplisted to NASDAQ, expanding our reach into the investment community. Additionally, we announced the appointment of David Green as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Green is a highly accomplished CFO, who brings an extensive array of financial, accounting, and operational experience to Aytu, including a background at both public and private life sciences companies over his twenty-five-year career. There was also some recent news that further cemented barriers to entry in the nearly $2 billion U.S. testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) market that Natesto addresses. Taken as a whole, the second quarter reinforced that Aytu has very strong momentum with a well-positioned product portfolio and the personnel to maximize shareholder value.\"\nQ2 2018 Operational Highlights\nRecognized $1.05 million in total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, representing a 32% increase over Q2 fiscal 2017 Listed the Company's common shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market, on which trading of shares under the ticker symbol \"AYTU\" began October 20, 2017 Increased Natesto prescription demand to 2,501 total prescriptions, representing a 317% increase over Q2 fiscal 2017 Increased Natesto unit sales to wholesalers to over 7,100, representing a 397% increase over Q2 fiscal 2017's pull-through demand levels Increased the number of Natesto prescribers across the U.S. to 1,178, which represents a 174% increase over Q2 fiscal 2017 Increased the number of MiOXSYS System placements globally to 38 since the beginning of fiscal 2018 through the Company's distribution partners, representing an increase of 73% over the same period last year\nQ2 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2018 was $1,050,000 compared to revenue of $794,000 for the same period last year, an increase of 32%. Natesto and MiOXSYS comprised the majority of sales in the second quarter of 2018. Product sales in the same quarter of 2017 were mostly comprised of ProstaScint and Primsol, a product that was divested in late fiscal 2017.\nOperating expenses for the second quarter of 2018 were $5,045,000, which was in line with the same quarter last year.\nCash used in operations for the quarter was $3,101,000, down 26% from the first quarter of 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $4,000,000 as of December 31, 2017.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a live conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today.
