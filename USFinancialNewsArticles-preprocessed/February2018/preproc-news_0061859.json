    "text": "ONTARIO, Calif., Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of Ajinomoto Co., Inc.'s Global Brand Initiatives, Ajinomoto Windsor, Inc. is changing its name to Ajinomoto Foods North America, Inc. to create brand consistency across North America. The company's rebranding structure will utilize the new Ajinomoto Global Brand logo - setting the stage for global consistency and a unified management.\nAjinomoto affiliates across North America are introducing a new company naming structure for each of their businesses to provide company continuity, including an easier way to understand each of their businesses, and to create a unified concept with each company name. The company naming structure will consist of \"Ajinomoto + Business Field + North America.\" Ajinomoto's three companies in North America are changing their names effective April 1, 2018 as follows:\nAjinomoto Windsor, Inc. will change to Ajinomoto Foods North America, Inc. Ajinomoto North America, Inc. will change to Ajinomoto Health & Nutrition North America, Inc. Ajinomoto Heartland, Inc. will change to Ajinomoto Animal Nutrition North America, Inc.\n\"Our new name will help distinguish Ajinomoto Foods North America as one of the leading high-quality seasonings and foods companies in the United States, Canada and Mexico,\" said Bernard Kreilmann, President and CEO of the newly named Ajinomoto Foods North America, Inc. \"The new company branding structure in North America will support Ajinomoto's Global Brand Logo and its efforts to become a global top 10 food company.\"\nThe Ajinomoto Global Brand Logo will enhance the corporate brand globally as well as ensure global consistency across all business activities and brands. The new logo goes \"beyond language\" with a friendly design that incorporates not only the history of the company but also the creative visions, goals, growth, and development of the Ajinomoto Group.\nThe meaning of \"Ajinomoto\" is the \"Essence of Umami,\" which has evolved from its literal meaning, the \"Essence of Taste.\" Now this brand logo is changing to not only include the history of the brand but to establish a memorable mark that is friendly for people worldwide and that has improved visibility.\nThe infinity \"A\": The \"A\" incorporates the infinity symbol and represents the \"A\" of taste (\"Aji\") and amino acids. The \"A\" also incorporates three ambitions:\nTo pursue, master and popularize taste (\"Aji\") To drive the evolution and develop the value of amino acids with leading-edge bioscience and fine chemical technologies To promote global sustainability\nThe line from \"A\" to \"j\": The \"j\" represents a person, signifying people joining together and finding joy in cooking, eating and comfortable lifestyles enriched by taste (\"Aji\") and amino acids.\nThe line from the bottom of \"j\" extending upward to the right: This line expresses the future growth and development of the Ajinomoto Group.\nThe new global brand has been rolled out in phases, beginning in October 2017, with the new logo being used on Ajinomoto Co.'s global press releases and website. As of November 2017, the logo was implemented in business applications such as name cards and stationery. In January 2018, the new logo was implemented for all points of consumer contact, including product packaging, corporate advertising, television commercials, sales promotions, and internet communication.\nAbout Ajinomoto Windsor/Ajinomoto Foods North America\nAjinomoto Foods North America is a leading company in the frozen food industry, creating meaningful food experiences through high quality ingredients and innovative technologies.
