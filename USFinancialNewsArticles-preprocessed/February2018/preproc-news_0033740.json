    "text": "Movie theater ticket sales hit a 20-year low in 2017, but one rapidly growing subscription service is trying to get more people into theaters by cutting its already low prices – and expanding into new ventures.\nMoviePass , which launched in 2011 and now boasts more than two million subscribers, allows users to see one film in theaters every day for a flat monthly price. Membership has skyrocketed since Mitch Lowe took over as CEO this past June and slashed fees from $30 a month to $9.95. In just two days after the fee reduction, sign-ups shot up by 150,000.\nNow the company is cutting prices even more. This week MoviePass reduced subscription fees by 20% to $7.95 per month. Coupled with the growing number of cinemas that accept the card – currently 91% of U.S. theaters – subscriptions are set to keep growing.\nBut even with subscriber growth on the rise, MoviePass reimburses most cinemas in full for each ticket (except for a few that offer them a 20 percent discount). In many high-priced markets such as New York and San Francisco, tickets cost much more than their $7.95 monthly fee.\nSo, how does the company break even?\nshow chapters ",
