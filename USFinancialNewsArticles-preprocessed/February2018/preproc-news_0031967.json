    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of Infinity Property and Casualty Corp. (\"IPCC\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: IPCC) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Kemper Corporation (\"KMPR\") (NYSE: KMPR). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $51.60 in cash and 1.2019 shares of KMPR for each share of IPCC they own. This represents consideration of $119.38 per IPCC share, based on KMPR's February 13 trading price of $56.40.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether IPCC's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, according to KMPR's President and CEO,\"[ t]his [is a] compelling transaction [that]combines two well-known brands with complementary strengths and cultures to form a leader in nonstandard auto insurance, and enhances [KMPR]'s overall growth opportunities, diversification, financial strength, and ability to serve policyholders.\" KMPR expects the acquisition of IPCC to broaden its product offerings and capabilities, and enhance its financial position.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether IPCC's shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects. If you own IPCC shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/infinity-property-and-casualty-corp/\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-infinity-property-and-casualty-corp-acquisition-may-not-be-in-the-best-interests-of-ipcc-shareholders-300598968.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP",
