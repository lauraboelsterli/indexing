    "text": "4 COMMENTS Michael Auslin is right to point out in “ China Humiliates Another Western Company ” (op-ed, Feb. 21) that “engagement is a two-way street,” yet there is no sign that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is willing to accommodate this basic truth. Clearly, all these years of engagement have not worked. Beijing is increasingly using its economic leverage to coerce Western companies into kowtowing to its directives, even at the expense of democratic principles.\nIt is bad enough that these companies fail to question whether China’s so-called sovereignty and territorial integrity are Beijing’s to define, but they go the extra mile and apologize to the authoritarian government using terminology that is suspiciously similar to what the propaganda departments of the PRC government use.\nTaiwan is not now, nor has it ever been, part of the PRC. This simple fact, however, doesn’t seem to matter when companies want to make nice with the Chinese communists. It is the same with the Dalai Lama. Even an innocuous inspirational Quote: from the widely revered spiritual leader—on a website banned in China no less—can cause such great offense that Mercedes-Benz feels the need to show subservience to the authorities in Beijing.\nChina’s imperialistic behavior is prompting Western corporations to subjugate themselves and impose self-censorship, not unlike what the Chinese are doing on Western campuses. Lamenting the erosion of democracy and freedom of expression is not enough. It is time to show some backbone.\nBrian Su\nTaipei Economic and Cultural Office New York\nRegarding Mr. Auslin’s call for Western companies to resist compromising their values to maintain favor with China and access to its markets, one may ask: Why? After all, if Pope Francis is going to let China select bishops for the Holy See, then why not let it also dictate policy to the Fortune 500?\nBrian Daley\nChicago\nThe profit motive is moral, beneficial and self-sustaining only within and between free-market democratic societies. When free-market capitalism meets an authoritarian state-led system, it stands no chance. Western companies will continue pursuing profit in any setting, adjusting to whatever rules are applied to them. That is why Boeing is happily selling jet fighters to the U.S. government and is just as happily selling its commercial jets to Iran.\nDuring the Cold War the profit motive ran into a barrier set by Western governments. After we let the Chinese and the Russians into the tent of free-market capitalism, the game changed. While the Western companies pursue the profit motive, the Chinese and Russian governments are using it in pursuit of their hegemonic ambitions. You can’t blame the Western companies. That’s a role for government. Until there is more recognition of the problem and a resolve to fix it, we will continue selling the hangman’s rope to authoritarian communist China.\nJago Blitshteyn\nEugene, Ore.",
