    "text": "February 13, 2018 / 4:06 PM / in 23 minutes FBI followed protocol in Rob Porter background check: FBI's Wray Reuters Staff 1   FBI Director Christopher Wray said the FBI had followed protocol in performing background checks for security clearance in the case of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who resigned last week amid allegations of domestic abuse by two former wives. “I‘m quite confident that in this particular instance, the FBI followed established protocols,” Wray told the Senate intelligence panel, amid scrutiny of the White House over when it had learned about the allegations against Porter. Wray said a partial report on Porter was issued in March and a completed report in July. The FBI received a request for a follow-up inquiry and provided that in November and passed along additional information earlier this month.
