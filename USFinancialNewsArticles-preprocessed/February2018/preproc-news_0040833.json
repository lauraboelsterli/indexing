    "text": "Dan Loeb 's Third Point hedge fund took a 2 million share stake in Netflix in the fourth quarter of last year, according to a filing released Wednesday.\nLoeb's fund returned 18.1 percent last year, according to a letter obtained by CNBC , as other high-profile hedge-fund managers struggled.\nThe streaming stock becomes the ninth-largest equity long holding in the fund, according to InsiderScore.com, joining other technology names in the top ten holdings, such as Facebook, Alphabet and Alibaba.\nThe new holding gives Third Point a 0.46 percent stake in Netflix, based on the 433.948 million shares outstanding, according to FactSet.\nShares of Netflix rose mildly in after-hours trading, after climbing 2.99 percent during Wednesday's session and outperforming the S&P 500's 1.3 percent gain. The stock is up 39 percent this year.\nThe Netflix stake was disclosed as part of a required quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The information is at least 45 days old and may not reflect the fund's current holdings.",
