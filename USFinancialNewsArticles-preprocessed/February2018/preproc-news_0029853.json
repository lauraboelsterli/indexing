J.Paul Haynes, former eSentire CEO, will assume the role of president and COO, and remain responsible for operations and the technical direction of the company.\n“Kerry is a seasoned leader with extensive experience delivering high growth and creating value within the information security services industry. We are confident in his ability to take eSentire to the next level at this important time in the company’s growth trajectory,” said Cary J. Davis, managing director, Warburg Pincus, eSentire’s lead investor.\nA growth and change leader with over 28 years of executive experience in the information technology services sector, Bailey possesses unique executive experience that spans security, managed services, and cloud computing, from Fortune 50 to early stage growth companies. Most recently, Bailey served as SVP and GM of Cloud at Hewlett Packard (HP) and channel chief, where he led the growth of private, public, and hybrid clouds, and the worldwide indirect channel, respectively.\n“I’m excited to lead eSentire into this next phase,” said Bailey. “Just as cloud disrupted legacy IT, MDR is disrupting traditional security approaches, and this drew me to the company. While we’re ready to drive the advancement, expansion, and evolution of the MDR services market, one thing that won’t change is the level of service delivery our clients have grown accustomed to.”\nPrior to HP, Bailey held various senior executive roles at Verizon Enterprise, including CEO and president of Terremark, a Verizon company, and leader in global managed security services, data center colocation, and cloud. Earlier roles include CEO of Betrusted and Security Assurance Group, and various senior executive level positions at CyberTrust and the United States Intelligence Community (IC).\nA bout eSentire:\neSentire® is the largest pure-play Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service provider, keeping organizations safe from constantly evolving cyber-attacks that technology alone cannot prevent.
