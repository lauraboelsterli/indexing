    "text": "HONG KONG, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Chinese personal computer maker Lenovo Group reported a quarterly loss of $289 million on Thursday against a $98 million profit a year earlier, due mainly to a one-off charge of $400 million resulting from U.S. tax reform.\nRevenue for the three-month period ending December was $12.94 billion, compared with $12.17 billion a year ago.\nLenovo said its core PC and smart devices business group posted an 8 percent rise in revenue to $9.25 billion as sales exceeded shipments growth thanks to better average selling prices driven by innovative products and a better product mix.\nIts struggling mobile business - which the group had set a target to turn around by the end of the financial year in March - reported a narrower operating loss before taxation of $92 million, compared with a loss of $132 million in the preceding quarter.
