Just like video, audio is transitioning from a one-to-many broadcast experience to a one-to-one model with personalization at the core. Pandora’s scale, listener engagement and data position us well to capitalize on these trends,” said Roger Lynch, CEO of Pandora. “From launching on-demand for our ad-supported listeners to expanding multiple device partnerships in the last quarter alone, we’re building a strong foundation for audience growth and improved monetization. These efforts will enable us to strengthen business fundamentals and reinvigorate Pandora in 2018.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results & Highlights\nPremium Access: Pandora successfully launched Premium Access, which allows ad-supported listeners access to on-demand experiences including, for the first time, the ability to search, play and share songs, albums and playlists by viewing a short video ad. Premium Access also unlocks new rewards-based video inventory for advertisers.\nRevenue: For the fourth quarter of 2017, total consolidated revenue was $395.3 million, an approximate 7% year-over-year increase compared to the year-ago quarter, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Ticketfly. This included $297.7 million in advertising revenue and $97.7 million in subscription revenue. Revenue in the year-ago quarter, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Ticketfly was $370.5 million. We discontinued our service in Australia and New Zealand on July 31, 2017 and Ticketfly was sold to Eventbrite on September 1, 2017. Including Australia, New Zealand and Ticketfly, total consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $392.6 million.\nGAAP Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA: For the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP net loss was $44.7 million compared to a net loss of $90.0 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 million, compared to a loss of $30.4 million in the same quarter last year.\nCash and Investments: For the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company ended with $500.8 million in cash and investments, compared to $499.4 million at the end of the prior quarter.\nPartnerships: Expanded partnerships across Sonos, Comcast’s Xfinity X1, Android TV and Amazon Fire TV in the fourth quarter.\nListener Hours: Total listener hours were 5.03 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 5.38 billion for the same period of the prior year.\nActive Listeners: Active listeners were 74.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSubscribers: Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium subscribers were 5.48 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue: For the full year 2017, consolidated total revenue was $1.467 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase.

A combination of eliminated roles and other measures are expected to result in combined annualized savings of approximately $45 million to adjusted EBITDA. The savings will be reinvested into growth initiatives including ad-tech, non-music content, device integration and marketing technology, toward which the company will redeploy existing employees and hire for new positions.\nGuidance: Guidance will be discussed during the fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call: Pandora will host a conference call today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results with the investment community.

These forward-looking statements are based on Pandora's current assumptions, expectations and beliefs and involve substantial risks and uncertainties that may cause results, performance or achievement to materially differ from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: our operation in an emerging market and our relatively new and evolving business model; our ability to estimate revenue reserves; our ability to increase our listener base and listener hours; our ability to attract and retain advertisers; our ability to generate additional revenue on a cost-effective basis; competitive factors; our ability to continue operating under existing laws and licensing regimes; our ability to enter into and maintain commercially viable direct licenses with record labels for the right to reproduce and publicly perform sound recordings on our service; our ability to establish and maintain relationships with makers of mobile devices, consumer electronic products and automobiles; our ability to manage our growth and geographic expansion; our ability to continue to innovate and keep pace with changes in technology and our competitors; our ability to expand our operations to delivery of non-music content; our ability to protect our intellectual property; risks related to service interruptions or security breaches; and general economic conditions worldwide. Further information on these factors and other risks that may affect the business are included in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from time to time, including under the heading “Risk Factors” in our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.\nThe financial information contained should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, each as they may be amended from time to time. Our results of operations for the current period are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future periods.\nThese documents are available online from the SEC or on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.pandora.com . Information on our website is not part of this release. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to the Company, which assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the Company uses the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per common share, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP product development, non-GAAP sales and marketing and non-GAAP general and administrative. The presentation of this additional financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Management compensates for these limitations by reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures within our earnings releases.\nNon-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per common share, non-GAAP product development, non-GAAP sales and marketing and non-GAAP general and administrative differ from GAAP in that they exclude stock-based compensation expense, intangible amortization expense, amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances, goodwill impairment, contract termination fees, expense associated with the restructurings and loss on sales of subsidiaries. The income tax effects of non-GAAP pre-tax loss have been reflected in non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per common share.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, benefit from (provision for) income taxes, depreciation and intangible amortization expense, amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances, other expense, expense associated with the restructurings, goodwill impairment, contract termination fees and loss on sales of subsidiaries.\nStock-based Compensation Expense: consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and other awards under our equity incentive plans. Stock-based compensation is included in the following cost and expense line items of our GAAP presentation: cost of revenue—other, cost of revenue—ticketing service, product development, sales and marketing and general and administrative.\nAlthough stock-based compensation is an expense for the Company and is viewed as a form of compensation, management excludes stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP measures and adjusted EBITDA results for purposes of evaluating our continuing operating performance primarily because it is a non-cash expense not believed by management to be reflective of our core business, ongoing operating results or future outlook. In addition, the value of stock-based instruments is determined using formulas that incorporate variables, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes: consists of expense recognized related to U.S. and foreign income taxes. The Company considers its adjusted EBITDA results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing performance because it is not believed by management to be reflective of our core business, ongoing operating results or future outlook.\nDepreciation and Intangible Amortization Expense: consists of non-cash charges that can be affected by the timing and magnitude of business combinations and asset purchases. Depreciation and intangible amortization expense is included in the following cost and expense line items of our GAAP presentation: cost of revenue—other, cost of revenue—ticketing service, product development, sales and marketing and general and administrative. Depreciation and intangible amortization expense also consists of non-cash amortization of non-recoupable amounts paid in advance to the Company’s clients pursuant to ticketing agreements. Amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances is included in the sales and marketing line of our GAAP presentation. Management considers its operating results without intangible amortization expense and amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances when evaluating its ongoing non-GAAP performance and without depreciation, intangible amortization expense and amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances when evaluating its ongoing adjusted EBITDA performance because these charges are non-cash expenses that can be affected by the timing and magnitude of business combinations, asset purchases and new client agreements and may not be reflective of our core business, ongoing operating results or future outlook.\nOther Expense: consists primarily of interest expense related to our Convertible Senior Notes and our Credit Facility. The Company considers its adjusted EBITDA results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing performance because it is not believed by management to be reflective of our core business, ongoing operating results or future outlook.\nExpense Associated with the Restructurings: consists of employee-related expense recognized in connection with the workforce reduction in the first quarter of 2017 and the restructuring in Australia and New Zealand. These costs are included in the following cost and expense line items of our GAAP presentation: cost of revenue—other, product development, sales and marketing and general and administrative. This also consists of professional fees recognized in connection with the reorganization of the Company in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are included in the general and administrative line item of our GAAP presentation. The Company considers its non-GAAP and adjusted EBITDA results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing performance because these charges are not believed by management to be reflective of our core business, ongoing operating results or future outlook.\nGoodwill Impairment: consists of impairment charges primarily related to the Ticketfly disposition. The impairment charge was calculated as the excess of the carrying amount of the Ticketfly segment over the agreed-upon purchase price less costs to sell. The Company considers its operating results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing non-GAAP and adjusted EBITDA results because these charges are not believed by management to be reflective of our core business, ongoing operating results or future outlook.\nContract Termination Fees: consists of termination and legal fees and benefits incurred in connection with the termination of the contractual commitment to sell redeemable convertible preferred stock to KKR Classic Investors L.P. The Company considers its operating results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing non-GAAP and adjusted EBITDA results because these charges are not believed by management to be reflective of our core business, ongoing operating results or future outlook.\nLoss on Sales of Subsidiaries: consists of loss on sales of subsidiaries recognized during the period, primarily related to the Ticketfly disposition. This amount was calculated as the decrease in the fair value less costs to sell for sales of our subsidiaries and was recorded as a loss on sale during the period. The Company considers its operating results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing non-GAAP and adjusted EBITDA results because these charges are not believed by management to be reflective of our core business, ongoing operating results or future outlook.\nIncome Tax Effects of Non-GAAP Pre-tax Loss: The Company adjusts non-GAAP pre-tax net loss by considering the income tax effects of its non-GAAP adjustments. The Company is currently forecasting a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 25% cumulatively for each quarter and the full year 2018. However, the Company is not expected to incur any material cash taxes due to its net operating loss position.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures and adjusted EBITDA serve as useful metrics for our management and investors because they enable a better understanding of the long-term performance of our core business and facilitate comparisons of our operating results over multiple periods and to those of peer companies, and when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and our reconciliations, enhance investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance.\nIn the financial tables below, the Company provides a reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP financial measure to the historical non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release.\nPandora Media, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nQuarter ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31,
