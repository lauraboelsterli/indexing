    "text": " 30 PM / Updated 42 minutes ago West Brom survival hopes recede after Huddersfield defeat Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - - Bottom club West Bromwich Albion’s hopes of Premier League survival suffered a hammer blow as Huddersfield Town earned a 2-1 victory to boost their own escape bid on Saturday. Slideshow (3 Images) Goals by Rajiv van la Parra and Steve Mounie early in the second half put Huddersfield in command and although Craig Dawson pulled a goal back for the hosts with a header they had given themselves too much to do. The defeat was West Brom’s fourth in a row in the league and left them seven points from safety. Huddersfield climbed to 14th spot with 30 points, three points above the relegation zone.
