    "text": "ROCHESTER, Minn., Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Fainsbert Mase Brown & Sussman, LLP (FMBS), a premiere Los Angeles law firm offering national services for real estate and business transactions, announced today the successful closing of the Industrial Realty Group, LLC (IRG) purchase of the 3.1 million sq. ft. IBM technology campus in Rochester, Minnesota.\nThe site is comprised of approximately 490 acres and 34 existing buildings, including office, manufacturing, warehouse, data center and laboratory space. IRG's plan for the site envisions a dynamic, mixed-use, multi-tenant campus, which will bring businesses and job opportunities to Rochester. Affirming its continued commitment to the Rochester area, IBM signed a long-term lease agreement for eight campus buildings.\n\"The legal team expertly navigated the intricacies of this complex transaction, ensuring the asset was smoothly incorporated into IRG's portfolio,\" said John A. Mase, Chief Executive Officer of IRG.\nThe complex transaction took more than a year to close because of the massive scale of the property, as well as negotiating with a multi-level, corporate legal team. The team of attorneys who completed the transaction for IRG was led by Jerry A. Brown, a partner, and supported by Amit S. Patel and James Cormie providing legal advice at all stages of the acquisition and financing.\nSince occupancy began in 1957, site employees have produced thousands of U.S. patents on behalf of IBM. The property was designed by Eero Saarinen, a 20th-century Finnish American architect known for also designing the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri.\nAbout Fainsbert Mase Brown & Sussman, LLP : Fainsbert Mase Brown & Sussman, LLP is a premier law firm dedicated to providing superior legal services to our clients on a nationwide basis.
