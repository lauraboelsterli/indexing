    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 1:02 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago NYSE-owner ICE's quarterly profit narrowly beats estimates Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Intercontinental Exchange Inc ( ICE.N ), which owns the New York Stock Exchange, reported a quarterly profit that narrowly beat analyst estimates on Wednesday, led by growth in its market data services unit and a tight leash on expenses. \nU.S. exchanges have been pivoting away from market-dependent services to insulate themselves from volatility swings, and have been moving into more stable businesses like data services, the demand for which has also substantially increased over the last couple of years. \nRevenue from ICE’s market data services unit, which publishes daily indexes and historical price data, rose 2 percent to $525 million. \nRevenue from ICE’s transaction and clearing business, its biggest, fell 7.3 percent to $758 million. \nNet income attributable to the company rose to $1.23 billion, or $2.08 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $352 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier. ( reut.rs/2sjee6K ) \nThe reported quarter included a $764 million gain related to deferred tax benefits, as part of the tax code overhaul. \nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned $433 million or 73 cents per share, above average analysts’ estimate of 72 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nICE said it expects adjusted expenses for full year 2018 to range between $2.00 billion and $2.05 billion as it plans to invest in the company and its employees. \nChief Financial Officer Scott Hill said on a post-earnings call that the company would invest $35 million to $40 million on its employees in 2018 and $30 million to $35 million to further strengthen its technological capabilities. \nDeutsche Bank analysts said in a note on Wednesday that ICE’s 2018 expense forecast is above their current estimates, which may pressure the stock. \nShares were down marginally at $71.82 in morning trading. \nTotal revenue, excluding transaction-based expenses, was flat at $1.14 billion, while total operating expenses fell 4.8 percent.
