And I'm going to do that by reducing regulation and reducing taxes.'\"\nDirck Halstead | Getty Images President Ronald Reagan campaigns in Orange County California during his 1984 re-election campaign. \"Ditto for President Trump,\" Cooperman said.\n\"[Reagan] said, 'I'm going to restore the lost prestige of the United States of America. And I'm going to do that by basically building out defense capability.,\" Cooperman recalled.\n\"Ditto for Trump,\" the hedge fund chief said.\n\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
