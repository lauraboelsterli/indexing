    "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday, according to sources, that Bezos' Amazon , Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Dimon's J.P. Morgan aim to cut out drug distributors like Amerisource, Cardinal Health and McKesson . \n\"Jeff Bezos believes he can lower the price of health care,\" Cramer said on \" Squawk on the Street. \" \"He can become even more dominant and really eviscerate some of the competitors.\" \n\"[Walgreens] may not be as smart as they think they are\" considering Amerisource, Cramer said. \"These companies are going to be squeezed by that [Bezos] venture and squeezed by others that have to compete.\" Getty Images (l) | CNBC (c-r) Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon. \nLate Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Walgreens approached Amerisource about buying the three-quarters of the firm it doesn't already own. Amerisource shares skyrocketed more than 25 percent after-hours Monday, and were up more than 8 percent late morning Tuesday. \nDespite being a possibly risky move for Walgreens, Cramer said it's a great time for Amerisource to sell itself. \n\"I would sell\" because Amazon \"wants to cut out the middleman,\" said Cramer, host of \" Mad Money .\" \nAmazon has made other attempts to enter the health-care industry. CNBC has previously reported the e-commerce giant was in talks with generic drugmakers about a potential entry into the pharmacy space. \nThe Journal reported Tuesday that Amazon is gearing up to launch a larger offering in the medical supplies business, sending shares of health-care supplier and services companies McKesson, Cardinal Health and Owens & Minor lower. \nNone of the companies mentioned were immediately available to respond to CNBC's request for comment.
