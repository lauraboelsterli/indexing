    "text": "Tomas Tatar scored his second goal of the game with 2:13 left in overtime, giving the Detroit Red Wings a 5-4 victory over the Washington Capitals on Sunday afternoon in Washington.\nTatar took a cross-ice pass from Dylan Larkin and slid a backhander past Washington goalie Braden Holtby for the game-winning goal.\nIn addition, Tatar scored twice in the other meeting between the two teams earlier this season, a 4-3 Washington victory.\nThe Red Wings appeared to be in charge after outshooting the Capitals 17-2 in the second period and getting goals from Luke Glendening and Anthony Mantha nine seconds apart with Tatar adding another 2:47 later for a 4-1 lead.\nDetroit was coming off of a 7-6 overtime loss versus the Islanders where the Red Wings blew a 5-2 third-period lead.\nThis time, the Wings lost the 4-1 lead as Brett Connolly, Dmitry Orlov and Nicklas Backstrom scored third-period goals and forced overtime.\nBackstrom’s goal came with 17 seconds remaining while Washington had a two-man advantage.\nDetroit goalie Jimmy Howard finished with 23 saves in the win.\nFor Washington, Alex Ovechkin did not get a shot in Friday’s 4-2 victory over the Blue Jackets but scored this game’s first goal, his 33rd this year -- matching his total for all of last season.\nWashington helped the Red Wings a bit later in the period. Matt Niskanen of the Capitals fumbled the puck away in the neutral zone, and Justin Abdelkader picked it up and scored on a breakaway with 6:23 left, tying the score at one.\nNiskanen also had the puck stolen from him on the third Detroit goal later on.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
