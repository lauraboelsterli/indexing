    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â€” That stock market pullback experts had been saying was long overdue has finally landed, and investor fears about higher interest rates escalated into rapid, computer-generated selling that on Monday wiped out all the market's gains for the year.\nAt one point, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1,000 points in less than an hour, and it ended with its worst day in more than six years. The Standard & Poor's 500 is now down nearly 8 percent from its record high, set a little more than a week ago.\nMarket professionals warn that the selling could continue for a bit. But many are also quick to say that they see no recession looming, and they expect the strengthening global economy and healthy corporate earnings to help stock prices to recover eventually.\n\"The reasons for the increase in rates is the stronger economy,\" said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust. \"The reasons are positive. It's not as if something like 2008 or financial Armageddon is coming.\"\nThe trigger for the sell-off came at the end of last week when a government report showed that wages across the country rose relatively quickly last month. While that's good for workers, traders took it as a signal that higher inflation may be on the way for the economy, which could push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly than expected. Higher rates not only make it more expensive for people and companies to borrow, they can also drive investors away from stocks and into bonds.\nOn Friday, stocks sank as the yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to its highest level in about four years, at 2.84 percent. But on Monday, the stock market's slide accelerated, even as the 10-year yield fell back to 2.71 percent.\nThe sell-off was so steep that some market watchers blamed automated trading systems, which have become more prevalent on Wall Street. These systems are programmed to buy and sell based on several variables, and they may have hit their sell triggers following the first wobble for stock prices after an unusually placid run.\nThat may mean even more volatility is to come in ensuing days, something that investors haven't had to deal with during a blissful year-plus of record-setting returns. Before Monday, the Standard & Poor's 500 index had gone a record length of time since a drop of even 5 percent, at roughly 400 trading days.\nMonday was also the first day in office for the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and investors are wondering how closely he'll stick with the low interest-rate policies set by his predecessor, Janet Yellen.\nStill, many market watchers said they remain optimistic that stocks will be able to recover.\nEven though worries are rising about interest rates, they still see a recession as a long shot. With economies growing around the world, profits for U.S. businesses are expected to continue rising, and stock prices tend to follow the path of corporate earnings over the long term.\n\"The rate worries have been the trigger\" for the stock market's swoon, said Melda Mergen, deputy global head of equities at Columbia Threadneedle. \"But fundamentally, we don't see any new news. It's earnings season, the time that we get more direct feedback from our companies, and we don't see any concerns.\"\nMore than half the companies in the S&P 500 have told investors how they performed in the last three months of 2017, and most have topped analysts' expectations, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Even more encouraging is that more than three quarters of them made more in revenue than expected, which means it's not just cost-cutting and layoffs that's allowing companies to earn more.\nThe White House cited some of those trends Monday and said it is focused on \"long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong.\"\nTrump has frequently commented on gains by the market during his first year in office. He has stayed silent in the face of market gyrations over the past week.\nIf the stock market does indeed bounce back, though, many market watchers expect returns to be more muted than in prior years because prices have already climbed so high. The S&P 500 is up nearly 292 percent since bottoming in early 2009.\nAnd investors should remember that drops like those of the past two days aren't a unique occurrence for stocks. They're inherently risky investments, and investors should be prepared to see drops of 10 percent for them. Such declines happen so regularly that analysts have a name for them: a market \"correction.\"\nAssociated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.",
