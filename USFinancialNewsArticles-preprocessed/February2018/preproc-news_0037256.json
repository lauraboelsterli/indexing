We are pleased to report that a number of engineering projects are transitioning to production, and we have now received production orders from three existing customers totaling over $2.1 Million with deliveries scheduled over the next eighteen months. Each of these three products utilizes our proprietary Microprecision™ technologies, and should significantly contribute to increasing revenues and continuously improving operational results in coming quarters.”\nQuarterly Conference Call Details\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss the fiscal Second quarter 2018 financial results for Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time.
