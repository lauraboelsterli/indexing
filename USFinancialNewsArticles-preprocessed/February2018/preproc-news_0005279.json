    "text": "Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Perth Mint's sales of gold and silver products rose in January from the previous month, the mint said in a blog post on its website on Thursday. Sales of gold coins and minted bars surged about 38 percent to 37,174 ounces in January from 27,009 ounces a month ago, the mint said. However, gold sales nearly halved in January compared with the same month last year. Silver sales in January jumped 22 percent month-on-month to 1,067,361 ounces, the highest since July. However, sales were down 13 percent compared with the same time last year. The Perth Mint refines more than 90 percent of newly mined gold in Australia, the world's second-largest gold producer after China. Spot gold prices rose 3.2 percent in January.
