Revenue increased by 12 percent and profit by 19 percent in 2017”, comments Henrik Ekelund President and CEO, BTS Group.\n“In 2018, we expect continued healthy growth and a profit before tax that is expected to be better than the previous year. The tax reform in the US is also expected to have a positive effect in the next fiscal years. For example, if the 2018 tax rates had applied in 2016 that year’s profit after tax would have been 7 percent higher”, says Henrik Ekelund.\nFor more information, please contact:\nMichael Wallin\nHead of Investor relations\nBTS Group AB\nE-mail: michael.wallin@bts.com\nMobile: +46 708-788 019\nAbout BTS Group AB\nBTS is a global professional services firm headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, with some 500 professionals in 35 offices located on six continents.
