At the same time, we feel positive about where we are going due to some important factors including: our solid capital position, our progress made in our 2017 ex-catastrophe underlying results, the strength of our market relevance as demonstrated by our 8 percent growth in gross written premiums year-over-year, and that we are seeing early signs of a return to realistic and sustainable rate. Additionally, with the benefit of learnings from our 2017 catastrophe experience and seeing the early way in which the rate environment is reacting following the 2017 events, we have already made a series of adjustments to optimize the balance of risk and return, meaningfully enhancing our catastrophe exposure profile while keeping us a leading player in these businesses. We expect to make further adjustments as the market environment unfolds.\nThroughout 2017 and clearly into 2018 we have shown that XL Catlin continues to be a market leader in customer satisfaction and innovation, earning, for the second straight year, Highest in Customer Satisfaction among large commercial insurers from J.D. Power, the top spot in the Gracechurch survey of the London Market, and first place in Advisen's innovation index, among numerous other external recognitions. All of this taken together, as we look at our industry, we feel well positioned for what comes next.\"\nFourth Quarter Summary\n(U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n2017\n2016\n$ Change\n% Change\n2017\n2016\n$ Change\n% Change\nNet income (loss) attributable\nto common shareholders\n$28,828\n$304,700\n$(275,872)\n(90.5)%\n$(560,398)\n$440,968\n$(1,001,366)\nN/M\nPer average common share outstanding-basic\n$0.11\n$1.13\n$(1.02)\n(90.3)%\n$(2.16)\n$1.58\n$(3.74)\nN/M\nPer average common share outstanding-fully diluted\n$0.11\n$1.12\n$(1.01)\n(90.2)%\n$(2.16)\n$1.56\n$(3.72)\nN/M\nOperating net income (loss)\n$116,054\n$128,440\n$(12,386)\n(9.6)%\n$(521,585)\n$460,729\n$(982,314)\nN/M\nPer average common share outstanding-fully diluted\n$0.45\n$0.47\n$(0.02)\n(4.3)%\n$(2.01)\n$1.63\n$(3.64)\nN/M\nN/M = not meaningful\nNet income attributable to common shareholders and net operating income were both significantly impacted by catastrophe losses during the current quarter, lower PYD and lower operating expenses. Net income attributable to common shareholders was also impacted by a non-recurring tax charge of $100.5 million related to the revaluation of the net deferred tax asset as a result of the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate enacted under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net investment income for the current quarter was $217.7 million, compared to $196.1 million in the prior year quarter. Net investment income for the current quarter, excluding the Life Funds Withheld Assets, was $186.3 million, compared to $161.0 million in the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher reinvestment rates in the current quarter from active sector rotation and portfolio management activities. Income from affiliates was $14.8 million for the current quarter, compared to $47.9 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower hedge fund performance as compared to the prior year quarter. The fourth quarter of 2016 included a one-time portfolio rebalancing gain. Operating expenses during the current quarter were 21.3% or $110.1 million favorable compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the absence of integration costs, which were $58.8 million in the prior year quarter, and a reduction to variable compensation costs resulting from the catastrophe loss impact on the Company's results. Income tax expense of $77.1 million was recognized during the current quarter driven largely by the $100.5 million discrete charge on the write-down of the net deferred tax asset as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, the current quarter income tax expense included the benefit of a lower full year effective tax rate resulting from third quarter losses and other discrete items recognized in the quarter. Fully diluted book value per common share decreased by $0.23 from the end of the prior quarter to $38.04, driven primarily by unrealized losses on the mark to market of our available for sale investments and by dividend payments made, partially offset by net income. Fully diluted tangible book value per common share also decreased by $0.26 from the end of the prior quarter to $29.44. There were no share buybacks 4 under our current share buyback authorization during the current quarter. Share buybacks for the full year ended December 31, 2017 totaled approximately 13.8 million shares at an average price of $41.36 per share or $571.6 million, compared to 30.2 million shares or $1.1 billion in the prior year. At December 31, 2017, $529.1 million of common shares remained available for purchase under our current share buyback authorization.\nP&C Operations\n(U.S. dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nInsurance\nReinsurance\nTotal P&C\nInsurance\nReinsurance\nTotal P&C\nGross premiums written\n$2,488,403\n$1,072,403\n$3,560,806\n$2,481,140\n$535,456\n$3,016,596\nNet premiums written\n$1,794,452\n$921,550\n$2,716,002\n$1,816,711\n$496,421\n$2,313,132\nNet premiums earned\n$1,757,004\n$915,944\n$2,672,948\n$1,707,440\n$746,620\n$2,454,060\nUnderwriting profit (loss)\n$(42,142)\n$68,482\n$26,340\n$30,043\n$96,377\n$126,420\nLoss ratio\n71.9%\n61.1%\n68.2%\n67.8%\n54.8%\n63.8%\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n30.5%\n31.4%\n30.8%\n30.4%\n32.3%\n31.0%\nCombined ratio\n102.4%\n92.5%\n99.0%\n98.2%\n87.1%\n94.8%\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nInsurance\nReinsurance\nTotal P&C\nInsurance\nReinsurance\nTotal P&C\nGross premiums written\n$10,070,463\n$4,682,110\n$14,752,573\n$9,650,503\n$3,975,106\n$13,625,609\nNet premiums written\n$6,704,548\n$3,963,876\n$10,668,424\n$6,715,969\n$3,514,667\n$10,230,636\nNet premiums earned\n$6,721,812\n$3,602,466\n$10,324,278\n$6,651,495\n$3,114,392\n$9,765,887\nUnderwriting profit (loss)\n$(454,255)\n$(407,812)\n$(862,067)\n$209,217\n$361,436\n$570,653\nLoss ratio\n76.2%\n79.9%\n77.5%\n65.0%\n56.3%\n62.2%\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n30.6%\n31.4%\n30.8%\n31.9%\n32.1%\n32.0%\nCombined ratio\n106.8%\n111.3%\n108.3%\n96.9%\n88.4%\n94.2%\nP&C gross premiums written (\"GPW\") in the fourth quarter increased 18.0% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, GPW increased by 16.9%. The Insurance segment GPW increased 0.3% from the prior year quarter driven primarily by growth in North American Property, International Casualty and International Financial Lines offset by lower premium from Political Risk, Credit and Bond as well as North American Programs. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Insurance GPW decreased 1.1%. The Reinsurance segment GPW increased by 100.3% from the prior year quarter due in part to an increased share on a large multiline treaty with one of our core clients. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the large multiline treaty and reinstatement premiums on catastrophe losses activity in the quarter, Reinsurance GPW increased by 80.3% driven by strong new business opportunities in our Casualty and Property classes of business. The P&C loss ratio excluding PYD and the impact of catastrophe losses in the current quarter was 58.7%, compared to 58.0% in the prior year quarter. On the same basis, the Insurance segment loss ratio in the current quarter was 61.2%, compared to 61.8% in the prior year quarter, while the Reinsurance segment was 53.9% in the current quarter compared to 49.4% in the prior year quarter. The P&C combined ratio excluding PYD and the impact of catastrophe losses in the current quarter was 89.5%, compared to 89.1% for the prior year quarter. On the same basis, the Insurance segment combined ratio in the current quarter was 91.7%, compared to 92.3% for the prior year quarter, while the Reinsurance segment was 85.4% in the current quarter, compared to 81.9% for the prior year quarter. Nearly half of the increase is attributed to a large multiline treaty with one of our core clients. The P&C net favorable PYD resulting from the current quarter was $54.2 million (2.0 points to the loss ratio), compared to net favorable development of $105.9 million, or 4.3 loss ratio points, in the prior year quarter. This reflects favorable development of $11.1 million in the Insurance segment and $43.1 million in the Reinsurance segment. Insurance releases were largely attributable to North America Casualty business in older accident years. Reinsurance releases were mainly attributable to favorable development on catastrophe and other large losses as well as favorable development on our North America Casualty business.\nFurther details of the results for the current quarter may be found in the Company's Financial Supplement and Earnings Presentation, each of which is dated February 1, 2018 and is available on the Investor Relations section of XL's website at www.xlgroup.com .\nA conference call to discuss the Company's results will be held at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time 1, 2018.

See the schedule entitled \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" on pages 12 and 13 of this press release for a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to \"operating net income\" and the calculation of \"annualized operating return on average common shareholders' equity including and excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of integration costs\", which are based on operating net income.\n2 Fully diluted tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure.

(\"GreyCastle\") providing for the sale of 100% of the common shares of XLIB's wholly-owned subsidiary, XLLR, for $570 million in cash. This transaction was completed on May 30, 2014. As a result of the transaction, we have ceded the majority of our life reinsurance business to XLLR via 100% quota share reinsurance (the \"GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements\"). The designated investments that support the GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements, which are written on a funds withheld basis (\"Life Funds Withheld Assets\"), are included within \"Total investments available for sale\" and \"Fixed maturities, trading at fair value\" on our balance sheet. Investment results for these assets - including interest income, unrealized gains and losses, and gains and losses from sales - are passed directly to the reinsurer pursuant to a contractual arrangement that is accounted for as a derivative. Net income attributable to common shareholders excluding the contribution from the GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements is a non-GAAP measure.

including interest income, unrealized gains and losses, and gains and losses from sales - are passed directly to the reinsurer pursuant to a contractual arrangement that is accounted for as a derivative. Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with these GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements are reflected within \"Net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets\" in the reconciliation above.\nNote 3: Defined as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders excluding: (1) our net investment income - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (2) our net realized (gains) losses on investments sold - excluding Life Funds Withheld Assets, (3) our net realized (gains) losses on investments sold (including OTTI) and net unrealized (gains) losses on investments, Trading - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (4) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, (5) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (6) our share of items (2) and (4) for our insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, (7) our foreign exchange (gains) losses, (8) our expenses related to the Catlin Acquisition, (9) our gain on the sale of our interest in ARX Holding Corp., (10) our gain on the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary XL Life Insurance and Annuity Company and the partial sale of our holdings in New Ocean Capital Management, (11) our loss on the inception of the U.S. Term Life Retro Arrangements, (12) our net (gains) losses on the early extinguishment of debt, (13) our net (gains) losses from the repurchase of preference shares, (14) tax provision arising from our write-down of our deferred tax asset related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and (15) a provision (benefit) for income tax on items excluded from operating income. We believe that showing \"operating net income (loss)\", \"annualized operating return on average common shareholders' equity including and excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of integration costs\" enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how we analyze our performance. In this regard, we believe that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) would make it more difficult for users of our financial information to evaluate our underlying business. We also believe that equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow us (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons, and they request that we provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis. A reconciliation of our net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to operating net income (loss) is provided above.\nNote 4: Diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is used to calculate per share data except when it is anti-dilutive to earnings per share or when there is a net loss. When it is anti-dilutive or when a net loss occurs, basic weighted average common shares outstanding is utilized in the calculation of net loss per share and net operating loss per share.\nNote 5 : Integration costs related to the Catlin Acquisition were completed in the second quarter of 2017.\nComment on Regulation G\nXL presents its operations in ways it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XL's financial information in evaluating XL's performance. This press release contains the presentation of (i) operating net income (loss) (\"Operating Net Income\"), which is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders excluding:(1) our net investment income - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (2) our net realized (gains) losses on investments sold - excluding Life Funds Withheld Assets, (3) our net realized (gains) losses on investments sold (including OTTI) and net unrealized (gains) losses on investments, Trading - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (4) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, (5) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (6) our share of items (2) and (4) for our insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, (7) our foreign exchange (gains) losses, (8) our expenses related to the Catlin Acquisition, (9) our gain on the sale of our interest in ARX Holding Corp., (10) our gain on the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary XL Life Insurance and Annuity Company and the partial sale of our holdings in New Ocean Capital Management, (11) our loss on the inception of the U.S. Term Life Retro Arrangements, (12) our net (gains) losses on the early extinguishment of debt, (13) our net (gains) losses from the repurchase of preference shares, (14) tax provision arising from our write-down of our deferred tax asset related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and (15) a provision (benefit) for income tax on items excluded from operating income; (ii) annualized return on average common shareholders' equity (\"ROE\") based on operating net income (loss) (\"Operating ROE\") including and excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of integration costs and (iii) Fully diluted tangible book value per common share (common shareholders' equity excluding goodwill and intangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding at the period end date combined with the dilutive impact of potential future share issues at any period end). These items are \"non-GAAP financial measures\" as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included in this press release on pages 12 and 13.\nAlthough the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realize capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of XL's operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses) is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be recognized as the result of other than temporary declines in value and from goodwill impairment charges without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of XL's financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and capital gains to understand the profitability of the operational sources of income without the effects of these two variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely a function of economic and interest rate conditions.\nNet realized and unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than certain credit derivatives and the life retrocession embedded derivative. With respect to credit derivatives, because XL and its insurance company operating affiliates generally hold financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies' treatment of such contracts), as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance.\nNet investment income - Life Funds Withheld Assets, and net realized (gains) losses on the life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets, have been excluded because, as a result of the GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangement, XL no longer shares in the risks and rewards of the underlying performance of the Life Funds Withheld Assets that support these retrocession arrangements. The returns on the Life Funds Withheld Assets are passed directly to the reinsurer pursuant to a contractual arrangement that is accounted for as a derivative. Therefore, net investment income from the Life Funds Withheld Assets and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with these GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements are not relevant to XL's underlying business performance.\nForeign exchange (gains) losses in the income statement are only one element of the overall impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on XL's financial position and are not representative of any economic gain or loss made by XL. Accordingly, it is not a relevant indicator of financial performance and it is excluded.\nIn summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing operating net income (loss) enables investors and other users of XL's financial information to analyze XL's performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) would make it much more difficult for users of XL's financial information to evaluate XL's underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.\nOperating ROE is a widely used measure of any company's profitability that is calculated by dividing annualized operating net income for any period other than a fiscal year when actual operating income is used by the average of the opening and closing common shareholders' equity. XL establishes target Operating ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If XL's Operating ROE targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, XL seeks to re-evaluate these lines. Operating ROE including and excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of integration costs, are additional measures of Company profitability. The most significant component of this exclusion is the mark to market fluctuations on XL's investment portfolio that have not been realized through sales, and/or distortions to XL's performance from integration costs related to the acquisition of Catlin. By providing these additional measures, users of our financial statements have the ability to include or exclude these items when considering our performance either on a standalone basis or for purposes of peer performance comparison.\nXL believes that fully diluted tangible book value per common share is a financial measure important to investors and other interested parties who benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry. However, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry.\nContact:\nAbbe Goldstein\nInvestor Relations\n(203) 964-3573\nCarol Parker Trott\nMedia Relations\n(441) 294-7290\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xl-group-ltd-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300592313.html\nSOURCE XL Group Ltd",
