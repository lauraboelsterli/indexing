    "text": "LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Greek government bond yields fell in early trading on Monday after a ratings upgrade from Fitch that highlighted improving sentiment towards the indebted southern European state.\nThe ratings agency upgraded Greece’s long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating to ‘B’ from ‘B-’ and kept its outlook positive.\nFitch said general government debt sustainability would improve on sustained economic growth and reduced political risks.\nGreece’s five-year bond yield was down 5 basis points at 3.395 percent early on Monday, outperforming euro zone peers.
