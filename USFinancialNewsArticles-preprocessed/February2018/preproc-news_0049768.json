    "text": "Estimated Remaining Collections increased to a record $7.0 billion Collections in 2017 reached an all-time high of $1.8 billion for the year Fourth quarter deployments of $170 million in the U.S., $301 million worldwide\nSAN DIEGO, Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Encore Capital Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ECPG), an international specialty finance company, today reported consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“In the fourth quarter, Encore continued to benefit from the growing supply of charged-off credit card receivables in the U.S. market, with solid deployments at favorable prices driving higher expected returns than a year ago,” said Ashish Masih, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “In the United States and in Europe, our consumer-centric liquidation programs are also driving better results and have contributed to substantial growth in our Estimated Remaining Collections, resulting in a new all-time high for Encore.”\n“2017 was a strong year for Encore in which we generated a record level of cash collections. We continue to invest in expanding our collections capacity to capitalize on the growing market opportunity in the U.S. In Europe, our subsidiary Cabot Credit Management completed its acquisition of Wescot in the fourth quarter and is now both the largest debt buyer and debt servicer in the United Kingdom.”\n“2017 was also a strong year for our industry in the U.S. After growing an estimated 15% in 2016, we estimate that sales of charged-off credit card receivables in the U.S. grew by more than 20% in 2017. We believe industry supply will continue to grow in 2018 and beyond, driven by recent record levels of revolving credit in the U.S. coupled with statements made by issuers who are broadly indicating that increases in charge-off rates are expected to continue,” said Masih.\nFinancial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of 2017:\nEstimated Remaining Collections (ERC) grew $1.1 billion compared to the same period of the prior year, to $7.0 billion. Investment in receivable portfolios was $301 million, including $170 million in the U.S. and $110 million in Europe, compared to $210 million deployed overall in the same period a year ago. Gross collections were $438 million, compared to $397 million in the same period of the prior year. Total revenues were $317 million, compared to $271 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. were $253 million, compared to $184 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was a result of several factors including: the impact of expenses related to the withdrawn Cabot IPO; the acquisition of Wescot and related restructuring costs; tax planning related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and investments in the expansion of our collections capacity. Adjusted operating expenses were $182 million, compared to $152 million in the same period of the prior year. Total interest expense increased to $51.7 million, compared to $48.4 million in the same period of the prior year. GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Encore was $12.7 million, or $0.48 per fully diluted share, compared to $22.0 million, or $0.85 per fully diluted share, in the same period of the prior year. The decline in net income from 2016 to 2017 was largely due to the impact of expenses related to the withdrawn Cabot IPO in November 2017. Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore was $27.7 million, compared to $18.7 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore per share (also referred to as Economic EPS) was $1.05, compared to $0.72 in the same period of the prior year. Available capacity under Encore’s revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing base and applicable debt covenants, was $213 million as of December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights for the Full Year of 2017:\nInvestment in receivable portfolios for the full year was $1.1 billion, including $536 million in the U.S. and $464 million in Europe, compared to $0.9 billion deployed overall in 2016. Gross collections were $1.8 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in 2016. Total revenues were $1.2 billion, compared to $1.0 billion in 2016. were $862 million, compared to $788 million in 2016. Adjusted operating expenses were $698 million, compared to $648 million in 2016 as we invested in the expansion of our collections capacity. Total interest expense was $204 million, compared to $198 million in 2016. GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Encore was $83.4 million, or $3.16 per fully diluted share, compared to $78.9 million, or $3.05 per fully diluted share, in 2016. Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore was $106.0 million, compared to $90.1 million in 2016. Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore per share (also referred to as Economic EPS) was $4.04, compared to $3.48 in 2016.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and slide presentation today, February 21, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time / 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss fourth quarter and full year results.\nMembers of the public are invited to access the live webcast via the Internet by logging on at the Investor Relations page of Encore's website at www.encorecapital.com .

The Company has included adjusted income attributable to Encore and adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore per share (also referred to as economic EPS when adjusted for certain shares associated with our convertible notes that will not be issued but are reflected in the fully diluted share count for accounting purposes) because management uses this measure to assess operating performance, in order to highlight trends in the Company’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included information concerning adjusted operating expenses in order to facilitate a comparison of approximate cash costs to cash collections for the portfolio purchasing and recovery business in the periods presented. Adjusted income attributable to Encore, adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore per share/economic EPS, and adjusted operating expenses have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income, net income per share, and total operating expenses as indicators of the Company’s operating performance. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures, as presented by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company has attached to this news release a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Encore Capital Group, Inc.\nEncore Capital Group is an international specialty finance company that provides debt recovery solutions and other related services for consumers across a broad range of financial assets.

These intangible assets are valued at the time of the acquisition and amortized over their estimated lives. We believe that amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, especially the amortization of an acquired company’s trade names and customer relationships, is the result of pre-acquisition activities. In addition, the amortization of these acquired intangibles is a non-cash static expense that is not affected by operations during any reporting period. As a result, the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets is excluded from our adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore and adjusted income from continuing operations per share.\n(4) In October 2017, Cabot announced its intention to proceed with an initial public offering and to apply for admission of its ordinary shares to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and to trade on the main market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange. In November 2017, Encore announced that Cabot has decided to not go forward with its previously announced initial public offering as a result of poor performance of other IPOs on the London Stock Exchange and unfavorable equity market conditions in the U.K. We believe these expenses are not indicative of ongoing operations, therefore adjusting for these expenses enhances comparability to prior periods, anticipated future periods, and our competitors’ results.\n(5) Amount represents the total income tax effect of the adjustments, which is calculated based on the applicable marginal tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the portion of the adjustment occurred.\n(6) Certain of the above pre-tax adjustments include expenses recognized by our partially-owned subsidiaries. This adjustment represents the portion of the non-GAAP adjustments that are attributable to noncontrolling interest.\n(7) As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”), we incurred a net additional tax expense of approximately $1.2 million. We believe the Tax Reform Act related expenses are not indicative of our ongoing operations, therefore adjusting for these expenses enhances comparability to prior periods, anticipated future periods, and our competitors’ results.\n(8) Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore per economic share includes $0.40 of adjustments to Cabot’s EPS contribution after tax and noncontrolling interest, consisting primarily of a portion of expenses related to the withdrawn Cabot IPO as well as restructuring charges related to Cabot’s acquisition of Wescot.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 $ Per Diluted\nShare—\nAccounting Per Diluted\nShare—\nEconomic $ Per Diluted\nShare—\nAccounting Per Diluted\nShare—\nEconomic GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Encore, as reported $ 83,427 $ 3.16 $ 3.18 $ 78,923 $ 3.05 $ 3.05 Adjustments: Convertible notes non-cash interest and issuance cost amortization 12,353 0.47 0.47 11,830 0.46 0.46 Acquisition, integration and restructuring related expenses (1) 16,628 0.63 0.63 17,630 0.68 0.68 Net gain on fair value adjustments to contingent considerations (2) (2,822 ) (0.11 ) (0.11 ) (8,111 ) (0.31 ) (0.31 ) Settlement fees and related administrative expenses (3) — — — 6,299 0.24 0.24 Amortization of certain acquired intangible assets (4) 3,561 0.13 0.14 2,593 0.10 0.10 Expenses related to withdrawn Cabot IPO (5) 15,339 0.58 0.58 — — — Income tax effect of the adjustments (6) (7,936 ) (0.30 ) (0.30 ) (12,577 ) (0.49 ) (0.49 ) Adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest (7) (15,720 ) (0.60 ) (0.60 ) (6,461 ) (0.25 ) (0.25 ) Impact from tax reform (8) 1,182 0.05 0.05 — — — Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Encore $ 106,012 $ 4.01 $ 4.04 $ 90,126 $ 3.48 $ 3.48\n(1) Amount represents acquisition, integration and restructuring related expenses.

In November 2017, Encore announced that Cabot has decided to not go forward with its previously announced initial public offering as a result of poor performance of other IPOs on the London Stock Exchange and unfavorable equity market conditions in the U.K. We believe these expenses are not indicative of ongoing operations, therefore adjusting for these expenses enhances comparability to prior periods, anticipated future periods, and our competitors’ results.\n(6) Amount represents the total income tax effect of the adjustments, which is calculated based on the applicable marginal tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the portion of the adjustment occurred.\n(7) Certain of the above pre-tax adjustments include expenses recognized by our partially-owned subsidiaries. This adjustment represents the portion of the non-GAAP adjustments that are attributable to noncontrolling interest.\n(8) As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we incurred a net additional tax expense of approximately $1.2 million. We believe the Tax Reform Act related expenses are not indicative of our ongoing operations, therefore adjusting for these expenses enhances comparability to prior periods, anticipated future periods, and our competitors’ results.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP total operating expenses, as reported $ 253,246 $ 183,939 $ 862,498 $ 787,744 Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense (3,358 ) (3,125 ) (10,399 ) (12,627 ) Operating expenses related to non-portfolio purchasing and recovery business (1) (41,164 ) (29,291 ) (125,028 ) (110,875 ) Acquisition, integration and restructuring related operating expenses (2) (11,911 ) (7,457 ) (16,628 ) (17,630 ) Net gain on fair value adjustments to contingent considerations (3) 49 8,111 2,822 8,111 Settlement fees and related administrative expenses (4) — — — (6,299 ) Expenses related to withdrawn Cabot IPO (5) (15,339 ) — (15,339 ) — Adjusted operating expenses related to portfolio purchasing and recovery business $ 181,523 $ 152,177 $ 697,926 $ 648,424",
