Under the PDT Plan, the Fund makes monthly distributions of an amount equal to $0.0975 per share. This amount will be paid monthly until further notice.\nDistributions under the PDT Plan may consist of net investment income, net realized long-term capital gains, net realized short-term capital gains and, to the extent necessary, return of capital.\nThe Fund may also make additional distributions (i) for purposes of not incurring federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gain of the Fund, if any, not included in such regular distributions and (ii) for purposes of not incurring federal excise tax on ordinary income and capital gain net income, if any, not included in such regular monthly distributions.\nThe Board may amend the terms of the PDT Plan or terminate the PDT Plan at any time.\nJohn Hancock Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income Fund\nTax-Advantaged Dividend Income Fund (the \"Fund\") declared its monthly distribution pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan (the \"HTD Plan\"). Under the HTD Plan, the Fund makes monthly distributions of an amount equal to $0.1380 per share. This amount will be paid monthly until further notice.\nDistributions under the HTD Plan may consist of net investment income, net realized long-term capital gains, net realized short-term capital gains and, to the extent necessary, return of capital.\nThe Fund may also make additional distributions (i) for purposes of not incurring federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gain of the Fund, if any, not included in such regular distributions and (ii) for purposes of not incurring federal excise tax on ordinary income and capital gain net income, if any, not included in such regular monthly distributions.\nThe Board may amend the terms of the HTD Plan or terminate the HTD Plan at any time.\nA portion of a Fund's current distribution may include sources other than net investment income, including a return of capital. Investors should understand that a return of capital is not a distribution from income or gains of a Fund. As required under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a notice with the estimated components of the distribution will be sent to shareholders at the time of payment if it does not consist solely of net investment income. Such notice will also be posted to the Funds' website at www.jhinvestments.com . The notice should not be used to prepare tax returns as the estimates indicated in the notice may differ from the ultimate federal income tax characterization of distributions. After the end of each calendar year, investors will be sent a Form 1099-DIV informing them how to report distributions received during that year for federal income tax purposes.\nStatements in this press release that are not historical facts are as defined by the United States securities laws. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on because they are subject to uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Fund's control and could cause actual results to set forth in the .\nAn investor should consider a Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.\nAbout John Hancock Investments\nJohn Hancock Investments provides asset management services to individuals and institutions through a unique manager-of-managers approach.
