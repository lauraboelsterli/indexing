    "text": "Performs within guidance for Revenue and EBITDA for 2017 MDSS service contracts divestiture completed Company continues to pay regular quarterly dividend of $0.055 cents per share\nSUWANEE, Ga., Feb. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digirad Corporation (Nasdaq:DRAD) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter were $30.9 million, compared to $31.1 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter was $22.0 million, or $1.10 net loss per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.0 million, or $0.10 net income per diluted share in the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter was $2.7 million, or $0.14 adjusted net loss per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $3.0 million, or $0.15 adjusted net income per diluted share in the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $2.8 million, compared to $5.4 million in the same period in the prior year.\nTotal revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $118.3 million, compared to the prior year's revenues for the same period of $125.5 million.\nNet loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $35.7 million, or $1.79 net loss per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.3 million, or $0.71 net income per diluted share in the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $0.2 million, or $0.01 adjusted net income per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $7.2 million, or $0.36 adjusted net income per diluted share in the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $10.0 million, compared to $16.8 million in the same period in the prior year.\nOperating cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $6.2 million, compared to the prior year's operating cash flow for the same period of $10.8 million. Non-GAAP free cash flow was $3.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.9 million in the same period in the prior year.\nDigirad President and CEO Matt Molchan said, “Overall, we are pleased that we finished within our guidance range for revenue, and EBITDA; our free cash flow was slightly below our range mainly due to timing of activities. From a business perspective, our Services businesses Diagnostic Services and Mobile Healthcare performed within our expectations, with Diagnostic Services showing revenue gains year over year for the quarter and year. As we had discussed earlier in the year, our Diagnostic Imaging business has been experiencing slower capital equipment sales, which impacted our overall results. Though we cannot predict exactly when capital spending will pick back up, we continue to build an order pipeline giving us confidence in eventual improvement in capital equipment sales.\nMolchan continued, “Also, during the quarter we signed a purchase agreement to sell our service contracts in our MDSS business unit to Philips, and as previously announced that sale closed effective February 1. With this business divested, as well as the previously announced MDSS products sales activity ending effective December 31st, we can now focus on our core mobile imaging services. As we move forward with this focus, we have made some operational and personnel changes in our core business areas to right size the organization based on the divestiture of these MDSS activities.”\nThe Company has previously announced on February 1, 2018 its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.055 cents per share, which will be paid on February 28, 2018, to shareholders of record on February 15, 2018.\nThe Company expects to release its 2018 financial guidance with its first quarter 2018 results at the end of April 2018.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call is scheduled for 11:00 a.m. EST on February 23, 2018 to discuss the results and management's outlook. The call may be accessed by dialing 1-877-407-9039 (international callers: +1-201-689-8470) five minutes prior to the scheduled start time and referencing Digirad. A simultaneous webcast of the call may be accessed online from the Events & Presentations link on the Investor Relations page at http://drad.client.shareholder.com ; an archived replay of the webcast will be available within 15 minutes of the end of the conference call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Digirad Corporation\nThis Digirad news release presents the non-GAAP financial measures “adjusted net income (loss),” “adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share,” “adjusted EBITDA”, and \"free cash flow\". The most directly comparable measure for these non-GAAP financial measures are net income (loss), net income (loss) per diluted share, and operating cash flow. The Company has included below unaudited adjusted financial information, which presents the Company's results of operations after excluding acquired intangible asset amortization, goodwill impairment, acquisition related contingent consideration adjustments, investment impairment loss, transaction and integration costs associated with DMS Health Technologies, litigation reserve, loss on extinguishment of debt and non-recurring related income tax adjustments. Further excluded in the measure of adjusted EBITDA are interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting cash paid for capital expenditures, net of dispositions from operating cash flow.\nA discussion of the reasons why management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Digirad's financial condition and results of operations is included as Exhibit 99.2 to Digirad's report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2018.\nAbout Digirad Corporation\nDigirad delivers convenient, effective, and efficient healthcare solutions on an as needed, when needed, and where needed basis.
