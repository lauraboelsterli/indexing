    "text": "Published: Feb 5, 2018 4:55 p.m. ET Share \nDecline matches ratings slide during NFL’s regular season Reuters The Eagles' Zach Ertz soared for this touchdown Sunday, but TV ratings were grounded. \nBy Joe Flint \nThere were 17 Super Bowl records set in Sunday night’s thriller between the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots, but the size of the audience wasn’t one of them. \nThe Eagles’ 41-33 nail-biter win over the Patriots in Super Bowl LII averaged 103.4 million viewers on Comcast Corp.’s CMCSA, -4.65% NBC, according to Nielsen, making it the least-watched football championship since 2009. \nThis year’s ratings marked a 7.1% drop from last year’s 111.3 million people who saw the Patriots beat the Atlanta Falcons in overtime on Fox. The record Super Bowl audience was set at 114.4 million when the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks in 2015 on NBC. \nThe decline in viewership for the Super Bowl is in line with declines the National Football League experienced during the regular season. The average audience for an NFL game for the 2017 season was 14.9 million viewers, a nearly 10% decline from the 2016 regular season, which was down 8% compared with 2015. Ratings for the playoffs this season were also down. ",
