    "text": "14 Share PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) – What do you do with your downtime at the Pyeongchang winter games? Ask a Swiss skier. Videos of athletes hanging onto an escalator and using a trolley as a makeshift bobsleigh have gone viral since they were uploaded to the Swiss ski team’s Instagram account (bit.ly/2nY2SQF). In one video, a team member hangs onto the wrong side of the escalator as it climbs upward. “After 20 years I still couldn’t figure out how these things work! Am I doing it right?”, skier Fabian Bösch said in a caption posted with the video. Reporting by Reuters Television, editing by Darren Schuettler Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
