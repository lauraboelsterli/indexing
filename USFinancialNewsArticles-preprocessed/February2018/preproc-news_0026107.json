    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 2:11 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago UK worried by Iran role in Israel-Syria border confrontation - Johnson Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson said London was concerned at Iran’s role in a confrontation at Israel’s border with Syria. \n“We are concerned at the Iranian actions, which detract from efforts to get a genuine peace process under way,” Johnson   Monday. \n“We encourage Russia to use its influence to press the regime and its backers to avoid provocative actions and to support de-escalation in pursuit of a broader political settlement,” he said. \nIn the most serious confrontation yet between Israel and Iranian-backed forces in Syria, anti-aircraft fire on Saturday downed an Israeli warplane returning from a bombing raid on Iran-backed positions.
