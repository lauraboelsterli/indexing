The German drugmaker, which is taking over U.S. seed maker Monsanto, is addressing the FDA’s complaints regarding manufacturing practices, which stem from a routine inspection in January, Bayer said. It has no evidence that patient safety was or is at risk and no products would be recalled, it added.

REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo “We expect temporary supply limitations affecting our mature product portfolio,” though distribution from the Leverkusen supply center would continue, Bayer said. A spokesman said this was affecting the established drugs Adalat against high blood pressure, blood thinner Aspirin Cardio, antibiotic Avelox, and potency drug Levitra. Citi analysts said in a research note that the products accounted for 2017 sales of about 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion), about 6 percent of the group total. “The business impact will be reflected in our upcoming 2018 guidance on February 28,” Bayer said. ($1 = 0.8098 euros)",
