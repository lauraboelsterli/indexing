    "text": "Distinguished leader will serve as senior vice president for top consulting firm’s homeland security and resilience practice area\nWALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Cadmus Group LLC (Cadmus) announced today that it has appointed Jeff Newell as senior vice president of safety, security, and resilience services. Newell will lead the strategic development and delivery of Cadmus’ expert consulting services in the homeland security and preparedness market.\n“Jeff brings a unique and powerful combination of capabilities and experience to Cadmus,” said President and CEO Ian Kline. “As a retired major general who moved into a leadership role in industry, Jeff can relate to our clients’ missions from every angle. He is a proven leader and a real-world practitioner of critical strategy and planning with a valuable perspective on our clients’ needs to prepare for and respond to natural and human-made threats.”\nNewell joins Cadmus from his previous position as vice president of aviation services at Pacific Architects & Engineers (PAE). Previously, he served as director of strategy and concepts on the United States Air Force staff, where he led five divisions responsible for developing future vision and strategy for the Air Force. Prior to that, Newell was the director of strategy, policy and plans (J5), U.S. Northern Command and NORAD, where he served as principal advisor to the commander on strategy and policy and was responsible for campaign and contingency planning for the defense of North America.\nAdditionally, Newell served as the senior military advisor to the U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, U.S. Department of State. Newell was also the deputy director for politico-military affairs for Asia for the Joint Staff, during which he served as the advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on security matters across Asia, including China, India, Korea, Japan, and Australia and was the key Joint Staff representative to the interagency team responding to Japan's earthquake and tsunami of 2011. Prior to his service within the Joint Staff, Newell served as the commander, 374th Airlift Wing, USAF.\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Newell served as the military aide to the president of the United States. As aide-de-camp and emergency actions officer for President George W. Bush, Newell ensured the president had ready access to the emergency action satchel, commonly known as “the football.”\nNewell is a life member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, and a Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters.\n“Cadmus is considered the gold standard in preparedness and resilience,” said Newell. “I look forward to being part of an extraordinary team and helping our clients prepare for and solve their most complex challenges.”\nKevin O’Prey, Ph.D., Cadmus’ previous senior vice president of homeland security services, will remain a senior vice president with Cadmus, concentrating on delivery to Cadmus’ clients, further advancing Cadmus’ thought leadership, and developing strategic opportunities across the firm.\n“Kevin is widely viewed as one of the top experts in the industry,” said Kline. “We are thrilled that he will be able to bring even more value to Cadmus and our clients by focusing on client support and mentoring the next generation of Cadmus thought leaders.”\nCadmus leverages in-depth understanding and experience to help clients prepare for everything from hurricanes to terrorist attacks to electricity outages.
