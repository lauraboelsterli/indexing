    "text": " 40 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago BRIEF-KGHM flags $90 mln of impairment charges in 2017 Reuters Staff 1 Min Read Feb 21 (Reuters) - KGHM Polska Miedz SA: * Europe’s No. 2 copper miner, the Poland-based KGHM, says tests have indicated impairment charges worth $90 million to be sustained by the company in 2017 * KGHM says tests have shown that an impairment charge worth $118.3 mln related to the Canadian Sudbury project is justified * An impairment charge worth $64 mln related to the Canadian Ajax project is also justified, KGHM says * KGHM also says reversal of some of $92.7 mln of an impairment charge related to the U.S. Robinson mine is justified * KGHM says the final value of the impairment charges could still change * Says tests have not shown justification to change the estimated value of KGHM’s other mining assets Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reporting by Warsaw bureau)",
