Traders, however, don't rule out there could be further turbulence ahead. Here's your snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) EUROPEAN EARNINGS: BEATS LAG TYPICAL QUARTER, BUT REVENUES AHEAD (0637 GMT) The latest Thomson Reuters Earnings Outlook report for the pan-European STOXX 600 index is out, showing how fourth-quarter earning beats so far are lagging the typical quarter, while revenue beats are ahead. As a result earnings growth forecasts for the quarter have been revised downwards. Here in the key highlights there are more details: * Fourth quarter earnings are expected to increase 11.0% from Q4 2016. Excluding the Energy sector, earnings are expected to increase 7.9%. * Fourth quarter revenue is expected to increase 1.5% from Q4 2016. Excluding the Energy sector, earnings are expected to increase 0.6%. * 85 companies in the STOXX 600 have reported earnings to date for Q4 2017. Of these, 48.2% reported results exceeding analyst estimates. In a typical quarter 50% beat analyst EPS estimates. * 89 companies in the STOXX 600 have reported revenue to date for Q4 2017. Of these, 57.3% reported revenue exceeding analyst estimates. In a typical quarter 54% beat analyst revenue estimates. * During the week of Feb. 12, 33 STOXX 600 companies are expected to report quarterly earnings. (Danilo Masoni)",
