    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department would sell about $290 billion in net ultra short-term debt in the next four weeks in the aftermath a budget agreement last week to suspended the federal debt limit into March 2019, JPMorgan analysts said on Monday.\nThis increase in bill issuance would bring the governmentâ€™s cash balance toward $340 billion by the end of April after the Treasury had reduced its cash balance in anticipation of hitting its statutory borrowing limit of $19.9 trillion.
