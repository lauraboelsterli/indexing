Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: julien.ponthus.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net WHAT'S ON THE RADAR AHEAD OF THE OPEN (0730 GMT) European markets are expected to open in positive territory but all eyes are really on the U.S. inflation data, which will come in early afternoon and will determine the fate of this session. In the meantime, a steady flow of corporate results and M&A will give traders enough to gnaw on while waiting for the big numbers. In the banking sector, Credit Suisse posted a third straight annual loss but it was smaller than expected. Credit Agricole saw a 33 percent jump in quarterly profit while French investment bank Natixis last evening reported an unexpected rise in quarterly net profit. For cyclicals, Thyssenkrupp Q1 operating profit is up 35, Dutch chemical firm DSM's Q4 profit beat expectations and Clariant 2017 profit missed estimates after a turbulent year. Swedish brake systems maker Haldex reported a rise in fourth-quarter core earnings but said investments in development and expansion in North America and China would hold back profitability in 2018. M&A: Danone to sell 14 percent stake in Japan's Yakult. In the UK, Sky won the bulk of Premier League rights. (Julien Ponthus) EUROPE TO OPEN IN POSITIVE TERRITORY, FUTURES INDICATE (0705 GMT) Looks like European bourses are set to open on a positive note, but of course, the rest of the session is largely expected to depend on the U.S. inflation data, which is to be published at 1330 GMT. (Julien Ponthus) A \"POWELL PUT\"? (0657 GMT) The incoming U.S. inflation data is sure keeping markets on their toes and it's interesting to note that the new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's first words at a ceremonial swearing-in was that the central bank would keep watching for financial stability risks. \"We will remain alert to any developing risks to financial stability\", Powell said on the heels of a market rout that shaved 10 percent from the value of major U.S. stock indexes. A lot of analysts are still trying to figure out how Powell would react to a melt-down and wondering whether there would be such as thing as a \"Powell Put\", in the same way that the so-called \"Greenspan Put\" came to the rescue in 1987. On Monday, Stéphane Déo, strategist for LBPAM, asked himself whether the \"Greenspan Put\" had disappeared and what to make of the old saying recently used by Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts: \"Markets stop panicking when central banks start panicking\". In the meantime and as far as we are concerned today, as said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader: \"Even a slightly higher number could set the cat among the pigeons given the late cycle stimulus the Trump Administration is pumping into the U.S. economy\".
