    "text": "SOLON, Ohio, Feb. MRI Software , a global leader in real estate software solutions, announced two key executive appointments today to support the company's recent growth. Proven enterprise software leader Russell Butler has joined MRI in the newly appointed role of Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and John Ensign, an eight-year veteran on the MRI leadership team, has been named President and Chief Legal Officer.\nButler and Ensign assume their new positions at a time when MRI is growing faster than in any other period of its history, having nearly doubled in size through six acquisitions on three continents during the latter part of 2017. Butler brings three decades of successfully leading high-performance, global product development teams at Oracle, IBM, AT&T and other leading software organizations. As CTO, Butler will oversee MRI's technology strategy and manage product innovation and integration efforts to support the company's expansion into new geographical and vertical markets.\nEnsign will assume oversight of MRI's corporate shared services, adding global client support, finance and accounting to his previous management responsibilities overseeing MRI's human resources, legal, facilities, M&A and Partner Connect teams. Ensign will also assume overall responsibility of MRI's EMEA and APAC operations, which are key to the company's future growth.\n\"These new executive appointments put two experienced leaders in position to support MRI Software's recent exponential growth,\" said Patrick Ghilani, Chief Executive Officer of MRI Software. \"Russell's background leading product development and strategy for some of the world's largest enterprise software companies will enable MRI to accelerate innovation and integration of our organic and acquired solutions to improve usability, increase efficiencies and deliver greater insight for our clients while maintaining a flexible and open architecture.
