    "text": " 26 PM / in 3 minutes Chipotle restaurant sales rise slightly after price increases Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc ( CMG.N ) on Tuesday reported a slightly better-than-expected rise in sales at established restaurants, boosted by menu price increases, as it works to regain customer trust after food safety lapses in 2015. \nSales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months were up 0.9 percent for the fourth quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected a gain of 0.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. \nNet profit was $43.8 million, or $1.55 per share, up from $16 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding the 21 cent per share gain related to the new U.S. tax law, Chipotle beat Street’s profit view by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nRevenue jumped 7.3 percent to $1.1 billion, to match Wall Street’s view. Traffic declines partially offset same-store sales gains related to last year’s menu price increases. Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Susan Thomas",
