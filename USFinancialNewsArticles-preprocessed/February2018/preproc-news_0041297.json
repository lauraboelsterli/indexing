    "text": "MUMBAI, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India said on Friday it has “undertaken a supervisory assessment of control systems” at Punjab National Bank and will take “appropriate supervisory action” after the lender disclosed this week it had been hit by a $1.77 billion scam.\nThe RBI also denied a report from The Economic Times newspaper that PNB had been asked to assume all liabilities arising from the fraud, according to a statement.\n“RBI denies having given any such instructions,” the statement said.
