(NASDAQ:PCYG), the parent company of ReposiTrak Inc., a compliance, supply chain, and MarketPlace B2B e-commerce services platform that partners with retailers to accelerate sales, control risk, and improve supply chain efficiencies, announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nStrategic and Financial Highlights:\nRevenue increased to a record $5.7 million driven by double-digit growth across all services. “As planned, we signed multiple Vendor Portal deals in the second quarter, driving supply chain results and overall revenue to record levels,” said Randall K. Fields, Park City Group’s Chairman and CEO. “These wins were important as they mark our transition to a platform-as-a-service company. The scope of our ReposiTrak customer relationships is expanding from food safety compliance to an end-to-end platform that also includes our supply chain and MarketPlace B2B e-commerce capabilities.”\nOne of world’s largest retailers completes MarketPlace pilot and commercially adopts platform. “MarketPlace is a highly effective tool for localizing merchandising decisions, enabling retailers to differentiate the product in one store from another. We are engaged by this customer to enable store level ordering though MarketPlace, replacing a catalog system they had used for decades. This is a use case for MarketPlace that was conceived by the customer and highlights the platform’s unique B2B e-commerce capabilities. This customer is now expanding this successful engagement,” said Mr. Fields.\nPartnership with GMDC to expand ReposiTrak network and accelerate MarketPlace growth. “Our work with GMDC, the largest general merchandise industry trade association, significantly expands our presence beyond retail food items. GMDC chose to exclusively endorse ReposiTrak and MarketPlace because of the platform’s unique compliance, supply chain and B2B e-commerce capabilities,” said Mr. Fields. “With GMDC’s general merchandise focus driving even further scale into our network of connections, we are increasingly confident that MarketPlace will significantly expand the addressable market for our services.”\nTop-five grocer expands ReposiTrak compliance to include managing sustainability. “During the quarter, this retailer, a long-time supply chain customer, expanded the use of ReposiTrak to include managing the compliance of its sustainability initiative,” said Mr. Fields. “This was an important development for us because it demonstrates that ReposiTrak’s capabilities go far beyond food safety and that our unique platform can be used to manage the compliance characteristics of all aspects of our customers’ business, helping them to achieve a number of strategic objectives.”\nSuccess of converged business plan to drive new ReposiTrak branded platform initiative. “With the accelerating convergence of our services we are launching a new marketing strategy to increase awareness of our capabilities,” said Mr. Fields. “ReposiTrak is the platform, not just our food safety initiative. This platform now encompasses three application suites; compliance, supply chain, and MarketPlace, which together, form a self-reinforcing eco-system wherein there is a logical connection from one suite of applications to another. Each application enhances the value of the others, creating a model for network driven sustainable growth and high profitability.”\nInvesting in improving ability to address the growing scale and scope of network . “Continually improving execution is the key to successful long-term customer relationships and our future growth. Last quarter we highlighted our efforts to drive the productivity of the Success Team to tackle our growing pipeline of connections. This quarter we leveraged new tools from our 10x Project to help the Success Team to better address the growing scope of capabilities of ReposiTrak’s network. As a result, the team is increasingly capable of implementing customers across all three of our application suites; compliance, supply chain, and MarketPlace,” said Mr. Fields.\nManagement reiterates fiscal 2018 revenue outlook and highlights growing profitability . “The list of ReposiTrak HUBs is growing rapidly. We are seeing an acceleration in supply chain service adoption across this growing network, and customer interest in Marketplace is stronger than any service launch in our history, validating the substantial resources committed to this initiative. With the execution capabilities of our Success Team rising to the occasion, we are increasingly confident in the self-reinforcing nature of our converged business model and our ability to drive sustainable strong top-line growth and even higher levels of earnings growth,” said Mr. Fields.\nFinancial Results Summary:\nFiscal 2Q18 Quarterly Results: Total revenue increased 20% to $5.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $4.8 million during the same period a year ago.

These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures will be provided upon the completion of the Company’s annual audit.\nNon-GAAP EBITDA excludes items such as impairment charges, allowance for doubtful accounts, non-cash stock based compensation and other one-time cash and non-cash charges. Non-GAAP EPS excludes items such as non-cash stock based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and other one-time cash and non-cash charges. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, which may not be indicative of its core operation results and business outlook. Because Park City Group has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the Company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures in the financial presentation below allows investors to compare the Company’s financial results with the Company’s historical financial results reported using non-GAAP financial measures, as well as with the financial results reported by others.\nForward-Looking Statement\nAny statements contained in this document that are not historical facts are as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
