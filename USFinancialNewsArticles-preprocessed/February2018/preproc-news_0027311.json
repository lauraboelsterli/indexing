    "text": "February 13, 2018 / 5:23 PM / Updated 33 minutes ago New German government will not alter Brexit policy, official says Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - A new German government will not change its policy regarding Britain’s looming departure from the European Union, an official said after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) reached a coalition deal last week. The conservatives and centre-left SPD have agreed they want to renew their 2013-2017 “grand coalition”. The SPD’s 464,000 members still have the chance to veto the decision in a postal ballot. “Somebody asked me today: will a new German government change its #Brexit policy? Nothing hints to such a policy shift!” Peter Ptassek, Germany’s Brexit coordinator, wrote in English on Twitter on Tuesday. “Expect us to follow our long-standing interest in the integrity of the single market and cohesion of the #EU,” he added.
