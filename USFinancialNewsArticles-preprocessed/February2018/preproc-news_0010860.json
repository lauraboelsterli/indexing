Kasian as Chairman. This follows previous Chairman Dr Malcolm. R Brandon’s resignation on 30 January 2018.\nDr Kasian has been a Board member of the Company for over four (4) years, and his appointment as Chairman provides continuity in the newly restructured Board of the Company as it seeks to build on the genomic assets and expertise developed to date and take advantage of new and developing opportunities. Dr Kasian commented: “The new Board has fully endorsed the Company's existing business and technology and is looking forward to continuing development of its predictive cancer platforms across the exciting area of colon cancer along with existing non familial breast cancer. Embracing new technologies such as blockchain to provide greater efficiencies in how tests are created, stored and passed on to patients, researchers and big Pharma may provide a quantum leap in efficiencies and opportunities for GTG moving forwards. Dr Kasian noted that the Board was encouraged by the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt’s, support of the recent Innovation and Science Australia (ISA) innovation report and Australia’s national mission which highlights the opportunities in combining “genomics and digital platforms” for personalised health.\nDr Kasian was appointed as a Director of the Company on 12 December 2013 and brings to the Board a combination of expertise in strategic business leadership and biotech investing, giving him a deep understanding on key value drivers for companies in generating shareholder value.
