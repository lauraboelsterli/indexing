    "text": "CHICAGO, Century Aluminum Company (NASDAQ:CENX) today announced fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet income of $35.8 million, or $0.37 per diluted share Adjusted net income 1 of $24.8 million and Adjusted EPS of $0.26 Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $60.2 million, up $12.3 million sequentially on higher LME prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs Net sales of $433.8 million, an 8% increase over prior quarter\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet income of $48.6 million, or $0.51 per diluted share Adjusted net income 1 of $34.7 million and Adjusted EPS of $0.36 Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $164.2 million, up significantly from the prior year on higher LME prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs and lower product premiums Net sales of $1,589.1 million, a 20% increase over the prior year\n$MM (except shipments and per share data) Q3 2017 Q4 2017 FY 2016 FY 2017 Shipments (tonnes) 184,974 189,000 733,825 743,198 Net Sales $ 400.6 $ 433.8 $ 1,319.1 $ 1,589.1 Net Income/(Loss) 20.8 35.8 (252.4 ) 48.6 Diluted EPS 0.22 0.37 (2.90 ) 0.51 Adjusted Net Income/(Loss) 1 14.4 24.8 (67.1 ) 34.7 Adjusted EPS 1 0.15 0.26 (0.71 ) 0.36 Adjusted EBITDA 1 47.9 60.2 29.0 164.2 Notes: 1 - Non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures Century Aluminum Company reported net income of $35.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Results were favorably impacted by a $7.3 million non-cash gain related to the termination of certain legacy contractual obligations and negatively impacted by $3.1 million for lower of cost or net realizable value (\"NRV\") inventory adjustments. During the quarter, the remaining volume under our 2017 LME hedge contracts matured and adjusted net income reflects a reduction of $6.8 million for the final settlement of these hedges. This result compares to net income of $20.8 million for the third quarter of 2017, which included a $5.5 million non-cash gain related to a retirement benefit settlement and a $0.9 million unrealized gain related to LME forward sales.\nAdjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $24.8 million compared to adjusted net income of $14.4 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Century reported adjusted EBITDA of $60.2 million, up $12.3 million from the third quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher LME prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs.\nSales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $433.8 million compared with $400.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. Shipments of primary aluminum for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 189,000 tonnes compared with 184,974 tonnes shipped in the third quarter of 2017.\nCentury's cash position at quarter end was $167.2 million and revolver availability was $159.8 million.\nFor the full year 2017, Century reported net income of $48.6 million. Results were favorably impacted by $13.9 million in non-cash gains, primarily related to the termination of certain legacy contractual obligations.\nFor the full year 2016, Century reported a net loss of $252.4 million. Results were favorably impacted by a $0.7 million lower of cost or NRV inventory adjustment. Results were negatively impacted by $179.0 million in non-cash charges, primarily due to asset impairments, and a $6.9 million charge related to discrete tax items.\nSales for the full year 2017 were $1,589.1 million compared with $1,319.1 million for 2016. Shipments of primary aluminum for 2017 were 743,198 tonnes compared with 733,825 tonnes shipped in 2016.\n“Stable operations, favorable operating metrics and tight controllable cost management contributed to what we believe was a very good quarter,” commented Michael Bless, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Safety performance across the company was strong, with most plants achieving quarter over quarter improvement. As we had forecast, higher raw material costs impacted our results; this factor will carry over to the first quarter. That said, we have seen a welcome abatement of this trend, which should inure in our favor for the second quarter onwards. We are thus entering 2018 with a good handle on our controllable costs and an improving raw material environment.”\nBless continued, “Industry conditions continue to be volatile and complex. Western world demand for primary aluminum and aluminum products remains quite good; we see this environment continuing for the foreseeable future, barring of course the impact of any significant global macroeconomic shock. Initial efforts at supply discipline in China have had only mixed results, and they have recently been met with a deteriorating demand environment. We believe the impact will be another record year of exports from that country. The U.S. market remains the ultimate recipient of excess production from China and other major aluminum exporting regions in which state support has created and perpetuated excess capacity. It is only through adjustment of these imports into the U.S. that this situation, which continues to imperil what is left of the primary aluminum industry in this country, can be regularized. We are hopeful the Trump administration will follow through on its strong statements of intent to remedy this situation.”\n“We are optimistic as we look toward the coming year,” concluded Bless. “We are implementing modest investments in upgrading our product mix across the plants. We will need to make certain investments at Hawesville and Mt. Holly in order to maintain production at current levels; this spending, principally in the rebuilding of failed cells, has been deferred since we curtailed production in late 2015. In addition, we continue to investigate the restart of capacity at Hawesville, potentially with an advanced cell design which has shown attractive results. We believe the company is exceptionally well positioned to serve customers in a rational market environment and generate attractive returns for our shareholders.”\nAbout Century Aluminum\nCentury Aluminum Company owns primary aluminum capacity in the United States and Iceland. Century's corporate offices are located in Chicago, IL. Visit www.centuryaluminum.com for more information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to evaluate Century's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of Century’s ongoing operating performance and ability to generate cash. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance an overall understanding of Century’s performance and our investors’ ability to review Century’s business from the same perspective as management. The tables below, under the heading \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, Century's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA included in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures.\nCautionary Statement\nThis press release and statements made by Century Aluminum Company management on the quarterly conference call contain \" \" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
