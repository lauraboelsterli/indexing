    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Integrity Marketing Group, LLC (“Integrity”), announced today that it has completed the acquisition of Western Penn Marketing (“Western Penn”), a Mesa, Arizona-based company focused on selling life and health insurance to the Senior Market. Ted Ruttinger, owner and CEO of Western Penn, has become an owner in Integrity as part of the deal. Financial terms of the private transaction were not disclosed.\nFounded in 1987, Western Penn specializes in marketing Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage plans throughout the United States. The combined business expands Integrity’s national footprint with a market-leading agency in key markets including Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and Oregon. All employees of Western Penn will maintain their current roles with the company and will continue to operate under the Western Penn brand.\nWestern Penn is a long-time Diamond Partner of AIMC, a company Integrity acquired in 2017. This partnership allows Western Penn to grow and expand more rapidly with access to more insurance carriers and more services to offer to their agents.\n“When AIMC joined Integrity, I knew I wanted to be part of this amazing organization that Mike White and other Senior Market leaders were building together,” Ruttinger said. “Integrity has the technology, marketing systems and carrier contracts that will help Western Penn agents take our business to the next level. Scale is important to be successful today and I am excited to join the team.”\n“It’s great to now be equity partners with Ted after working with him for over 30 years,” said Mike White, CEO of AIMC and Managing Partner of Integrity. “The platform we are building allows entrepreneurs like Ted and myself to diversify our personal assets by taking some chips off the table, while significantly growing the business at the same time.”\nWestern Penn brings a wealth of regional expertise in the Southwest where there is a large population of Seniors that are in need of the products Integrity offers, and a proven track record which is evident by its deep and long-lasting relationships with the agents and agencies that it serves.\n“Ted and his team have built an incredible business around providing the highest level of service to agents, and we are excited to welcome Western Penn to the team of Integrity companies,” said Bryan W. Adams, Co-Founder & CEO of Integrity. “It is an honor to have another thought leader in Ted who shares our vision as we continue to look for owners of quality businesses to join our partnership.”\nAbout Integrity Marketing Group\nIntegrity Marketing Group, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is the nation’s leading independent distributor of life and health insurance products focused on serving the Senior Market.
