    "text": "EditorsNote: Updated a few factual inconsistencies\nEric Bledsoe scored 12 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Brooklyn Nets 109-94 Sunday afternoon at Barclays Center.\nBledsoe helped Milwaukee beat the Nets for the 10th straight time by making 12 of 20 shots. He posted his sixth game with at least 25 points with the Bucks and finished two shy of his season high set Nov. 22 at Phoenix.\nBledsoe made 5 of 7 shots in the fourth quarter when Milwaukee pulled away again after blowing a significant portion of its 28-point lead in the third.\nThe Nets were within 88-81 following a 3-pointer by Spencer Dinwiddie with 8:50 remaining, but Milwaukee finished the game with a 21-13 push.\nBledsoe helped the Bucks finish off their latest win over the Nets with an 18-foot pull-up jumper with 7:52 left, a 21-footer with 6:46 to go and a 3-pointer 2 1/2 minutes later for a 103-89 lead.\nJohn Henson added 19 points and 18 rebounds for Milwaukee, which is 6-1 since firing coach Jason Kidd on Jan. 22.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo contributed 16 and eight rebounds, highlighting his showing with three dunks. He also appeared to tweak his right ankle stepping on Brooklyn forward DeMarre Carroll’s foot with about 7 1/2 minutes left but did not head back to the locker room and was able to stand up to cheer on his teammates down the stretch.\nKhris Middleton chipped in 16 and Jabari Parker finished with 11 in his second game back from last year’s knee injury as Milwaukee shot 51.9 percent and controlled the glass by a 54-36 margin.\nCarroll and Caris LeVert led the Nets with 15 points apiece as Brooklyn lost for the sixth time in seven games. Rookie Jarrett Allen added 14 while Allen Crabbe finished with 11 as Brooklyn shot 41.1 percent and missed 20 of 29 3-point attempts.\nMilwaukee pushed its lead to 71-43 on a put-back dunk by Henson with 8:12 remaining in the third but Brooklyn finished the quarter with a 29-12 spurt.\nThe Nets cut it to single digits at 81-72 on a 3-pointer by Nik Stauskas with 86 seconds left.\nMilwaukee took an 83-72 lead into the fourth before Bledsoe halted Brooklyn’s comeback attempt.\n-- Field Level Media\n ",
