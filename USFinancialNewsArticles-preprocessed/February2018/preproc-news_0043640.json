    "text": "GRAND CAYMAN, Cayman Islands, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (NASDAQ:GLRE) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Greenlight Re reported a net loss of $37.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $49.2 million for the same period in 2016. The net loss per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.02, compared to fully diluted net income per share of $1.31 for the same period in 2016.\nFully diluted adjusted book value per share was $22.22 as of December 31, 2017, a 5.0% decrease from $23.38 per share as of December 31, 2016.\nManagement Commentary\nSimon Burton, Chief Executive Officer of Greenlight Re, stated, “Our fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by reserve strengthening, an investment loss and, to a lesser extent, losses from the California wildfires. The reserving action taken this quarter is the result of a detailed ground-up review led by our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Belfatti, during his first full quarter with the Company. Our current underwriting portfolio performed acceptably well in the quarter and I’m pleased with our progress in repositioning the business.”\nDavid Einhorn, Chairman of the Board of Directors, stated, “2017 continued to be a challenging environment for our investment style as our managed portfolio returned 1.5% for the year. Despite the headwinds caused by natural catastrophic events and reserve strengthening, I am pleased with the proactive actions taken by our management team during the second half of 2017.”\nFinancial and Operating Highlights\nFourth Quarter 2017\nGross written premiums were $139.0 million, compared to $148.8 million in the prior year period. Net written premiums were $96.3 million compared to $146.6 million in the prior year period. Gross premium ceded increased during the fourth quarter as the Company ceded off a portion of its non-standard automobile business.\nNet earned premiums were $141.1 million, a 3.3% increase compared to $136.6 million in the prior year period.\nNet investment loss was $16.2 million (or 1.3%) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net investment income of $52.9 million for the prior year period.\nUnderwriting loss was $19.7 million, compared to underwriting income of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in this underwriting loss is an estimated $4.7 million loss, net of reinstatement premiums, from the recent California wildfires.\nThe Company strengthened prior year reserves by $16.5 million during the period primarily due from additional reporting on individual claims as well as industry wide performance on professional liability exposures and to a lesser extent due to higher reserves on various casualty and multi-line contracts.\nComposite ratio for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 111.8%, compared to 96.3% for the prior-year period. Combined ratio for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 114.0%, compared to 99.0% in the prior year period. Catastrophe losses contributed 3.5 percentage points to the composite and combined ratio for the three month period.\n2017 Annual\nGross written premiums were $692.7 million, an increase of 29.2% from $536.1 million in the prior year. Net written premiums increased to $636.1 million, compared to $526.1 million in the prior year.\nNet premiums earned increased 22.0% to $626.0 million, from $513.1 million in the prior year.\nNet investment income was $20.2 million (or 1.5%), compared to net investment income of $76.2 million during 2016.\nThe composite ratio was 106.1%, compared to 100.4% for the prior-year. Combined ratio for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 108.6%, compared to 103.6% in the prior year. Catastrophe losses contributed 6.9 percentage points to the composite and combined ratios for the year.\nNet loss was $45.0 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared to net income of $44.9 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in 2016.\nConference Call Details\nGreenlight Re will hold a live conference call to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 on Wednesday February 21, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.

Book value is adjusted by subtracting the amount of the non-controlling interest in joint venture from total shareholders’ equity to calculate adjusted book value. We believe that long term growth in fully diluted adjusted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial performance because it provides management and investors a yardstick by which to monitor the shareholder value generated. In addition, fully diluted adjusted book value per share may be of benefit to our investors, shareholders and other interested parties to form a basis of comparison with other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry.\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used in the calculation of net income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. The measure includes underwriting expenses which are directly related to underwriting activities as well as an allocation of other general and administrative expenses. Net underwriting income (loss) is calculated as net premiums earned, less net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred, less, acquisition costs and less underwriting expenses. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) net investment income; (2) any foreign exchange gains or losses; (3) corporate general and administrative expenses; (4) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, and (5) income taxes and income attributable to non-controlling interest. We exclude net investment income and foreign exchange gains or losses as we believe these are influenced by market conditions and other factors not related to underwriting decisions. We exclude corporate general and administrative expenses because these expenses are generally fixed and not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations. We include other income and expense relating to deposit accounted contracts and industry loss warranty contracts which we believe are part of our underwriting operations and should be reflected in our underwriting income (loss). Net underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.
