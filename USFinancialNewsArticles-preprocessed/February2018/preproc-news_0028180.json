    "text": "BEIRUT, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Lebanese Energy Minister Cesar Abi Khalil vowed on Friday there would be full exploration in offshore energy Block 9, part of which lies in waters disputed by neighbouring Israel.\nLebanon said on Friday it had signed its first offshore oil and gas exploration and production contracts for two energy blocks. A consortium of France’s Total, Italy’s Eni and Russia’s Novatek signed contracts for two of the five blocks that Lebanon put up for tender.\nIsrael and Lebanon have exchanged threats and condemnation over the tender, amid rising tensions over territorial and marine boundaries.
