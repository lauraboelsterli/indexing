The company said last week that Egizio Bianchini, former co-head of BMO Capital Markets' global metals and mining group, would become its executive vice chairman. * First Majestic Silver Corp was the second-biggest gainer, rising 9.4 percent. * Copper futures rose 1.6 percent to $6,862 a tonne at 4:07 p.m. (2107 GMT), while silver added 0.9 percent to $16.50 an ounce and gold prices advanced 0.4 percent to $1,322.02 an ounce. * Aecon Group was the worst performer, with a 1.8 percent drop after its $1.5 billion takeover by China's CCCC International Holding was delayed because of an extended national security review of the deal by Canada. * Yamana Gold and marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp were the most actively traded stocks on the index. * There were 231 advancing stocks and 13 declining ones on the index.
