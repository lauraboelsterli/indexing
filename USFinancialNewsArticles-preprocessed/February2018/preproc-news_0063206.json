Alala, III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We continue to make progress on our short-term goals of making quality first lien debt investments in the lower middle market, monetization and rotation of equity positions, and a reduction in our non-performing investments. Continued execution of our short-term goals should position us well to achieve our longer-term strategy of consistent distribution coverage and stability and growth of our net asset value per share.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company originated $43.1 million of new investments, and received $11.1 million of repayments. Debt investments represented 93% of fourth quarter investment activity, of which 96% were first lien structures. The weighted average annualized yield on the debt investments was 11.2%.\nTotal investment income was $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $16.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest, fee and PIK income collectively were $4.7 million lower in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from a decline in the Company’s investment portfolio and the impact of higher non-accrual balances. All other income decreased by $0.2 million from the comparable periods.\nTotal expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $7.4 million, compared to $9.8 million for the comparable period in 2016. The decrease of $2.4 million is attributable to (1) a decrease in interest and financing expenses of $0.6 million, and (2) a decrease of $1.7 million in incentive fees as incentive fees were not earned for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet investment income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.2 million, or $0.26 per share, compared to $6.7 million, or $0.43 per share, 2016.\nNet realized losses totaled $23.4 million, or $1.47 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net gains of $2.1 million, or $0.13 per share, 2016. During the quarter, the Company realized losses related to Print Direction, Inc. ($22.4 million), Portrait Innovations, Inc. ($1.8 million) and Immersive Media Tactical Solutions, LLC ($2.0 million), partially offset by gains related to Brunswick Bowling Products, Inc. ($2.5 million) and other gains totaling $0.3 million.\nNet unrealized appreciation totaled $17.3 million, or $1.08 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to depreciation of $0.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $1.4 million primarily related to net operating losses incurred by our blocker corporations. There was no tax provision for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was $0.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.04 per share, compared to a net increase of $8.1 million, or $0.51 per share, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nDuring 2017, the Company originated $82.8 million of new investments and received $115.8 million of repayments. New debt investments totaled $76.5 million, 91% of which were first lien secured.\nTotal investment income was $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $68.3 million 2016. Interest, fee and PIK income decreased by $15.8 million, driven by a reduction in investments outstanding during the comparable period along with an increase in investments on non-accrual status. Dividend income decreased by $1.6 million resulting from the wind down of Capitala Senior Liquid Loan Fund I during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $35.6 million, a decrease of $3.7 million from the comparable period in 2016. Significant variances included (1) a decrease of $4.8 million related to incentive fees, net of the waiver, (2) a $0.9 million decrease in interest and financing fees, (3) a $0.8 million decrease in management fees, and (4) an increase of $2.7 million related to the loss on the extinguishment of debt during the second quarter of 2017.\nNet investment income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $15.5 million, or $0.98 per share, compared to $29.0 million, or $1.84 per share, 2016.\nNet realized losses totaled $24.2 million, or $1.52 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to losses of $22.8 million, or $1.44 per share, 2016.\nNet unrealized appreciation totaled $3.0 million, or $0.19 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net unrealized appreciation of $2.9 million, or $0.18 per share, 2016.\nDuring 2017, the Company recorded a tax provision of $1.3 million primarily related to net income from our blocker corporations. There was no income tax expense recorded in 2016.\nThe net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was $7.0 million, or $0.44 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $9.2 million, or $0.58 per share, 2016.\nNet assets at December 31, 2017 were $221.9 million, or $13.91 per share, compared to $250.6 million, or $15.79 per share, at December 31, 2016.\nInvestment Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2017, our portfolio consisted of 47 companies with a fair market value of $499.9 million and a cost basis of $465.0 million.
