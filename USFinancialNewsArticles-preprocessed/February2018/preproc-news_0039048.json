    "text": "SEATTLE, Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Impinj, Inc. (NASDAQ:PI), a leading provider and pioneer of RAIN RFID solutions for identifying, locating and authenticating everyday items, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2017. Revenue in 2017 was $26.9 million, less than the $29.0 to $30.0 million range shared in the February 1 preliminary announcement. The decrease is due to Impinj agreeing to a partner’s request for a one-time product exchange after the preliminary revenue estimates were previously announced, requiring an accounting reserve in 2017. Impinj expects to recognize the revenue in the first quarter of 2018 when the exchange is completed. As a result, Impinj is increasing the revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2018 by $3.25 million, to between $23.25 and $25.25 million.\n“Our fourth quarter revenue included strong fixed-reader unit-volume growth of 42% year-over-year,” said Chris Diorio, Impinj co-founder and CEO. \"As we announced earlier this month, we anticipate softness in our first-quarter 2018 endpoint IC volumes and revenue due to shortened lead times contributing to a reduction in our order backlog, as well as ongoing reductions in inlay-partner inventory,” Diorio continued. “We remain confident in our market opportunity, position, and in our vision of identifying, locating and authenticating every item in our everyday world, and connecting every one of those items to the cloud.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Summary\nRevenue declined 20% year-over-year to $26.9 million GAAP gross margin of 48.4%; non-GAAP gross margin of 50.5% GAAP net loss of $9.3 million, or loss of $0.45 per basic and diluted share using 20.9 million shares Adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.8 million Non-GAAP net loss of $5.9 million, or loss of $0.28 per diluted share using 20.9 million shares\nFull Year 2017 Financial Summary\nRevenue grew 12% year-over-year to $125.3 million GAAP gross margin of 51.8%; non-GAAP gross margin of 53.4% GAAP net loss of $17.3 million, or a loss of $0.84 per basic and diluted share using 20.7 million shares Adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.6 million Non-GAAP net loss of $6.1 million, or loss of $0.29 per diluted share using 20.7 million shares\nA reconciliation between historical GAAP and non-GAAP information, including weighted-average basic and diluted shares, is contained in the tables below.
