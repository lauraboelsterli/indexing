    "text": "Taxes Arming teachers in schools should be 'up to states' to decide, Trump tweets President Donald Trump tweeted that arming teachers as a deterrent against such often deadly violence should be \"Up to States.\" Trump has heavily promoted the idea of putting \"gun-adept\" teachers and staff carrying concealed firearms in classrooms and schools to protect students. His comments follow this month's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people, most of them students. Published 17 Hours Ago Leah Millis | Reuters President Donald Trump speaks about the mass shooting at a Florida high school in a national address from the White House in Washington, U.S., February 15, 2018. \nPresident Donald Trump appeared Saturday to begin refining his proposals for combatting school violence, tweeting that arming teachers as a deterrent against such often deadly violence — an idea he championed in recent days — is \"Up to States.\" \nTrump heavily promoted the idea of putting \"gun-adept\" teachers and staff carrying concealed firearms in classrooms and schools to protect students following this month's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people, most of them students. \nHe called for bonuses for educators who volunteer to carry a firearm, and said he also wanted action to strengthen background checks and boost the minimum age for the purchase of assault-style weapons. \nExpectations were raised that Trump would propose federal legislation on arming teachers, but that no longer appeared to be the case Saturday. \n\"Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept & have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again - a big & very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States,\" Trump tweeted. Donald Trump tweet \nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the president's tweet. \nThe White House has yet to offer a complete plan to address school violence amid the public outcry sparked by the Florida shooting, including addressing who would bear the financial cost. Trump said in the tweet that arming educators and paying their bonuses would be \"very inexpensive.\" \nAsked on Thursday whether the federal government or state and local municipalities would pay the millions of dollars it would cost to train and arm teachers, White House spokesman Raj Shah said \"the policy hasn't been fleshed out,\" adding \"Do we really think that that's too much to pay for school safety?\" \nTeachers and law enforcement organizations oppose the idea, while several states are considering arming teachers. \nTrump spent several days earlier this week hearing emotional pleas from parents and students, including some who survived the Parkland shooting, and others who had lost children in school shootings in Connecticut and Colorado. He also solicited input from state and local officials. \nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence have said school safety will be a top agenda item when they meet with the nation's governors next week.",
