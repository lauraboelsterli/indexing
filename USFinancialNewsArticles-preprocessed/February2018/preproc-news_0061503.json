    "text": "FLORENCE, S.C., Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- First Reliance Bancshares, Inc. (OTC: FSRL), the holding company (the \"Company\") for First Reliance Bank (the \"Bank\"), reported a fourth quarter 2017 net loss of $2,719,627, or $0.34 per diluted share. The Company's adjusted net income was $426,266, or $0.05 per diluted share, excluding an estimated tax charge of $2.7 million, related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and non-recurring merger related expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of $501,265 totaling $0.39 per diluted share. The tax charge was attributed entirely to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets (\"DTAs\").\nThe Company's DTAs are estimates of future tax benefits that arose primarily from expenses that were reported on current and previous years' financial statements but are not deductible for tax purposes until future years' tax returns (e.g., provisions for loan losses for probably incurred losses that are reported on financial statements as compared to tax returns where deductions are reported only when loans are charged off). On December 22, 2017, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, the Company's federal income tax rate decreased from 34% to 21% effective in 2018, and the DTAs were revalued accordingly. While the revaluation of DTAs decreases 2017 net income, the lower federal tax rate beginning in 2018 is expected to increase net income in the future years.\nCore profitability continues to be driven by strong loan and deposit growth and expanding operating efficiencies, but has been impacted temporarily with the opening of two new branch offices, an OREO write-down of $541,527 on a pending sale totaling $1.6 million expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, and a decline in mortgage income stemming from a slowdown in correspondent bank mortgage originations.\nOn January 22, 2018, we completed the legal closing of the acquisition of Independence Bancshares, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Independence National Bank (\"Independence\"). The operational conversion is scheduled for early March 2018. This expansion into the attractive Greenville market will continue to broaden our footprint throughout South Carolina. The closing of this transaction comes on the heels of several new significant developments for the Bank over the past six months, including raising $25.1 million of additional capital in September 2017, Jack McElveen joining the bank in September 2017 as Chief Credit Officer, Kemper Kenan joining the bank as City Executive for Greenville, South Carolina in late 2017, David Barksdale joining the bank as President of North Carolina in early 2018, and Ben Brazell being named as President of South Carolina in early 2018. In early first quarter of 2018, we received regulatory approval to open our Myrtle Beach branch location and hired Ron Paige as City Executive for the Myrtle Beach market.\nFinancial Highlights (at or for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, except as noted)\nCompleted legal closing of Independence Banchshares on January 22, 2018. The combined company is expected to have approximately $532.9 million in assets. Operational full conversion of systems is expected to be completed by March 5, 2018. Received regulatory approval for expansion into Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Planned expansion into Charlotte, North Carolina Q1 2018. Opened a loan production office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Loan growth is up $45.5 million, or 16%, while earning asset yields at the Bank remain stable at 4.61% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.60% for the same period of 2016. Non-interest bearing checking accounts increased $10 million to 24% of total deposits from one year ago, as we continue to attract new customers through unique programs and the convenience of mobile banking. Total Deposits increased $16.5 million from one year ago as the Company continues to leverage its low cost of funds at 36bps. Net interest margin (NIM) was 4.29% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nReview of Income Statement\nNet interest income improved 9% at $1.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016. Late in the third quarter of 2017, the Company paid off its $7.0 million senior secured loan, which will reduce interest expense by approximately $350,000 annually. The improvement in net interest income is due to growth in earning assets while earning asset yields remain stable at 4.61% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.60% for the same period 2016.\nNoninterest income decreased 17% to $8.34 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $10 million for the same period 2016. The decrease in noninterest income was largely due to a one time gain on the sale of bank premise totaling $652,367 in the fourth quarter 2016 and the decrease in gains on sale of mortgage loans on a year-over-year basis as a result of lower production volumes within the Company's correspondent mortgage channel due to lower levels of refinancing opportunities. However, the Company's retail mortgage channel within each operating market increased production volumes year-over-year by $4 million and continues to build core franchise value and provide customer acquisition opportunities.\nBalance Sheet and Asset Quality\nTotal assets increased $50.2 million, or 12% to $458.4 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $408.1 million from December 31, 2016.\nLoans receivable grew by $45.5 million , or 15%, to $333.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $288.1 million, at December 31, 2016 largely due to continued growth in all our markets including commercial portfolios, 1-4 family mortgage portfolios and our consumer loan portfolios. 1-4 Family mortgage portfolio loans are up 26%, Commercial Real Estate loans are up 22%, and Consumer loans are up 20% year over year. \"Continued earning asset growth is the primary focus going into 2018 with emphasis on consumer and commercial loans throughout the branch network and commercial loan growth in our new markets which include Winston-Salem and Myrtle Beach.\nTransaction and Savings deposits increased by $7.1 million, or 11%, to $275.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $268.6 million at December 31, 2016. Household checking accounts increased by 4% reflecting our strong year-over-year branch sales growth. \"We continue to focus on creating an exceptional customer experience to drive a differentiated level of service to our customers and we continuously upgrade customer channels to expand customer convenience and improve our efficiency,\" said Rick Saunders, Chief Executive Officer.\nNonperforming assets declined $2.4 million to $3.0 million at December 31, 2017 compared to one year ago. The Company incurred a write down on OREO totaling $541,527 during the quarter relating to a pending sale totaling $1.6 million expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets declined to 0.67% at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.34% one year earlier. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 0.72% at December 31, 2017, compared to 0.90% one year earlier. For the fourth quarter of 2017, loan charge offs were nominal and largely offset by the bank recoveries.\nCapital\nFirst Reliance Bank continues to remain well capitalized under all regulatory measures with capital ratios exceeding the statutory well-capitalized thresholds by an ample margin. At December 31, 2017, capital ratios were as follows:\nRatio\nFirst Reliance Bank\nWell-capitalized Minimum\nTier 1 leverage ratio\n9.50%\n5.00%\nCommon equity tier 1 capital\n11.64%\n6.50%\nTier 1 capital ratio\n11.64%\n8.00%\nTotal capital ratio\n12.32%\n10.00%\nABOUT FIRST RELIANCE BANCSHARES, INC.\nFirst Reliance Bancshares, Inc. is the holding company for First Reliance Bank.
