    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court has accepted an indictment seeking up to 18 years in jail for German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel and decided to release him from custody pending trial, state-run Anadolu news agency said on Friday.\nYucel, a reporter for German newspaper Die Welt, was taken into custody a year ago on suspicion of spreading propaganda in support of a terrorist organization. He denied the accusation. The German Foreign Ministry earlier confirmed his release.\nWriting by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
