    "text": "Published: Feb 18, 2018 4:20 p.m. ET Share \nPresident minimizes effects of Russian misinformation campaign Reuters President Donald Trump speaks at the White House in October. \nBy Julie Bykowicz Janet Hook \nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump used Twitter over the weekend to respond to the latest moves by special counsel Robert Mueller, repeating that his campaign didn’t collude with Russia. He also played down the impact that Russian actions had on the election. \nTrump’s volley of a dozen Russia-related tweets Saturday and Sunday came after Mueller’s blockbuster indictment Friday of three Russian companies and 13 Russian nationals for engaging in a widespread effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Russia’s concentrated social media effort attacked Democrat Hillary Clinton, promoted Trump, and aimed to sow divisions among Americans, the indictment charges. \nTrump is spending the three-day weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in South Florida, not far from the school where a teenager shot and killed 17 people last week. Trump and first lady Melania Trump stopped to visit victims and first responders as they landed in Florida on Friday night. Trump made no public appearances Saturday or early Sunday but made calls to local officials offering the nation’s support as the community reels from the deadly assault, according to White House officials. \nOne of Trump’s tweets Sunday morning knit together the two major developments. “Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign — there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!” \nIn several Sunday morning tweets, Trump praised his own candidacy, saying Democrats continue to use the Russia interference plot as an “excuse” for why Clinton lost. If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018 I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said “it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018 General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018 Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!",
