    "text": "MURFREESBORO, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- National Health Investors, Inc. (NYSE:NHI) announced today its net income attributable to common stockholders, its Funds From Operations (“FFO”), its Normalized Funds From Operations and its Normalized Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nQ4 2017 Highlights\nAnnounced $49.9 million in real estate acquisitions and loans; $215.2 million for the full year Maintained low leverage balance sheet at 4.2x net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA Portfolio lease coverage remains strong at 1.66x GAAP net income of $.90 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter; $3.87 for the full year Normalized FFO up 6.3% over fourth quarter 2016; up 8.6% for the full year Normalized AFFO up 5.2% over fourth quarter 2016; up 8.2% for the full year\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company currently expects Normalized FFO for 2018 to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.51 per diluted common share and Normalized AFFO to be in the range of $4.99 to $5.03 per diluted common share. The Company’s guidance range for the full year 2018, with underlying assumptions and timing of certain transactions, is set forth and reconciled below:\nFull-Year\n2018 Range\nLow High Net income per diluted share attributable to common stockholders $ 3.79 $ 3.83 Plus: Depreciation 1.66 1.68 Normalized FFO per diluted common share $ 5.45 $ 5.51 Less: Straight-line rental income (0.53 ) (0.55 ) Plus: Amortization of debt issuance costs 0.05 0.05 Plus: Amortization of original issue discount 0.02 0.02 Normalized AFFO per diluted common share $ 4.99 $ 5.03 The Company’s guidance range reflects the existence of volatile economic conditions, but does not assume any material deterioration in tenant credit quality and/or performance of its portfolio. The Company has completed $28 million of new investments since December 31, 2017. The Company currently estimates it will close an additional $65 million of new lease investments by mid-year at initial lease rates of approximately 7% and will fund other commitments and new investments of $80 million throughout 2018 at initial yields of approximately 8%. The guidance is based on a number of assumptions, many of which are outside the Company’s control and all of which are subject to change. The Company’s guidance range allows for the uncertainty inherent in the structure and timing of the financing required to fund previously announced investments and any pending new investments. The Company’s guidance may change if actual results vary from these assumptions.\nFinancial Results\nNet income attributable to common stockholders per diluted common share for 31, 2017, was $.90, a decrease of 12.6% from the same period in the prior year. Net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $3.87, unchanged from the same period in the prior year. Normalized FFO per diluted common share for 31, 2017, was $1.35, an increase of 6.3% over the same period in the prior year. Normalized FFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $5.29, an increase of 8.6% over the same period in the prior year. Normalized AFFO per diluted common share for 31, 2017 was $1.21, an increase of 5.2% over the same period in the prior year. Normalized AFFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.75, an increase of 8.2% over the same period in the prior year. FFO per diluted common share for 31, 2017, was $1.31, a decrease of 8.4% from the same period in the prior year. FFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $5.50, an increase of 4.8% from the same period in the prior year. FFO and net income attributable to common stockholders for 31, 2017 includes $1.6 million in write-offs related to early retirement of a portion of our convertible debt. FFO and net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 included, in addition to the above-mentioned items, gains on sales of marketable securities of $10.0 million, an additional $590,000 related to early retirement of a portion of our convertible debt, and $922,000 recognized into income on a mortgage note payoff.\nFFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and applied by us, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, if any. The Company defines Normalized FFO as FFO adjusted for certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing FFO for the current period to similar prior periods. We define Normalized AFFO as Normalized FFO excluding the effects of straight-line lease revenue, amortization of debt issuance costs and the non-cash amortization of the original issue discount of our unsecured convertible notes. These supplemental non-GAAP performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders is a calculation of our net income, defined as the results of our operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated joint ventures, if any.\nThe reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to our FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized Funds Available for Distribution (“FAD”) is included as a table to this press release and filed in the Company’s Form 10-Q Commission.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nNHI will host a conference call on Friday, February 16, 2018, at 12 p.m. ET, to discuss fourth quarter results. The number to call for this interactive teleconference is (800) 926-7748 with the confirmation number, 21881542. The live broadcast of NHI’s fourth quarter available online at www.nhireit.com .

Consequently, our Funds From Operations (“FFO”), Normalized FFO, Normalized Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) and Normalized Funds Available for Distribution (“FAD”) may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other REITs. Since other REITs may not use our definition of these operating performance measures, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company’s FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD to that of other REITs. These financial performance measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (these measures do not include changes in operating assets and liabilities) and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance, or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.\nFunds From Operations - FFO\nFFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and applied by us, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, if any. The Company’s computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from that of the Company; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company’s FFO to that of other REITs. Diluted FFO assumes the exercise of stock options and other potentially dilutive securities. Normalized FFO excludes from FFO certain items which, due to their infrequent or unpredictable nature, may create some difficulty in comparing FFO for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, and recoveries of previous write-downs.\nWe believe that FFO and normalized FFO are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative, and should be supplemented with a measure such as FFO. The term FFO was designed by the REIT industry to address this issue.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations - AFFO\nIn addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized FFO, normalized AFFO excludes the impact of any straight-line lease revenue, amortization of the original issue discount on our convertible senior notes and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nWe believe that normalized AFFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT. GAAP requires a lessor to recognize contractual lease payments into income on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease. This straight-line adjustment has the effect of reporting lease income that is significantly more or less than the contractual cash flows received pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement. GAAP also requires the original issue discount of our convertible senior notes and debt issuance costs to be amortized as non-cash adjustments to earnings. Normalized AFFO is useful to our investors as it reflects the growth inherent in the contractual lease payments of our real estate portfolio.\nFunds Available for Distribution - FAD\nIn addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized AFFO, normalized FAD excludes the impact of non-cash stock based compensation.\nWe believe that normalized FAD is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT as a useful indicator of the ability to distribute dividends to shareholders. Additionally, normalized FAD improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods and (iii) results among REITs, more meaningful. Because FAD may function as a liquidity measure, we do not present FAD on a per-share basis.\nCondensed Statements of Income (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues: Rental income $ 68,050 $ 61,009 $ 265,127 $ 232,353 Interest income from mortgage and other notes 3,009 3,669 13,134 13,805 Investment income and other 24 339 398 2,302 71,083 65,017 278,659 248,460 Expenses: Depreciation 17,167 15,887 67,173 59,525 Interest expense 11,185 11,364 46,324 43,108 Legal 77 16 494 422 Franchise, excise and other taxes 157 183 960 1,009 General and administrative 3,075 2,554 12,217 9,773 Loan and realty losses — — — 15,856 31,661 30,004 127,168 129,693 Income before equity-method investee, TRS tax benefit, investment and other gains and noncontrolling interest\n39,422 35,013 151,491 118,767 Loss from equity-method investee — — — (1,214 ) Loss on convertible note retirement (1,624 ) — (2,214 ) — Income tax benefit attributable to taxable REIT subsidiary — — — (749 ) Investment and other gains — 6,175 10,088 35,912 Net income 37,798 41,188 159,365 152,716 Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — — — (1,176 ) Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 37,798 $ 41,188 $ 159,365 $ 151,540 Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 41,532,130 39,847,860 40,894,219 39,013,412 Diluted 41,803,615 39,993,445 41,151,453 39,155,380 Earnings per common share: Net income attributable to common stockholders - basic $ .91 $ 1.03 $ 3.90 $ 3.88 Net income attributable to common stockholders - diluted $ .90 $ 1.03 $ 3.87 $ 3.87 Regular dividends declared per common share $ .95 $ .90 $ 3.80 $ 3.60 Selected Balance Sheet Data (in thousands) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Real estate properties, net $ 2,285,701 $ 2,159,774 Mortgage and other notes receivable, net $ 141,486 $ 133,493 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,063 $ 4,636 Straight-line rent receivable $ 97,359 $ 72,518 Other assets $ 18,212 $ 33,212 Debt $ 1,145,497 $ 1,115,981 Stockholders’ equity $ 1,322,117 $ 1,209,590 This press release includes within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
