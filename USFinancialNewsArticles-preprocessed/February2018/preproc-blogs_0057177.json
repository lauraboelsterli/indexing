    "text": "Just days after her father controversially suggested teachers should be armed at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Ivanka Trump shared her own view on the matter.\nRead: Trump Proposes ‘Bonus’ for Teachers Who Carry Guns in the Classroom\nPresident Trump suggested that “well-trained, gun-adept teachers and coaches” should carry arms in school, under a concealed carry permit last week, as it would “be a major deterrent” to potential future school shootings.\nIn an interview with NBC on Sunday, Ivanka conceded that she didn’t know if teachers bearing arms would make her children any safer. “Obviously, there would have to be an incredibly high standard for who would be able to bear arms in our school,” she went on. “But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.”\nRead: In Early Morning Tweetstorm, Trump Lays Out His Plan For Guns in Schools\nWhen asked whether she thought her father would seek her advice on the matter, she said, “I think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.”",
