The SlashNext Internet Access Protection System is a cloud powered solution that leverages cognitive computing, a process that mimics how the human brain senses, reasons and responds to stimulus, to process and detect complex and interlinked Internet access attacks including social engineering and phishing, malware, exploits and callbacks.\nSlashNext CEO Atif Mushtaq founded the company after serving nine years as a senior scientist for FireEye, where he was a leading architect of the company's core malware detection system based on signatures and sandbox based technologies. Atif has been at the forefront in the fight against cybercrimes and has worked with law enforcement and other global organizations to take down some of the world's biggest cybercrime networks. In 2012, his efforts took down one of the largest email spam networks operating out of Russia, causing the worldwide spam level to drop by 50% in a single day.\nTo learn more about SlashNext and to keep up on the latest news, visit: www.SlashNext.com , follow @slashnextinc on Twitter, and read the company blog at: www.slashnext.com/blog\nMedia Contact:\nLisa Cravens\nLumina Communications\nSlashNext@LuminaPR.com\n831-239-4652\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/slashnext-expands-executive-leadership-team-with-security-and-saas-industry-sales-veteran-ed-greene-300594917.html\nSOURCE SlashNext",
