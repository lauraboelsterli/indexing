    "text": "188 COMMENTS Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, a former Navy SEAL and best-selling author, was indicted by a St. Louis grand jury Thursday for invasion of privacy stemming from a 2015 extramarital affair.\nThe indictment, announced by City of St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner, came amid an investigation launched by her office after reports that the Republican governor had threatened to release nude photos of a former mistress if she publicly spoke about their affair.\nMr. Greitens’s attorney didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking comment, but told local media that the charges were “baseless and unfounded.”\nMr. Greitens, who served several tours of a duty as a Navy SEAL, admitted earlier this year to cheating on his wife after a local news station released recordings of the woman describing a sexual relationship with the governor.\nThe indictment states that Mr. Greitens knowingly photographed the unnamed victim in partial or full nudity without her knowledge and consent. He then transmitted the image to a computer, according to the indictment.\nMs. Gardner, a Democrat, said in a statement that “it is essential for residents of the City of St. Louis and our state to have confidence in their leaders” and know that her office “will hold public officials accountable.” She added that the investigation hasn’t been closed.\nRepublican Rep. State Senator Rob Schaaf, who previously called for Mr. Greitens to resign over the affair, said on Twitter Thursday evening, “...he’s done,” with the hashtag moleg, for Missouri legislature.\nAfter the indictment was announced, the Democratic Governors Association called on Mr. Greitens to step down immediately.\n“Everything about Eric Greitens—his dark money, his lies, his scandals, his crimes—has been a stain on Missouri. Through it all, the Republican Establishment has stood by him. Change can’t come soon enough,” said Missouri Democratic Pary Chairman Stephen Webber.\nA representative for the Missouri Republican Senate caucus didn’t immediately return a call for comment.\nIn January, after the affair came to light, Mr. Greitens and his wife, Sheena, released a statement saying the couple dealt with the affair privately and honestly. His wife said she had forgiven him and asked others to forgive him as well.\n“We understand that there will be some people who cannot forgive—but for those who can find it in your heart, Eric asks for your forgiveness, and we are grateful for your love, your compassion, and your prayers,” Ms. Greitens said at the time.\nMr. Greitens, who was elected governor in 2016, touted his status as a non-career politician and said he would challenge special interests and fight corruption. A former Democrat-turned Republican, Mr. Greitens spent his time in office challenging unions, going after the $10 state minimum wage and cutting back on regulations.\nIn a September interview with The Wall Street Journal’s opinion section, Mr. Greitens deflected criticism of his policies. “We know that we’re always going to get criticized and we recognize that there are certain liberal media institutions in the state of Missouri that will always see whatever we do in the worst possible light.”\nA graduate of Duke University and a Rhodes Scholar, Mr. Greitens started a security consulting firm and an organization that helped veterans acclimate to civilian life after his four overseas deployments in the mid-2000s. He also wrote two best-selling books on lessons learned from his experiences and in 2013 Time magazine named him one of the world’s 100 most influential people.\nWrite to Shayndi Raice at shayndi.raice@wsj.com",
