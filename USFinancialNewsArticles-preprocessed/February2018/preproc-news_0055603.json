We are very proud of the dedicated effort and work of the team members across our portfolio of businesses and at our Las Vegas Service Center, which is the driving force behind the positive financial outcomes we have been able to achieve. In 2017, we produced record net revenues and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR, which are the results of the many operational excellence initiatives we have implemented over the past two years along with the returns on the focused and prudent capital investments made across our portfolio of businesses. We have also strived to make continuous progress on our balance sheet, while also returning capital to our shareholders. In 2017, we repaid $131.2 million of debt and repurchased $22.3 million of Pinnacle shares at an average price of $19.51.\n\"Our strong 2017 financial results were driven by balanced regional same-store Adjusted EBITDAR growth and margin expansion, as well as the first full year of contributions from The Meadows. Overall, we achieved net revenue growth of 7.7% to a record $2.6 billion and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR growth of 7.2% to a record $701.9 million. Underlying these results is Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR growth of 1.4% and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR margin expansion of 60 basis points in our same-store portfolio of businesses.\n\"Our 2017 financial results were led by exceptional performances from our River City, L'Auberge Baton Rouge, L'Auberge Lake Charles, and Ameristar Black Hawk businesses throughout the year. In the South segment, L'Auberge Lake Charles, the perennial thoroughbred of our portfolio, grew Adjusted EBITDAR 2.6% and expanded margins 170 basis points despite the severe hurricane headwinds the property faced in the third quarter of the year due to flooding in Houston and Southeast Texas. L'Auberge Baton Rouge grew net revenues 5.0% and Adjusted EBITDAR 9.8%, profitably expanding Adjusted EBITDAR margins by 130 basis points in 2017. River City, in our Midwest segment, expanded Adjusted EBITDAR margins by 140 basis points through profitable net revenue and Adjusted EBITDAR growth of 1.4% and 5.7%, respectively. Rounding out the segments, Ameristar Black Hawk in the West produced a superb year with net revenue growth of 3.6%, Adjusted EBITDAR growth of 5.1%, and Adjusted EBITDAR margin expansion of 60 basis points. Ameristar Black Hawk continues to benefit from our multi-year effort to reposition it as the premier gaming entertainment destination resort in the broader Denver market.\n\"Our focus in 2018 remains on operations and our initiatives to drive profitable revenue streams and expense efficiency. We continue to pursue prudent capital investments to maintain the high quality businesses in our portfolio and expand the amenities we provide our guests. At Ameristar East Chicago, we have an approximately $20 million capital initiative underway to construct a new land-based high limit casino space and renovate the existing casino floors of the property. The renovation of the existing casino floors, which we expect will be completed this summer, will improve the overall quality of the gaming entertainment experience at Ameristar East Chicago, while allowing us to optimize its capacity, layout and game mix.\n\"The most notable moment of 2017 occurred on December 18, when we announced that we signed a definitive agreement under which Penn National will acquire Pinnacle in a landmark transaction valued at approximately $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Pinnacle shareholders will receive $20.00 in cash and 0.42 shares of Penn National common stock for each Pinnacle share they own. As we noted on the day we jointly announced this transaction with Penn National, we believe the resulting combined company will be the preeminent regional gaming entertainment resort operator in North America, with significantly enhanced scale, geographic diversity and substantial free cash flow generation. We believe the transaction provides our shareholders with both immediate value and the opportunity to participate in the potential upside expected from the significant operating synergies anticipated to be generated by the combination.\n\"We will make every effort to maximize the financial performance of our gaming entertainment businesses and to repay debt on our balance sheet, with the goal of having our Company on its best financial footing at the time of the closing of the transaction with Penn National. We will also work closely with the Penn National team to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and to plan a smooth transition and seamless integration of these two great companies upon the closing of the transaction,\" concluded Mr. Sanfilippo.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Operational Review\nMidwest Segment\nIn the Midwest segment, net revenues decreased by $3.9 million or 1.0% year over year to $375.2 million in the 2017 fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR increased by $2.1 million or 2.0% year over year to $105.5 million and Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 28.1%, an increase of 80 basis points year over year. Midwest segment Adjusted EBITDAR in the prior year period included a benefit of approximately $2.5 million due to lower expense accruals from compensation program changes.\nAmeristar St. Charles produced low single digit net revenue and Adjusted EBITDAR growth, and expanded Adjusted EBITDAR margin by approximately 50 basis points year over year. These results were achieved by a low single digit increase in gaming revenues, disciplined marketing reinvestment and cost control.\nRiver City produced high single digit Adjusted EBITDAR growth despite a slight decline in net revenues. Adjusted EBITDAR margin increased by approximately 260 basis points versus the prior year period. River City achieved these results through marketing expense efficiency.\nThe Meadows generated mid-single digit Adjusted EBITDAR growth despite a slight decline in net revenues, resulting in Adjusted EBITDAR margin expansion of approximately 110 basis points. These results were achieved by strategically driving profitable table gaming revenues, cost control, and marketing efficiencies.\nBelterra Park generated high single digit net revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDAR growth in excess of 50%. Adjusted EBITDAR margin increased by approximately 420 basis points year over year.\nSouth Segment\nIn the South segment, net revenues decreased by $14.0 million or 7.1% year over year to $184.1 million in the 2017 fourth quarter.

Consequently, L'Auberge Lake Charles expanded Adjusted EBITDAR margin by approximately 160 basis points year over year in the fourth quarter.\nL'Auberge Baton Rouge experienced double digit net revenue and Adjusted EBITDAR declines on a year over year basis. Adjusted EBITDAR margin contracted approximately 400 basis points year over year. Declines in input costs and additional marketing efficiencies were not enough to offset softer gaming revenues in comparison to a strong fourth quarter 2016.\nWest Segment\nWest segment net revenues were $60.1 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, an increase of $1.4 million or 2.4% year over year. Adjusted EBITDAR was $22.3 million, an increase of $0.7 million or 3.2% year over year. Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 37.1%, an increase of 30 basis points year over year.

Adjusted EBITDAR margin declined approximately 70 basis points year over year. The operating results at Ameristar Black Hawk were driven by a low single digit increase in gaming revenues and continued marketing and promotional efficiency.\nCorporate Expenses and Other\nCorporate expenses and other, which is principally comprised of corporate overhead expenses, as well as the Retama Park Racetrack management operations, decreased by $0.7 million in the 2017 fourth quarter to $20.2 million.\nLease Payments For the three months\nended December 31, For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (amounts in thousands, unaudited) Reduction of financing obligation (1) $ 13,035 $ 11,751 $ 49,770 $ 30,988 Interest expense attributable to financing obligation (1) 83,445 83,274 331,106 225,149 Total payments to GLPI related to Master Lease (1) $ 96,480 $ 95,025 $ 380,876 $ 256,137 Long-term prepaid rent (2) $ 2,275 $ 2,275 $ 9,100 $ 2,831 Rent expense attributable to Meadows Lease (2) 4,171 4,083 16,309 5,081 Total payments to GLPI related to Meadows Lease (2) $ 6,446 $ 6,358 $ 25,409 $ 7,912\n(1 ) The Company completed its transactions with GLPI and entered into the Master Lease on April 28, 2016.

As a result of the transaction with GLPI, the Company's Master Lease with GLPI is accounted for as a financing obligation in accordance with GAAP. The financing obligation is calculated based upon the present value of the future minimum lease payments made to GLPI under the Master Lease over the remaining lease term, which includes all renewal options. The derivation of the present value of the future minimum lease payments is made using an imputed borrowing rate of 10.5%.\nFormer Pinnacle: is defined as Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. prior to the spin-off of its operating businesses and the sale of substantially all of its real estate assets to GLPI on April 28, 2016.\nLease Payments: is defined as cash rent payments made to GLPI for the Master Lease and the Meadows Lease.

The presentation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of its business and is especially relevant in evaluating large, long-lived casino-hotel projects because it provides a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial, non-operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects. Management also reviews pre-opening, development and other costs separately, as such expenses are also included in total project costs when assessing budgets and project returns, and because such costs relate to anticipated future revenues and income. Management believes that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR margin are useful measures for investors because they are indicators of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare operating performance and value of companies within our industry. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR also approximates the measures used in the debt covenants within the Company’s debt agreements. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company compensates for these limitations by using other comparative measures to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.\nIn addition, the Company uses Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, net of Lease Payments as a relevant and useful measure to compare operating results between accounting periods. Management believes that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, net of Lease Payments is useful to investors because it is an indicator of the performance of ongoing business operations after incorporating the cash flow impact of Adjusted Lease Payments and to assess the historical impact of the Adjusted Lease Payments as if they had been incurred in prior evaluation periods.\nNot all of the aforementioned benefits and costs occur in each reporting period, but have been included in the definitions based on historical activity.\nEach of these measures is not calculated in the same manner by all companies and, accordingly, may not be an appropriate measure of comparing performance among different companies. See the attached “supplemental information” tables for reconciliations of these measures to the GAAP equivalent financial measures.\nAbout Pinnacle Entertainment\nPinnacle Entertainment, Inc. owns and operates 16 gaming entertainment businesses, located in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Pinnacle holds a majority interest in the racing license owner, as well as a management contract, for Retama Park Racetrack outside of San Antonio, Texas.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis communication may contain certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements regarding Pinnacle’s business generally, expected results of operations and future operating performance and future growth, about the benefits of the proposed merger, adequacy of resources to fund development and expansion projects, liquidity, financing options, Pinnacle’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the expected timing of the completion of the proposed merger, and other statements that are not historical facts.

While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements including: Pinnacle’s sensitivity to reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending as a result of downturns in the economy; significant competition in the gaming industry in all of Pinnacle’s markets, which could adversely affect revenues and profitability; Pinnacle is required to pay a significant portion of its cash flows pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease and Meadows Lease, which could adversely affect our ability to fund Pinnacle’s operations and growth and limit Pinnacle’s ability to react to competitive and economic changes; fluctuations in the trading volume and market price of shares of Pinnacle’s common stock, general business and market conditions; risks related to the acquisition of Pinnacle by Penn National and the integration of the businesses and assets to be acquired; the possibility that the proposed merger does not close when expected or at all because required regulatory, shareholder or other approvals are not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that the financing required to fund the proposed merger is not obtained on the terms anticipated or at all; the possibility that the Boyd Gaming Corporation and/or Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. deals do not close in a timely fashion or at all; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed merger; potential litigation challenging the transaction; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or issues arising from, the integration of the two companies; the possibility that the anticipated divestitures are not completed in the anticipated time frame or at all; the possibility that additional divestitures may be required; the possibility that the transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; litigation relating to the proposed merger; risks associated with increased leverage from the transaction; and additional factors discussed in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Penn National’s and Pinnacle’s respective most recent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Other unknown or unpredictable factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are difficult to anticipate and are generally beyond the control of Penn National and Pinnacle. Pinnacle does not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events unless required to do so by law.\nReferences in this press release to \"Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc.,\" \"Pinnacle,\" \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" refer to Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where stated or the context otherwise indicates.\nAmeristar, Belterra, Boomtown, Casino Magic, L’Auberge, River City, Meadows, mychoice, and Belterra Park are registered trademarks of Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc.
