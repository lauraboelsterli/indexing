    "text": "Both Join as Members in the Firm’s Boston Office from Morgan Lewis\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mintz Levin is expanding the firm’s technology capabilities with the arrival of William S. Perkins and Dinesh K. Melwani . Mr. Perkins and Mr. Melwani join the firm as Members in the Corporate & Securities Section and will help lead the firm’s technology initiative from Boston. Both were previously partners at Morgan Lewis.\n“Will and Dinesh are highly-regarded and bring significant experience which will supplement our existing tech practice in Boston and our emerging companies practice nationally. Their entrepreneurial spirit and collaborative approach to client service make them a great fit for the firm,” said Bob Bodian , Managing Member of Mintz Levin.\nMr. Perkins concentrates his practice on general corporate transactions. He has more than 20 years of experience representing technology, life sciences and emerging-growth companies in seed and venture financings, various M&A transactions, and has closed over $1.0 billion in strategic investments for leading, global technology businesses.\nMr. Melwani’s practice spans the technology, life sciences, and energy sectors, where he serves as a strategic advisor to his clients. He counsels US and international public, private, and emerging growth companies in a range of matters, including M&A, seed and venture capital ﬁnancings, and general corporate matters.\nMr. Perkins and Mr. Melwani regularly work with founders on entity formation and financing strategy, including angel, seed and venture investments, and guest lecture on these topics at a leading business school.\nAs a team, the two have collaborated with clients on a large number of deals. One such project was their work on behalf of a global e-commerce client in connection with Flipkart’s $1.4+ billion investment round, with the simultaneous sale of the client’s India-based ecommerce business to Flipkart as part of the transaction, which was just this month highlighted among India Business Law Journal’s “Deals of the year 2017.”\nMichael L. Fantozzi , Managing Member of the Boston office and Division Head for the firm's Corporate, Tax, Private Client, and Immigration Sections, added, “Will and Dinesh know the tech and entrepreneurial communities given their years of experience, especially in and around New England. We’re excited to welcome them to the firm.”\nFor more information about Mintz Levin, please visit www.mintz.com .\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180227006124/en/\nMintz Levin\nBrian Moynihan, 617-348-1648\nBPMoynihan@mintz.com\nSource: Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C.",
