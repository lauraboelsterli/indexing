    "text": "Apple has released a software update that prevents a text message bug from crashing iPhones. That means you should update your iPhone as soon as possible.\nApple said Monday that iOS 11.2.6 is now available and it's a relatively small update considering that the larger, more feature-packed iOS 11.3 is in test phase and on its way soon. Apple released the patch to fix a bug that allowed folks to send an Telegu character using the Indian language keyboard that, when received, would crash the Messages app on the receiving party's iPhone.\nThe bug was first spotted last week and crashed iMessage, WhatsApp, Gmail and Facebook Messenger when received. It also affected macOS.\nYou can update your iPhone by visiting Settings > General > Software update.\nWATCH: This new glitch is messing up iPhone X calls show chapters This new glitch is messing up iPhone X calls 2:56 PM ET Mon, 5 Feb 2018 | 00:30",
