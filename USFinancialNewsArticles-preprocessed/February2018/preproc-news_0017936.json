    "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Coherent, Inc. (NASDAQ, COHR), one of the world's leading providers of lasers, laser-based technologies and laser-based system solutions in a broad range of scientific, commercial and industrial applications, today announced financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThree Months Ended\nDec. 30, 2017\nSep. 30, 2017\nDec. 31, 2016\nGAAP Results\n(in millions except per share data)\nNet sales\n$\n477.6\n$\n490.3\n$\n346.1\nNet income\n$\n41.9\n$\n73.8\n$\n30.4\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.67\n$\n2.96\n$\n1.23\nNon-GAAP Results\n(in millions except per share data)\nNet income\n$\n88.6\n$\n92.5\n$\n63.4\nDiluted EPS\n$\n3.54\n$\n3.72\n$\n2.57\nFIRST FISCAL QUARTER DETAILS\nFor the first fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017, Coherent announced net sales of $477.6 million and net income, on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, of $41.9 million, or $1.67 per diluted share. These results include $41.7 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, of largely one time additional income tax expense due to the provisions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as a $12.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, benefit from the adoption of new rules for accounting for excess tax benefits and deficiencies for employee stock-based compensation. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued rules that allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. Coherent currently anticipates finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the end of the quarter ending September 29, 2018. These results compare to net sales of $346.1 million and net income of $30.4 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $88.6 million, or $3.54 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $63.4 million, or $2.57 per diluted share. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 appear in the financial statements portion of this release under the heading \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP net income.\"\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were $490.3 million and net income, on a GAAP basis, was $73.8 million, or $2.96 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $92.5 million, or $3.72 per diluted share.\nAs previously announced, on November 7, 2016, Coherent completed its acquisition of Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. (\"Rofin\"), one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components. As a result, Rofin's operating results were consolidated for the period from November 7, 2016 through December 31, 2016 in Coherent's first fiscal quarter results ended December 31, 2016, and a full quarter of Rofin's operating results in Coherent's fourth and first fiscal quarter results ended September 30, 2017 and December 30, 2017, respectively.\n\"There has been a lot of turbulence in the display market over the last several weeks, raising investors' concerns about the timing and/or sustainability of the investment cycle. We conducted a channel check and the results indicated no current sign of customers seeking to delay or cancel deliveries of existing ELA systems. We also reviewed fab utilization rates and system installations and concluded that service revenues are in-line with our expectations. During the quarter, orders from semicap applications were strong for expansion of memory capacity. We received our first volume order for high-power fiber lasers from one of the largest Chinese machine tool manufacturers. We also saw a solid uptick in medical device manufacturing workstations,\" stated John Ambroseo, Coherent's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We were pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which enabled another €75 million voluntary debt payment. We have now repaid approximately one third of the debt used to finance the Rofin transaction. In addition, as a result of our strong cash generation, our Board has approved a share repurchase authorization of up to $100 million,\" he added.\nCONFERENCE CALL REMINDER\nThe Company will host a conference call today to discuss its financial results at 1:30 P.M.
