    "text": "7:33 AM EST \nElon Musk’s next big day is approaching rapidly. \nSpaceX is due to launch the Falcon Heavy rocket on Tuesday, sending a Tesla Roadster along for the ride to serve as the payload. But now it appears that the Roadster will be sent into space with a driver of sorts. A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Feb 4, 2018 at 9:50pm PST \nRead: SpaceX Will Try To Recover All 3 Falcon Heavy Boosters After Tuesday Test Launch \nAccording to a series of photos posted to founder Elon Musk’s Instagram account, there will be a dummy behind the wheel of the roadster—and not just any dummy, but one named Starman and dressed in SpaceX’s sleek white spacesuit . The name of the dummy is fitting, of course, as it brings to mind the David Bowie song that will reportedly be playing when the rocket is launched . \nRead: See Photos of Elon Musk’s Tesla Roadster Inside SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy Rocket \nIf Starman is in fact in the driver’s seat tomorrow, Musk will be launching three of his products into space. It remains to be seen, though, how much of the rocket and its cargo will be recovered after the launch. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
