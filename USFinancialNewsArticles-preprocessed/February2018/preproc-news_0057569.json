    "text": "SINGAPORE, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Singapore-based commodity trader Olam International reported a 159.3 percent rise in its fourth-quarter net profit, helped by one-off gains from divestments of its Indonesia sugar refining business and edible nuts farmland assets in the United States.\nThe company reported a net profit of S$265.1 million ($201.4 million) for the three months ended December, compared with S$102.2 million a year ago. Operational profit, which excludes exceptional items, was 7.2 percent higher at S$109.7 million.\nOlam, which counts Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings and Japanâ€™s Mitsubishi Corp as its largest shareholders, is a major player in markets for a number of commodities including cocoa, coffee and edible nuts.
