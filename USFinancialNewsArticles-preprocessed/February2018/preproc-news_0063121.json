    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFull Year 2017 Highlights:\nTour revenues increased 10% to $266.5 million Net loss available to common stockholders was $8.7 million, including a $12.7 million non-cash expense related to U.S. tax law change Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $43.5 million Repurchased $6.2 million of stock and warrants Lindblad segment Net Yield increased 1% to $985 and Occupancy was 87% Bookings in 2017 for future travel increased 26% over bookings in 2016 Expanded capacity with the launch of the National Geographic Quest in July 2017\nLindblad Expeditions Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: LIND; the \"Company\" or \"Lindblad\"), a global provider of expedition cruises and adventure travel experiences, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nSven-Olof Lindblad, President and Chief Executive Officer, said \"Lindblad's financial growth during 2017 highlights the opportunity we have to deliver substantial returns as we expand our capacity to take advantage of the growing demand for high quality, authentic experiential travel. The July launch of our first new-build vessel, the National Geographic Quest, contributed considerably to the Company's significant revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth in the back half of the year and we are poised to build on that momentum in the years ahead. Bookings for 2018 travel are 24% above the same point a year ago for 2017 and we are seeing broad based demand for both returning and new itineraries. The upcoming year will also see the next step in our fleet expansion with the anticipated launch of the National Geographic Venture in December and we just began cutting the steel last month for our state-of-the-art, polar ice class vessel, which is expected to be delivered in early 2020. Overall we have contracted to expand our available guest nights by over 50% from pre-expansion levels so we can further capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for authentic expedition travel.\"\nFULL YEAR RESULTS\nTour Revenues\nFull year tour revenues of $266.5 million increased $24.2 million, or 10%, as compared to 2016, primarily due to a $15.2 million increase at Natural Habitat, which was acquired in May of 2016, and a $9.0 million increase at the Lindblad segment, despite the estimated $12.4 million impact from voyage cancellations in 2017. These cancellations included four expeditions on the National Geographic Orion to repair the engine, two voyages on the National Geographic Sea Lion to repair the air conditioning system and four voyages due to the delayed launch of the National Geographic Quest. Excluding the impact of these voyage cancellations in 2017, the Company estimates that total Company tour revenue would have increased 15% over the prior year to $278.9 million.\nLindblad segment revenues of $216.8 million increased $9.0 million, or 4%, compared to 2016, primarily from a $7.3 million increase in ticket revenue, due mostly to increased Available Guest Nights and slightly higher Net Yield, and a $1.7 million increase in other revenue mainly from $2.3 million of insurance revenue related to the National Geographic Orion voyage cancellations. Excluding the impact of the voyage cancellations in 2017, the Company estimates that Lindblad segment revenue would have increased 10% over the prior year to $229.2 million.\nFor the full year, Available Guest Nights increased 3% primarily due to the launch of the National Geographic Quest in July 2017 and a full year of charter expeditions to Cuba, partially offset by the voyage cancellations on the National Geographic Orion and National Geographic Sea Lion. Net Yield increased 1% to $985 from increased pricing and changes in itineraries. Occupancy decreased to 87% due to lower bookings for 2017 travel throughout the first half of 2016 and due to the cancellation of the highly booked voyages.\nNatural Habitat revenues of $49.7 million increased $15.2 million, or 44%, compared to a year ago due primarily to a full year of operating results in 2017 and higher ticket revenue from additional guests.\nNet Income\nNet loss available to common stockholders of $8.7 million for 2017, $0.19 per diluted share, decreased $13.5 million as compared with net income available to common stockholders of $4.9 million, $0.10 per diluted share, in 2016. The decline versus a year ago reflects the increased operating results, which were more than offset primarily by a $12.7 million non-cash impact from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and $5.2 million of additional stock-based compensation expense due primarily to grants under the 2016 CEO share allocation plan, which provides our CEO the ability to transfer shares from his existing holdings in the Company to eligible employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFull year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $43.5 million increased $1.8 million, or 4%, compared to 2016, due to $1.8 million of additional contributions from Natural Habitat and a slight increase at the Lindblad segment despite the impact of the voyage cancellations in the current year. Excluding the impact of the voyage cancellations in 2017, the Company estimates that total Company Adjusted EBITDA would have increased 26% over the prior year to $52.5 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA at the Lindblad segment of $38.7 million increased slightly versus 2016 as the increased tour revenues and a decline in drydock, employee and fuel costs were mostly offset by operating costs for the National Geographic Quest as well as higher charter costs, primarily related to Cuba. Excluding the impact of the voyage cancellations, the Company estimates that Lindblad segment Adjusted EBITDA would have increased 24% over the prior year to $47.7 million.\nNatural Habitat Adjusted EBITDA of $4.8 million increased $1.8 million, or 59%, compared to a year ago due primarily to a full year of operating results in 2017. The current year also included higher revenues from additional guests which was partially offset by increased cost of tours from the additional guests as well as higher personnel costs.\nFOURTH QUARTER RESULTS\nTour Revenues\nFourth quarter tour revenues of $63.2 million increased $7.1 million, or 13%, as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was driven by $7.0 million of additional contributions from the Lindblad segment and a $0.1 million increase at Natural Habitat.\nLindblad segment tour revenues of $48.9 million increased 17% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago mainly due to a $6.4 million increase in ticket revenue, primarily from a 10% increase in Available Guest Nights mostly related to the launch of the National Geographic Quest in July of 2017 and the addition of a trans-Atlantic voyage on the National Geographic Orion. The growth in ticket revenue also reflects a 6% increase in Net Yield to $924 due to increased pricing and changes in itineraries. Occupancy of 86% was in-line with a year ago despite the inclusion of the trans-Atlantic voyage on the National Geographic Orion, which had a lower occupancy than traditional expeditions as anticipated.\nNet Income\nNet loss available to common stockholders for the fourth quarter was $16.0 million, $0.36 per diluted share, as compared with a net loss available to common stockholders of $8.7 million, $0.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decline versus a year ago reflects the increased operating results, which were more than offset by a $12.7 million non-cash impact from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and $1.4 million of higher depreciation and amortization primarily related to the addition of the National Geographic Quest to the fleet in July 2017. The fourth quarter of 2016 also included $1.2 million of other expense primarily related to the retirement of the National Geographic Endeavour.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $4.8 million increased $3.3 million, or 221%, as compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to additional contributions from the Lindblad segment partially offset by $0.1 million decrease at Natural Habitat.\nLindblad segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million increased $3.4 million compared to the fourth quarter a year ago as the increased Tour Revenues and lower personnel costs were partially offset by higher operating costs related to the addition of the National Geographic Quest and higher commission expense related to the revenue growth.\nNatural Habitat Adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 million decreased slightly versus the fourth quarter a year ago as the revenue growth was more than offset by increased personnel and marketing costs to drive long-term growth initiatives.\nSegment Results\nFor the three months ended December 31,\nFor the years ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\n2017\n2016\nChange\n%\n2017\n2016 *\nChange\n%\nTour revenues:\nLindblad\n$ 48,924\n$ 41,900\n$ 7,024\n17%\n$ 216,815\n$ 207,836\n$ 8,979\n4%\nNatural Habitat\n14,297\n14,228\n69\n0%\n49,689\n34,510\n15,179\n44%\nTotal tour revenues\n63,221\n56,128\n7,093\n13%\n266,504\n242,346\n24,158\n10%\nImpact of voyage\ncancellations\n(125)\n-\n(125)\nNA\n12,353\n-\n12,353\nNA\nTotal tour revenues\nexcluding voyage cancellations\n$ 63,096\n$ 56,128\n$ 6,968\n12%\n$ 278,857\n$ 242,346\n$36,511\n15%\nOperating (loss) income:\nLindblad\n$ (5,093)\n$ (7,245)\n$ 2,152\n(30%)\n$ 7,292\n$ 11,794\n$ (4,502)\n(38%)\nNatural Habitat\n2,579\n2,676\n(97)\n(4%)\n3,452\n2,187\n1,265\n58%\nTotal operating (loss) income\n(2,514)\n(4,569)\n2,055\n(45%)\n10,744\n13,981\n(3,237)\n(23%)\nImpact of voyage\ncancellations\n(125)\n-\n(125)\nNA\n8,798\n-\n8,798\nNA\nTotal operating (loss) income\nexcluding voyage cancellations\n$ (2,639)\n$ (4,569)\n$ 1,930\n(42%)\n$ 19,542\n$ 13,981\n$ 5,561\n40%\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nLindblad\n$ 1,890\n$ (1,493)\n$ 3,383\n227%\n$ 38,655\n$ 38,624\n$ 31\n0%\nNatural Habitat\n2,938\n2,997\n(59)\n(2%)\n4,834\n3,038\n1,796\n59%\nTotal adjusted EBITDA\n4,828\n1,504\n3,324\n221%\n43,489\n41,662\n1,827\n4%\nImpact of voyage\ncancellations\n(125)\n-\n(125)\nNA\n9,047\n-\n9,047\nNA\nTotal adjusted EBITDA\nexcluding voyage cancellations\n$ 4,703\n$ 1,504\n$ 3,199\n213%\n$ 52,536\n$ 41,662\n$10,874\n26%\n* The 2016 Natural Habitat segment results represent activity from acquisition date of May 2016 through\nDecember 31, 2016.\nThe impact of the cancelled voyages on tour revenues was calculated as booked tour revenue at the time of cancellation less insurance proceeds. The impact of the cancelled voyages on operating income and Adjusted EBITDA was calculated as booked tour revenue at the time of cancellation less insurance proceeds and estimated operating costs. The cancellation of the December 28, 2016 voyage on the National Geographic Orion was not material to the results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents were $96.4 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared with $135.4 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease primarily reflects purchases of property and equipment of $80.5 million, primarily related to the three new vessel builds, and $6.2 million used to repurchase stock and warrants, partially offset by $52.9 million in net cash provided by operating activities due in large part to advanced bookings for future travel.\nFree cash flow use was $27.6 million for the full year 2017 as compared with a use of $44.5 million in 2016. The improved results reflect higher bookings for future travel and increased operating performance partially offset by higher capital expenditures for new vessels. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.\nOn January 8, 2018, the Company entered into a senior secured credit agreement to make available, at the Company's option, a loan in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $107.7 million for the purpose of providing financing for up to 80% of the purchase price of the Company's new expedition ice-class cruise vessel. At the Company's election, the loan will bear interest either at a fixed interest rate effectively equal to 5.78% or a floating interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.00% per annum.\nLINDBLAD FLEET ACTIVITIES\nThe Company expanded its travel offerings in July 2017 with the launch of the National Geographic Quest, which sailed in Alaska and British Columbia during the summer before voyaging to Costa Rica and Panama for the winter season. The Company's second new-build coastal vessel, the National Geographic Venture, is currently expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company signed a contract with Ulstein Verft to build a new polar ice class vessel for delivery in January 2020, with potential accelerated delivery to November 2019. This state-of-the-art vessel will join the National Geographic Explorer and National Geographic Orion as the third polar ice class vessel in the Lindblad National Geographic fleet, with the ability to voyage anywhere around the globe and specializing in polar travel. The vessel will be capable of exploring deep into the Antarctic and Arctic waters, and will be built with the Ulstein X-BOW® design allowing for greater comfort and speed through rough waters. The contract with Ulstein Verft also includes options to build two additional polar ice class vessels, the first for delivery twelve months after the initial vessel and the second for delivery twelve months thereafter.\nSTOCK AND WARRANT REPURCHASE PLAN\nThe Company has a $35.0 million stock and warrant repurchase plan in place which authorizes the Company to purchase from time to time the Company's outstanding stock and warrants through open market repurchases and/or in privately negotiated transactions based on market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. During 2017, the Company repurchased 529,867 warrants and 547,058 shares of common stock under the plan for a total of $6.2 million. As of February 26, 2018 the Company had repurchased 6.0 million warrants and 864,506 shares of common stock under the plan and had $12.1 million remaining under the plan. As of February 26, 2018, there were 45.8 million shares of common stock and 10.1 million warrants outstanding.\nFINANCIAL OUTLOOK\nThe Company's current expectations for the full year 2018 are as follows:\nTour revenues of $308 - $315 million (16 – 18% growth) Adjusted EBITDA of $54 - $57 million (24 – 31% growth)\nAs of February 26, 2018, the Lindblad segment had 90% of full year 2018 projected guest ticket revenues on the books versus 85% of full year 2017 revenue at the same time last year. The Company continues to anticipate it will achieve its long-range revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company uses a variety of operational and financial metrics, including non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, Occupancy, Net Yields and Net Cruise Costs, to enable it to analyze its performance and financial condition. The Company utilizes these financial measures to manage its business on a day-to-day basis and believes that they are the most relevant measures of performance. Some of these measures are commonly used in the cruise and tourism industry to evaluate performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide expanded insight to assess revenue and cost performance, in addition to the standard GAAP-based financial measures. There are no specific rules or regulations for determining non-GAAP measures, and as such, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies within the industry.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The definitions of non-GAAP financial measures along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to GAAP are included in the supplemental financial schedules beginning on page 11.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on February 28, 2018 to discuss the earnings of the Company.

Other supplemental adjustments include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, executive severance costs, the National Geographic fee amortization, merger-related expenses, and acquisition-related expenses. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the business, such as sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense, and other operating income and expense. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA helps provide a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of the Company's financial performance and prospects for the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as unearned passenger revenues, capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. The Company's use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other companies within the industry.\nThe following metrics apply to the Lindblad segment:\nAdjusted Net Cruise Cost represents Net Cruise Cost adjusted for Non-GAAP other supplemental adjustments which include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, the National Geographic fee amortization, merger-related expenses and acquisition-related expenses.\nAvailable Guest Nights is a measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin) multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period. The Company also records the number of guest nights available on its limited land programs in this definition.\nGross Cruise Cost represents the sum of cost of tours plus merger-related expenses, selling and marketing expense, and general and administrative expense.\nGross Yield represents tour revenues less insurance proceeds divided by Available Guest Nights.\nGuest Nights Sold represents the number of guests carried for the period multiplied by the number of nights sailed within the period.\nMaximum Guests is a measure of capacity and represents the maximum number of guests in a period and is based on double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin).\nNet Cruise Cost represents Gross Cruise Cost excluding commissions and certain other direct costs of guest ticket revenues and other tour revenues.\nNet Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel represents Net Cruise Cost excluding fuel costs.\nNet Revenue represents tour revenues less insurance proceeds, commissions and direct costs of other tour revenues.\nNet Yield represents Net Revenue divided by Available Guest Nights.\nNumber of Guests represents the number of guests that travel with the Company in a period.\nOccupancy is calculated by dividing Guest Nights Sold by Available Guest Nights.\nVoyages represent the number of ship expeditions completed during the period.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lindblad-expeditions-holdings-inc-reports-2017-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial-results-300605505.html\nSOURCE Lindblad Expeditions Holdings, Inc.",
