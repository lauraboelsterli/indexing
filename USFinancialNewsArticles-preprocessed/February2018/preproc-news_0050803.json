The program has been extended until December 31, 2018, and will remain in effect until then, unless further extended or earlier terminated by the board of directors. Since the inception of the program through December 31, 2017, Select Medical has repurchased 35,924,128 shares at a cost of approximately $314.7 million, or $8.76 per share, which includes transaction costs.\nU.S. HealthWorks Acquisition and Financing\nOn October 23, 2017, Select Medical announced that Concentra Group Holdings, LLC (\"Concentra Group Holdings\") entered into an Equity Purchase and Contribution Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") dated October 22, 2017 with Concentra, Concentra Group Holdings Parent, LLC (\"Concentra Group Holdings Parent\"), U.S. HealthWorks, Inc. (\"U.S. HealthWorks\"), and Dignity Health Holding Company (\"DHHC\"). On February 1, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Concentra acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of U.S. HealthWorks, an occupational medicine and urgent care service provider which operates approximately 250 centers and onsite clinics. The operations of U.S. HealthWorks will be included within our Concentra segment.\nIn connection with the closing of the transaction, Concentra Group Holdings redeemed certain of its outstanding equity interests from existing minority equity holders and subsequently, Concentra Group Holdings and a wholly owned subsidiary of Concentra Group Holdings Parent merged, with Concentra Group Holdings surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Concentra Group Holdings Parent. As a result of the merger, the equity interests of Concentra Group Holdings outstanding after the redemption described above were exchanged for membership interests in Concentra Group Holdings Parent.\nConcentra acquired U.S. HealthWorks for $753.0 million. DHHC, a subsidiary of Dignity Health, was issued a 20% equity interest in Concentra Group Holdings Parent, which was valued at $238.0 million. Select Medical retained a majority voting interest in Concentra Group Holdings Parent following the closing of the transaction.\nOn February 1, 2018, in connection with the transactions contemplated under the Purchase Agreement, Concentra amended its first lien credit agreement (the \"Concentra first lien credit agreement\") to, among other things, provide for (i) an additional $555.0 million in tranche B term loans that, along with the existing tranche B term loans under the Concentra first lien credit agreement, have a maturity date of June 1, 2022 and (ii) an additional $25.0 million to the $50.0 million, five-year revolving credit facility under the terms of the existing Concentra first lien credit agreement. The tranche B term loans bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Concentra first lien credit agreement) plus 2.75% (subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor of 1.00%) for Eurodollar Borrowings (as defined in the Concentra first lien credit agreement), or Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Concentra first lien credit agreement) plus 1.75% (subject to an Alternate Base Rate floor of 2.00%) for ABR Borrowings (as defined in the Concentra first lien credit agreement). All other material terms and conditions applicable to the original tranche B term loan commitments are applicable to the additional tranche B term loans created under this amendment.\nIn addition, Concentra entered into a second lien credit agreement (the \"Concentra 2018 second lien credit agreement\") that provides for $240.0 million in term loans with an initial maturity date of June 1, 2023. Borrowings under the Concentra 2018 second lien credit agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Concentra 2018 second lien credit agreement) plus 6.50% (subject to an Adjusted LIBO Rate floor of 1.00%), or Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Concentra 2018 second lien credit agreement) plus 5.50% (subject to an Alternate Base Rate floor of 2.00%).\nConcentra used borrowings under the Concentra first lien credit agreement and Concentra 2018 second lien credit agreement credit facilities, together with cash on hand, to pay the purchase price for all of the issued and outstanding stock of U.S. HealthWorks to DHHC and to finance the redemption and reorganization transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (as described above).\nProposed Refinancing\nSelect Medical is currently in negotiations with its lenders regarding a proposed repricing of its senior secured credit facility. The proposed repricing is subject to customary terms and conditions, including negotiation and execution of definitive documentation. Select Medical anticipates that the proposed repricing, if completed, would close in March of 2018.\nBusiness Outlook\nSelect Medical reaffirms its 2018 business outlook, provided most recently in its January 8, 2018 press release, for net operating revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and fully diluted income per common share. Select Medical continues to expect consolidated net operating revenues for the full year 2018 to be in the range of $5.0 billion to $5.2 billion. Select Medical continues to expect Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2018 to be in the range of $630.0 million to $660.0 million. Select Medical continues to expect fully diluted income per common share for the full year 2018 to be in the range of $0.97 to $1.12. The above business outlook takes into consideration the consummation of the acquisition of U.S. HealthWorks and the related financing, which occurred on February 1, 2018. Select Medical assumed a 28.0% effective tax rate when preparing the above business outlook, which includes the expected impact resulting from the federal tax reform legislation enacted during 2017.\nConference Call\nSelect Medical will host a conference call regarding its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 results, as well as its business outlook, on Thursday, February 22, 2018, at 9:00am ET.

Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements due to factors including the following:\nchanges in government reimbursement for our services and/or new payment policies (including, for example, the expiration of the moratorium limiting the full application of the 25 Percent Rule that would reduce our Medicare payments for those patients admitted to a long term acute care hospital from a referring hospital in excess of an applicable percentage admissions threshold) may result in a reduction in net operating revenues, an increase in costs, and a reduction in profitability; the failure of our long term acute care hospitals or inpatient rehabilitation facilities to maintain their Medicare certifications may cause our net operating revenues and profitability to decline; the failure of our long term acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities operated as \"hospitals within hospitals\" to qualify as hospitals separate from their host hospitals may cause our net operating revenues and profitability to decline; a government investigation or assertion that we have violated applicable regulations may result in sanctions or reputational harm and increased costs; acquisitions or joint ventures may prove difficult or unsuccessful, use significant resources or expose us to unforeseen liabilities; our plans and expectations related to the acquisition of U.S. HealthWorks by Concentra and our ability to realize anticipated synergies; private third-party payors for our services may adopt payment policies that could limit our future net operating revenues and profitability; the failure to maintain established relationships with the physicians in the areas we serve could reduce our net operating revenues and profitability; shortages in qualified nurses, therapists, physicians, or other licensed providers could increase our operating costs significantly or limit our ability to staff our facilities; competition may limit our ability to grow and result in a decrease in our net operating revenues and profitability; the loss of key members of our management team could significantly disrupt our operations; the effect of claims asserted against us could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities; a security breach of our or our third-party vendors' information technology systems may subject us to potential legal and reputational harm and may result in a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act; and other factors discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including factors discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nExcept as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we are under no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of any new information, future events, or otherwise.

Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nFor the Three Months and Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2017\n(In thousands, unaudited)\nThe presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is important to investors because Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator of performance by investors within the healthcare industry. Adjusted EBITDA is used to evaluate financial performance and determine resource allocation for each of Select Medical's operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, income from operations, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for Select Medical. Adjusted EBITDA is used by Select Medical to report its segment performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, stock compensation expense, acquisition costs associated with Physiotherapy and U.S. HealthWorks, non-operating gain (loss), and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2017\n2016\n2017\nNet income\n$\n20,481\n$\n121,058\n$\n125,270\n$\n220,645\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n3,879\n(77,777)\n55,464\n(18,184)\nInterest expense\n42,419\n38,507\n170,081\n154,703\nNon-operating loss (gain)\n(5,557)\n—\n(42,651)\n49\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries\n(5,477)\n(5,436)\n(19,943)\n(21,054)\nLoss on early retirement of debt\n—\n—\n11,626\n19,719\nIncome from operations\n55,745\n76,352\n299,847\n355,878\nStock compensation expense:\nIncluded in\n3,836\n4,103\n14,607\n15,706\nIncluded in cost of services\n653\n954\n2,806\n3,578\nDepreciation and amortization\n37,424\n40,367\n145,311\n160,011\nPhysiotherapy acquisition costs\n—\n—\n3,236\n—\nU.S. HealthWorks acquisition costs\n—\n2,819\n—\n2,819\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n97,658\n$\n124,595\n$\n465,807\n$\n537,992\nLong term acute care\n$\n46,794\n$\n58,426\n$\n224,609\n$\n252,679\nInpatient rehabilitation\n16,958\n28,003\n56,902\n90,041\nOutpatient rehabilitation\n30,824\n29,958\n129,830\n132,533\nConcentra\n24,929\n31,905\n143,009\n157,561\nOther (a)\n(21,847)\n(23,697)\n(88,543)\n(94,822)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n97,658\n$\n124,595\n$\n465,807\n$\n537,992\n(a)\nOther primarily includes costs.\nIX. Reconciliation of Income per Common Share to Adjusted Income per Common Share\nFor the Three Months and Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2017\n(In thousands, except per share amounts, unaudited)\nAdjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Items excluded from adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Select Medical believes that the presentation of adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares are important to investors because they are reflective of the financial performance of our ongoing operations and provide better comparability of our results of operations between periods. Adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to, or substitutes for, net income, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following tables reconcile net income available to common stockholders and income per common share to adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted income per common share – diluted shares for Select Medical.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2016\nPer share (a)\n2017\nPer share (a)\nNet income attributable to Select Medical\n$\n20,172\n$\n100,797\nEarnings allocated to unvested restricted stockholders\n649\n3,348\nNet income available to common stockholders\n19,523\n$\n0.15\n97,449\n$\n0.75\nAdjustments:\nIncome tax benefit resulting from tax reform legislation\n—\n(59,645)\nOther adjustments:\nNon-operating gain\n(5,557)\n—\nEstimated income tax expense (b)\n941\n—\nEarnings allocated to unvested restricted stockholders\n148\n1,981\nAdjusted net income available to common stockholders\n$\n15,055\n$\n0.12\n$\n39,785\n$\n0.31\nAdjustment for dilution\n0.00\n0.00\nAdjusted income per common share – diluted shares\n$\n0.12\n$\n0.31\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n128,274\n129,578\nDiluted\n128,436\n129,731\n(a)\nPer share amounts for each period presented are basic weighted average common shares outstanding for all amounts except adjusted income per common share - diluted shares, which is based on diluted shares outstanding.\n(b)\nRepresents the estimated income tax impact related to the non-operating gain adjustment.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\nPer share (a)\n2017\nPer share (a)\nNet income attributable to Select Medical\n$\n115,411\n$\n177,184\nEarnings allocated to unvested restricted stockholders\n3,521\n5,758\nNet income available to common stockholders\n111,890\n$\n0.88\n171,426\n$\n1.33\nAdjustments:\nIncome tax benefit resulting from tax reform legislation\n—\n(59,645)\nOther adjustments:\nNon-operating gain on sale of contract therapy\n(33,933)\n—\nOther non-operating losses (gains)\n(8,705)\n49\nLoss on early retirement of debt (b)\n6,211\n19,719\nEstimated income tax expense (benefit) (c)\n1,273\n(7,796)\nEarnings allocated to unvested restricted stockholders\n1,072\n1,551\nAdjusted net income available to common stockholders\n$\n77,808\n$\n0.61\n$\n125,304\n$\n0.97\nAdjustment for dilution\n0.00\n0.00\nAdjusted income per common share – diluted shares\n$\n0.61\n$\n0.97\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n127,813\n128,955\nDiluted\n127,968\n129,126\n(a)\nPer share amounts for each period presented are basic weighted average common shares outstanding for all amounts except adjusted income per common share - diluted shares, which is based on diluted shares outstanding.\n(b)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the loss on early retirement of Concentra's debt is net of non-controlling interest.\n(c)\nRepresents the estimated income tax impacts related to the loss on early retirement of debt and non-operating gain and loss adjustments.\nX.
