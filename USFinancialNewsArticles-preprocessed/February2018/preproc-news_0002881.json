    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cushing ® MLP Total Return Fund (NYSE: SRV) declared a distribution for February 2018 of $0.0903 per common share. The Fund's distribution will be payable on February 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 16, 2018. The ex-date for the Fund's distribution is February 15, 2018.\nIt is anticipated but not certain that approximately 100% of the Fund's distribution will be treated as a return of capital. The final determination of such amounts will be made and reported to shareholders in early 2019, after the end of the calendar year when the Fund determines its earnings and profits for the year. The final tax status of the distribution may differ substantially from this preliminary information.\nThe Fund's Board of Trustees has approved a continuation of the waiver of the Fund's management fees, in the amount of 0.25% of the Fund's Managed Assets, for the next twelve months, beginning as of February 1, 2018.\nThe Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company with an investment objective of seeking a high after-tax total return from a combination of capital appreciation and current income. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in master limited partnership (MLP) investments. The Fund is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"SRV.\"\nThe Fund is managed by Cushing ® Asset Management, LP. No assurance can be given that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.\nABOUT CUSHING ® ASSET MANAGEMENT, LP\nCushing, a subsidiary of Swank Capital, is an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in Dallas, Texas.
