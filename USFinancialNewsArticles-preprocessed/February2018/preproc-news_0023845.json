    "text": "BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Civitas Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: CIVI) today reported financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 At A Glance\nFirst quarter net revenue increased 10.0% to $395.4 million First quarter net income was $9.4 million, compared to $4.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. First quarter net income for fiscal 2018 includes a $6.5 million tax benefit related to the impact of the newly enacted tax law. First quarter Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.2% to $38.1 million, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Six acquisitions were completed during the first quarter, with total annual revenues of $53 million\n“Our first quarter reflects strong revenue growth in our I/DD, SRS and ADH service lines,” stated Bruce Nardella, president and chief executive officer. “The performance of each of these operations was driven by increases in volume and rates, and in particular by the number and size of acquisitions completed during the last three quarters.\n“While the fundamentals underpinning the growth of our business remain strong, during the first quarter the labor pressures we have been experiencing increased, putting pressure on margins,” stated Nardella. “We are taking aggressive action to mitigate the effects of this pressure and improve margins in the second half of the year, including efforts to achieve additional G&A efficiency, expand occupancy through program consolidations, and strengthen recruitment and retention of caregivers. Although we believe these efforts will result in considerable improvement, we expect that current external labor conditions are likely to persist throughout the remainder of the year. Accordingly, we are modestly reducing our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for fiscal 2018. We remain confident, however, in our ability to execute on our multi-lever growth strategy and create long-term value for our stockholders.”\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nGAAP Results\nNet revenue for the first quarter was $395.4 million, an increase of $36.0 million, or 10.0%, over net revenue for the same period of the prior year. Net revenue increased $9.5 million from organic growth and $26.5 million from acquisitions that closed after the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nNet revenue consisted of:\nIntellectual and Developmental Disabilities (\"I/DD\") services net revenue of $255.9 million, an increase of 7.4% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Post-Acute Specialty Rehabilitation Services (\"SRS\") net revenue of $86.0 million, an increase of 15.7% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. At-risk youth (\"ARY\") services net revenue of $35.9 million, which is relatively consistent with the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adult Day Health (\"ADH\") services net revenue of $17.6 million, an increase of 59.3% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nIncome from operations for the first quarter was $12.8 million, or 3.2% of net revenue, compared to $15.5 million, or 4.3% of net revenue, for the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease in our operating margin was primarily due to increases in direct occupancy costs and direct labor costs as a percentage of revenue compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in occupancy costs was driven by higher open occupancy rates as well as increases in rent expense. The increase in direct labor costs in the first quarter was attributable to increase in wages, higher staff to individuals served ratios in certain programs, and an increase in overtime compared to the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease in our operating margin was partially offset by lower general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue due to our continued focus on optimizing our cost structure.\nNet income for the first quarter was $9.4 million compared to $4.2 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in net income was due to a $6.5 million tax benefit that was recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the newly enacted tax law that lowered the corporate income tax rate. The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") is expected to meaningfully lower the Company's long-term effective tax rate and annual cash taxes. The tax law reduces the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nBasic and diluted net income per common share was $0.25 for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.11 for the same period of the prior year.\nNon-GAAP Results\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $38.1 million, or 9.6% of net revenue, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $37.6 million, or 10.5% of net revenue, for the first quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in our Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily attributable to the increases in direct labor costs and direct occupancy costs described above. The decrease was partially offset by lower general and administrative costs resulting from our continued focus on optimizing our cost structure.\nAdjusted net income per diluted common share was $0.33 for the first quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.30 for the first quarter of the prior year.\nBeginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we added Adjusted net income per diluted common share as an additional non-GAAP financial metric, and changed our definition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude acquisition-related transaction costs from Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that excluding acquisition-related transaction costs from Adjusted EBITDA gives investors a more transparent reflection of our underlying operating performance without quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in the amount of these costs. Prior-period Adjusted EBITDA has been recast to conform to this presentation. Please refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn February 7, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $25.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise (including, without limitation, the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans). The stock repurchase program will expire on August 12, 2018. The Company intends to conduct any open market stock repurchase activities in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook and Guidance\nFor fiscal 2018, we are maintaining our guidance for net revenue communicated on December 12, 2017 with a range of $1.57 billion to $1.62 billion and lowering our guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to a range of $168 million and $173 million.\nA reconciliation of the low-end and high-end of the Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income is as follows:\nFiscal Year Ending September 30, 2018 (In millions) Low-end High-end Net income $ 30 $ 34 Provision for income taxes 5 6 Interest expense, net (a) 36 36 Depreciation and amortization 85 85 Stock-based compensation 10 10 Expense reduction project costs 1 1 Acquisition-related transaction costs* 1 1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 168 $ 173 Modeling guidelines for the current fiscal year are as follows:\nAverage basic and diluted shares outstanding for the year: 38 million (b)\nCapital expenditures: 3.3% of net revenue\nAnnual tax rate: 32% (c)\n(a) Interest expense, net as presented in the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income does not give effect to any future borrowings to fund repurchases under the stock repurchase program.\n(b) The modeling guideline for average basic and diluted shares outstanding does not give effect to any future repurchases under the stock repurchase program.\n(c) The modeling guideline for our annual tax rate excludes the impact of the $6.5 million non-cash benefit recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This benefit primarily relates to remeasuring the Company's deferred tax liabilities at the newly enacted federal tax rate. Including the $6.5 million benefit the annual tax rate is estimated to be approximately 16%.\nNet income as presented in the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income may be further impacted by potential future non-operating charges that would impact net income without affecting Adjusted EBITDA.\n* Consistent with our decision in the first fiscal quarter to change the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude acquisition-related transaction costs, our updated Adjusted EBITDA guidance excludes approximately $1.0 million in such transaction costs. Our original guidance provided in December made no such exclusion. See \"Non-GAAP Results\" and \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nConference Call\nThis afternoon, Thursday, February 8, 2018, Civitas Solutions management will host a conference call at 5:00 pm (Eastern Time) to discuss the fiscal 2018 first quarter operating results.\nConference Call Dial-in#:\nDomestic U.S. Toll Free: 877-255-4315 International: 412-317-5467 Replay Details (available 1 hour after conclusion of the conference call through 2/15/18):\nDomestic U.S. Toll Free: 877-344-7529 International: 412-317-0088 Canada Toll Free: 855-669-9658 Replay Access Code: 10116721 A live webcast of the conference call will be available via the investor relations section of the Company’s website: www.civitas-solutions.com . Following the call, an archived replay of the webcast will be available on this website through May 8, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis earnings release includes a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income per diluted common share and net debt, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it is an important measure used by management to assess financial performance, and management believes it provides a more transparent view of the Company’s underlying operating performance and operating trends. In addition, the Company believes this measurement is important because securities analysts, investors and lenders use this measurement to compare the Company’s performance to other companies in our industry. Adjusted net income per diluted share is presented to exclude non-recurring costs and other expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions that are not reflective of the Company's continuing operating performance. Net debt is presented because it is useful for lenders, securities analysts, and investors in determining the Company's net debt leverage ratio.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, net income per diluted share, revenues or total debt or other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Similarly, Adjusted net income per diluted share should not be considered a measure of cash flow per common share but rather a performance metric that presents our operating performance taking into account certain of the same adjustments in Adjusted EBITDA and does so on a per share basis. While we and other companies in our industry frequently use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income per diluted share as measures of operating performance and the ability to meet debt service requirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. All non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements filed with the SEC.\nFor a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on pages 8 and 9 of this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains statements about future events and expectations that constitute , including our guidance, outlook and statements about our expectations for future financial performance.
