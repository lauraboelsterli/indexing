It could indeed lead to a dangerous spillover,” a spokeswoman for the European Commission told a regular press briefing. \n“We urge the Syrian parties, their allies, as well as the regional actors to abide by international law, to show restraint, and avoid actions that further escalate the situation and prolong the suffering of Syrian civilians,” she said, adding the Commission was monitoring the situation closely.
