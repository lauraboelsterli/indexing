    "text": "LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The cost of insuring exposure to South African sovereign debt fell to a two-week low on Friday, a day after Cyril Ramaphosa was sworn in as the country’s president.\nFive-year credit default swaps (CDS) for South Africa fell 3 basis points (bps) from Thursday’s close to 144 bps according to IHS Markit data, the lowest level since Feb. 2.\nHopes are high that Ramaphosa will tackle endemic corruption and introduce structural reforms to reverse South Africa’s economic decline.
