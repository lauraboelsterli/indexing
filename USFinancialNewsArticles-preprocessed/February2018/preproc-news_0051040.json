Workiva will report its financial results under both ASC 606 and the previous standard (ASC 605) each quarter in 2018. Workiva's preliminary estimates relating to this accounting change are as follows: a favorable impact of approximately $4.5 million on operating expenses for 2018, an unfavorable impact of approximately $2.0 million on services revenue in the first quarter, and an insignificant impact on total revenue for 2018. These impacts are addressed in the guidance below.\nAs of February 22, 2018, Workiva is providing guidance for its first quarter 2018 and full year 2018 as follows:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance :\nTotal revenue is expected to be in the range of $57.3 million to $57.8 million. GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $13.7 million to $14.2 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $7.8 million to $8.3 million. GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.34. Non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.20. Net loss per basic and diluted share is based on 42.6 million weighted-average shares outstanding.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance :\nTotal revenue is expected to be in the range of $234.0 million to $236.0 million. GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $57.1 million to $59.1 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $32.0 million to $34.0 million. GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share is expected to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.40. Non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.82. Net loss per basic and diluted share is based on 43.4 million weighted-average shares outstanding.\n“Our plans to capture larger enterprise deals and achieve our long-term financial targets remain unchanged. Our 2018 non-GAAP operating loss guidance reflects the necessary investments to execute our strategy. As we stated last quarter, we expect to see progress from our enterprise strategy in bookings in the second half of 2018 and in revenue in 2019,” said Miller.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nWorkiva will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET to review the Company’s financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, in addition to discussing the Company’s outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP historical financial measures has been provided in Exhibit A at the end of this press release. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP guidance has been provided in Exhibit B at the end of this press release.\nWorkiva believes that the use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share is helpful to its investors. These measures, which are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense attributable to cost of revenues from gross profit. Non-GAAP gross margin is the ratio calculated by dividing non-GAAP gross profit by revenues. Non-GAAP loss from operations is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense from loss from operations. Non-GAAP net loss is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense, net of tax, from net loss. Non-GAAP net loss per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net loss by the weighted- average shares outstanding as presented in the calculation of GAAP net loss per share. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash expenses, Workiva believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows for more meaningful comparisons between its operating results from period to period. Workiva’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as tools for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Workiva’s own operating results over different periods of time.\nNon-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in Workiva’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on Workiva’s reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Workiva’s business and an important part of the compensation provided to its employees. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Workiva’s business.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nCertain statements in this press release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby.
