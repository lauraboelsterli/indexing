    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 6:27 AM / a few seconds ago BoE's Broadbent: further rate hikes within a year shouldn't be 'great shock' Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Friday he did not think a couple more interest rate hikes in the space of a year should come as a great shock, but added that the central bank had not fixed any path for rates. \nSpeaking a day after the BoE surprised investors by saying it was likely to raise rates sooner and by more than it thought a few months ago, Broadbent said the low level of rates in recent years reflected global factors. \n“But nor do I think if there were to be a couple of 25 basis point rises in a year, that that would somehow be a great shock,” Broadbent said in a BBC radio interview. \nAsked if he would distance himself from a media report that interest rates are likely double from 0.5 percent by the end of 2018, Broadbent said: “I don’t know... We do not fix the path of interest rates in advance. What is fixed is our remit and rates change with the economy.” Reporting by Andy Bruce;  ",
