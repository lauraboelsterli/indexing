The last full trading day’s volume was 15.33 billion shares. ** As of 04:03 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 29.75 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day moving average and below its 200-day moving average. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 14.46 as of the last full trading day while the dividend yield was 2 percent. ** So far this week, the market capitalisation of the Shanghai stock index has risen by 0.57 percent to 27.89 trillion yuan. ** In Hong Kong, the energy sub-index of the Hang Seng index rose 1.3 percent while the IT sector rose 3.6 percent. The top gainer on Hang Seng was Sunny Optical Technology Group Co Ltd up 6.75 percent, while the biggest loser was Lenovo Group Ltd down 1.03 percent.\nReporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ",
