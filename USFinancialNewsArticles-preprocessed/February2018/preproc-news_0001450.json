    "text": "FINDLAY, Ohio, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nReported record fourth-quarter net income of $238 million and adjusted EBITDA of $569 million; reported record full-year net income of $794 million and adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion Reported fourth-quarter net cash from operating activities of $569 million and distributable cash flow of $445 million Declared 20th consecutive quarterly distribution increase to $0.6075 per common unit; delivered 12.1 percent distribution growth in 2017 with a full-year coverage ratio of 1.28 Announced closing of transactions completing planned strategic actions with MPC Affirmed 2018 distribution growth guidance of 10 percent Announced 2018 capital investment plan focused on growth investments for the development of natural gas, gas liquids and crude oil infrastructure\nMPLX LP (NYSE: MPLX) today reported fourth-quarter 2017 net income attributable to MPLX of $238 million and full-year 2017 net income attributable to MPLX of $794 million.\nMPLX achieved record financial results in the fourth-quarter and full-year 2017, reporting $1.2 billion in income from operations for the year. This record-setting performance was primarily driven by gathered, processed and fractionated volume growth, resulting in high plant utilization, as well as contributions from acquired logistics and storage assets.\nMPLX achieved 12.1 percent distribution growth for 2017, in line with prior guidance and ended the year with strong full-year distribution coverage of 1.28 times and debt-to-pro forma adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 3.6 times. Higher earnings and cash flow, combined with a disciplined approach to capital investments, have increased the partnership's capacity to fund organic growth with debt and retained cash. As a result, there was no public equity issued in the fourth quarter.\nMPLX and its sponsor, Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: MPC), announced that they are today closing the dropdown of refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services that are projected to generate approximately $1 billion in annual EBITDA as well as the exchange of MPC's general partner (GP) economic interests, including its incentive distribution rights (IDRs), for newly issued MPLX common (LP) units, eliminating the GP cash distribution requirements of the partnership.\n\"In 2017, MPLX delivered strong results with sequential earnings growth in all four quarters as we executed our strategy to grow the business through increased utilization of our existing assets; an impressive portfolio of organic projects; strategic third-party acquisitions; and strategic actions with our sponsor,\" said Gary R. Heminger, chairman and chief executive officer. \"These actions have transformed MPLX, nearly doubling the partnership's earnings base and improving the partnership's cost of capital by permanently eliminating the IDR burden.\"\nMPLX also announced its 2018 capital investment plan, which includes approximately $2.2 billion of organic growth capital and $190 million of maintenance capital. For the Gathering and Processing (G&P) segment, this robust organic growth plan includes the addition of 8 processing plants representing nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity as well as 100,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity in the prolific Marcellus, Utica and Permian basins.\nIn the Marcellus and Utica basins, MPLX expects to strengthen its position as the largest processor and fractionator with the addition of six gas processing plants in 2018, increasing the partnership's processing capacity by 21 percent to over 7 billion cubic feet per day. Additionally, the partnership expects to add 40,000 barrels per day of ethane fractionation capacity, and 60,000 barrels per day of propane-plus fractionation capacity.\nIn the Southwest, the partnership also plans to expand its footprint by adding nearly 300 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity. The Argo gas processing plant will be placed in service in the first quarter, doubling the partnership's processing capacity in the Permian basin. Construction of the Omega gas processing plant in the STACK shale play of Oklahoma is on schedule and expected to be complete by mid-2018.\nIn the Logistics and Storage (L&S) segment, work continues on the expansion of the Ozark and Wood River-to-Patoka pipeline systems, which connect Cushing, Oklahoma, to Patoka, Illinois. Both are targeted for completion in mid-2018. Additional 2018 projects include the completion of a butane cavern in Robinson, Illinois; tank expansions in Patoka, Illinois, and Texas City, Texas; and an expansion of the partnership's marine fleet. Work also continues on the refining logistics project to expand Galveston Bay refinery's export capacity, expected to be completed in 2020. These projects are expected to create additional fee-based revenue for the partnership while providing logistics solutions to MPC and other market participants.\nThe partnership plans to fund its 2018 organic growth capital plan with retained cash and debt, while maintaining strong coverage and an investment grade credit profile. MPLX does not anticipate the need to issue public equity to fund organic growth capital.\n\"After the closing of today's dropdown and the elimination of IDRs, MPLX is among the largest diversified master limited partnerships in the energy sector with a very competitive cost of capital,\" Heminger said. \"With a robust portfolio of organic projects in the Marcellus, Utica, Permian and STACK, which are among the most prolific and economic shale plays in the country, and a diversified suite of logistics assets, we believe MPLX is extraordinarily well-positioned to deliver attractive long-term returns.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree Months Ended\nDec. 31\nYear Ended\nDec. 31\n(In millions, except per unit and ratio data)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income attributable to MPLX (a)\n$\n238\n$\n133\n$\n794\n$\n233\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to MPLX (b)\n569\n391\n2,004\n1,419\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n569\n516\n1,907\n1,491\nDistributable cash flow (\"DCF\") (b)\n445\n318\n1,628\n1,140\nDistribution per common unit (c)\n0.6075\n0.5200\n2.2975\n2.0500\nDistribution coverage ratio (d)\n1.24x\n1.25x\n1.28x\n1.23x\nGrowth capital expenditures (e)\n400\n358\n1,518\n1,292\n(a)\nThe year ended Dec. 31, 2016, includes pretax, non-cash impairments of $89 million related to an equity method investment and $130 million related to the goodwill established in connection with the MarkWest acquisition.\n(b)\nNon-GAAP measure calculated before the distribution to preferred units and excluding impairment charges.

Reported record processed volumes in the Marcellus and Utica of 5.2 billion cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 17 percent increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Reported record fractionated volumes in the Marcellus and Utica of 389,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 24 percent increase versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Commenced operations of the 40,000-barrel-per-day Majorsville de-ethanization plant in the fourth quarter. Commenced operations of the Sherwood IX 200 million-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant in January; two additional Sherwood plants are under construction.\nFinancial Position and Liquidity\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, MPLX had $5 million in cash, $1.7 billion available through its bank revolving credit facility expiring in July 2022, and $114 million available through its credit facility with MPC. In 2017, MPLX received net proceeds from public equity issuances of approximately $473 million related to first- and second-quarter commitments under its at-the-market program. No additional common units were issued through this program in the third and fourth quarters.\nThe partnership's $1.9 billion of available liquidity and its access to the capital markets should provide it with sufficient flexibility to meet its day-to-day operational needs and continue investing in organic growth opportunities. The partnership's debt-to-pro forma adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.6 times at Dec. 31, 2017. MPLX remains committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.\nSegment Results\nSegment operating income attributable to MPLX LP\nThree Months Ended\nDec. 31\nYear Ended\nDec. 31\n(In millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nLogistics and Storage (a)\n$\n205\n$\n118\n$\n782\n$\n453\nGathering and Processing (a)\n364\n311\n1,335\n1,132\n(a)\nSee reconciliation below for details.\nL&S segment operating income increased for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, compared with the same periods in 2016. The full-year increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the Hardin Street Marine, MPLX Terminals, Hardin Street Transportation, Woodhaven Cavern, and Ozark Pipeline businesses.\nG&P segment operating income increased for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2017, compared with the same periods in 2016. The fourth-quarter increase was predominantly due to record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes, which drove high utilization rates, and a benefit from increased product margins. The full-year increase was predominantly due to record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes resulting in strong utilization of existing and new facilities. The increase also included a benefit from higher product margins.\nSee reconciliation below for detail on items not allocable to or controllable by any individual segment, which are therefore excluded when evaluating segment performance.\nConference Call\nAt 11 a.m. EST today, MPLX will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss the reported results and provide an update on operations. Interested parties may listen to the conference call by dialing 1-888-606-5719 (confirmation number 6033306) or by visiting MPLX's website at http://www.mplx.com and clicking on the \"2017 Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results\" link in the \"News & Headlines\" section.

Investor-related material will also be available online prior to the conference call and webcast at http://ir.mplx.com .\nAbout MPLX LP\nMPLX is a diversified, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in 2012 by Marathon Petroleum Corporation to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets. MPLX is engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs; and the transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil and refined petroleum products through a marine fleet and approximately 10,000 miles of crude oil and light product pipelines. Headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, MPLX's assets consist of a network of crude oil and products pipelines and supporting assets, including storage facilities (tank farms) located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States; 62 light-product terminals with approximately 24 million barrels of storage capacity; an inland marine business; storage caverns with approximately 2.8 million barrels of storage capacity; a barge dock facility with approximately 78,000 barrels per day of crude oil and product throughput capacity; and gathering and processing assets that include approximately 5.9 billion cubic feet per day of gathering capacity, 8.2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas processing capacity and 610,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity. Following today's dropdown, MPLX will provide fuels distribution services to MPC and own refining logistics assets consisting of tanks with storage capacity of approximately 56 million barrels as well as refinery docks, loading racks and associated piping.\nNon-GAAP references\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management utilizes additional non-GAAP measures to facilitate comparisons of past performance and future periods. This press release and supporting schedules include the non-GAAP measures adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow (DCF) and distribution coverage ratio. The amount of adjusted EBITDA and DCF generated is considered by the board of directors of our general partner in approving the Partnership's cash distribution. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered separately from or as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow as reflected in our financial statements. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) (benefit) provision for income taxes; (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs; (iv) non-cash equity-based compensation; (v) impairment expense; (vi) net interest and other financial costs; (vii) (income) loss from equity method investments; (viii) distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries; (ix) distributions of cash received from equity method investments to MPC; (x) unrealized derivative losses; (xi) other adjustments to equity method investment distributions; and (xii) acquisition costs. In general, we define DCF as adjusted EBITDA adjusted for (i) deferred revenue impacts; (ii) net interest and other financial costs; (iii) maintenance capital expenditures; (iv) equity method investment capital expenditures paid out; and (v) other non-cash items.\nThe Partnership makes a distinction between realized or unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. During the period when a derivative contract is outstanding, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative as an unrealized gain or loss. When a derivative contract matures or is settled, we reverse the previously recorded unrealized gain or loss and record the realized gain or loss of the contract.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial performance measure used by management, industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and operating results of our ongoing business operations. Additionally, we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors for trending, analyzing and benchmarking our operating results from period to period as compared to other companies that may have different financing and capital structures.\nDCF is a financial performance measure used by management as a key component in the determination of cash distributions paid to unitholders. We believe DCF is an important financial measure for unitholders as an indicator of cash return on investment and to evaluate whether the partnership is generating sufficient cash flow to support quarterly distributions. In addition, DCF is commonly used by the investment community because the market value of publicly traded partnerships is based, in part, on DCF and cash distributions paid to unitholders.\nDistribution coverage ratio is a financial performance measure used by management to reflect the relationship between the partnership's financial operating performance and cash distribution capability. We define the distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of DCF attributable to GP and LP unitholders to total GP and LP distribution declared.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of federal securities laws regarding MPLX LP (\"MPLX\") and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (\"MPC\").
