    "text": "Aegis Health, Clariture Health and Expression Health Analytics Introduce Platform as a Service Strategy and Unite Under Trilliant Health Brand\nNASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Trilliant Health announced today the release of its analytics platform as a service for intelligent patient acquisition. In addition, Trilliant stated that Aegis Health, Clariture Health and Expression Health Analytics will now operate under the Trilliant Health brand.\nTrilliant Health was created in June 2017 through the merger of Aegis Health and Clariture Health and expanded with the addition of Expression Health Analytics in October. Prior to forming Trilliant, Aegis, Clariture and Expression each deployed specific solutions to increase profitable market share for healthcare providers: Aegis provided employer and physician focused solutions, Clariture provided consumer focused digital marketing solutions, and Expression provided near-time data and analytics. Collectively, the companies synthesize technology, analytics and consultative expertise into a single platform as a service to drive profitable market share growth through every patient acquisition channel.\n“Trilliant Health was formed to enable hospitals and physicians to address the challenges of declining reimbursements, the dramatic migration of care from inpatient to outpatient sites of service, and an unpredictable regulatory future,” said Hal Andrews, chief executive officer of Trilliant. “By integrating our proprietary solutions, we have developed an analytics platform as a service that can inform and enable numerous strategic, financial and operational functions and applications, including physician relationship management, demand forecasting, M&A activities, de novo site selection, allocation of marketing budgets, customer relationship management, and payer negotiations.” Andrews continued, “Elective patients choose a provider in one of three ways – physician referral, benefit design of their employers’ health insurance, or searching online for care. Trilliant’s comprehensive solution addresses all three pathways to care and, as a result, can offer hospitals a complete solution for growth through every channel – physician, employer and consumer.”\n“Uniting all of our companies with a common mission, vision and brand will accelerate our relentless pursuit of innovative solutions that will enable healthcare providers to thrive in a challenging market,” said Andrews. “It will also allow each of our clients to leverage the incredible talents and extensive health care and data science experience of our entire team in ways that will give them a competitive advantage.”\nAbout Trilliant Health\nTrilliant Health is a healthcare technology, data, and marketing company that enables intelligent patient acquisition through its unique analytics platform as a service. By combining best-in-class technology with a data integration platform that combines clinical, claims, and patient-generated data, Trilliant Health can deliver market-specific and patient-level intelligence to assist health care providers in finding, retaining and assuming risk for patient populations.
