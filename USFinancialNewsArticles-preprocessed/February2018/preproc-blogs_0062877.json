    "text": "DowDuPont, soon to be 3 cos, reveals names Published 5 Hours Ago The Associated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) â€” DowDuPont is announcing the names of the three businesses it will become when it breaks itself into three, eight months after the Justice Department approved a $62 billion merger between the chemical giants Dow and DuPont. \nThe company said Monday that its agriculture division will be called Corteva Agriscience, based in Wilmington, Delaware. The division had more than $14 billion in revenue last year. \nThe second company, focused on materials science, will be based in Midland, Michigan and will keep the Dow name and red diamond logo. \nThe third spinoff, which produces and sells specialty products, will be called DuPont. Its headquarters will also be Wilmington, Delaware. \nThe merger between Dow and Dupont, after being held up by regulators in the U.S. and abroad, was approved on June 15.",
