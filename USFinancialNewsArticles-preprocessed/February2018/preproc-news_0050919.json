    "text": "12 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The Trump administration on Wednesday disputed criticism that it is going easy on Russia, detailing what senior officials described as a year of efforts to counter Moscow’s interference in the U.S. elections and interventions in Ukraine and Syria.\nSome lawmakers and critics of the administration have accused the White House of soft-pedaling sanctions against Russia that are required under a new U.S. law, amid a far-reaching special-counsel investigation into Kremlin meddling in the 2016 elections. The special counsel last week indicted three Russian companies and 13 Russian citizens for a widespread effort to interfere in U.S. elections, documenting their efforts in a filing that undercut President Donald Trump’s expressed skepticism about Moscow’s involvement.\n“Not a single thing that was American law on January 20th, 2017 has been reversed by the current administration, not one thing across any agency,” a senior administration official said at a White House briefing.\nUnder President Trump, the U.S. has closed Russia’s San Francisco consulate last August and imposed new sanctions against a key ally of President Vladimir Putin, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, said a panel of senior officials charged with oversight of the administration’s Russia strategy at Wednesday’s briefing.\nThe officials also pointed to a proposed move by the Treasury last week to block one of Latvia’s largest banks from accessing U.S. markets for its alleged role as a go-to money-laundering institution for Russian oligarchs, under an investigation first initiated by the Obama administration.\nMr. Trump has fueled concerns about his administration’s Russia policy by questioning U.S. intelligence charges of Kremlin interference in the U.S. elections and for his campaign’s outreach to Russian officials. As the Obama administration hit Russia with a series of punitive actions in its final days, members of the incoming Trump administration were working to undermine the impact of U.S. sanctions, according to court documents.\nSome of the key lawmakers who authored a new law toughening sanctions against Russia said they were largely satisfied with the Trump administration’s early implementation. The law, initially opposed by Mr. Trump before he signed it, required the administration to list oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government. At the end of January, the Treasury Department published a list , but didn’t impose sanctions on individuals doing business with Russian military or intelligence bodies.\nSome Democrats criticized the Trump administration for not immediately levying sanctions, particularly on a section targeting military spending and another focused on corrupt politicians and oligarchs.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, however, has signaled new sanctions are coming against Russian oligarchs, possibly within weeks, stirring consternation among Russia’s elite.\nAnother senior administration official said several large countries that had been planning weapon purchases from Russia “are now stepping back” as a result of U.S. diplomatic efforts as Washington warns governments it could hit those countries with fresh sanctions. The official declined to name the countries, and wouldn’t say if the countries in question included Turkey, which signed a deal last year with Russia for a sophisticated antiaircraft defense system.\nThe senior officials argued that ratcheting up sanctions pressure requires careful due diligence to ensure evidence can meet legal thresholds, a process that can take well over a year.\nThey said that is why several major efforts targeting Russia and its allies that have been rolled out by the Trump administration actually were initiated during the Obama administration. The U.S. Treasury started its investigation of the Latvian bank, for example, in 2016, a third administration official said.\nWhile the administration is implementing a concerted strategy to counter Russia’s malign activities, the third senior official said, the White house also has to weigh other foreign-policy priorities.\n“We’re in a very dangerous situation in global affairs right now and we’re also trying to find points where we can actually engage with Russia productively,” the official said. Those include trying to gain support for a global pressure campaign against nuclear-armed North Korea, trying to persuade Moscow to help Washington counter Iran’s growing influence in the Middle East, and curbing Russia’s intervention in Syria, where Kremlin support for President Bashar al-Assad is fueling a civil war.\nStill, some lawmakers question whether either the current or former administration has moved aggressively enough. The combined sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea and support for rebels in Ukraine have yet to force Moscow to retreat from the former Soviet satellite nation, critics have said.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Inspector General intends to review the Russia sanctions program and implementation as part of its regular audit of major programs required by law.\nWrite to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com",
