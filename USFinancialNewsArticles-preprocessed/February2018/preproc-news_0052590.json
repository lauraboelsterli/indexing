( Teekay LNG or the Partnership ) (NYSE:TGP), today reported the Partnership’s results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (in thousands of U.S. Dollars) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON Voyage revenues 126,307 104,285 100,774 432,676 396,444 Income from vessel operations 62,378 10,322 38,010 148,649 153,181 Equity income 2,992 1,417 9,728 9,789 62,307 Net income (loss) attributable to the partners and preferred unitholders 39,877 (18,896 ) 84,411 33,965 140,451 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON Total cash flow from vessel operations (CFVO) (1) 126,833 107,254 114,534 449,550 480,063 Distributable cash flow (DCF) (1) 52,054 40,224 50,199 176,128 234,995 Adjusted net income attributable to the partners and preferred unitholders (1) 33,972 20,925 28,958 93,850 148,982 (1) These are non-GAAP financial measures.

These increases were partially offset by the sale of a conventional tanker in the first quarter of 2017; lower rates earned on two conventional tankers upon the expiration of their fixed-rate charter contracts ending in 2017; and lower spot rates earned for certain of the vessels in the Exmar LPG Joint Venture. Additionally, GAAP net income was also impacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year, by various non-cash items, such as the write-down of a conventional tanker in the fourth quarter of 2016; a decrease in unrealized gains on derivative instruments; and an increase in unrealized foreign currency exchange losses relating to the Partnership’s Euro and NOK-denominated debt.\nCEO Commentary\n“During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Partnership continued to generate stable cash flows and execute on its growth projects and financing plans,” commented Mark Kremin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Teekay Gas Group Ltd.\n“In December 2017, our 50/50 joint venture with China LNG Shipping secured a long-term debt facility to finance all six ARC7 LNG carrier newbuildings and in mid-January 2018, we took delivery of our first ARC7 vessel, the Eduard Toll , two weeks ahead of schedule,” Mr. Kremin continued. “In total, since October 2017, the Partnership has taken delivery of six LNG carrier newbuildings over a four-month period, all of which immediately commenced their respective long-term charter contracts. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2018, we expect to take delivery of another five LNG carrier newbuildings and a further three mid-sized LPG carrier newbuildings in our 50/50 joint venture with Exmar, all of which we expect will provide further cash flow growth to the Partnership.”\n“We also continue to make good progress on refinancing our debt maturities,” commented Mr. Kremin. “I am pleased to report that in November 2017 we refinanced and upsized our unsecured corporate revolving credit facility and in February 2018, we refinanced one of our 2018 loan maturities with a new five-year, $197 million long-term debt facility.”\nMr. Kremin added, “Finally, in January 2018, we completed an opportunistic sale of the 50 percent-owned 2005-built S/S Excelsior at an attractive price.”\nSummary of Recent Events\nLNG Carrier Newbuilding Deliveries\nIn October 2017 through February 2018, the Partnership took delivery of three MEGI LNG carrier newbuildings, the Macoma , Murex and Magdala , all of which immediately commenced their respective charter contracts with Shell ranging between six to eight years in duration, plus extension options.\nIn October 2017 through January 2018, the Partnership’s 30 percent-owned joint venture with China LNG Shipping (Holdings) Limited ( China LNG ) and CETS (an affiliate of China National Offshore Oil Corporation ( CNOOC )) took delivery of two LNG carrier newbuildings, the Pan Asia and the Pan Americas , both of which immediately commenced their respective 20-year charter contracts with Shell.\nIn January 2018, the Partnership's 50 percent-owned joint venture with China LNG ( the Yamal LNG Joint Venture ) took delivery of its first ARC7 LNG carrier newbuilding, the Eduard Toll , which immediately commenced its 28-year charter contract with Yamal LNG.\nNew Teekay Multigas Pool\nIn November 2017, the Partnership terminated its charter contracts with Skaugen due to non-payment of charter hire and established the Teekay Multigas Pool, a new in-house commercial management solution for ethylene-capable LPG and small-scale LNG vessels. The Teekay Multigas Pool now manages the Partnership’s seven directly-owned ethylene-capable LPG carriers, some of which are also capable of small-scale LNG shipping, which were previously part of the Norgas Carriers Pool operated by Skaugen.\nSale of the S/S Excelsior\nIn January 2018, the Partnership sold its 50 percent interest in the S/S Excelsior to Excelerate Energy for net proceeds of approximately $44 million after repaying external debt obligations. The Partnership originally acquired its 50 percent interest in the S/S Excelsior in 2010 through an acquisition from Exmar NV and expects to record a gain of approximately $2 million on the sale in the first quarter of 2018.\nDebt Financing Update\nIn November 2017, the Partnership completed a refinancing and upsizing of its 364-day, unsecured corporate revolving credit facility from $170 million to $190 million.\nIn December 2017, the Yamal LNG Joint Venture completed an $816 million (1) long-term debt facility to finance all six of the Yamal LNG Joint Venture's ARC7 LNG carrier newbuildings delivering through early-2020, the first of which was delivered in January 2018.\nIn February 2018, the Partnership refinanced the full amount of a revolving credit facility maturing in 2018 secured by the Hispania Spirit and Galicia Spirit with a new $197 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2022.\n(1) Based on the Partnership’s 50 percent ownership interests in the six ARC7 LNG carrier newbuildings.\nOperating Results\nThe following table highlights certain financial information for Teekay LNG’s two segments: the Liquefied Gas Segment and the Conventional Tanker Segment (please refer to the “Teekay LNG’s Fleet” section of this release below and Appendices C through E for further details).\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in thousands of U.S. Dollars) (unaudited) (unaudited) Liquefied\nGas\nSegment Conventional\nTanker\nSegment Total Liquefied\nGas\nSegment Conventional\nTanker\nSegment Total GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON Voyage revenues 114,605 11,702 126,307 86,188 14,586 100,774 Income (loss) from vessel operations 60,395 1,983 62,378 43,918 (5,908 ) 38,010 Equity income 2,992 — 2,992 9,728 — 9,728 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON CFVO from consolidated vessels (i) 86,667 4,122 90,789 70,889 7,490 78,379 CFVO from equity-accounted vessels (i) 36,044 — 36,044 36,155 — 36,155 Total CFVO (i) 122,711 4,122 126,833 107,044 7,490 114,534 (i) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to “Definitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the Appendices to this release for definitions of these terms and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures as used in this release to the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP.\nLiquefied Gas Segment\nIncome from vessel operations and cash flow from vessel operations from consolidated vessels for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, were impacted primarily due to higher revenues earned on the deliveries of three MEGI LNG carrier newbuildings between February and November 2017 and recognition of the prepaid lease payments of $10.7 million received from Skaugen in prior periods, which were previously deferred and then recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 upon the termination of the charter contracts for five of the Partnership’s LPG carriers on charter with Skaugen. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues earned for two of the Partnership’s LNG carriers on charter with Awilco LNG ASA ( Awilco ) as the charter contracts for these two LNG carriers were amended in 2017, which have the effect of deferring a portion of the charter hire until December 2019.\nEquity income and cash flow from vessel operations from equity-accounted vessels for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, were impacted primarily due to lower spot rates earned in 2017 on certain vessels in the Exmar LPG Joint Venture. This decrease was partially offset by deliveries of two mid-size LPG carriers in the Exmar LPG Joint Venture between March and July 2017; the delivery of the Partnership’s 30 percent-owned LNG carrier newbuilding on charter to Shell in October 2017; and the commencement of short-term charter contracts for certain of the vessels in the Teekay LNG-Marubeni Joint Venture that were previously earning lower spot rates. Equity income was also impacted by a decrease in net unrealized gains on designated and non-designated derivative instruments and an increase in vessel write-downs in the Exmar LPG Joint Venture during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year.\nConventional Tanker Segment\nIncome (loss) from vessel operations increased for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to the write-down of the Asian Spirit recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower rates earned on the European Spirit and African Spirit conventional tankers upon the expiration of their fixed-rate charter contracts in August and November 2017, respectively. Cash flow from vessel operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, decreased primarily due to the lower rates earned on the European Spirit and African Spirit conventional tankers.\nTeekay LNG's Fleet\nThe following table summarizes the Partnership’s fleet as of February 15, 2018, excluding the Partnership’s 30 percent interest in a regasification facility currently under construction:\nNumber of Vessels Owned and\nIn-Chartered Vessels (i) Newbuildings Total LNG Carrier Fleet 37 (ii) 12 (iii) 49 LPG/Multigas Carrier Fleet 26 (iv) 3 (v) 29 Conventional Tanker Fleet 4 (vi) — 4 Total 67 15 82 (i) Owned vessels includes vessels accounted for as vessels related to capital leases.\n(ii) The Partnership’s ownership interests in these vessels range from 30 percent to 100 percent.\n(iii) The Partnership's ownership interests in these newbuildings, which includes a floating storage unit ( FSU ), range from 20 percent to 100 percent.\n(iv) The Partnership’s ownership interests in these vessels range from 50 percent to 99 percent.\n(v) The Partnership’s ownership interests in these newbuildings is 50 percent.\n(vi) Two of the Partnership's conventional tankers are held for sale.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had total liquidity of $433.6 million (comprised of $244.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $189.4 million in undrawn credit facilities).\nConference Call\nThe Partnership plans to host a conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017. All unitholders and interested parties are invited to listen to the live conference call by choosing from the following options:\nBy dialing (866) 548-4713 or (647) 484-0477, if outside North America, and quoting conference ID code 1441937. By accessing the webcast, which will be available on Teekay LNG’s website at www.teekay.com (the archive will remain on the website for a period of one year).\nAn accompanying Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Presentation will also be available at www.teekay.com in advance of the conference call start time.\nAbout Teekay LNG Partners L.P.\nTeekay LNG Partners is one of the world's largest independent owners and operators of LNG carriers, providing LNG, LPG and crude oil marine transportation services primarily under long-term, fee-based charter contracts through its interests in 49 LNG carriers (including 12 newbuildings), 29 LPG/Multigas carriers (including three newbuildings) and four conventional tankers. The Partnership's interests in these vessels range from 20 to 100 percent. In addition, the Partnership owns a 30 percent interest in a regasification facility, which is currently under construction. Teekay LNG Partners L.P. is a publicly-traded master limited partnership ( MLP ) formed by Teekay Corporation (NYSE:TK) as part of its strategy to expand its operations in the LNG and LPG shipping sectors.\nTeekay LNG Partners’ common units and preferred units trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TGP”, \"TGP PR A\" and \"TGP PR B\", respectively.\nFor Investor Relations\nenquiries contact:\nRyan Hamilton\nTel: +1 (604) 609-2963\nWebsite: www.teekay.com\nDefinitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release includes various financial measures that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These non-GAAP financial measures, which include Cash Flow from Vessel Operations, Adjusted Net Income, and Distributable Cash Flow, are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these measures do not have standardized meanings across companies, and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Partnership believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Partnership’s financial performance, as does management.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCash Flow from Vessel Operations ( CFVO ) represents income from vessel operations before depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of in-process revenue contracts, vessel write-downs, losses on the sales of vessels and adjustments for direct financing leases to a cash basis, but includes realized gains or losses on a derivative charter contract. CFVO from Consolidated Vessels represents CFVO from vessels that are consolidated on the Partnership’s financial statements. CFVO from Equity-Accounted Vessels represents the Partnership’s proportionate share of CFVO from its equity-accounted vessels. The Partnership does not control its equity-accounted vessels and as a result, the Partnership does not have the unilateral ability to determine whether the cash generated by its equity-accounted vessels is retained within the entities in which the Partnership holds the equity-accounted investments or distributed to the Partnership and other owners. In addition, the Partnership does not control the timing of such distributions to the Partnership and other owners. Consequently, readers are cautioned when using total CFVO as a liquidity measure as the amount contributed from CFVO from Equity-Accounted Vessels may not be available to the Partnership in the periods such CFVO is generated by its equity-accounted vessels. CFVO is a non-GAAP financial measure used by certain investors and management to measure the operational financial performance of companies. Please refer to Appendices D and E of this release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to income from vessel operations and income from vessel operations of equity-accounted vessels, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures reflected in the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted Net Income excludes items of income or loss from GAAP net income (loss) that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of the Partnership’s financial results. The Partnership believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Partnership’s financial performance, as does management. Please refer to Appendix A of this release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income, and refer to footnote (2) of the statements of income (loss) for a reconciliation of adjusted equity income to equity income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure reflected in the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.\nDistributable Cash Flow ( DCF ) represents GAAP net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense, deferred income tax and other non-cash items, estimated maintenance capital expenditures, unrealized gains and losses from non-designated derivative instruments, ineffectiveness for derivative instruments designated as hedges for accounting purposes, distributions relating to equity financing of newbuilding installments, adjustments for direct financing leases to a cash basis and foreign exchange related items, including the Partnership's proportionate share of such items in equity-accounted for investments. Maintenance capital expenditures represent those capital expenditures required to maintain over the long-term the operating capacity of, or the revenue generated by, the Partnership's capital assets. DCF is a quantitative standard used in the publicly-traded partnership investment community and by management to assist in evaluating financial performance. Please refer to Appendix B of this release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure reflected in the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.\nTeekay LNG Partners L.P.\nConsolidated Statements of Income (Loss)\n(in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except units outstanding)\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) Voyage revenues 126,307 104,285 100,774 432,676 396,444 Voyage expenses (4,303 ) (1,466 ) (302 ) (8,202 ) (1,656 ) Vessel operating expenses (27,026 ) (26,724 ) (22,270 ) (103,139 ) (88,590 ) Depreciation and amortization (27,651 ) (24,980 ) (25,021 ) (105,545 ) (95,542 ) General and administrative expenses (4,949 ) (2,793 ) (3,634 ) (16,541 ) (18,499 ) Write-down and loss on sales of vessels (1) — (38,000 ) (11,537 ) (50,600 ) (38,976 ) Income from vessel operations 62,378 10,322 38,010 148,649 153,181 Equity income (2) 2,992 1,417 9,728 9,789 62,307 Interest expense (23,333 ) (20,091 ) (15,934 ) (80,937 ) (58,844 ) Interest income 880 602 783 2,915 2,583 Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on non-designated derivative instruments (3) 3,066 (2,178 ) 43,245 (5,309 ) (7,161 ) Foreign currency exchange (loss) gain (4) (2,436 ) (5,104 ) 15,474 (26,933 ) 5,335 Other income 424 356 314 1,561 1,537 Net income (loss) before tax expense 43,971 (14,676 ) 91,620 49,735 158,938 Income tax recovery (expense) 319 (750 ) (251 ) (824 ) (973 ) Net income (loss) 44,290 (15,426 ) 91,369 48,911 157,965 Non-controlling interest in net income (loss) 4,413 3,470 6,958 14,946 17,514 Preferred unitholders' interest in net income (loss) 5,541 2,813 2,719 13,979 2,719 General Partner's interest in net income (loss) 687 (434 ) 1,634 400 2,755 Limited partners’ interest in net income (loss) 33,649 (21,275 ) 80,058 19,586 134,977 Weighted-average number of common units outstanding: • Basic 79,626,819 79,626,819 79,571,820 79,617,778 79,568,352 • Diluted 79,839,231 79,626,819 79,705,854 79,791,041 79,671,858 Total number of common units outstanding at end of period 79,626,819 79,626,819 79,571,820 79,626,819 79,571,820 (1) The write-down and loss on sales of vessels for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and year ended December 31, 2017 includes impairment charges on the African Spirit, Teide Spirit and Toledo Spirit Suezmax tankers. The charterer for the African Spirit notified the Partnership in August 2017 that it would redeliver the vessel to the Partnership upon its charter contract ending in November 2017, which resulted in a write-down of the vessel to its estimated market value. The African Spirit was redelivered to the Partnership in November 2017. The charterer for the Teide Spirit and Toledo Spirit, who is also the owner of these vessels, has the option to cancel the charter contracts 13 years following commencement of the respective charter contracts. In October 2017, the charterer notified the Partnership that it was marketing the Teide Spirit f or sale and subsequently, sold the vessel on February 8, 2018. Upon sale of the vessel, the charterer concurrently terminated its charter contract with the Partnership. The charterer’s cancellation option for the Toledo Spirit is first exercisable in August 2018. Given the Partnership's prior experience with this charterer, the Partnership expects the charterer will cancel the charter contract and sell the Toledo Spirit to a third party in 2018. As a result, the Partnership wrote down the Teide Spirit and Toledo Spirit to their estimated market values. The write-down and loss on sales of vessels for the year ended December 31, 2017 also includes the write-down of the European Spirit Suezmax tanker to its estimated market value, as the Partnership commenced marketing the vessel for sale upon receiving notification from the charterer in late-June 2017 that it would redeliver the vessel back to the Partnership in August 2017. The write-down and loss on sales of vessels for the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to Centrofin Management Inc. exercising its purchase options, under the 12-year charter contracts, to acquire the Bermuda Spirit and Hamilton Spirit Suezmax tankers . In addition, the write-down and loss on sales of vessels for the three months ended December 31, 2016 includes the write-down of the Asian Spirit upon the Partnership reaching an agreement to sell the vessel in November 2016.\n(2) The Partnership’s proportionate share of items within equity income as identified in Appendix A of this release is detailed in the table below. By excluding these items from equity income, the Partnership believes the resulting adjusted equity income is a normalized amount that can be used to evaluate the financial performance of the Partnership’s equity-accounted investments. Adjusted equity income is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Equity income 2,992 1,417 9,728 9,789 62,307 Proportionate share of unrealized (gain) loss on non-designated derivative instruments (4,404 ) (1,485 ) (8,078 ) (7,491 ) (6,963 ) Proportionate share of ineffective portion of hedge-accounted interest rate swaps 566 968 (364 ) 5,100 (372 ) Proportionate share of write-down and loss on sales of vessels 5,500 — 4,861 5,500 4,861 Proportionate share of other items 191 219 1,162 651 1,317 Equity income adjusted for items in Appendix A 4,845 1,119 7,309 13,549 61,150 (3) The realized (losses) gains on non-designated derivative instruments relate to the amounts the Partnership actually paid or received to settle non-designated derivative instruments and the unrealized gains (losses) on non-designated derivative instruments relate to the change in fair value of such non-designated derivative instruments, as detailed in the table below:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Realized (losses) gains relating to: Interest rate swap agreements (5,012 ) (4,528 ) (6,190 ) (18,825 ) (25,940 ) Interest rate swaption agreements termination — — — (610 ) — Toledo Spirit time-charter derivative contract 152 646 (1,274 ) 678 (654 ) (4,860 ) (3,882 ) (7,464 ) (18,757 ) (26,594 ) Unrealized gains (losses) relating to: Interest rate swap agreements 8,182 1,775 34,068 12,393 15,627 Interest rate swaption agreements 518 285 16,601 945 (164 ) Toledo Spirit time-charter derivative contract (774 ) (356 ) 40 110 3,970 7,926 1,704 50,709 13,448 19,433 Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) on non-designated derivative instruments 3,066 (2,178 ) 43,245 (5,309 ) (7,161 ) (4) For accounting purposes, the Partnership is required to revalue all foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities based on the prevailing exchange rates at the end of each reporting period. This revaluation does not affect the Partnership’s cash flows or the calculation of distributable cash flow, but results in the recognition of unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nForeign currency exchange (loss) gain includes realized losses relating to the amounts the Partnership paid to settle or terminate the Partnership’s non-designated cross-currency swaps that were entered into as economic hedges in relation to the Partnership’s Norwegian Kroner ( NOK ) denominated unsecured bonds and realized gains on NOK bond repurchases. Foreign currency exchange (loss) gain also includes unrealized (losses) gains relating to the change in fair value of such derivative instruments, partially offset by unrealized gains (losses) on the revaluation of the NOK bonds as detailed in the table below:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Realized losses

The following factors are among those that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, and that should be considered in evaluating any such statement: potential shipyard and project construction delays, newbuilding specification changes or cost overruns; changes in production of LNG or LPG, either generally or in particular regions; changes in trading patterns or timing of start-up of new LNG liquefaction and regasification projects significantly affecting overall vessel tonnage requirements; changes in applicable industry laws and regulations and the timing of implementation of new laws and regulations; the potential for early termination of long-term contracts of existing vessels in the Partnership's fleet; the inability of charterers to make future charter payments; the inability of the Partnership to renew or replace long-term contracts on existing vessels; the Partnership’s or the Partnership’s joint ventures’ ability to secure or draw on financings for its vessels; and other factors discussed in Teekay LNG Partners’ filings from time to time with the SEC, including its Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The Partnership expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the Partnership’s expectations with respect thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nSource:Teekay LNG Partners L.P.",
