The stock was down 8.5 percent at 14.855 euros as of 1200 GMT.\nLast summer, the firm flagged growing price pressures from raw materials and development projects and cut its annual profit guidance.\nSeparately, Schaeffler said it would accelerate a group-wide efficiency programme designed to sharpen its customer focus and operational performance to boost competitiveness\n$1 = 0.8046 euros Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Mark Potter\n ",
