    "text": "BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (NYSE: PEB) (the “Company”) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The Company’s results include the following:\nFourth Quarter Full Year 2017 2016 2017 2016 ($ in millions except per share and RevPAR data) Net income $11.9 $18.4 $100.3 $74.0 Same-Property RevPAR (1) $188.54 $188.78 $207.33 $212.01 Same-Property RevPAR growth rate (0.1%) (2.2%) Same-Property Total RevPAR (1) $281.14 $273.33 $299.03 $299.82 Same-Property Total RevPAR growth rate 2.9% (0.3%) Same-Property EBITDA (1) $53.8 $53.6 $253.6 $265.9 Same-Property EBITDA growth rate 0.4% (4.6%) Same-Property EBITDA Margin (1) 30.7% 31.5% 33.7% 35.2% Adjusted EBITDA (1) $46.8 $57.7 $233.1 $273.2 Adjusted EBITDA growth rate (18.8%) (14.7%) Adjusted FFO (1) $33.8 $41.5 $180.4 $201.8 Adjusted FFO per diluted share (1) $0.49 $0.57 $2.57 $2.78 Adjusted FFO per diluted share growth rate (14.0%) (7.6%) (1)\nSee tables later in this press release for a description of same-property information and reconciliations from net income (loss) to non-GAAP financial measures, including Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"), Adjusted EBITDA, Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), FFO per share, Adjusted FFO and Adjusted FFO per share.\nFor the details as to which hotels are included in Same-Property Revenue Per Available Room (“RevPAR”), Same-Property Total Revenue Per Available Room (“Total RevPAR”), Average Daily Rate (“ADR”), Occupancy, Revenues, Expenses, EBITDA and EBITDA Margins appearing in the table above and elsewhere in this press release, refer to the Same-Property Inclusion Reference Table later in this press release.\n“We are pleased with our 2017 performance and the continued operating improvements we made throughout the portfolio,” said Jon E. Bortz, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust. “We exceeded our outlook for Same-Property EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO per diluted share for the fourth quarter and the year. We also completed $80.8 million of capital reinvestments, including several major redevelopment projects which we expect will generate significant growth in 2018 and beyond. We were also successful in our strategic disposition plan, as we sold two additional properties for $213.0 million, which enabled us to reduce our leverage, improve our balance sheet and repurchase $93.4 million of common shares at a significant discount to our Net Asset Value. As we look ahead to 2018, we are incrementally more optimistic about the economy, which should result in increased travel and hotel demand. However, businesses remain cautious, and while we’ve seen some spotty evidence of progress, we’ve not yet experienced any material improvement in corporate travel trends. Leisure demand growth remains robust despite declines in international inbound travel, and we expect these trends to continue throughout 2018.”\n2017 Highlights\nNet income : The Company’s net income was $100.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, rising $26.3 million as compared to 2016, primarily due to the impairment losses related to property dispositions in the prior year. Same-Property RevPAR and Same-Property Total RevPAR : Same-Property RevPAR for the year fell 2.2 percent versus 2016 to $207.33. Excluding San Francisco, Same-Property RevPAR declined 0.3 percent over the prior year. Same-Property ADR slipped 1.0 percent from the prior year to $245.73. Same-Property Occupancy decreased 1.3 percent to 84.4 percent. Same-Property Total RevPAR declined 0.3 percent from the same period of 2016, due to healthy improvements in Food & Beverage Revenue and Other Revenue. Same-Property EBITDA : The Company’s hotels generated $253.6 million of Same-Property EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017, declining 4.6 percent from 2016. Same-Property Revenues decreased 0.5 percent, while Same-Property Expenses increased 1.7 percent. Same-Property EBITDA Margin declined by 146 basis points to 33.7 percent for 2017, as compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA : The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 declined to $233.1 million, a loss of 14.7 percent versus $273.2 million in 2016. The declines were partially a result of the properties the Company sold during 2017 and the necessary closure of LaPlaya Beach Resort & Club (“LaPlaya”) for the majority of the fourth quarter of 2017 following Hurricane Irma. Adjusted FFO : The Company’s Adjusted FFO decreased 10.6 percent to $180.4 million, compared with $201.8 million for the prior year. Dividends : During 2017, the Company declared dividends of $1.52 per share on its common shares, $1.63 per share on its 6.50% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest and $1.59 per share on its 6.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest.\n“Our hotels generated solid results despite the challenging operating environment, which included the disruption related to the expansion of the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco, as well as several natural disasters and redevelopment projects,” said Mr. Bortz. “These headwinds that we endured in 2017 should serve as tailwinds for our portfolio in 2018 and 2019 as the San Francisco market is recovering as anticipated and our recently renovated hotels are recapturing market share and increasing their cash flows. In addition, our properties continue to generate healthy growth in non-room revenues, such as food and beverage, which we expect to continue throughout the year.”\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nNet income : The Company’s net income was $11.9 million in declining $6.5 million as compared to the same period of 2016. Same-Property RevPAR and Same-Property Total RevPAR : Same-Property RevPAR for the quarter fell slightly by 0.1 percent over 2016 to $188.54. Excluding San Francisco, Same-Property RevPAR rose 0.7 percent over the prior year. Same-Property ADR increased 0.7 percent from the prior year to $234.40. Same-Property Occupancy decreased 0.9 percent to 80.4 percent. Same-Property Total RevPAR grew 2.9 percent over the same period of 2016 to $281.14. Same-Property EBITDA : The Company’s hotels generated $53.8 million of Same-Property EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, increasing 0.4 percent over the same period of 2016. Same-Property Revenues grew 2.9 percent, while Same-Property Expenses rose by 4.1 percent. Same-Property EBITDA Margin declined by 78 basis points to 30.7 percent for as compared to the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA : The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $46.8 million from $57.7 million in the prior year period, a decrease of $10.9 million, or 18.8 percent. The declines were primarily a result of the properties the Company sold during 2017 and the necessary closure of LaPlaya for the majority of the fourth quarter of 2017 following Hurricane Irma. LaPlaya has now fully reopened following its period of restoration and renovation. Adjusted FFO : The Company’s Adjusted FFO decreased 18.4 percent to $33.8 million from $41.5 million in the prior year period. Dividends : On December 15, 2017, the Company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share on its common shares, a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.40625 per share on its 6.50% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest and a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.39844 per share on its 6.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest.\n“Many leading economic indicators remain positive or have been improving, the global economy is healthy and is gaining momentum, and business sentiment remains positive, all of which are encouraging trends for the hotel industry and our portfolio,” noted Mr. Bortz. “Still, we will maintain our modest outlook for industry demand growth until we see a substantive pickup in corporate demand. On the operating side, we continue to experience cost pressures, including labor and employee benefits. Our asset managers work constantly in partnership with our hotel teams to implement best practices in order to limit expense growth, increase efficiencies and improve profitability.”\nUpdate on Impact from Hurricane Irma on LaPlaya Beach Resort & Club\nThe Company completed the major repair and remediation work at LaPlaya in late January 2018, and all guestrooms have been reopened. The Company expects to complete additional repair work later in 2018, which will negatively impact the resort’s performance and is included in our outlook. However, the Company anticipates this disruption will be covered under the Company’s current business interruption and property insurance programs, although to be conservative, and prior to any settlement, business interruption proceeds for 2018 are not included in our outlook.\nStrategic Disposition Plan\nDuring 2017, the Company continued the execution of its previously announced strategic disposition plan with the completion of two transactions, which brought the total amount of sales within the original targeted range of $500.0 million to $1.0 billion. In the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed the sales of the 252-room Dumont NYC for a price of $118.0 million and the 826-space parking garage at Revere Hotel Boston Common for a price of $95.0 million. The two sales, totaling $213.0 million, bring the Company’s total disposition proceeds to $676.8 million over the past two years.\nIn addition, in the Company received $2.0 million in cash for a forfeited hard-money security deposit in connection with a potential property sale with a third-party buyer. The Company will continue to evaluate opportunistic and selective sales within its portfolio.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn 2017, the Company completed a total of 3.2 million common share repurchases at an average price of $28.77 per share totaling $93.4 million. Under the $250.0 million common share repurchase program, the Company is authorized to repurchase an additional $156.6 million of common shares. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and the Company is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of shares. There were no repurchases in the fourth quarter.\nCapital Reinvestments\nDuring 2017, the Company completed $80.8 million of capital investments throughout its portfolio. The Company’s capital improvements included $21.7 million at Revere Hotel Boston Common (part of a $22.5 million project), $12.5 million at Hotel Zoe San Francisco (which was included in a $17.0 million transformation of the former Tuscan Fisherman’s Wharf), $4.7 million at Hotel Palomar Los Angeles Beverly Hills (part of a $12.0 million redevelopment) and $11.1 million at LaPlaya Beach Resort & Club ($8.0 million of which is primarily attributed to the Gulf Tower renovation project).\nIn 2018, the Company intends to start or complete several renovation and repositioning projects including:\nMondrian Los Angeles (estimated at $11.0 million) which will undergo a renovation of the guestrooms and lobby as well as a renovation of the Skybar restaurant beginning in the fourth quarter of this year with an expected completion date in the first quarter of 2019; Hotel Zelos San Francisco (estimated at $6.0 million), which is planning a guestroom renovation to complement recent improvements to the guestrooms as well as the transformative lobby, guestroom corridor and restaurant renovation completed in 2014; Hotel Zephyr Fisherman’s Wharf, Zephyr Walk (estimated at $5.5 million), which is undergoing a redevelopment and re-leasing of most of the approximately 46,000 square feet of street level retail space that began in the fourth quarter of 2017 with an expected completion date in the second quarter of 2018; and Revere Hotel Boston Common (estimated at $3.5 million), which involves the conversion of the property’s nightlife club into a newly completed restaurant called Rebel’s Guild that will fully transform the food and beverage offerings at the hotel.\nCapital Markets and Balance Sheet\nIn 2017, Pebblebrook refinanced and extended the maturities of the Company’s $450.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and four unsecured term loans comprising $675.0 million. The Company now has no debt maturities until 2020. Additionally, the Company paid off $44.1 million of maturing debt on the Sofitel Philadelphia and the $25.5 million mortgage secured by the Hotel Zelos San Francisco.\n“We were pleased with the terrific results of our credit facility and term loan refinancing and debt maturity payoffs in 2017, which has allowed us to lower our overall leverage, increase our coverage ratios and extend our debt maturities,” noted Raymond D. Martz, Chief Financial Officer of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust. “The Company’s balance sheet continues to be in a strong position to provide any needed liquidity in order to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise over the next several years. We appreciate the continued support and longstanding positive relationships shown by our banking partners.”\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $890.6 million in consolidated debt at an effective weighted-average interest rate of 3.3 percent. The Company had $675.0 million outstanding in the form of unsecured term loans and $45.0 million outstanding on its $450.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $32.5 million of consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.\nOn December 31, 2017, as defined in the Company’s credit agreement, the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.7 times and total net debt to trailing 12-month corporate EBITDA was 3.7 times.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company's outlook for 2018, which assumes no additional acquisitions or dispositions, reflects the Company’s various planned capital investment projects and includes other significant assumptions, including an estimated $3.5 million of business interruption proceeds related to the LaPlaya hurricane impact in 2017, is as follows:\n2018 Outlook Low High ($ and shares/units in millions, except per share and RevPAR data) Net income\n$79.7 $89.7 Adjusted EBITDA $224.5 $234.5 Adjusted EBITDA growth rate (3.7%) 0.6% Adjusted FFO $171.6 $181.6 Adjusted FFO per diluted share $2.46 $2.61 Adjusted FFO per diluted share growth rate (4.3%) 1.6% This 2018 outlook is based, in part, on the following estimates and assumptions:\nU.S. GDP growth rate 2.50% 2.75% U.S. Hotel Industry RevPAR growth rate 1.0% 3.0% Urban Markets RevPAR growth rate (1.0%) 1.0% Same-Property RevPAR $207 $211 Same-Property RevPAR growth rate (0.5%) 1.5% Same-Property EBITDA $244.5 $254.5 Same-Property EBITDA growth rate (3.9%) 0.0% Same-Property EBITDA Margin 32.6% 33.1% Same-Property EBITDA Margin growth rate (125 bps) (75 bps) Corporate cash general and administrative expenses $21.0 $21.0 Corporate non-cash general and administrative expenses $6.7 $6.7 Total capital investments related to renovations, capital maintenance and return on investment projects $55.0 $65.0 Weighted-average fully diluted shares and units 69.7 69.7 “The hotel industry is entering 2018 with an improved economic outlook and more optimism than in 2017,” commented Mr. Bortz. “We expect the urban markets to continue to underperform the overall industry, primarily due to increased supply. Our portfolio, however, should outperform the urban markets by approximately 50 bps, as we benefit from the ramp up of several hotels following disruptive renovations in 2017 as well as an improving environment in San Francisco. We remain encouraged with the fundamentals in our markets as supply growth appears to be peaking later this year and demand growth remains solid despite only modest growth in the corporate segment. The improved sentiment in the business community may serve as a positive catalyst for hotel demand later in 2018.”\nThe Company’s outlook for the first quarter of 2018 is as follows:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Outlook Low High ($ and shares/units in millions, except per share and RevPAR data) Net income $14.5 $17.5 Same-Property RevPAR $189 $193 Same-Property RevPAR growth rate (3.5%) (1.5%) Same-Property EBITDA $48.5 $51.5 Same-Property EBITDA growth rate (11.0%) (5.5%) Same-Property EBITDA Margin 28.7% 29.2% Same-Property EBITDA Margin growth rate (200 bps) (150 bps) Adjusted EBITDA $47.1 $50.1 Adjusted EBITDA growth rate (3.9%) 2.2% Adjusted FFO $35.4 $38.4 Adjusted FFO per diluted share $0.51 $0.55 Adjusted FFO per diluted share growth rate (5.6%) 1.9% Weighted-average fully diluted shares and units 69.7 69.7 The Company’s estimates and assumptions, including the Company’s outlook for 2018 and the first quarter 2018 for Same-Property RevPAR, Same-Property RevPAR growth rate, Same-Property EBITDA, Same-Property EBITDA growth rate, Same-Property EBITDA Margin and Same-Property EBITDA Margin growth rate include the hotels owned as of December 31, 2017, as if they had been owned by the Company for all of 2017 and 2018, except for LaPlaya, which is not included in the third or fourth quarters. The Company’s 2018 outlook assumes no additional acquisitions or dispositions beyond the hotels the Company owned as of December 31, 2017.\nIf any of the foregoing estimates and assumptions prove to be inaccurate, actual results, including the outlook, may vary, and could vary significantly, from the amounts shown above.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call\nThe Company will conduct its quarterly analyst and investor conference call on Friday, February 23, 2018 at 10:00 AM ET.

These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP. Funds from Operations (“FFO”) - FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships. The Company considers FFO a useful measure of performance for an equity REIT because it facilitates an understanding of the Company's operating performance without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, the Company believes that FFO provides a meaningful indication of its performance. The Company also considers FFO an appropriate performance measure given its wide use by investors and analysts. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999 and April 2002), which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to that of other REITs. Further, FFO does not represent amounts available for management’s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. The Company presents FFO per diluted share calculations that are based on the outstanding dilutive common shares plus the outstanding Operating Partnership units for the periods presented. The Company also evaluates its performance by reviewing Adjusted FFO because it believes that adjusting FFO to exclude certain recurring and non-recurring items described below provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted FFO, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income (loss), more completely describes the Company's operating performance. The Company adjusts FFO for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refers to this measure as Adjusted FFO: - Hotel acquisition and disposition costs: The Company excludes acquisition and disposition transaction costs expensed during the period because it believes that including these costs in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels. - Non-cash ground rent: The Company excludes the non-cash ground rent expense, which is primarily made up of the straight-line rent impact from a ground lease. - Management/franchise contract transition costs: The Company excludes one-time management and/or franchise contract transition costs expensed during the period because it believes that including these costs in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels. - Interest expense adjustment for acquired liabilities: The Company excludes interest expense adjustment for acquired liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions, because it believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company. - Capital lease adjustment: The Company excludes the effect of non-cash interest expense from capital leases because it believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company. - Non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles: The Company excludes the non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, which includes but is not limited to the amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and above/below market real estate tax reduction agreements because it believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company. - Issuance costs of redeemed preferred shares: The Company excludes issuance costs of redeemed preferred shares during the period because it believes that including these adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels. - Estimated hurricane related repairs and cleanup costs: The Company excludes estimated hurricane related repairs and cleanup costs during the period because it believes that including these adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels. - Other: The Company excludes both the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instruments during the period because it believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels and the forfeited deposits on asset transactions because it believes that including these adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying performance of the Company and its hotels. The Company’s presentation of FFO in accordance with the NAREIT White Paper, and as adjusted by the Company, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its liquidity.
