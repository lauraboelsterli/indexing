    "text": "CNBC.com Bill O'Leary | The Washington Post | Getty Images President Donald Trump gestures to onlookers as he departs the White House on March, 15, 2017 in Washington, DC. \nLike the typical American, the president of the United States is on salary. \nUnlike the typical American worker, who brings in about $44,564 a year , the president is paid $400,000 a year , plus an extra expense allowance of $50,000 a year, a $100,000 non-taxable travel account and $19,000 for entertainment. \nBetween 1789, when George Washington came into office, and today, there have been five pay raises for the President, the most recent one coming in 2001, when Congress doubled the presidential salary. George W. Bush, who took office that year, was the first to benefit from the increase â€” which, as you can tell from the breakdown below, was arguably overdue. \nCNBC Make It used an inflation calculator to determine what each salary would be worth in today's dollars. It turns out that $400,000 a year is nothing compared to what some previous presidents earned.",
