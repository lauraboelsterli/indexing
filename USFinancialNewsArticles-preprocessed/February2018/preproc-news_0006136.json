    "text": "EditorsNote: minor edits\nForward Marreese Speights led seven Orlando players in double figures with 21 points as the Magic rolled to a 127-105 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night at the Amway Center in Orlando, Fla.\nStarting for leading scorer Aaron Gordon (hip), Speights delivered his most productive showing with the Magic. In his 26th career game with at least 20 points, Speights made 6 of 11 shots as Orlando shot 54.3 percent.\nEvan Fournier added 14 of his 19 points in the third quarter when Orlando pulled away. He made five 3-pointers, and Orlando shot a season-best 56.3 percent (18 of 32) from 3-point range and tied a season high for 3-pointers.\nElfrid Payton finished with 15 points, seven rebounds and six assists along with four or Orlandoâ€™s 13 steals. Jonathon Simmons and Mario Hezonja contributed 14 points apiece while reserve point guards Shelvin Mack and D.J. Augustin chipped in 13 and 12, respectively.\nJulius Randle and reserve guard Jordan Clarkson led the Lakers with 20 points apiece. Brandon Ingram added 13 while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope contributed 12 as the Lakers lost for the fourth time in their past 12 games.\nLos Angeles lost for the ninth time in its past 10 visits to Orlando despite shooting 47 percent. The Lakers allowed more than 125 points for the fifth time and trailed for the final 41-plus minutes.\nOrlando took a 29-25 lead into the second and quickly expanded it. The Magic took their first double-digit lead at 44-33 when rookie Kyle Kuzma lost the ball and Augustin turned the steal into a transition layup with 7:06 remaining.\nOrlando held a 48-36 edge following a layup by Wesley Iwundu with 5:12 remaining, but Clarkson scored seven consecutive points. The Lakers cut the deficit to 50-47 on a 5-footer by Randle, but Speights scored eight straight points and Orlando carried a 58-51 lead into halftime.\nThe Magic outscored the Lakers 43-30 in the third and took their first 20-point lead with 58 seconds left on a 3-pointer by Hezonja. Orlando took a 101-81 advantage into the fourth after Speights hit two free throws with four seconds left in the third.\nThe Magic led by as many 28 midway through the fourth.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
