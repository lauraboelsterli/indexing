    "text": "SEATTLE, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Giving Compass , the first of its kind online portal aggregating information to help people give with impact, announced today the appointment of Ben Klasky as CEO.\nKlasky is one of the northwest's premier experts in social entrepreneurship and nonprofit leadership, most recently serving at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation where he led the strategy, planning and management of philanthropic solutions for ultra high net worth individuals. He is also an active community member, having served on many corporate and nonprofit boards, in roles ranging from Treasurer to Secretary to Board Chair. Klasky spent over twelve years as the CEO of IslandWood, an organization that introduces thousands of low-income students to the outdoors each year. A prolific speaker and writer, Klasky has been featured in HuffPost, TEDx, and in the halls of academia as an adjunct professor at the University of Washington. Klasky cut his teeth with leadership roles in variety of public and private organizations including Net Impact, Camp Galileo, Deloitte and Teach for America. Klasky holds an MBA and Masters in Education from Stanford University and a B.A. in Social Psychology from Tufts University.\n\"With over two decades of experience in the field, Ben is an engaging visionary who will no doubt ensure Giving Compass gains exponential traction,\" said Jeff Raikes. \"Under his stewardship, I look forward to seeing Giving Compass create market leadership in the field of donor education using the principles of impact philanthropy coupled with technology innovation to drive the sector forward.\"\nGiving Compass was incubated at Giving Tech Labs thanks to a catalytic grant by the Raikes Foundation, founded by Jeff and Tricia Raikes. Launched last July 2017, Giving Compass has attracted over 100,000 visits in its incubation phase. With the appointment of Klasky as CEO, Giving Compass has become the first spin-off from Giving Tech Labs of Seattle, WA, where Jeff and Tricia Raikes serve as board advisors.\n\"The potential for Giving Compass is truly remarkable,\" said Ben Klasky, CEO, Giving Compass. \"85% of donors say they want to give with impact, but only 9% compare organizations to assess their relative impact. Giving Compass provides philanthropists with their own trusted destination to conduct research, in the same way American investors regularly rely on financial portals to research the stock market and investment opportunities.\"\nGiving Compass offers a digital experience featuring cause-related news, resources, events, volunteering opportunities, funds, organizations and other content to make it easier to give well.\nGiving Compass represents a partnership in giving with a collective of corporate citizens, foundations, and nonprofits to advocate for impact philanthropy including Boardsource, Bright Funds, Charity Navigator, Global Brigades, Global Giving, Imperative, LEAP Ambassadors, National Center for Family Philanthropy, Philanthropy Roundtable, Raikes Foundation, Seattle Foundation, Social Impact Exchange, Social Venture Partners, Stanford PACS, The Bridgespan Group, The Center for High Impact Philanthropy, The Impact Network, The Philanthropy Workshop, VolunteerMatch and more.\nAbout Giving Compass\nHeadquartered in Seattle, WA, Giving Compass is a nonprofit portal organizing the world's information to make it easier to give well.
