    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- On the heels of its $53 million funding round, ProsperWorks, the leading CRM for G Suite that is also recommended by Google's G Suite Marketplace, today announced it has appointed Jon Aniano as chief product officer, Morgan Norman as chief marketing officer and Niraj Shah as vice president of growth. With decades of product, marketing and leadership experience, these executives bring deep expertise in scaling global enterprise software companies to help ProsperWorks drive its next stage of growth.\n\"Jon, Morgan and Niraj bring a wealth of impressive experience scaling businesses quickly and building multi-billion dollar companies, which is exactly what we need to accelerate our growth,\" said Jon Lee, CEO. \"Bringing them on board makes us even more confident in our ability to fulfill our mission to shift how companies manage relationships.\"\nThese appointments solidify ProsperWorks' leadership team as the company continues to grow rapidly and drive innovation in the CRM space with its relationship collaboration platform. By offering a better CRM that is natively integrated with G Suite, ProsperWorks has increased year-over-year revenue by 152 percent and expanded its customer base to over 10,000 businesses in more than 100 countries. The company's rapid traction underscores its ability to meet the evolving expectations of a CRM among sales and marketing teams, who need technology that enables them to manage and understand business relationships, in addition to managing sales forecasts and data.\n\"ProsperWorks is ushering in a new era by building the CRM foundation on relationships, not records,\" said Promod Haque, senior managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners, an investor in ProsperWorks. \"ProsperWorks has a tremendous market opportunity to provide every size company relationship tools they need to thrive. Jon, Morgan and Niraj come at an inflection point for ProsperWorks, and their deep expertise in the CRM space and growing SaaS companies position the company to take full advantage of this opportunity.\"\nAs chief product officer, Aniano will be responsible for driving the global product vision for ProsperWorks' relationship collaboration platform. Previously, Aniano served as the senior vice president of product management for the Salesforce Service Cloud, the fastest-growing and second-largest business unit at Salesforce, as it grew to a multi-billion dollar product line. He also served as head of product management at Salesforce's Desk.com , an all-in-one customer service application for fast-growing companies. Prior to Salesforce, Aniano helped lead cloud-based web chat startup Activa Live Chat to an acquisition by Salesforce in 2010.\nAs chief marketing officer, Norman will lead all worldwide marketing initiatives, including demand generation and corporate, product and industry marketing, and guide strategic direction for ProsperWorks' expanding global brand. He was previously the chief marketing officer of Dialpad, where he helped the business communications platform grow annual recurring revenue nearly 5X in just two years. Prior to Dialpad, Norman was chief creative officer and Senior Vice President of marketing at NetSuite and Zuora, and also held a marketing executive role at Microsoft's Dynamics CRM division.\nAs vice president of growth, Shah will be responsible for expanding ProsperWorks' SMB customer base, its largest customer segment. He previously helped Zendesk and Marin Software through successful IPOs, serving in leadership roles across sales, operations, and strategy. At Zendesk, Shah held a variety of management positions in marketing and sales focused on its growth division. At Marin, he served as a general manager, among other roles, where he led the launch of its mid-market business unit.\nAbout ProsperWorks\nProsperWorks is a recommended CRM for G Suite (formerly Google Apps for Work). ProsperWorks helps companies sell more with a CRM that's simple to use, deeply integrated with G Suite and automated to eliminate tedious data entry. Founded by entrepreneurs Jon Lee and Kelly Cheng, ProsperWorks is based in San Francisco, has 150 employees and has raised $87M in venture capital financing.
