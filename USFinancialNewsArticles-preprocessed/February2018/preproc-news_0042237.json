In total, approximately 22 million common shares of PotlatchDeltic will be issued to Deltic Timber shareholders, representing approximately 35 percent of total shares of outstanding.\nAbout PotlatchDeltic\nPotlatchDeltic Corporation (NASDAQ:PCH) is a leading Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that owns nearly 2 million acres of timberlands in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi.
