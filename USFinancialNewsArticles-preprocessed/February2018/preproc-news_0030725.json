    "text": "Feb 14 (Reuters) - CF Industries Holdings Inc reported a 27 percent jump in fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, benefiting from robust demand for its nitrogen fertilizer.\nThe company reported net profit of $465 million, or $1.98 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $320 million, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier.\nThe company benefited from $491 million one-time gain in the quarter due to changes in the U.S. tax law.\nNet sales rose to $1.1 billion from $867 million.
