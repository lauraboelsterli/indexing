These are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by terms such as “expects,” “believes,” “plans,” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Those involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the . The company may be required to revise its results contained herein upon finalizing its review of quarterly and full-year results and completion of the annual audit, which could cause or contribute to such differences. Additional factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) the possibility that general economic conditions, including leasing velocity or uncertainty, could cause information technology spending, particularly in the rental housing industry, to be reduced or purchasing decisions to be delayed; (b) an increase in insurance claims; (c) an increase in client cancellations; (d) the inability to increase sales to existing clients and to attract new clients; (e) RealPage’s failure to integrate acquired businesses and any recent or future acquisitions successfully or to achieve expected synergies, including the recently completed acquisition of LRO; (f) the timing and success of new product introductions by RealPage or its competitors; (g) changes in RealPage’s pricing policies or those of its competitors; (h) legal or regulatory proceedings; (i) the inability to achieve revenue growth or to enable margin expansion; (j) changes in RealPage’s estimates with respect to its long-term corporate tax rate or any other impact from the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and (k) such other risks and uncertainties described more fully in documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) by RealPage, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on November 7, 2017. All information provided in this release is as of the date hereof and RealPage undertakes no duty to update this information except as required by law.\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. However, the company believes that, in order to properly understand its short-term and long-term financial, operational and strategic trends, it may be helpful for investors to exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring items when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These non-cash or non-recurring items result from facts and circumstances that vary in both frequency and impact on continuing operations. The company also uses results of operations excluding such items to evaluate the operating performance of RealPage and compare it against prior periods, make operating decisions, determine executive compensation, and serve as a basis for long-term strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide the company with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in its ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that RealPage believes might otherwise make comparisons of its ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts, or obscure the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of certain business strategies and management incentive structures. In addition, the company also believes that investors and financial analysts find this information to be helpful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Total Revenue” as total revenue plus acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments. The company believes it is useful to include deferred revenue written down for GAAP purposes under purchase accounting rules and revenue deferred due to a lack of historical experience determining the settlement of the contractual obligation in order to appropriately measure the underlying performance of its business operations in the period of activity and associated expense. Further, the company believes this measure is useful to investors as a way to evaluate the company’s ongoing performance because it provides a more accurate depiction of on demand revenue arising from our strategic acquisitions.\nThe company defines “Adjusted Gross Profit” as gross profit, plus (1) acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments, (2) depreciation, (3) amortization of intangible assets, (4) headquarters relocation costs, and (5) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nThe company defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income (loss), plus (1) acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments, (2) depreciation, asset impairment, and the loss on disposal of assets, (3) amortization of intangible assets, (4) acquisition-related expense, (5) costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, (6) interest expense, net, (7) income tax expense, (8) headquarters relocation costs, and (9) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Product Development Expense” as product development expense, excluding (1) headquarters relocation costs, and (2) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ongoing expenditures related to product innovation.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Sales and Marketing Expense” as sales and marketing expense, excluding (1) amortization of intangible assets, (2) headquarters relocation costs, and (3) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ongoing expenditures related to its sales and marketing strategies.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP General and Administrative Expense” as general and administrative expense, excluding (1) loss on disposal of assets, (2) acquisition-related expense, (3) costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, (4) headquarters relocation costs, and (5) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s underlying expense structure to support corporate activities and processes.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Operating Expense” as operating expense, excluding (1) asset impairment and loss on disposal of assets, (2) amortization of intangible assets, (3) acquisition-related expense, (4) costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, (5) headquarters relocation costs, and (6) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s underlying expense structure to support ongoing operations.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Operating Income” as operating income (loss), plus (1) acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments, (2) asset impairment and loss on disposal of assets, (3) amortization of intangible assets, (4) acquisition-related expense, (5) costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, (6) headquarters relocation costs, and (7) stock-based expense. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP Net Income” as net income (loss), plus (1) income tax (benefit) expense, (2) acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments, (3) asset impairment and loss on disposal of assets, (4) amortization of intangible assets, (5) acquisition-related expense, (6) costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, (7) headquarters relocation costs, (8) amortization of convertible note discount, (9) stock-based expense, and (10) provision for income tax expense based on an assumed rate in order to approximate the company’s long-term effective corporate tax rate; and the company defines “Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share” as Non-GAAP Net Income divided by Non-GAAP weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The company believes that investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful in analyzing the company’s financial and operational performance, comparing this performance to the company’s peers and competitors, and understanding the company’s ability to generate income from ongoing business operations.\nThe company defines “Non-GAAP On Demand Revenue” as total on demand revenue plus acquisition-related and other deferred revenue adjustments. The company believes it is useful to include deferred revenue written down for GAAP purposes under purchase accounting rules and revenue deferred due to a lack of historical experience determining the settlement of the contractual obligation in order to appropriately measure the underlying performance of the company’s business operations in the period of activity and associated expense. Further, the company believes that investors and financial analysts find this measure to be useful in evaluating the company’s ongoing performance because it provides a more accurate depiction of on demand revenue arising from our strategic acquisitions.\nThe company defines “Ending On Demand Units” as the number of rental housing units managed by our clients with one or more of our on demand software solutions at the end of the period. We use ending on demand units to measure the success of our strategy of increasing the number of rental housing units managed with our on demand software solutions. Property unit counts are provided to us by our customers as new sales orders are processed. Property unit counts may be adjusted periodically as information related to our clients’ properties is updated or supplemented, which could result in adjustments to the number of units previously reported.\nThe company defines “Average On Demand Units” as the average of the beginning and ending on demand units for each quarter in the period presented. The company’s management monitors this metric to measure its success in increasing the number of on demand software solutions utilized by our clients to manage their rental housing units, our overall revenue, and profitability.\nThe company defines “ACV,” or Annual Client Value, as management’s estimate of the annual value of the company’s on demand revenue contracts. The company’s management monitors this metric to measure its success in increasing the number of on demand units, and the amount of software solutions utilized by its clients to manage their rental housing units.\nThe company defines “RPU,” or Revenue Per Unit, as ACV divided by ending on demand units. The company monitors this metric to measure its success in increasing the penetration of on demand software solutions utilized by its clients to manage their rental housing units.\nThe company excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to each excluded item:\nNon-GAAP tax rate – In 2017, the company used a 40.0% tax rate in order to approximate the company’s long-term effective corporate tax rate. The GAAP tax rate includes certain tax items which may include, but are not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to ongoing business operations in the current year; unusual or infrequently occurring items; benefits from stock compensation deductions for tax purposes that exceed the stock compensation expense recognized for GAAP; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency re-measurement; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and liabilities; and changes in tax law. For 2018 guidance purposes, the company uses a Non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%, as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation, to approximate the company’s long-term effective corporate tax rate. We believe excluding these items assists investors and analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations. Acquisition-related and other deferred revenue – These items are included to reflect deferred revenue written down for GAAP purposes under purchase accounting rules and revenue deferred due to a lack of historical experience determining the settlement of the contractual obligation in order to appropriately measure the underlying performance of the company’s business operations in the period of activity and associated expense. Asset impairment and loss on disposal of assets – These items comprise gains (losses) on the disposal and impairment of long-lived assets, which are not reflective of the company’s ongoing operations. We believe exclusion of these items facilitates a more accurate comparison of the company’s results of operations between periods. Amortization of intangible assets – These items are amortized over their estimated useful lives and generally cannot be changed or influenced by the company after acquisition. Accordingly, these items are not considered by the company in making operating decisions. The company does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of its ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred. Acquisition-related expense – These items consist of direct costs incurred in our business acquisition transactions and the impact of changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations. We believe exclusion of these items facilitates a more accurate comparison of the results of the company’s ongoing operations across periods and eliminates volatility related to changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations. Costs related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process – This item relates to the company's Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act review process as a result of the recently completed acquisitions of On-Site and LRO. The company believes that these significant legal costs are not reflective of its ongoing operations. Headquarters relocation costs – These items consist of duplicative rent and other expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters and data center. These costs are not reflective of the company’s ongoing operations due to their non-recurring nature. Amortization of the convertible note discount – This items consists of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount recognized on the convertible notes issued in May 2017. Management excludes this item as it is not indicative of the company’s ongoing operating performance. Stock-based expense – This item is excluded because these are non-cash expenditures that the company does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expenditure is partially outside of its control because it is based on factors such as stock price, volatility, and interest rates, which may be unrelated to the company’s performance during the period in which the expenses are incurred.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share data) December 31, 2017 2016 (unaudited) Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 69,343 $ 104,886 Restricted cash 96,002 83,654 Accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts of $3,951 and $2,468 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively 124,505 92,367 Prepaid expenses 12,107 10,836 Other current assets 6,622 5,712 Total current assets\n308,579 297,455 Property, equipment, and software, net 148,428 130,428 Goodwill 751,052 259,938 Identified intangible assets, net 252,337 74,976 Deferred tax assets, net 44,887 15,665 Other assets 11,010 9,636 Total assets $ 1,516,293 $ 788,098 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 26,733 $ 21,421 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 79,379 50,464 Current portion of deferred revenue 116,622 89,583 Current portion of term loans 14,116 5,469 Customer deposits held in restricted accounts 96,057 83,590 Total current liabilities 332,907 250,527 Deferred revenue 5,538 6,308 Revolving facility 50,000 -

An explanation of these measures is also included under the heading “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nWhile the company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying performance of our business operations, investors are reminded to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Please reference the “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section. (2) For periods with GAAP net losses and non-GAAP net income, the weighted-average outstanding shares used to calculate non-GAAP net income per share includes potentially dilutive securities that were excluded from the calculation of GAAP net income per share as the effect was anti-dilutive. It is the current intent of the Company to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock. We exclude these shares that are issuable upon conversions of our convertible notes because we expect that the dilution from such shares will be offset by the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in May 2017 in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes. (3) Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the . The company may be required to revise its results upon finalizing its review of quarterly and full year results, which could cause or contribute to such differences. All information provided in this release is as of the date hereof and RealPage, Inc. undertakes no duty to update this information except as required by law. See additional discussion under \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" above. (4) Among the major provisions contained in the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 was a reduction in our federal corporate tax rate. We have revised our estimate of our effective tax rate to 26.0% in order to approximate the Company's long-term effective corporate tax rate.
