    "text": "AGOURA HILLS, Calif., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE: AMH) (the \"Company\"), a leading provider of high quality single-family homes for rent, today announced its financial and operating results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nTotal revenues increased 6.7% to $242.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $227.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss attributable to common shareholders totaled $22.0 million, and a $0.08 loss per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $2.4 million, and a $0.01 loss per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Core Funds from Operations attributable to common share and unit holders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $89.4 million, or $0.26 per FFO share and unit, compared to $75.9 million, or $0.26 per FFO share and unit, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Funds from Operations attributable to common share and unit holders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $79.8 million, or $0.23 per FFO share and unit, compared to $67.7 million, or $0.23 per FFO share and unit, for the same period in 2016. Core Net Operating Income (\"Core NOI\") margin on Same-Home properties was 64.9% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 65.2% for the same period in 2016. Core NOI after capital expenditures from Same-Home properties increased by 1.5% year-over-year for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Same-Home portfolio leasing percentage increased to 95.7% as of December 31, 2017, from 95.2% as of September 30, 2017, while achieving 3.1% growth in average monthly realized rent per property for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. Redeemed the Series A and B participating preferred shares through a conversion into 12,398,276 Class A common shares (see \"Capital Activities and Balance Sheet\"). In February 2018, issued $500.0 million of 4.25% unsecured senior notes due 2028, which have been effectively hedged at 4.08% through the use of a treasury lock (see \"Capital Activities and Balance Sheet\").\n\"American Homes 4 Rent completed a successful year, generating a 6% improvement in annual Core NOI after capital expenditures from our comparable Same-Home pool by improving Core NOI margins by 130 basis points to 64.5% through further efficiencies from our industry-leading, mature platform,\" stated David Singelyn, Chief Executive Officer. \"We also obtained the first and only investment grade ratings in the single-family rental sector, and have demonstrated the benefit of those ratings in our inaugural issuance of unsecured corporate debt. Looking forward to 2018, I remain bullish on our future based on the strength of fundamentals in the single-family rental sector that provide us with a strong macro tailwind to further expand our existing portfolio cash flows, execute on our strategic external growth plans and create value for our shareholders.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nDuring the quarter, the Company released newly defined average occupancy, rental rate and capital expenditure metrics, which management believes provide better clarity into our underlying leasing results and operating performance. These metric changes include: (1) replacement of average occupancy percentage with average occupied days percentage, (2) replacement of average contractual monthly rent as of period end with average monthly realized rent per property and (3) additional disclosures around previously reported capital expenditures to distinguish between recurring capital expenditures and property enhancing capex. Full definitions of these new metrics, along with historical quarterly disclosure under the new methodology can be found in the Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release and Supplemental Information Package.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders totaled $22.0 million, and a $0.08 loss per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $2.4 million, and a $0.01 loss per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to the redemption of the Series A and Series B participating preferred shares through a conversion into Class A common shares, partially offset by higher revenues and lower interest expense.\nTotal revenues increased 6.7% to $242.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $227.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue growth was primarily driven by continued strong acquisition and leasing activity, as our average leased portfolio grew to 46,511 homes for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 44,772 homes for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nCore NOI on our total portfolio increased 5.9% to $136.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $129.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to growth in rental income resulting from a larger number of leased properties.\nCore revenues from Same-Home properties increased 2.1% to $159.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $156.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This growth was driven by a 3.1% increase in average monthly realized rents, offset by a 0.8% decline in average occupied days percentage caused by excess vacant inventory carried over from the third quarter of 2017. Note that we experienced strong leasing activity during the fourth quarter of 2017 and improved the leased percentage on Same-Home properties by 50 basis points to 95.7% as of December 31, 2017, from 95.2% as of September 30, 2017. Core property operating expenses from Same-Home properties increased 3.0% to $55.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $54.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the timing of property tax expense and increased R&M and turnover costs, net, due to labor and material cost increases and higher turnover costs associated with additional vacant homes.\nCore NOI from Same-Home properties increased 1.7% to $103.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $101.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. After capital expenditures, Core NOI from Same-Home properties increased 1.5% to $97.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $96.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCore Funds from Operations attributable to common share and unit holders (\"Core FFO attributable to common share and unit holders\") was $89.4 million, or $0.26 per FFO share and unit, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $75.9 million, or $0.26 per FFO share and unit, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Funds from Operations attributable to common share and unit holders (\"Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders\") for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $79.8 million, or $0.23 per FFO share and unit, compared to $67.7 million, or $0.23 per FFO share and unit, for the fourth quarter of 2016. This improvement was primarily attributable to increases in rental revenue driven by a larger number of leased properties and higher rental rates.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders totaled $22.1 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. This improvement was primarily attributable to higher revenues and lower interest expense, partially offset by the redemption of the Series A and Series B participating preferred shares through a conversion into Class A common shares, higher property operating expenses and an increase in preferred dividends.\nTotal revenues increased 9.3% to $960.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $878.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue growth was primarily driven by continued strong acquisition and leasing activity, as our average leased portfolio grew to 45,839 homes for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 43,026 homes for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCore NOI on our total portfolio increased 11.6% to $531.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $476.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to substantial growth in rental income resulting from a larger number of leased properties.\nCore revenues from Same-Home properties increased 3.0% to $634.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $616.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This growth was driven by a 3.1% increase in average monthly realized rents, offset by a 0.1% decline in average occupied days percentage. Core property operating expenses from Same-Home properties decreased 0.8% to $225.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $226.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This improvement was driven by continued operating efficiencies in R&M and turnover costs, net and a reduction in property management expenses, net, partially offset by modest increases in property tax expense and HOA fees, net.\nCore NOI from Same-Home properties increased 5.1% to $409.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $389.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. After capital expenditures, Core NOI from Same-Home properties increased 6.2% to $384.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $361.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCore FFO attributable to common share and unit holders was $327.0 million, or $1.02 per FFO share and unit, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $282.1 million, or $0.97 per FFO share and unit, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $287.0 million, or $0.90 per FFO share and unit, compared to $242.5 million, or $0.84 per FFO share and unit, for the year ended December 31, 2016. This improvement was primarily attributable to significant increases in rental revenue driven by a larger number of leased properties and higher rental rates, partially offset by increases in property operating expenses.\nPortfolio\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had 46,996 leased properties, an increase of 970 properties from September 30, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the leased percentage on Same-Home properties was 95.7%, compared to 95.2% as of September 30, 2017.\nInvestments\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's total portfolio consisted of 51,239 homes, including 310 homes held for sale, compared to 50,015 homes as of September 30, 2017, including 469 homes held for sale, an increase of 1,224 homes, which included 1,412 homes acquired and 188 homes sold or rescinded (including 162 former ARPI properties).\nFor 2018, the Company is revising its full year acquisition target to $400 million to $600 million, which will be focused going forward primarily on newly-constructed, built-for-rental product that we believe provides the best risk-adjusted returns and is consistent with our core growth strategy.\nCapital Activities and Balance Sheet\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company redeemed all 5,060,000 shares of the outstanding 5.0% Series A participating preferred shares and all 4,400,000 shares of the outstanding 5.0% Series B participating preferred shares through a conversion of those shares into Class A common shares, in accordance with the conversion terms in the Articles Supplementary. This resulted in 12,398,276 total Class A common shares issued from the redemption, based on a conversion ratio of 1.3106 Class A common shares issued per Series A and B participating preferred share.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $46.2 million and had total outstanding debt of $2.5 billion, excluding an unamortized discount on acquired debt, the value of exchangeable senior notes classified within equity and unamortized deferred loan costs, with a weighted-average stated interest rate of 4.07% and a weighted-average term to maturity of 14.4 years. The Company's $800.0 million revolving credit facility and $200.0 million term loan facility had outstanding borrowings of $140.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively, at the end of the year.\nIn February 2018, the Operating Partnership issued $500.0 million of 4.25% unsecured senior notes with a maturity date of February 15, 2028, which have been effectively hedged at 4.08% through the use of a treasury lock that was settled for a $9.6 million gain. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2018. The Operating Partnership received net proceeds of $494.0 million from this offering, after underwriting fees of approximately $3.2 million and a $2.8 million discount, and before estimated offering costs of $1.5 million. The Operating Partnership intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, acquisition of properties, the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, the expansion, redevelopment and/or improvement of our properties, working capital and other general purposes, including repurchases of securities.\nDuring February 2018, the Company's board of trustees authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our outstanding Class A common shares and up to $250.0 million of our outstanding preferred shares. Common and preferred share repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.\n2018 Outlook\nFull Year 2018\nSame-Home\nAverage Occupied Days Percentage\n94.5% - 95.5%\nCore revenues growth\n3.5% - 4.5%\nCore property operating expenses growth\n4.0% - 5.0%\nCore NOI After Capital Expenditures growth\n3.0% - 4.0%\nCore NOI margin\n64.0% - 65.0%\nProperty tax expense growth\n3.5% - 4.5%\nAverage R&M and turnover costs, net, plus Recurring Capital Expenditures per property\n$1,950 - $2,100\nProperty Enhancing Capex\n$8 - $12 million\nGeneral and administrative expense, excluding noncash share-based compensation\n$33.5 - $35.5 million\nAcquisition volume\n$400 - $600 million\nNote: The Company does not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP financial measures of net income or loss, total revenues and property operating expenses, or a reconciliation of the above-listed forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures because we are unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures, including non-recurring and infrequent items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, net gain or loss on sales and impairment of single-family properties, casualty loss, Non-Same-Home revenues, Non-Same-Home property operating expenses and noncash fair value adjustments associated with remeasuring our participating preferred shares derivative liability to fair value. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on our GAAP results for the guidance period.\nAdditional Information\nA copy of the Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release and Supplemental Information Package and this press release are available on our website at www.americanhomes4rent.com .

financial measures. We believe these measures are helpful in understanding our financial performance and are widely used in the REIT industry. Because other REITs may not compute these financial measures in the same manner, they may not be comparable among REITs. In addition, these metrics are not substitutes for net income or loss or net cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, as measures of our operating performance, liquidity or ability to pay dividends. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this press release and in the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release and Supplemental Information Package.\nFunds from Operations attributable to common share and unit holders\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income or loss attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common share and unit holders, Core FFO attributable to common share and unit holders and Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nNet (loss) income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n(21,994)\n$\n2,391\n$\n(22,135)\n$\n(33,542)\nAdjustments:\nNoncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership\n(4,618)\n(6,525)\n(4,648)\n4,313\nNet loss (gain) on sale / impairment of single-family properties and other\n443\n1,508\n(2,146)\n(9,599)\nDepreciation and amortization\n75,831\n74,164\n297,290\n298,677\nLess: depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets\n(1,797)\n(2,046)\n(7,847)\n(6,391)\nFFO attributable to common share and unit holders\n$\n47,865\n$\n69,492\n$\n260,514\n$\n253,458\nAdjustments:\nAcquisition fees and costs expensed\n809\n544\n4,623\n11,443\nNoncash share-based compensation - general and administrative\n646\n498\n2,563\n2,076\nNoncash share-based compensation - property management\n391\n394\n1,649\n1,560\nNoncash interest expense related to acquired debt\n925\n865\n3,549\n4,564\nHurricane-related charges, net\n(2,173)\n—\n7,963\n—\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n6,555\n13,408\nGain on conversion of Series E units\n—\n—\n—\n(11,463)\nRemeasurement of participating preferred shares\n(1,500)\n4,080\n(2,841)\n7,020\nRedemption of participating preferred shares\n42,416\n—\n42,416\n—\nCore FFO attributable to common share and unit holders\n$\n89,379\n$\n75,873\n$\n326,991\n$\n282,066\nRecurring capital expenditures (1)\n(7,501)\n(6,353)\n(32,556)\n(31,536)\nLeasing costs\n(2,029)\n(1,806)\n(7,390)\n(8,005)\nAdjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders\n$\n79,849\n$\n67,714\n$\n287,045\n$\n242,525\nPer FFO share and unit:\nFFO attributable to common share and unit holders\n$\n0.14\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.81\n$\n0.88\nCore FFO attributable to common share and unit holders\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.26\n$\n1.02\n$\n0.97\nAdjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.90\n$\n0.84\nWeighted-average FFO shares and units:\nCommon shares outstanding\n286,469,724\n239,887,357\n264,254,718\n234,010,168\nShare-based compensation plan (2)\n696,037\n—\n735,415\n—\nOperating partnership units\n55,353,391\n55,555,960\n55,498,488\n55,355,197\nTotal weighted-average FFO shares and units\n342,519,152\n295,443,317\n320,488,621\n289,365,365\n(1)\nAs a portion of our homes are recently acquired and / or renovated, we estimate recurring capital expenditures for our entire portfolio by multiplying (a) current period actual recurring capital expenditures per Same-Home property by (b) our total number of properties, excluding non-stabilized and held for sale properties.\n(2)\nReflects the effect of potentially dilutive securities issuable upon the assumed vesting / exercise of restricted stock units and stock options.\nFFO attributable to common share and unit holders is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate in accordance with the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), which defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales or impairment of real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nCore FFO attributable to common share and unit holders is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance. We compute this metric by adjusting FFO attributable to common share and unit holders for (1) acquisition fees and costs expensed incurred with recent business combinations and the acquisition of individual properties, (2) noncash share-based compensation expense, (3) noncash interest expense related to acquired debt, (4) hurricane-related charges, net, (5) gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, (6) noncash gain or loss on redemption or conversion of shares or units and (7) noncash fair value adjustments associated with remeasuring our participating preferred shares derivative liability to fair value.\nAdjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance. We compute this metric by adjusting Core FFO attributable to common share and unit holders for (1) recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value and maintain functionality of our properties and (2) actual leasing costs incurred during the period. As a portion of our homes are recently acquired and/or renovated, we estimate recurring capital expenditures for our entire portfolio by multiplying (a) current period actual capital expenditures per Same-Home Property by (b) our total number of properties, excluding non-stabilized and held for sale properties.\nWe present FFO attributable to common share and unit holders, as well as on a per FFO share and unit basis, because we consider this metric to be an important measure of the performance of real estate companies, as do many investors and analysts in evaluating the Company. We believe that FFO attributable to common share and unit holders provides useful information to investors because this metric excludes depreciation, which is included in computing net income and assumes the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions and in response to inflation.\nWe also believe that Core FFO and Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders, as well as on a per FFO share and unit basis, provide useful information to investors because they allow investors to compare our operating performance to prior reporting periods without the effect of certain items that, by nature, are not comparable from period to period.\nFFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders are not a substitute for net income or loss per share or net cash flow provided by operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our operating performance, liquidity or ability to pay dividends. These metrics also are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. Because other REITs may not compute these measures in the same manner, they may not be comparable among REITs.\nCore Net Operating Income\nCore NOI, which we also present separately for our Same-Home portfolio, is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that we define as core revenues, which is calculated as rents and fees from single-family properties, net of bad debt expense, less core property operating expenses, which is calculated as property operating and property management expenses, excluding noncash share-based compensation expense, expenses reimbursed by tenant charge-backs and bad debt expense. Our Same-Home portfolio consists of our single-family properties that have been stabilized longer than 90 days prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented, and that have not been classified as held for sale or taken out of service as a result of a casualty loss.\nCore NOI also excludes (1) noncash fair value adjustments associated with remeasuring our participating preferred shares derivative liability to fair value, (2) noncash gain or loss on conversion of shares or units, (3) gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, (4) hurricane-related charges, net, (5) gain or loss on sales of single-family properties and other, (6) depreciation and amortization, (7) acquisition fees and costs expensed incurred with recent business combinations and the acquisition of individual properties, (8) noncash share-based compensation expense, (9) interest expense, (10) general and administrative expense, (11) other expenses and (12) other revenues. We believe Core NOI provides useful information to investors about the operating performance of our single-family properties without the impact of certain operating expenses that are reimbursed through tenant charge-backs. We further adjust Core NOI for our Same-Home portfolio by subtracting recurring capital expenditures to calculate Same-Home Core NOI After Capital Expenditures, which we believe provides useful information to investors because it more fully reflects our operating performance after the impact of all property-level expenditures, regardless of whether they are capitalized or expensed.\nCore NOI and Same-Home Core NOI After Capital Expenditures should be considered only as supplements to net income or loss as a measure of our performance and should not be used as measures of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. Additionally, these metrics should not be used as substitutes for net income or loss or net cash flows from operating activities (as computed in accordance with GAAP).\nThe following are reconciliations of core revenues, core property operating expenses, Core NOI, Same-Home Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI After Capital Expenditures to their respective GAAP metrics for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (amounts in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nCore revenues\nTotal revenues\n$\n242,801\n$\n227,559\n$\n960,399\n$\n878,889\nTenant charge-backs\n(28,232)\n(23,177)\n(120,081)\n(95,254)\nBad debt expense\n(2,186)\n(1,877)\n(7,328)\n(6,969)\nOther revenues\n(1,201)\n(2,987)\n(5,568)\n(15,798)\nCore revenues\n$\n211,182\n$\n199,518\n$\n827,422\n$\n760,868\nCore property operating expenses\nProperty operating expenses\n$\n87,871\n$\n78,323\n$\n355,074\n$\n317,310\nProperty management expenses\n17,345\n17,547\n69,712\n70,724\nNoncash share-based compensation - property management\n(391)\n(394)\n(1,649)\n(1,560)\nExpenses reimbursed by tenant charge-backs\n(28,232)\n(23,177)\n(120,081)\n(95,254)\nBad debt expense\n(2,186)\n(1,877)\n(7,328)\n(6,969)\nCore property operating expenses\n$\n74,407\n$\n70,422\n$\n295,728\n$\n284,251\nCore NOI, Same-Home Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI After Capital Expenditures\nNet income\n$\n30,533\n$\n9,338\n$\n76,492\n$\n10,446\nRemeasurement of participating preferred shares\n(1,500)\n4,080\n(2,841)\n7,020\nGain on conversion of Series E units\n—\n—\n—\n(11,463)\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n6,555\n13,408\nHurricane-related charges, net\n(2,173)\n—\n7,963\n—\nGain on sale of single-family properties and other, net\n(451)\n(1,995)\n(6,826)\n(14,569)\nDepreciation and amortization\n75,831\n74,164\n297,290\n298,677\nAcquisition fees and costs expensed\n809\n544\n4,623\n11,443\nNoncash share-based compensation - property management\n391\n394\n1,649\n1,560\nInterest expense\n25,747\n31,538\n112,620\n130,847\nGeneral and administrative expense\n7,986\n8,524\n34,732\n33,068\nOther expenses\n803\n5,496\n5,005\n11,978\nOther revenues\n(1,201)\n(2,987)\n(5,568)\n(15,798)\nTenant charge-backs\n28,232\n23,177\n120,081\n95,254\nExpenses reimbursed by tenant charge-backs\n(28,232)\n(23,177)\n(120,081)\n(95,254)\nBad debt expense excluded from operating expenses\n2,186\n1,877\n7,328\n6,969\nBad debt expense included in revenues\n(2,186)\n(1,877)\n(7,328)\n(6,969)\nCore NOI\n136,775\n129,096\n531,694\n476,617\nLess: Non-Same-Home Core NOI\n33,207\n27,268\n122,429\n87,337\nSame-Home Core NOI\n103,568\n101,828\n409,265\n389,280\nLess: Same-Home recurring capital expenditures\n5,706\n5,381\n25,150\n27,572\nSame-Home Core NOI After Capital Expenditures\n$\n97,862\n$\n96,447\n$\n384,115\n$\n361,708\nContact:\nAmerican Homes 4 Rent\nInvestor Relations\nPhone: (855) 794-2447\nEmail: investors@ah4r.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-homes-4-rent-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-and-operating-results-300603141.html\nSOURCE American Homes 4 Rent",
