    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- IGEL, a world leader in endpoint management software for the secure enterprise, today announced that CRN ® , a brand of The Channel Company , has named Brad Tompkins, Vice President of Sales for North America, to its prestigious list of 2018 Channel Chiefs. The executives on this annual list represent top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their organization through channel partners.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN's editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding channel partner programs.\nTompkins joined IGEL in May 2017, and has since been leading IGEL's North American sales organization as it pivots toward a software-driven sales model. IGEL ended 2017 with 74% revenue growth in the U.S., year-over-year. This growth was significantly driven by software sales, which were up by 589% in the U.S., and specifically included sales for IGEL's Universal Desktop Converter™ (UDC) and UD Pocket™ solutions. Further, during 2017 IGEL added 258,000 hardware units and 115,000 software seats, globally, resulting in a 16% growth in revenue for IGEL.\n\"Demand among our partners and customers for innovative solutions that solve a broad array of end user computing (EUC) challenges – from enhancing security and manageability to lowering device ownership costs – is on the rise,\" said Jed Ayres , President and CEO, IGEL North America. \"Since joining IGEL last year, Brad and his team have done an exceptional job demonstrating to our partners and their customers how the IGEL OS™, when combined with our powerful software suite for endpoint management can deliver enhanced endpoint security, control and cost efficiency for organizations looking to do more with their EUC budgets. We are proud to see Brad recognized as one of the top leaders in the IT channel, and would like to thank the editors of CRN for this tremendous honor.\"\nAs a 100% channel-led, partner-first company, IGEL empowers partners like Accelera Solutions, with the tools and resources they need to grow their business quickly and profitably. \"As one of IGEL's top Platinum Partners, we have come to count on IGEL as a go-to technology platform to solve our customers' most pressing EUC challenges through their smart, simple and secure endpoint management solutions,\" said Jason March, Vice President of Growth & Development. \"Brad and his team work hand-in-hand with our field sales and engineering teams to respond to our client's business and technology needs. With their support, our IGEL business has grown exponentially due to our expanded reach and influence within the markets we serve.\"\n\"The executives on CRN's 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,\" said Robert Faletra, Executive Chairman of The Channel Company. \"These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief's impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.\"\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list, including the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs, is featured online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs and will appear in the February 2018 issue of CRN.\nFollow The Channel Company: Twitter , LinkedIn and Facebook\nIGEL on Social Media\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/IGEL_Technology\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/igel.technology\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/u/0/101270758605662221044\nLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/igel-technology\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/user/IGELTechnologyTV\nAbout IGEL\nIGEL delivers powerful unified endpoint management software that is revolutionary in its simplicity and purpose-built for the enterprise.
