    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Quantum Corp. (NYSE: QTM) on Feb. 15, 2018, the New York Stock Exchange notified the company that it is not in compliance with the NYSE's continued listing standard because the company has not timely filed Form 10-Q for its fiscal third quarter 2018 ended Dec. 31, 2017. As previously announced, Quantum's audit committee is conducting an independent investigation of accounting matters related to revenue recognition, and the company intends to release its fiscal third quarter 2018 earnings results and file the associated Form 10-Q as soon as practicable following the completion of the audit committee's investigation.\nUnder NYSE rules, Quantum has six months from receipt of the notification to comply with the listing standard. It can regain compliance at any time during this six-month period by filing the Form 10-Q. In the meantime, Quantum's stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE, subject to compliance with other continued listing requirements.\nThe NYSE notification has no impact on the company's business operations.\nAbout Quantum\nQuantum is a leading expert in scale-out tiered storage, archive and data protection, providing solutions for capturing, sharing, managing and preserving digital assets over the entire data lifecycle.
