Improvement in prepared meats, plus accelerating growth in the U.S. and plant protein, offset softening in pork processing, which continues to demonstrate the benefits of our balanced portfolio.\" said Michael H. McCain, President and CEO. \"Looking forward, we are excited about the future. In our quest to be the most sustainable protein company on earth, the coming year will mark the most ambitious brand renovation in our history. We have great confidence our brand strategy will support continued growth for years to come.\"\nOPERATING REVIEW\nThe following is a summary of sales and Adjusted Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter:\n($ millions)\nFourth Quarter\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales\n$\n876.8\n$\n828.2\n5.9%\nAdjusted Operating Earnings\n$\n64.7\n$\n63.7\n1.5%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n10.7%\n10.4%\n+30bps\nThe following table summarizes sales and Adjusted Operating Earnings for the two years ended December 31:\n($ millions)\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales\n$\n3,522.2\n$\n3,331.8\n5.7%\nAdjusted Operating Earnings\n$\n263.8\n$\n239.3\n10.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n10.8%\n10.3%\n+50bps\nSales and Earnings Review\nFourth Quarter\nSales for the fourth quarter increased 5.9% to $876.8 million or 5.4% after adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions, driven primarily by pricing and volume growth, with prepared meats sales benefiting from innovation and the Company's development in the U.S. market. Sales in the value-added fresh portfolio benefited from continued increased demand for fresh value-added poultry. The addition of Lightlife also contributed to the increase.\nAdjusted Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $64.7 million compared to $63.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 10.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 10.4% in the prior year. Increased sales and volume growth, lower operating costs, as well as a partial reduction in year over year variable compensation costs, contributed to higher earnings in the quarter. Commercial performance in prepared meats partially offset a softening in the pork complex, reversing the trend from earlier in the year. Fourth quarter earnings also benefited from continued high demand for fresh value-added poultry.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $59.1 million compared to $76.2 million in the same period last year. The progress in the business reflected in positive revenue and margin growth, and a tax benefit associated with U.S. tax reform, was more than offset by factors excluded in calculating Adjusted Operating Earnings. These factors consist of unrealized losses on derivative contracts, the change in fair value of biological assets and restructuring costs.\nBasic Earnings per Share was $0.47 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the factors described above. Adjusted Earnings per Share in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.41 compared to $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017\nSales for 2017 increased 5.7% to $3,522.2 million, or 4.8% after adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions compared to the prior year. Higher sales across the portfolio benefited from improved volumes and pricing, as well as the addition of Lightlife. Prepared meats sales benefited from the same factors noted above. Sales in the value-added fresh portfolio increased due to stronger volumes and improved sales mix.\nAdjusted Operating Earnings for 2017 increased to $263.8 million compared to $239.3 million in the prior year. Increased sales across the business contributed to earnings growth. Earnings performance in the value-added fresh portfolio was partially offset by margin compression in prepared meats related to the volatility in raw material costs for the majority of the year. During the fourth quarter the trend reversed, with a softening in the pork complex partially offset by improved commercial performance in prepared meats.\nNet earnings for the year were $164.1 million compared to $181.7 million in the prior year. Full year revenue and margin growth, and a tax benefit associated with U.S. tax reform, were also impacted by the factors noted above which are excluded in calculating Adjusted Operating Earnings.\nBasic Earnings per Share was $1.28 for 2017 compared to $1.35 in the prior year. Adjusted Earnings per Share increased to $1.54 from $1.23 in the prior year.\nSubsequent Events\nOn November 30, 2017, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of The Field Roast Grain Meat Company, SPC, a privately held U.S. based corporation engaged in the production and distribution of premium grain-based protein and vegan cheese products. The transaction was subject to customary U.S. regulatory review, and was completed on January 29, 2018. The purchase price was US$120.0 million plus transaction costs settled through a combination of cash-on-hand and borrowings under the existing revolving credit facility as described in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination.\nOther Matters\nOn February 20, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.13 per share, $0.52 per share on an annual basis, from $0.11 per share, payable March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business March 9, 2018. Unless indicated otherwise by the Company at or before the time the dividend is paid, the dividend will be considered an Eligible Dividend for the purposes of the \"Enhanced Dividend Tax Credit System\".\nConference Call\nAn investor presentation related to the Company's fourth quarter financial results is available at www.mapleleaffoods.com and can be found under Investor Material on the Investors page. A conference call will be held at 2:30 p.m. EDT on February 21, 2018, to review Maple Leaf Foods' fourth quarter financial results.

Management believes that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors in measuring the financial performance of the Company. These measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies and should not be construed as an alternative to other financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAdjusted Operating Earnings\nAdjusted Operating Earnings, a non-IFRS measure, is used by Management to evaluate financial operating results. It is defined as earnings before income taxes adjusted for items that are not considered representative of ongoing operational activities of the business and items where the economic impact of the transactions will be reflected in earnings in future periods when the underlying asset is sold or transferred. The table below provides a reconciliation of net earnings as reported under IFRS in the audited consolidated statement of earnings to Adjusted Operating Earnings for the years ended, as indicated below. Management believes that this basis is the most appropriate on which to evaluate operating results, as they are representative of the ongoing operations of the Company.\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n($ thousands)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet earnings\n$\n59,064\n$\n76,224\n$\n164,089\n$\n181,702\nIncome taxes\n12,153\n28,681\n50,192\n67,891\nEarnings before income taxes\n$\n71,217\n$\n104,905\n$\n214,281\n$\n249,593\nInterest expense and other financing costs\n1,276\n1,231\n5,168\n6,367\nOther (income) expense\n5,319\n5,025\n(3,609)\n3,596\nRestructuring and other related costs\n5,921\n4,226\n23,024\n6,570\nEarnings from operations\n$\n83,733\n$\n115,387\n$\n238,864\n$\n266,126\nIncrease in fair value of biological assets (5)\n(27,629)\n(48,172)\n(1,267)\n(6,263)\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivative contracts (5)\n8,548\n(3,497)\n26,243\n(20,581)\nAdjusted Operating Earnings\n$\n64,652\n$\n63,718\n$\n263,840\n$\n239,282\nAdjusted Earnings per Share\nAdjusted Earnings per Share, a non-IFRS measure, is used by Management to evaluate financial operating results.

The table below provides a reconciliation of basic earnings per share as reported under IFRS in the audited consolidated statements of earnings to Adjusted Earnings per Share for the years ended, as indicated below.

The following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings as reported under IFRS in the audited consolidated statements of earnings to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended, as indicated below.
