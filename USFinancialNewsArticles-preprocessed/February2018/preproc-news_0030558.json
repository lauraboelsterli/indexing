    "text": "(Refiles to fix slug, no changes to text)\nBy Steve Keating\nGANGNEUNG, South Korea, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The united Korean women’s ice hockey team set the stage for their own Miracle on Ice when Randi Heesoon Griffin scored their first goal in Olympic competition midway through the second period to trim Japan’s lead to 2-1 on Wednesday.\nAfter blowout 8-0 losses to Switzerland and Sweden, American-born Griffin gave North Korea’s “Army of Beauties”, an all-female cheerleading delegation, something real to cheer when her wrist shot dribbled through the pads of Japan netminder Akane Konishi.\nThe goal sparked wild celebrations at the Kwandong Hockey Centre particularly from the North Korean cheer section who celebrated the landmark goal right through until the end of the period.\nOffense has been hard to come by for the Koreans who until their goal had managed just 33 shots on target.
