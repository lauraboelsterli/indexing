The recommendations include a 24% global tariff on steel imports.   Join the Nation's Conversation To   Commerce Department calls for Trump to impose steep tariffs or quotas on foreign steel and aluminum Kayla Tausche, Lori Ann LaRocco and Tom DiChristopher, CNBC Published 2:08 p.m. ET Feb. 16, 2018 | Updated 2:26 p.m. ET Feb. 16, 2018 CLOSE President Donald Trump is looking for advice from a range of lawmakers as he considers whether to issue trade sanctions on aluminum and steel imports.

President Donald Trump and his administration announced the so-called Section 232 investigation into steel and aluminum imports in April. The investigation sought to determine whether the imports posed a threat to the country's national security. On Friday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross reported that steel is in fact important to U.S. national security, and current import flows are adversely impacting the steel industry. \"[T]he Secretary of Commerce concludes that the present quantities and circumstance of steel imports are 'weakening our internal economy' and threaten to impair the national security as defined in Section 232,\" the department said. \nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross takes a question as he speaks to the media about a new tariff on Canadian lumber during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, Tuesday, April 25, 2017. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) In a 262-page document, Ross recommended a couple alternatives for the president to take \"immediate action by adjusting the level of imports through quotas or tariffs.\" The department's goal is to increase demand for American-made metals. Trump has 90 days to review the findings and recommendations. The president would then decide on what course of action to take. Among the recommendations in the reports are a global tariff of 24% on all steel imports. An alternative option would impose a tariff of at least 53% on steel from 12 countries including China and Brazil. A 63% quota of those countries' 2017 steel imports is recommended in the report. The aluminum recommendations include a 7.7% tariff on imports from all exporter nations. Ross also suggested a 23.5% tariff on aluminum products from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam.

Trump could determine that specific countries should be exempted from the proposed quota, based on the economic or security interests of the United States. The president could also consider the countries' willingness to work with the United States to address global excess capacity and other challenges facing the U.S. aluminum and steel industries. Companies can also seek appeals based on U.S. production of steel and aluminum and specific national security-based considerations. Ross said each of the measures should enable U.S. steel producers to operate at 80% average capacity utilization rates or better based on available capacity in 2017. According to the Aluminum Association, there are five U.S. smelting facilities that are operating with three partial curtailments. This is a fraction compared with the 24 operational smelters up and running in 2001. © CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
