    "text": "February 20, 2018 / 4:50 PM / Updated 5 hours ago West Ham charged by FA over anti-doping rule breach Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - West Ham United have been charged by the English Football Association (FA) over a breach of anti-doping rules, the governing body said on Tuesday. The FA said in a statement that West Ham were alleged to have failed to ensure their “Club Whereabouts” information was accurate on three occasions within 12 months. West Ham said in a statement on their website that it was a club administrative matter and did not concern any of their players. “The breach relates to administrative oversights on The FA’s whereabouts system, for example a player’s address had been registered and the house number digits transposed, and the club will be responding to The FA in due course,” a club spokesperson said. West Ham have until Feb. 27 to respond to the charge. Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis",
