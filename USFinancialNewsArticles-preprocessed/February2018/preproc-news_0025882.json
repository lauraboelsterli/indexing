It did not provide further details. In November, the watchdog said that Bayer’s planned takeover of Monsanto could create significant risks to competition on the Russian market. The proposed solutions included Bayer sharing breeding technologies and giving Russia access to digital farming data. (Reporting by Polina Devitt; editing by Polina Ivanova)",
