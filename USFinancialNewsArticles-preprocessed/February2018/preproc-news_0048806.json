The cabinet was holding an emergency meeting on both matters on Monday morning.\nThe economy in Latvia, which gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and shares a border with Russia, has been booming in recent years. Its commercial banking sector is dominated by Nordic banks alongside a number of privately owned local lenders.\nCENTRAL BANK In a separate development, Latvia’s government increased pressure on central bank boss Rimsevics, an ECB policymaker, to quit after he was detained by police over the weekend in an anti-corruption probe.\n“I can’t imagine that a governor of the Bank of Latvia detained over such a serious accusation could work,” Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis said.\nRimsevics’ lawyer on Sunday declined to comment on what he was being investigated for but said the detention was unlawful.\nLatvian authorities have not provided details about the accusations which led to the detention, but the anti-corruption agency will hold a news conference at 1100 GMT.\nAfter joining the European Union in 2003, Latvia adopted the euro as its currency at the start of 2014, a move which gave its central bank governor a seat on the currency bloc’s policymaking council.\nRimsevics was arrested on Saturday after police searched his office and home. He can be held for 48 hours, a period which is due to expire late on Monday.\nEven as its top official was detained, the Latvian central bank agreed to provide 97.5 million euros worth of funding to ABLV but details of the deal still need to be worked out and the bank has yet to receive the funding, a Bank of Latvia spokesman said.\nABLV said it has ample collateral so it was not seeking any bailout but was only in need of temporary liquidity.\nIt originally asked for 480 million euros, calling its issue a “technical difficulty”.
