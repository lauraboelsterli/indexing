    "text": "quarter@ (Compares with analyst estimate, adds share movement)\nFeb 26 (Reuters) - Wearable device maker Fitbit Inc reported fourth-quarter results on Monday below Wall Street estimates as it sold fewer fitness wrist bands amid rising competition.\nFitbit shares fell 11.6 percent to $4.90 in after-market trading after the company said sale of its devices in the holiday quarter fell about 17 percent.\nRevenue fell 0.5 percent to $570.8 million in the quarter and missed the average analyst estimate of $588.9 million.\nThe San Francisco, California-based company has come under pressure as new rivals such as Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics, Xiaomi Inc and Garmin Ltd pick up market share in a saturating wearables market.\nThe company's net loss narrowed to $45.5 million, or 19 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $146.3 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted-basis, the company reported a loss of 2 cents per share. Analysts on average expected the company to report a break-even, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n(Reporting by Shariq Khan in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)",
