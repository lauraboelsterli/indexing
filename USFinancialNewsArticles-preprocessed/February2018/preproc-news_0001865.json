    "text": "(Removes extraneous words from dateline)\nFeb 1 (Reuters) - Euromoney Institutional Investor, publisher of the Euromoney magazine, said quarterly revenue rose 6 percent, as recent acquisitions more than offset the negative impact from a stronger pound.\nEuromoney, which is 49.1 percent-owned by Daily Mail & General Trust Plc, said total revenue was 100.8 million pounds ($142.83 million) for the period from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, compared with 95.2 million pounds in the same period last year.\nUnderlying revenue, which excludes the effect of currency movements and acquisitions and disposals, rose 3 percent. The group generates about two-thirds of its revenue and about 80 percent of its profit in US dollars. ($1 = 0.7057 pounds) (Reporting by Hanna Paul in Bengaluru)\n ",
