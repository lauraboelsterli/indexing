Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. (Nasdaq: JBSS) (the “Company”) today announced operating results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $7.8 million, or $0.68 per share diluted, compared to net income of $12.9 million, or $1.13 per share diluted, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Net income for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018 was $18.2 million, or $1.59 per share diluted, compared to net income of $23.1 million, or $2.03 per share diluted, for the first two quarters of fiscal 2017.\nNet sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $259.1 million compared to net sales of $249.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The 3.9% increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of snack and trail mix products in our consumer distribution channel. Sales volume, which is defined as pounds sold to customers, increased by 0.9%, as the 6.6% sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel was offset in large part by a 14.5% decline in sales volume in the commercial ingredients distribution channel. The sales volume decline in the commercial ingredients distribution channel was due to the loss of a bulk almond butter customer that occurred in the latter part of the fiscal 2017 second quarter. The sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel primarily resulted from increased sales of private brand and Orchard Valley Harvest trail mixes. The sales volume decrease of 1.9% in the contract packaging distribution channel was due to our acquisition of the Squirrel Brand business at the end of November 2017. Squirrel Brand sales volume for December in the current quarter was included in the consumer and commercial ingredients distribution channels, while Squirrel Brand sales volume for December in the fiscal 2017 second quarter was included in the contract packaging distribution channel because Squirrel Brand was a contract packaging customer during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nSales volume for our branded products changed in the quarterly comparison as follows:\nFisher recipe nuts 3.4% Orchard Valley Harvest produce products 55.6% Fisher snack nuts (2.8)% The increase in sales volume for Fisher recipe nuts was driven primarily by distribution gains at new and existing customers, increased promotional activity and a product line extension for raw peanuts. The increase in sales volume for Orchard Valley Harvest resulted from new item introductions and distribution gains at new and existing customers. The decline in sales volume for Fisher snack nuts resulted mainly from lower promotional activity.\nFor the first two quarters of fiscal 2018, net sales increased to $473.9 million from $471.7 million for the first two quarters of fiscal 2017. Sales volume increased slightly in the year to date comparison. The 4.4% sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel and the 5.7% sales volume increase in the contract packaging distribution channel were offset in large part by a decline in sales volume for bulk almond butter in the commercial ingredients distribution channel as discussed in the quarterly comparison. The sales volume increase in the consumer distribution channel primarily resulted from increased sales of private brand and Orchard Valley Harvest trail mixes. Increased sales to an existing customer from new item introductions drove the increase in sales volume in the contract packaging distribution channel.\nGross profit decreased by $5.5 million, or 12.7%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 14.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from 17.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin were mainly due to increased commodity acquisition costs for walnuts and pecans. We could not raise pecan and walnut selling prices to cover these acquisition cost increases due to prior holiday promotional pricing commitments that we made primarily to support new Fisher recipe nut distribution.\nIn the year to date comparison, gross profit decreased by $7.1 million, or 8.9%, and gross profit margin decreased to 15.3% for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018 from 16.9% for the first two quarters of fiscal 2017. The decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin in the year to date comparison occurred primarily for the same reasons cited in the quarterly comparison.\nTotal operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 9.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from 9.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to a higher net sales base for the current second quarter. Total operating expenses increased by $0.5 million in the quarterly comparison and included $0.5 million in transaction expenses and $0.3 million in amortization expense associated with our acquisition of the Squirrel Brand business. These acquisition related expenses along with increases in freight, broker commissions and advertising expenses were largely offset by a decline in incentive compensation expense.\nTotal operating expenses for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018 decreased to 8.7% of net sales from 9.0% of net sales for the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, and total operating expenses declined by $1.4 million in the year to date comparison. The decrease in total operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales and dollars, primarily was attributable to a decrease in incentive compensation expense.\nInterest expense was $0.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $0.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Interest expense for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018 was $1.6 million compared to $1.2 million for the first two quarters of fiscal 2017. The increase in interest expense in both comparisons was attributable primarily to higher debt levels, which were mainly driven by our acquisition of the Squirrel Brand business.\nThe increases in the effective tax rates in the quarterly and year to date comparisons resulted from the write down of net deferred tax assets due to changes in U.S. tax laws that were enacted during the current second quarter.\nThe total value of inventories on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased by $13.8 million, or 7.6%, compared to the total value of inventories on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in the total value of inventories on hand was primarily driven by reduced quantities of inshell pecans. The weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased by 3.4% compared to the weighted average cost per pound at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in the weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks was mainly due to lower acquisition costs for pecans and a shift in mix from higher cost inshell pecans to lower cost peanuts.\n“We were encouraged by our significant sales growth in both branded and private brand products in our consumer distribution channel. Our holiday promotional pricing commitments for Fisher recipe nuts were completed by the end of the fiscal 2018 second quarter. We believe that this promotional pricing program supported our goal of investing in our brands and will support new distribution gains as well as continued growth for the Fisher recipe nut brand in future quarters. Following the conclusion of these holiday commitments, we have currently improved the alignment of our selling prices with our acquisition costs for walnuts and pecans,” stated Jeffrey T. Sanfilippo, Chief Executive Officer. “Fisher recipe nut sales volume grew in the current quarter from a product line extension and distribution gains at new and existing grocery customers. At retail, Fisher recipe nut pound volume increased by 3% while the total category pound volume was unchanged in the quarterly comparison according to IRi market data,” Mr. Sanfilippo noted. “Our Orchard Valley Harvest brand continues to grow significantly, and it is currently our second largest brand in respect to net sales. Orchard Valley Harvest also performed well at retail with pound volume up by 61%, while the total produce category pound volume was unchanged in the quarterly comparison,” Mr. Sanfilippo stated. “Fisher snack nut pound volume at retail declined by 17%, while the total pound volume for the snack nut category increased by 1%. In future quarters, we intend to focus on reversing this downward trend with the introduction of our new Oven Roasted Never Fried product line of Fisher snack nuts,” Mr. Sanfilippo noted. “As I mentioned in last quarter’s earnings release, we intend to invest in our Expanding Consumer Reach growth strategy, and we kicked that off with the strategic acquisition of the Squirrel Brand business at the end of November. The acquisition of Squirrel Brand should provide us with a strong platform to expand our consumer distribution channel and gain meaningful distribution in alternative retail channels,” Mr. Sanfilippo concluded.\nThe Company will host an investor conference call and webcast on Tuesday, February 6, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern (9:00 a.m. Central) to discuss these results.
