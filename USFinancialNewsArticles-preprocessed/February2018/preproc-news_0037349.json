    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 13, NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc. (NYSE:NXRT) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nNXRT reported Net Income, FFO 1 , Core FFO 1 and AFFO 1 of $53.4M, $25.1M, $30.4M and $35.1M, respectively, attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016-2017 Same Store properties average effective rent, total revenue and NOI 1 increased 4.4%, 7.0% and 8.6%, respectively, over the prior year period. The weighted average effective monthly rent per unit across all 33 properties held as of December 31, 2017 (the \"Portfolio\"), consisting of 11,775 units, was $948, while physical occupancy was 93.8%. NXRT paid a fourth quarter dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock on December 29, 2017; this cash dividend represented a $0.03 per share, or 13.6% increase, over the prior quarter's dividend. During the fourth quarter, NXRT acquired Atera Apartments, a 380-unit property in Dallas, Texas for $59.2 million. During the fourth quarter, NXRT used proceeds from the sale of The Arbors, The Crossings, The Crossings at Holcomb Bridge and The Knolls (the \"NAVA Portfolio\") to pay down approximately $46.0 million on the bridge facility with KeyBank National Association (the \"2017 Bridge Facility\"). During 2017, for the properties in our Portfolio, NXRT completed 1,408 full and partial interior upgrades and leased 1,246 upgraded units, achieving $89 average monthly rent premiums and a 22.0% ROI. Since inception, for the properties in our Portfolio, we have completed 4,374 full and partial upgrades and achieved a $90 average monthly rental increase per unit, equating to a 21.0% ROI on all units leased as of December 31, 2017. During 2017, NXRT repurchased 104,361 shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $2,435,000, or $23.33 per share. As of December 31, 2017, NXRT had repurchased a total of 354,517 shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $7,022,000, or $19.81 per share. Our seven interest rate swap agreements have effectively fixed the interest rate on $650.0 million, or approximately 92%, of our $703.1 million of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the adjusted weighted average interest rate of our total indebtedness was 3.24%.\n\"2017 symbolized a year of transformation, achievement, and strategic positioning to further bolster the future growth and development of NXRT. We worked diligently to fortify the Company's balance sheet – favorably refinancing over $500 million of mortgage debt and adding $250 million of floating rate hedge positions, reducing our floating rate exposure to <10% of total mortgage debt. We continued to execute our internal growth strategies; harvesting gains and recycling capital into well-located assets in our core markets of Dallas, Houston and Atlanta; distributing $19.3 million in dividends; buying back over 100,000 shares at discounts to our Net Asset Value estimate; and generating 20%+ ROIs on unit upgrades,\" stated NXRT Chairman and President, Jim Dondero. \"We are also pleased to report superior same store performance for Q4 and full year 2017. Moving forward in 2018, we maintain a core focus on creating value – for our residents, for our communities, and for our shareholders.\"\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenues were $144.2 million for the full year 2017, compared to $132.8 million for the full year 2016. Net income for the full year 2017 totaled $56.4 million, or earnings of $2.49 per diluted share, which included $78.4 million of gain on sales of real estate and $48.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense. This compared to net income of $25.9 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the full year 2016, which included $25.9 million of gain on sales of real estate and $35.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense. The change in our net income between the periods primarily relates to increases in gain on sales of real estate and same store operating results, and was partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. The change in our net income between the periods was also due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions. For the full year 2017, NOI¹ was $76.6 million, compared to $69.7 million for the full year 2016. For the full year 2017, Same Store NOI¹ increased 8.6% to $55.0 million, compared to $50.7 million for the full year 2016. For the full year 2017, FFO¹ totaled $25.1 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to $31.0 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, for the full year 2016. For the full year 2017, Core FFO¹ totaled $30.4 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, compared to $31.3 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, for the full year 2016. For the full year 2017, AFFO¹ totaled $35.1 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared to $33.5 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, for the full year 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenues were $34.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $32.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $(4.3) million, or a loss of $(0.21) per share, which included depreciation and amortization expense of $12.9 million. This compared to net income of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016, which included depreciation and amortization expense of $9.3 million. The change in our net income (loss) between the periods primarily relates to increases in depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. For the fourth quarter of 2017, NOI¹ was $19.3 million, compared to $17.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Same Store NOI¹ increased 10.5% to $14.9 million, compared to $13.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, FFO¹ totaled $8.5 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $8.3 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Core FFO¹ totaled $8.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $7.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, AFFO¹ totaled $9.5 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $8.1 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n1.\nFFO, Core FFO, AFFO and NOI are non-GAAP measures.

NXRT completed the reverse portion of the 1031 Exchange of Atera Apartments with the sale of Timberglen on January 31, 2018 (see \"Subsequent Events\" below). This is NXRT's eleventh acquisition in Dallas, expanding its footprint in the market to 3,556 units and bringing its total portfolio to 33 properties consisting of 11,775 units in 10 markets as of December 31, 2017.\nFor the full year 2017, NXRT completed three acquisitions totaling 1,348 units for a combined gross purchase price of $197.2 million.\nDisposition of Property\nAs previously reported, NXRT completed the disposition of nine properties during the year, totaling 2,538 units, for net cash proceeds of $224.4 million, before debt repayments. The combined returns totaled an IRR of approximately 46% and a 2.73x multiple on invested capital 1 .\n(1)\nWe define a \"multiple on invested capital\" as the total return to NXRT (inclusive of the Company's share of property distributions and net cash proceeds from sale, less mortgage debt repaid) divided by NXRT's total capital investment in the properties.\nValue-Add Programs\nFor the properties in our Portfolio as of December 31, 2017, we completed full and partial renovations on 1,408 units in 2017 at an average cost of $4,897 per renovated unit. Since inception, for the properties in our Portfolio, we have completed full and partial renovations on 4,374 units at an average cost of $4,962 per renovated unit that has been leased as of December 31, 2017. We have achieved average rent growth of 10.8%, or a $90 average monthly rental increase per unit, on all units renovated and leased as of December 31, 2017, resulting in a return on invested capital for interior renovations of 21.0%.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our capital expenditures related to our value-add program for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nRehab Expenditures\n2017\n2016\n2015\nInterior\n(1)\n$\n8,393\n$\n9,974\n$\n12,229\nExterior and common area\n7,621\n10,297\n21,449\nTotal rehab expenditures\n$\n16,014\n$\n20,271\n$\n33,678\n(1)\nIncludes total capital expenditures during the period on completed and in-progress interior rehabs.

These non-GAAP measures should be used as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP. For a more complete discussion of FFO, Core FFO, AFFO, and NOI, see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.\nThis press release also includes an analysis of our 2016-2017, 2015-2017 and Q4 Same Store properties, which are defined as those that are stabilized and comparable for both the current and the prior reporting periods. Same Store analysis for the full years 2016-2017 includes 26 properties totaling 8,871 units, or approximately 75% of our Portfolio; the full years 2015-2017 includes 17 properties totaling 5,546 units, or approximately 47% of our Portfolio; while the fourth quarters 2016-2017 includes 27 properties totaling 9,088 units, or approximately 77% of our Portfolio.\nNet Operating Income\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) advisory and administrative fees, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (5) corporate general and administrative expenses, (6) other gains and losses that are specific to us, (7) casualty-related expenses/(recoveries), and (8) property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on behalf of NXRT at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees.\nThe following table, which has not been adjusted for the effects of noncontrolling

incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees.\nFFO, Core FFO and AFFO\nWe believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, core funds from operations, or Core FFO, and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT.\nSince the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges. We compute FFO attributable to common stockholders in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with net income (loss) before adjusting for amounts attributable to (1) noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures and (2) redeemable noncontrolling interests in the OP; we show the combined amounts attributable to such noncontrolling interests as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common stockholders. Core FFO makes certain adjustments to FFO, which are either not likely to occur on a continuing basis or are otherwise not representative of the continuing operating performance of our portfolio.\nCore FFO adjusts FFO to remove items such as acquisition expenses, losses on extinguishment of debt and modification costs (includes prepayment penalties incurred and the write-off of unamortized deferred loan costs related to the early retirement of debt and costs incurred in connection with a debt modification that are expensed), the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining short-term debt financing, the ineffective portion of fair value adjustments on our interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe Core FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities.\nAFFO makes certain adjustments to Core FFO. There is no industry standard definition of AFFO and practice is divergent across the industry. AFFO adjusts Core FFO to remove items such as equity-based compensation expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining long-term debt financing, and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe AFFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities.\nThe effect of the conversion of OP Units held by noncontrolling limited partners is not reflected in the computation of basic and diluted FFO, Core FFO and AFFO per share, as they are exchangeable for common stock on a one-for-one basis. The FFO, Core FFO and AFFO allocable to such units is allocated on this same basis and reflected in the adjustments for noncontrolling interests below. As such, the assumed conversion of these units would have no net impact on the determination of diluted FFO, Core FFO and AFFO per share.\nWe believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. While FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income (loss) as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO, Core FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do.\nThe following table reconciles our calculations of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2015\nNet income (loss)\n$\n56,359\n$\n25,888\n$\n(10,992)\nDepreciation and amortization\n48,752\n35,643\n40,801\nGain on sales of real estate\n(78,365)\n(25,932)\n—\nAdjustment for noncontrolling interests\n(1,695)\n(4,583)\n(4,170)\nFFO attributable to common stockholders\n25,051\n31,016\n25,639\nFFO per share - basic\n$\n1.19\n$\n1.46\n$\n1.20\nFFO per share - diluted\n$\n1.17\n$\n1.46\n$\n1.20\nAcquisition costs\n—\n386\n2,975\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs\n5,719\n1,722\n652\nChange in fair value on derivative instruments - ineffective portion\n(309)\n(1,683)\n—\nAmortization of deferred financing costs - acquisition term notes\n403\n—\n—\nAdjustment for noncontrolling interests\n(429)\n(94)\n(322)\nCore FFO attributable to common stockholders\n30,435\n31,347\n28,944\nCore FFO per share - basic\n$\n1.45\n$\n1.48\n$\n1.36\nCore FFO per share - diluted\n$\n1.42\n$\n1.47\n$\n1.36\nAmortization of deferred financing costs - long term debt\n1,592\n1,423\n1,081\nEquity-based compensation expense\n3,108\n825\n—\nAdjustment for noncontrolling interests\n(76)\n(140)\n(92)\nAFFO attributable to common stockholders\n35,059\n33,455\n29,933\nAFFO per share - basic\n$\n1.66\n$\n1.58\n$\n1.41\nAFFO per share - diluted\n$\n1.64\n$\n1.57\n$\n1.41\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic\n21,057\n21,232\n21,294\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n21,399\n21,314\n21,294\nDividends declared per common share\n$\n0.910\n$\n0.838\n(1)\nFFO Coverage - diluted\n1.29x\n1.74x\n(1)\nCore FFO Coverage - diluted\n1.56x\n1.76x\n(1)\nAFFO Coverage - diluted\n1.80x\n1.87x\n(1)\nThe year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nFFO was $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of approximately $5.9 million. The change in our FFO between periods primarily relates to increases in total property operating expenses of approximately $4.0 million, interest expense of approximately $9.4 million, loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of approximately $4.0 million and corporate general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.3 million, and was partially offset by an increase in total revenues of approximately $11.4 million and adjustments for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nCore FFO was $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of approximately $0.9 million.
