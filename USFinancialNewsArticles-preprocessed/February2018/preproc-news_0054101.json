That’s what has given the market a reason to see a little bit of a positive futures,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth in New York.\nAt 8:34 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 24 points. S&P 500 e-minis rose 8 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis gained 21.75 points.\nStocks ended lower on Wednesday after the release of the minutes pushed yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to a four-year high of 2.957 percent. They were last trading at 2.9134 percent.\nWorries of rising inflation were at the heart of a stock market rout earlier this month. Stocks have, however, clawed back some of those losses, with the S&P 500 gaining in six of the past eight days.\nDespite Fed’s hawkish views, bets in the U.S. short-term interest rate futures continued to reflect expectations of three rate hikes this year, based on a Reuters analysis.\nTraders also gave a 94 percent chance that the first hike would come in March.\nEconomic data showed U.S. jobless claims fell more-than-expected to a near 45-year low last week.\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims unchanged at 230,000 in the latest week.\nChesapeake Energy’s shares rose more than 6 percent and were the most traded premarket after the company’s fourth-quarter profit topped analysts’ estimates.\nPandora Media gained 4.7 percent after the internet radio company reported quarterly revenue that topped Wall Street estimates as it added more subscribers.\nRoku slid more than 19 percent after the TV streaming device maker forecast current-quarter revenue below estimates.
