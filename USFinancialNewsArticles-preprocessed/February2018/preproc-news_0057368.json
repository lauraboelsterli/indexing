The hotel is currently expected to remain closed through the end of 2019. The Company is currently working with its insurance carriers and the USVI government to evaluate all alternatives. The Company expects to receive insurance proceeds for its business interruption losses, including lost profits, during the closure period. The Inn at Key West : The Company is in the process of completing a comprehensive renovation of the hotel in connection with remediation of the substantial wind and water-related damage from Hurricane Irma. The hotel is expected to reopen as the Havana Cabana Key West in April 2018. The Company expects to receive insurance proceeds for its business interruption losses, including lost profits, during the closure period.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company is pursuing insurance claims for the remediation of property damage and business interruption at Frenchman's Reef, the Inn at Key West and the Lodge at Sonoma. The Company is insured for up to $361 million for each covered event, subject to certain deductibles and other conditions. During the fourth quarter, the Company recognized $4.1 million of business interruption income for Frenchman's Reef and Inn at Key West.\nHotel Acquisition Activity\nDuring 2017, the Company acquired two hotels for a total purchase price of $97 million in the resort market of Sedona, Arizona. The L'Auberge de Sedona and the Orchards Inn Sedona generated combined RevPAR growth of 19.3% and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin growth of 382 basis points during 2017. The combined hotels outperformed the Company's underwriting by $1.2 million in 2017 and the Company's total investment represents a 9% yield on full year 2017 Hotel Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe Company is under contract to acquire the 77-room Landing Resort & Spa in South Lake Tahoe, California for $42 million, or $545,000 per key. The Landing Resort & Spa is a premier luxury resort with one of the best locations in Lake Tahoe. TripAdvisor currently ranks The Landing as one of the top 20 hotels in the U.S. and Condé Nast Readers' Choice Award named the hotel the #1 resort in Northern California in 2016. The resort was redeveloped and opened essentially new in 2012. The acquisition is expected to close before the end of the first quarter and will be funded with corporate cash. The Company has identified a number of value-add and asset management opportunities and has underwritten the resort to stabilize in the coming years at an approximate 9.5% EBITDA yield on its total investment after full implementation of its value-add asset management plan. The acquisition represents a 7% yield on 2017 Hotel Adjusted EBITDA.\nHotel Manager Changes\nThe Company made several manager changes during 2017 that it believes will create value going forward. In August 2017, the Company terminated its management agreement with Marriott at the Courtyard Midtown East and entered into a new franchise agreement with Marriott and a new management agreement with HEI. In October 2017, the Company entered into a new management agreement with Viceroy Hotels & Resorts for the Hotel Rex as part of its strategy to significantly reposition the hotel into a higher rate category. In December 2017, the Company terminated its management agreement with the seller at the L'Auberge de Sedona and Orchards Inn Sedona and entered into a new management agreement with Two Roads Hospitality, a national hotel operator with extensive luxury resort experience. The Company exercised its right to terminate its management agreement with Marriott for Frenchman's Reef due to the hotel's extensive property damage, effective February 20, 2018.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company invested approximately $100 million on capital improvements during the year ended December 31, 2017, which included the following significant projects:\nChicago Marriott Downtown: The Company completed the third phase of its multi-year renovation, which included the upgrade renovation of approximately 340 guest rooms. The hotel gained over 5.5 percentage points in market share during 2017. The Gwen Chicago: The Company completed the $27 million rebranding renovation of the hotel, including a complete renovation of its 311 guest rooms in April 2017. The hotel is currently ranked in the Top 10 of all hotels in Chicago by TripAdvisor. Worthington Renaissance: The Company completed the renovation of the hotel's 504 guest rooms in January 2017. Since the renovation, RevPAR has increased 23% and the hotel gained over 20 points of market share. Charleston Renaissance: The Company completed the renovation of the hotel's 166 guest rooms in February 2017. The hotel has gained significant market share post renovation, most dramatically in the fourth quarter with a 21 percentage point gain. The Lodge at Sonoma: The Company completed the renovation of the hotel's 182 guest rooms in April 2017. The ramp up after the renovation was interrupted by the impact of wildfires in Northern California, however the hotel is expected to gain market share in 2018.\nIn pursuit of optimizing its capital allocation, the Company is finding the highest return opportunities in the current environment are through value creation investments in its existing portfolio. In total, DiamondRock expects to invest approximately $135 million on capital improvements at its hotels in 2018, which includes carryover from certain projects that commenced in 2017. Significant projects in 2018 include the following:\nChicago Marriott Downtown: The Company commenced the final phase of its $110 million, multi-year renovation, which includes the final 258 of 1,200 guest rooms and all of the hotel's 60,000 square feet of prime meeting space. Meeting planners have responded well with post-renovation booking pace up 12.7% in 2018. With the best location and strong brand, the hotel is well positioned to continue to gain market share following the first quarter renovation disruption. Havana Cabana Key West: The Company will relaunch this newly-themed boutique hotel following a comprehensive repositioning of the entire asset post hurricane. The hotel will re-open as the Havana Cabana Key West in April 2018. This fully renovated and repositioned boutique hotel is expected to drive incremental market share of 5 to 10 percentage points. The Company does not anticipate significant Hotel Adjusted EBITDA displacement as it expects to receive business interruption insurance proceeds for the closure period. Vail Marriott Resort: This well-located Vail resort becomes unencumbered by brand and management over the next several years, creating numerous up-branding options to capture higher revenues and close the ADR gap among the luxury hotels in this growing market. In anticipation of this, the Company will complete a comprehensive renovation of the hotel's guest rooms and meeting space in 2018 after the ski season. The renovation will be done to a luxury standard to position the hotel to gain market share and partially close the gap with the luxury comp set, which currently has a $175 average daily rate premium to the Vail Marriott. Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort: Since its acquisition in 2014, the Westin has cumulatively exceeded underwriting by $5.5 million in Hotel Adjusted EBITDA and is currently generating a 9.8x EBITDA multiple on the Company's all-in investment. To capitalize on this high-performing asset, the Company expects to renovate the hotel's 432 guest rooms in 2018. This renovation follows the completion of the newly-created Lona restaurant and redeveloped lobby experience. The rooms renovation will give the Westin the ability to increase business transient rates and to increase both group room nights and rates. JW Marriott Denver: To maintain its leadership position as the premier luxury hotel within Denver's high-end submarket of Cherry Creek, the Company expects to commence a renovation in the fourth quarter of 2018 of the JW Marriott's guest rooms, public space and meeting rooms. Since the majority of this renovation will take place in 2019, the Company does not expect any material displacement in 2018. Hotel Rex: This boutique hotel located in the heart of San Francisco's Union Square will close for the last four months of 2018 to complete a comprehensive renovation and transformation to a Viceroy hotel. Following this renovation and relaunch, the hotel will be well-positioned to take advantage of an anticipated record year in San Francisco in 2019.\nThe Company anticipates approximately $6 million in renovation displacement to Hotel Adjusted EBITDA in 2018, which is approximately $2 million more than the prior year. The displacement is primarily attributable to the upgrade renovations at the Vail Marriott Resort, Hotel Rex San Francisco, Westin Ft. Lauderdale Beach Resort, and the Chicago Marriott Downtown. The displacement is expected to be approximately $2 million during the first quarter, $1 million during the second quarter, and $1.5 million during each of the third and fourth quarters.\nBalance Sheet\nAs the Company had $183.6 million of unrestricted cash on hand and approximately $937.8 million of total debt (approximately 3.0x full year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA), which consisted of property-specific mortgage debt and $300.0 million of unsecured term loans. The Company has no outstanding borrowings on its $300 million senior unsecured credit facility and 20 of its 28 hotels are unencumbered by debt.\nDividends\nThe Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2017. The dividend was paid on January 12, 2018.\nATM Equity Offering Program\nThe Company issued common stock under its \"at-the-market\" equity offering program subsequent to December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Company opportunistically sold 230,719 shares of its common stock at an average price of $12.02 per share for net proceeds of $2.7 million.\nGuidance\nThe Company's actual results for the year ended December 31, 2017, which came in at or above the high end of its previously provided guidance, are as follows:\nMetric\nGuidance\nActual Results\nPerformance Relative to Midpoint\nLow End\nHigh End\nComparable RevPAR Growth\n2 percent\n2.5 percent\n2.5 percent\n+ 0.25 percent\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$239 million\n$247 million\n$250.0 million\n+ $7.0 million\nAdjusted FFO\n$192.3 million\n$197.3 million\n$201.0 million\n+ $6.2 million\nAdjusted FFO per share\n$0.95 per share\n$0.98 per share\n$1.00 per share\n+ $0.035 per share\nThe Company is providing annual guidance for 2018, but does not undertake to update it for any developments in its business.

These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company.\nUse and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur management and Board of Directors use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital intensive companies. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. These non-GAAP financial measures as presented by us, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies. These measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur, such as depreciation, interest and capital expenditures. We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nEBITDA and FFO\nEBITDA represents net income excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. In addition, covenants included in our debt agreements use EBITDA as a measure of financial compliance. We also use EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.\nThe Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and impairment losses, plus depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it is a measure of the Company's operations without regard to specified non-cash items, such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on the sale of assets. The Company also uses FFO as one measure in assessing its operating results.\nHotel EBITDA\nHotel EBITDA represents net income excluding: (1) interest expense, (2) income taxes, (3) depreciation and amortization, (4) corporate general and administrative expenses (shown as corporate expenses on the consolidated statements of operations), and (5) hotel acquisition costs. We believe that Hotel EBITDA provides our investors a useful financial measure to evaluate our hotel operating performance, excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest), our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), and our corporate-level expenses (corporate expenses and hotel acquisition costs). With respect to Hotel EBITDA, we believe that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and third-party management companies have direct control. We believe property-level results provide investors with supplemental information on the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and effectiveness of the third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis.\nAdjustments to EBITDA, FFO and Hotel EBITDA\nWe adjust EBITDA, FFO and Hotel EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted FFO and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA when combined with U.S. GAAP net income, EBITDA, FFO and Hotel EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our consolidated and property-level operating performance. Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margins are calculated as Hotel Adjusted EBITDA divided by total hotel revenues.\nWe adjust EBITDA, FFO and Hotel EBITDA for the following items:\nNon-Cash Ground Rent: We exclude the non-cash expense incurred from the straight line recognition of rent from our ground lease obligations and the non-cash amortization of our favorable lease assets. We exclude these non-cash items because they do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors in the current period and they are of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period. Non-Cash Amortization of Favorable and Unfavorable Contracts: We exclude the non-cash amortization of the favorable and unfavorable contracts recorded in conjunction with certain acquisitions because the non-cash amortization is based on historical cost accounting and is of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle: Infrequently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude the effect of these adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect the Company's actual underlying performance for the current period. Gains or Losses from Early Extinguishment of Debt: We exclude the effect of gains or losses recorded on the early extinguishment of debt because these gains or losses result from transaction activity related to the Company's capital structure that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the Company or our hotels. Hotel Acquisition Costs: We exclude hotel acquisition costs expensed during the period because we believe these transaction costs are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Severance Costs: We exclude corporate severance costs incurred with the termination of corporate-level employees and severance costs incurred at our hotels related to lease terminations or structured severance programs because we believe these costs do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Hotel Manager Transition Items: We exclude the transition costs and other related items, such as the acceleration of key money amortization, associated with a change in hotel manager because we believe these items do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Other Items: From time to time we incur costs or realize gains that we consider outside the ordinary course of business and that we do not believe reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Such items may include, but are not limited to the following: pre-opening costs incurred with newly developed hotels; lease preparation costs incurred to prepare vacant space for marketing; management or franchise contract termination fees; gains or losses from legal settlements; bargain purchase gains incurred upon acquisition of a hotel; costs incurred related to natural disasters, such as hurricanes; and gains from insurance proceeds, other than income related to business interruption insurance.\nIn addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA we exclude gains or losses on dispositions and impairment losses because we believe that including them in EBITDA does not reflect the ongoing performance of our hotels. Additionally, the gain or loss on dispositions and impairment losses are based on historical cost accounting and represent either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods, and depreciation is excluded from EBITDA.\nIn addition, to derive Adjusted FFO we exclude any fair value adjustments to debt instruments. We exclude these non-cash amounts because they do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company.\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following tables are reconciliations of our GAAP net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$\n24,772\n$\n23,906\n$\n91,877\n$\n114,796\nInterest expense\n9,691\n9,493\n38,481\n41,735\nIncome tax expense\n1,188\n1,042\n10,207\n12,399\nReal estate related depreciation\n24,059\n23,713\n99,090\n97,444\nEBITDA\n59,710\n58,154\n239,655\n266,374\nNon-cash ground rent\n1,535\n1,441\n6,290\n5,671\nNon-cash amortization of favorable and unfavorable\ncontract liabilities, net\n(478)\n(478)\n(1,912)\n(1,912)\nHotel acquisition costs\n—\n—\n2,028\n—\nHurricane-related costs (1)\n1,787\n—\n3,280\n—\nImpairment losses\n852\n—\n3,209\n—\nHotel manager transition items and pre-opening costs (2)\n(2,275)\n—\n(3,637)\n—\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n274\n—\nLoss (gain) on sale of hotel properties, net (3)\n764\n(379)\n764\n(10,698)\nSeverance costs (4)\n—\n—\n—\n(563)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n61,895\n$\n58,738\n$\n249,951\n$\n258,872\n(1)\nRepresents stabilization, cleanup, and other costs (such as hotel labor) incurred at our hotels impacted by Hurricanes Irma or Maria that are not expected to be recovered by insurance.\n(2)\nIncludes items related to the hotel manager changes during three months ended December 31, 2017, as follows: a reduction in employee severance costs of approximately $0.1 million related to Courtyard Manhattan Midtown East; transition costs of approximately $0.4 million related to the Hotel Rex, L'Auberge de Sedona and Orchards Inn Sedona; offset by $2.6 million of accelerated amortization of key money received from Marriott for Frenchman's Reef.
