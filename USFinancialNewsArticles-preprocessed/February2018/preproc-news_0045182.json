Adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $220.6 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, after excluding the $22.0 million tax charge related to the re-measurement of the Company’s net deferred tax assets and the $13.2 million pretax charge related to the impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated entity.* No similar adjustments existed in 2016. New home orders of 5,075 compared to 4,248, an increase of 19% Active selling communities averaged 127.5 compared to 118.3, an increase of 8% New home orders per average selling community increased by 11% to 39.8 orders (3.3 monthly) compared to 35.9 orders (3.0 monthly) Cancellation rate of 15% in both full year periods Home sales revenue of $2.7 billion compared to $2.3 billion, an increase of 17% New home deliveries of 4,697 homes compared to 4,211 homes, an increase of 12% Average sales price of homes delivered of $582,000 compared to $553,000, an increase of 5% Homebuilding gross margin percentage of 20.5% compared to 21.2%, a decrease of 70 basis points Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 22.9%* SG&A expense as a percentage of homes sales revenue of 10.1% compared to 10.8%, a decrease of 70 basis points Repurchased 8,994,705 shares of common stock at an average price of $12.48 for an aggregate dollar amount of $112.2 million in the full year ended December 31, 2017\n* See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\"\n“We ended 2017 on a very strong note,” said TRI Pointe Group CEO Doug Bauer. “Fourth quarter home sales revenue grew 46% year-over-year, thanks to a 23% increase in new home deliveries and an 18% rise in average selling price. We also posted solid year-over-year operating margin expansion, as both homebuilding gross margins and SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved during the quarter, culminating in an 81% increase in pretax income. New home orders during the quarter also surpassed last year’s comparable quarter total, as our average sales pace per community was a healthy 2.8 homes per community per month compared to 2.5 in the same period last year.”\n“For the full year 2017, we posted double digit gains in new home orders of 19%, home sales revenue of 17% and pretax income of 13%, and we ended the year with a backlog dollar value 56% higher than the prior year,” said Mr. Bauer. These results are a testament to the ongoing strength of our homebuilding markets, the quality of our land positions and the value created by our unique operating strategy.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nNet income available to common stockholders was $74.0 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income available to common stockholders of $57.9 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in net income available to common stockholders was primarily driven by higher home sales revenue and homebuilding gross margin, partially offset by a $22.0 million tax charge related to the re-measurement of the Company’s net deferred tax assets and a pretax charge of $13.2 million related to the impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated entity. Excluding these items, adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $107.4 million or $0.70 per diluted share.* No similar adjustments existed in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nHome sales revenue increased $352.1 million, or 46%, to $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $770.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a 23% increase in new home deliveries to 1,757, and an 18% increase in average selling price of homes delivered to $639,000 compared to $540,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNew home orders increased 17% to 1,063 homes for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to 909 homes for the same period in 2016. Average selling communities was 127.5 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 122.8 for the fourth quarter of 2016. New home orders per average selling community for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 8.3 orders (2.8 monthly) compared to 7.4 orders (2.5 monthly) during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company ended the quarter with 1,571 homes in backlog, representing approximately $1.0 billion. The average selling price of homes in backlog as of December 31, 2017 increased $103,000, or 19%, to $657,000 compared to $554,000 at December 31, 2016.\nHomebuilding gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to 21.7% compared to 20.0% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments in cost of home sales, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 24.2% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 22.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016.* The increase in homebuilding gross margin percentage was largely due to the mix of homes delivered during the quarter, with 225 more homes delivered from our California assets, which have gross margins above the Company average.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased to 7.2% of home sales revenue as compared to 9.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016 due to increased leverage as a result of the 46% increase in home sales revenue.\n“We continue to be at the forefront of homebuilding innovation, both in terms of community planning and new home design,” said TRI Pointe Group COO Tom Mitchell. “We strive to create a unique home buying experience for our customers, one that takes into account the distinct aesthetic of our local markets and the lifestyle wants and needs of each buyer segment. We believe that this emphasis on design and innovation played a key role in our strong financial performance in 2017. We are in the process of rolling out several communities with new home concepts that we expect will appeal to two of the largest home buying segments - Active Adults and Millennials - and we are excited about their prospects.”\n* See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nOutlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects to grow average selling communities by 5% compared to 2017 and deliver between 5,100 and 5,400 homes at an average sales price of approximately $610,000. The Company expects its homebuilding gross margin percentage for the full year 2018 to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5% and expects its SG&A expense as a percentage of home sales revenue to be in the range of 9.9% to 10.3%. Finally, the Company expects its effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects to open 8 new communities and close out of 11 communities, resulting in 127 active selling communities as of March 31, 2018. In addition, the Company anticipates delivering approximately 55% of its 1,571 homes in backlog as of December 31, 2017 at an average sales price of $630,000 to $640,000. The Company anticipates its homebuilding gross margin percentage to be in a range of 21.5% to 22.5% for the first quarter of 2018. Finally, the Company expects its SG&A expense as a percentage of home sales revenue to be in the range of 13.0% to 13.5% for the first quarter of 2018.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn February 16, 2018, our Board of Directors cancelled the share repurchase program approved in 2017, which had approximately $37.8 million remaining in authorized repurchases, and approved the Repurchase Program, which authorizes the repurchase of up to $100 million of Company common stock through March 31, 2019. Purchases of common stock pursuant to the Repurchase Program may be made in open market transactions effected through a broker-dealer at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We are not obligated under the Repurchase Program to repurchase any specific number or dollar amount of shares of common stock, and we may modify, suspend or discontinue the Repurchase Program at any time. Our management will determine the timing and amount of any repurchases in its discretion based on a variety of factors, such as the market price of our common stock, corporate requirements, general market economic conditions and legal requirements.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call via live webcast for investors and other interested parties beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, February 20, 2018.

non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We present these measures because we believe they and similar measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and financing structure. We also believe these measures facilitate the comparison of our operating performance and financing structure with other companies in our industry. Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following tables reconcile homebuilding gross margin percentage, as reported and prepared in accordance with GAAP, to the non-GAAP financial measure adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage. We believe this information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that leverage and non-cash impairments and lot option abandonments have on homebuilding gross margin and permits investors to make better comparisons with our competitors, who may adjust gross margins in a similar fashion.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 % 2016 % (dollars in thousands) Home sales revenue $ 1,122,841 100.0 % $ 770,703 100.0 % Cost of home sales 878,688 78.3 % 616,767 80.0 % Homebuilding gross margin 244,153 21.7 % 153,936 20.0 % Add: interest in cost of home sales 26,387 2.4 % 16,458 2.1 % Add: impairments and lot option abandonments 851 0.1 % 792 0.1 % Adjusted homebuilding gross margin $ 271,391 24.2 % $ 171,186 22.2 % Homebuilding gross margin percentage 21.7 % 20.0 % Adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage 24.2 % 22.2 %\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 % 2016 % (dollars in thousands) Home sales revenue $ 2,732,299 100.0 % $ 2,329,336 100.0 % Cost of home sales 2,173,251 79.5 % 1,836,327 78.8 % Homebuilding gross margin 559,048 20.5 % 493,009 21.2 % Add: interest in cost of home sales 64,835 2.4 % 51,111 2.2 % Add: impairments and lot option abandonments 2,020 0.1 % 1,470 0.1 % Adjusted homebuilding gross margin $ 625,903 22.9 % $ 545,590 23.4 % Homebuilding gross margin percentage 20.5 % 21.2 % Adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage 22.9 % 23.4 % RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s ratio of debt-to-capital to the non-GAAP ratio of net debt-to-net capital. We believe that the ratio of net debt-to-net capital is a relevant financial measure for management and investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of the Company’s ability to obtain financing.\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Unsecured revolving credit facility $ — $ 200,000 Seller financed loans — 13,726 Senior notes 1,471,302 1,168,307 Total debt 1,471,302 1,382,033 Stockholders’ equity 1,929,722 1,829,447 Total capital $ 3,401,024 $ 3,211,480 Ratio of debt-to-capital (1) 43.3 % 43.0 % Total debt $ 1,471,302 $ 1,382,033 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (282,914 ) (208,657 ) Net debt 1,188,388 1,173,376 Stockholders’ equity 1,929,722 1,829,447 Net capital $ 3,118,110 $ 3,002,823 Ratio of net debt-to-net capital (2) 38.1 % 39.1 %\n(1) The ratio of debt-to-capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing debt by the sum of debt plus equity.\n(2) The ratio of net debt-to-net capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing net debt (which is debt less cash and cash equivalents) by the sum of net debt plus equity.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following table contains information about our operating results reflecting certain adjustments to income before income taxes, (provision) benefit for income taxes, net income, net income available to common stockholders and earnings per share (diluted). We believe reflecting these adjustments is useful to investors in understanding our recurring operations by eliminating the varying effects of certain non-routine events, and may be helpful in comparing the Company to other homebuilders to the extent they provide similar information.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2017 As Reported Adjustments Adjusted As Reported Adjustments Adjusted (in thousands, except per share amounts) Income before income taxes 156,685 13,182 (1) 169,867 339,818 13,182 (1) 353,000 (Provision) benefit for income taxes (82,443 ) 20,201 (2) (62,242 ) (152,267 ) 20,201 (2) (132,066 ) Net income 74,242 33,383 107,625 187,551 33,383 220,934 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (222 ) — (222 ) (360 ) — (360 ) Net income available to common stockholders $ 74,020 $ 33,383 $ 107,403 $ 187,191 $ 33,383 $ 220,574 Earnings per share Diluted $ 0.49 $ 0.70 $ 1.21 $ 1.42 Weighted average shares outstanding Diluted 152,568 152,568 155,085 155,085 Effective tax rate 52.6 % 36.6 % 44.8 % 37.4 %",
