    "text": "HOUSTON, Spectra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: SEP) today reported fourth quarter 2017 financial results and provided a quarterly business update.\nHIGHLIGHTS AND PRESIDENT'S COMMENT\nSuccessfully brought 6 projects online, totaling more than $2.0 billion Announced 41 st consecutive quarterly distribution increase, representing a 7.3% increase over the distribution declared in February 2017 Completed SEP's Incentive Distribution Rights (IDR) restructuring\n\"Driven primarily by contributions from our successful expansion program, Spectra Energy Partners achieved yet another year of strong performance, delivering increased earnings, cash flows and distributions for our investors,\" said Bill Yardley, Chairman and President of Spectra Energy Partners.\n\"Our 2017 results reinforce the strength and stability of our fee-based business model and exceptional asset footprint which delivered strong operational performance and achieved top delivery days across our major U.S. pipelines over the recent winter period. We continue to create value for our investors now and into the future, as demonstrated by the recent announcement of our 41 st consecutive quarterly distribution increase.\n\"We also are pleased to have successfully completed the elimination of SEP's incentive distribution rights, which enhances SEP's long-term value proposition and better positions SEP for extended growth,\" Mr. Yardley concluded.\nU.S. TAX REFORM\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States implemented U.S. Tax Reform. The \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (TCJA) was signed into law and became enacted for tax purposes. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxation years beginning after December 31, 2017. The most significant change included in the TCJA, with respect to SEP's 2017 financial statements, was a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nThis tax rate change resulted in a non-cash $860 million charge in the fourth quarter 2017 to reflect the establishment of an estimated regulatory liability for the cost of service assets of SEP. This charge has no immediate net impact to the rate base of the affected entities. In the event of a future rate case, and subject to further regulatory guidance, we anticipate that the charge may be required to be amortized over the remaining useful life of the affected assets and would be one of many factors to be considered in establishing go-forward rates. SEP expects no material impact to cash flows over the 2018-2020 plan timeframe as a result of the TCJA.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY\nSpectra Energy Partners reported a net loss of $489 million, including a net loss from controlling interests of $496 million, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, with diluted earnings per limited partner unit of $(1.86). For the year, net income was $703 million, which included net income from controlling interests of $609 million, with diluted earnings per limited partner unit of $0.77. The fourth quarter and yearly results included special items of $854 million and $848 million, respectively, primarily attributable to the TCJA enacted in December 2017, which decreased diluted earnings per limited partner unit by $2.68 for the quarter and $2.68 for the year.\nFourth quarter 2017 ongoing distributable cash flow (DCF) was $358 million, compared with $330 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year, ongoing DCF was $1.53 billion, a $235 million increase from $1.30 billion in 2016. Distributions per limited partner unit paid in 2017 were $2.83, compared with $2.63 per limited partner unit in 2016. The full year distribution coverage ratio was 1.2x.\nFor the quarter, ongoing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $532 million, compared with $510 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year, ongoing EBITDA was $2.18 billion, compared to $1.87 billion in 2016.\nOngoing net income from controlling interests was $358 million for the quarter, or $0.82 diluted earnings per limited partner unit, compared with $337 million, or $0.81 diluted earnings per limited partner unit in the prior-year quarter. The net loss from controlling interests was $496 million for the quarter, or $(1.86) diluted earnings per limited partner unit, compared with $301 million, or $0.70 diluted earnings per limited partner unit in the prior-year quarter.\nFor the year, ongoing net income from controlling interests was $1.46 billion, or $3.45 diluted earnings per limited partner unit, compared with $1.24 billion, or $3.10 diluted earnings per limited partner unit in 2016. Net income from controlling interests was $609 million in 2017, or $0.77 diluted earnings per limited partner unit, compared with $1.16 billion, or $2.84 diluted earnings per limited partner unit in 2016.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nU.S. Transmission\nOngoing EBITDA from U.S. Transmission was $507 million in fourth quarter 2017, compared with $466 million in fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 results reflect increased earnings from expansion projects and slightly higher operating costs. As previously referenced, the 2017 ongoing quarterly results exclude $860 million attributable to the change in the federal income tax rate.\nFor the year 2017, ongoing EBITDA for U.S. Transmission was $2.01 billion, compared with $1.72 billion in 2016. The 2017 and 2016 ongoing EBITDA exclude special items of $21 million and $80 million in expenses, respectively, both related to the 2016 Texas Eastern pipeline incident. The 2017 ongoing results also exclude a special item of $860 million previously referenced and $34 million in expense, mainly from merger-related costs; primarily offset by a $106 million gain realized as a result of the deconsolidation and fair value re-measurement of our interest in Sabal Trail.\nLiquids\nOngoing EBITDA from Liquids was $60 million in fourth quarter 2017, compared with $63 million in fourth quarter 2016. The decrease is mainly due to higher integrity and maintenance expenses.\nFor the year 2017, ongoing EBITDA for Liquids was $260 million, compared with $237 million in 2016. The increase is primarily a result of increased revenues due to the Express Enhancement project placed into service in October 2016.\nOther\n\"Other\" net expenses were $35 million in fourth quarter 2017, compared with $19 million in fourth quarter 2016.\nFor the year 2017, ongoing net expenses were $89 million, compared with net expenses of $82 million in 2016. The 2017 ongoing net expense excludes special items of $38 million, primarily from merger-related costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $74 million in fourth quarter 2017, compared with $59 million in fourth quarter 2016, reflecting lower capitalized interest and higher average debt balances in 2017.\nFor the year 2017, interest expense was $265 million, compared with $224 million in 2016, reflecting higher average debt balances in 2017 and lower capitalized interest.\nLiquidity and Capital Expenditures\nTotal debt outstanding at Spectra Energy Partners as of December 31, 2017, was $8.5 billion. Available liquidity at the end of the quarter was $353 million.\nIncluding contributions from noncontrolling interests of $418 million, total capital and investment spending for the year was approximately $1.8 billion, and consisted of about $1.6 billion of growth capital expenditures and about $243 million of maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures include a $44 million special item related to the 2016 Texas Eastern pipeline incident.\nIn 2017, Spectra Energy Partners received net proceeds of $171 million through its \"At the Market\" (ATM) equity issuance program, with $58 million raised in the fourth quarter.\nIncluding contributions from noncontrolling interests, Spectra Energy Partners has $1.6 billion of capital expansion planned in 2018, which is expected to be funded through a combination of debt, equity, including the use of its ATM program, and return of capital from joint venture asset-level financings.\nIn early January, Texas Eastern issued $800 million of long-term debt split evenly between 10 and 30-year tranches at attractive coupons of 3.50% and 4.15%. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay an affiliate loan of $400 million from SEP and remaining proceeds were distributed to SEP, which the Partnership used to pay down commercial paper and revolver borrowings.\nEXPANSION PROJECT UPDATES\nSpectra Energy Partners' 2017 growth program concluded with six projects placed into service, representing more than $2.0 billion of capital expansion, including:\nSabal Trail Lebanon Extension Gulf Markets – Phase 2 Access South Adair Southwest Atlantic Bridge – Phase 1\nAdditionally, the Bayway Lateral was placed into service in late December, on budget and ahead of schedule.\nCommercially Secured Projects\nApproximately $2 billion of commercially secured projects are on target to be placed into service in 2018. Most notably, the $1.3 billion NEXUS project is under construction and remains on target to achieve in-service in third quarter 2018.\nProgress continues on SEP's other projects in execution with PennEast receiving its FERC certificate in mid-January. We filed our FERC application in December for Lambertville East adding 60,000 Dth/d of capacity on Texas Eastern for utility customers in late 2019. SEP's other projects in execution continue to advance through various stages of the regulatory approval process and remain on track for their respective targeted in-service dates.\nDevelopment Opportunities\nNatural gas pipeline capacity scarcity and system reliability remains a primary issue for New England and one that must be resolved for the region to meet its energy supply needs. We remain committed to bringing much needed affordable energy to New England consumers as we continue to explore energy solutions for the region. The dramatic wholesale electricity price spikes in late December and early January that resulted from the lack of gas pipeline capacity underscored the need for such a solution.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nAdditional information about fourth quarter 2017 earnings can be obtained via the Spectra Energy Partners website: www.spectraenergypartners.com .\nSpectra Energy Partners will host a joint webcast with Enbridge Inc.

The webcast will be available via the Spectra Energy Partners Events & Presentations page, and the conference call can be accessed by dialing (877) 930-8043 in North America or (253) 336-7522 outside North America. The participant passcode is 4939158#.\nA replay of the call will be available via the Spectra Energy Partners Events & Presentations page, or by dialing (855) 859-2056 in North America or (404) 537-3406 outside North America and using the above passcode.\nThe conference call format will include prepared remarks from the executive team followed by a question and answer session for the analyst and investor community only. Spectra Energy Partners' media and investor relations teams will be available after the call for any additional questions.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use ongoing net income from controlling interests as a measure to evaluate operations of the partnership. This measure is a non-GAAP financial measure as it represents net income from controlling interests, excluding special items. Special items represent certain charges and credits which we believe will not be recurring on a regular basis. We believe that the presentation of ongoing net income from controlling interests provides useful information to investors, as it allows investors to more accurately compare our ongoing performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for ongoing net income from controlling interests is net income from controlling interests.\nWe use earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and ongoing EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, as performance measures for Spectra Energy Partners, LP. Ongoing EBITDA represents EBITDA, excluding special items. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and ongoing EBITDA provides useful information to investors, as it allows investors to more accurately compare Spectra Energy Partners, LP's performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for EBITDA and ongoing EBITDA for Spectra Energy Partners, LP is net income.\nThe primary performance measures used by us to evaluate segment performance are segment EBITDA and Other EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA and Other EBITDA, which are the GAAP measures used to report segment results, to be good indicators of each segment's operating performance from its continuing operations as they represent the results of our segments' operations before depreciation and amortization without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA and Other EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\nWe also use ongoing segment EBITDA as a measure of performance. Ongoing segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it represents reported segment EBITDA, excluding special items. We believe that the presentation of ongoing segment EBITDA provides useful information to investors, as it allows investors to more accurately compare a segment's ongoing performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for ongoing segment EBITDA is segment EBITDA.\nWe also present Distributable Cash Flow (DCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of DCF provides useful information to investors, as it represents the cash generation capabilities of the partnership to support distribution growth. We also use ongoing DCF, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it represents DCF, excluding the cash effect of special items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for DCF and ongoing DCF is net income. We also use DCF coverage, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it represents DCF divided by distributions declared on partnership units. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for DCF coverage is Earnings-Per-Unit (EPU).\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other partnerships because other partnerships may not calculate these measures in the same manner.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release includes \" \" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
