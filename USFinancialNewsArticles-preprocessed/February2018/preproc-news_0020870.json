The gross proceeds to MediciNova from this offering are expected to be approximately $40.0 million, before deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses. All of the shares of common stock to be sold in the offering are being offered by MediciNova. In addition, MediciNova has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 662,983 shares of common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The offering is expected to close on or about February 12, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nMediciNova intends to use the net proceeds received from the offering primarily to continue to fund the development of its MN-166 (ibudilast) and MN-001 (tipelukast) programs, including a Phase 3 clinical trial of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of progressive MS, and for working capital and general corporate purposes, including support for MediciNova’s continuing research and development of its product candidates and research programs, clinical trials, commercialization activities and business development activities. MediciNova may use a portion of the net proceeds for acquisitions of businesses, products, technologies or licenses that are complementary to its business, although MediciNova has no present commitments or agreements to do so.\nLadenburg Thalmann & Co.
