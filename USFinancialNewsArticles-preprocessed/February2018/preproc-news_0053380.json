    "text": " 44 p.m. ET Share \nOptions include written testimony, limited verbal testimony Reuters President Donald Trump appears in the White House on Friday. \nBy Peter Nicholas \nPresident Donald Trump’s lawyers are considering ways for him to testify before special counsel Robert Mueller, provided the questions he faces are limited in scope and don’t test his recollections in ways that amount to a potential perjury trap, a person familiar with his legal team’s thinking said. \nTrump’s legal team is weighing options that include providing written answers to Mueller’s questions and having the president give limited verbal testimony, another person familiar with the matter said. \n“Everything is on the table,” this person said. \nMueller is investigating whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 elections and whether the president obstructed justice when he fired former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, who launched the Russia probe. The president denies his campaign colluded with Moscow and that he obstructed justice; Russia says it didn’t meddle in the campaign.",
