Total Revenues were $686.0 million, which is a 24.3% increase over the same quarter in 2016, due mainly to a 13.1% increase in the number of Installed Room Nights at the Chain level, in combination with growth of 6.6% in the RevPAR.

At the consolidated level, Hoteles City Express increased Total Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA by more than 23% and 29%, respectively.\nGrowth of more than 10% in the average rate and more than 8% in the effective rates are reflections of an operating, distribution and digital marketing platform that is best in its class. As we expected, the yield management platform and the efforts to release installed capacity through higher prices, were successful. Today the gap in occupancy levels is non-existent, as it reached levels of 62.6% during 4Q17, more than 100 bps higher than those reported during the same quarter of 2016.\nSupported by the transformation to a real-time operating culture, empowerment at all levels of the organization, and technology development in point-to-point processes, Hoteles City Express is ready to capture the benefits of an infrastructure that is able to operate more than 200 hotels without significant increases in the cost basis. Evidence of this is the fact that the company's EBITDA during the year grew 1.3 times more quickly than Total Revenues.\nDuring 2017 we put more than 1,500 rooms into operation, and we completed our entire development plan, operating 136 hotels today and 140 in the coming weeks. For 2018, we reinforce our commitment towards profitable growth, as we work on a plan to add between 15 to 21 new hotels before the end of the year.\nFinally, we recently announced our intention to create a lodging REIT under the name FSTAY. The launch of this vehicle is a watershed for the company in several different ways, we believe it will be a vehicle that fully supports investor interests, as it will be the best in its class in terms of corporate governance. Furthermore, the company believes that this vehicle will be a catalyst to create greater transparency in the value of its assets, to establish a mechanism for continuous development without any dilution in value for investors, and to strengthen its development capacity so that it will be able to put more hotels into operation per year.\nThis step also marks a change in our model of communicating with the market, in which our investors will be able to validate the performance of that portfolio and to compare it with the rest of the company, which has lower levels of stabilization, thus showing the potential for incremental value of Hoteles City Express over time.\nIt is worth mentioning that currently the Company has sufficient flexibility to adopt any other strategic alternative to achieve the previously discussed objectives, options like increasing leverage based on the credit facilities currently in-placed and taking advantage from the already created trust structure continue to be other ways to accomplish future growth.\nToday more than ever, and now with an additional, and potentially public vehicle, we will maintain our commitment to new shareholders to continue being the best alternative for profitable growth in the market. Thank you for your trust.\"\nC onference Call Details:\nHoteles City Express will host a conference call to discuss these results.
