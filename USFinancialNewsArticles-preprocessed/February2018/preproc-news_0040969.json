In November, Swedish Match completed the divestment of its remaining shareholding in STG. During 2017, Swedish Match distributed 5,498 MSEK to its shareholders in the form of an ordinary dividend, a special dividend and share repurchases. The Board proposes a dividend of 16.60 SEK per share consisting of an increased ordinary dividend of 9.20 SEK (8.50) and a special dividend of 7.40 SEK, following the final sale of shares in STG. As of January 1, 2018, Swedish Match will apply the new revenue recognition standard, IFRS 15. While not impacting profit, this implementation will have a significant effect on the recognition of net sales. Further information is given in Note 1, Accounting principles. The outlook for 2018 can be found on page 13.\n1) Operating profit for Swedish Match product areas, which excludes larger one-time items and share of net profit in STG in 2016.\n2) The full year 2017 includes larger one-time items of 373 MSEK relating to capital gains from the sale of STG shares and from the sale of a parcel of land as well as an income from a defined benefit plan amendment. Previous full year included larger one-time items of 2,254 MSEK relating to capital gains from the partial divestments of STG and an unrealized gain from revaluing Swedish Match's then remaining shareholding in STG to market value as well as a capital gain from the sale of a distribution center. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes larger one-time items of 135 MSEK relating to a capital gain from the sale of STG shares and an income from a defined benefit plan amendment.\nFor the full report: www.swedishmatch.com/Investors/Financial-reports/Interim-reports/\nSwedish Match telephone conference\nA telephone conference will be held today, Wednesday, February 14 at 2:00 p.m. (CET), (1:00 p.m. UK time).
