(NASDAQ:MHLD) (“Maiden” or “the Company”) today reported a fourth quarter 2017 net loss attributable to Maiden common shareholders of $133.6 million or $1.59 per diluted common share compared to net loss attributable to Maiden common shareholders of $74.7 million or $0.87 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Despite these actions, Maiden’s inception to date AmTrust underwriting results remain profitable and with the exception of pre-2016 underwriting year commercial auto liability the balance of our U.S. Diversified segment historical portfolio and more recent underwriting years continue to perform profitably and within expectations.”\n“Notwithstanding the reserve actions and re-underwriting processes that have been implemented, we are also actively engaged in efforts to develop and implement further initiatives and strategies aimed at strengthening shareholder value,” said Raschbaum. “We are committed to do whatever is necessary to deliver greater value for shareholders, customers, and employees.”\nConsolidated Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 201 7\nMaiden reported a fourth quarter 2017 net loss attributable to Maiden common shareholders of $133.6 million or $1.59 per diluted common share compared to net loss attributable to Maiden common shareholders of $74.7 million or $0.87 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Net premiums written increased as a result of the reduction of corporate retrocessional programs in 2017. The segment experienced adverse development of $71.4 million in 2017 compared to $96.8 million in 2016 due to higher than expected loss emergence with over half from two commercial auto accounts.\nAmTrust Reinsurance Segment\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change Gross premiums written $ 1,993,478 $ 2,006,646 (0.7%) Net premiums written 1,954,856 1,888,428 3.5% Net premiums earned 1,909,644 1,843,621 3.6%\nUnderwriting Ratios % Point\nChange Net loss and LAE ratio (6) 78.4% 66.5% 11.9 Commission and other acquisition expense ratio (7) 32.2% 31.7% 0.5 General and administrative expense ratio (8) 0.2% 0.2% 0.0 Expense ratio (9) 32.4% 31.9% 0.5 Combined ratio (10) 110.8% 98.4% 12.4 Gross premiums written decreased marginally due to slower organic growth offset by reductions in AmTrust’s Specialty Program segment reflecting underwriting initiatives focused on improving the profitability of these classes of business. Net premiums written increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the lower utilization of retrocessional capacity in 2017. The segment experienced adverse loss development of $239.9 million during 2017 compared to $54.0 million in 2016. More than half of the loss development in 2017 was from workers’ compensation with general liability and, to a lesser extent, commercial auto, contributing to the adverse result.\nOther Financial Matters\nTotal assets increased to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $6.3 billion at year-end 2016.

The Company’s management believes that non-GAAP (loss) income from operations is a useful measure of the Company’s underlying earnings fundamentals based on its underwriting and investment income before financing costs. This (loss) income from operations enables readers of this information to more clearly understand the essential operating results of the Company. The Company’s measure of non-GAAP (loss) income from operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. (3) Dividends on preference shares consist of $3,093 and $12,375 paid to Preference shares - Series A for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, $2,940 paid to Preference shares - Series C for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and $11,756 and $12,410 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $2,512 and $5,025 paid to Preference shares - Series D for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. It also includes $0 and $8,971 paid to Preference Shares - Series B during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. On September 15, 2016, each of then outstanding Preference share - Series B were automatically converted into 12,069,090 of the Company's common shares at a conversion rate of 3.6573 per preference share.\n(4) Underwriting related general and administrative expenses is a non-GAAP measure and includes expenses which are segregated for analytical purposes as a component of underwriting income. (5) Underwriting (loss) income is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated as net premiums earned plus other insurance revenue less net loss and LAE, commission and other acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses directly related to underwriting activities. Management believes that this measure is important in evaluating the underwriting performance of the Company and its segments. This measure is also a useful tool to measure the profitability of the Company separately from the investment results and is also a widely used performance indicator in the insurance industry. (6) Calculated by dividing net loss and LAE by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. (7) Calculated by dividing commission and other acquisition expenses by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. (8) Calculated by dividing general and administrative expenses by the sum of net premiums earned and other insurance revenue. (9) Calculated by adding together the commission and other acquisition expense ratio and general and administrative expense ratio. (10) Calculated by adding together the net loss and LAE ratio and the expense ratio. (11) Non-GAAP operating (loss) earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by the Company as net (loss) income attributable to Maiden common shareholders excluding realized and unrealized investment gains and losses, foreign exchange and other gains and losses, amortization of intangible assets, divested E&S business and NGHC run-off, accelerated amortization of senior note issuance cost and non-cash deferred tax (benefit) expense and should not be considered as an alternative to net (loss) income. The Company's management believes that non-GAAP operating (loss) earnings is a useful indicator of trends in the Company's underlying operations. The Company's measure of non-GAAP operating (loss) earnings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. (12) Non-GAAP operating return on average common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses non-GAAP operating return on average common shareholders' equity as a measure of profitability that focuses on the return to Maiden common shareholders. It is calculated using non-GAAP operating (loss) earnings attributable to Maiden common shareholders divided by average Maiden common shareholders' equity. (13) Investable assets is the total of the Company's investments, cash and cash equivalents and loan to a related party. (14) Total capital resources is the sum of the Company's principal amount of debt and Maiden shareholders' equity. (15) During a period of loss, the basic weighted average common shares outstanding is used in the denominator of the diluted loss per common share computation as the effect of including potential dilutive shares would be anti-dilutive.\nSource: Maiden Holdings, Ltd.",
