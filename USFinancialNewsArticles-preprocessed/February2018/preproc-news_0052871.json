    "text": "JAKARTA, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo has nominated Perry Warjiyo, a deputy governor at Bank Indonesia (BI), as his nomination for central bank governor, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Saturday.\nWarjiyo is the sole candidate submitted by the president to parliament for approval, said the parliamentary source, who declined to be identified because the information has not been officially released.\nWarjiyo did not respond to a request for comment.\nJohan Budi, a presidential spokesman, said he has no information on the nomination. A BI spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe term of the current BI governor, Agus Martowardojo, will end in May and parliament is due to conduct a “fit and proper test” on the president’s nomination before approval.
