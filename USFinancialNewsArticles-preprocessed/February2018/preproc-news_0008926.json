    "text": " 26 AM / a few seconds ago Janus Henderson co-CEO: Market falls a 'not unhealthy' correction Reuters Staff 2   Fund manager Janus Henderson’s ( JHG.N ) co-Chief Executive Andrew Formica said a market sell-off on fears of rising inflation was a “not unhealthy” pull-back as opposed to the start of a more sustained selloff. \nRecent stock market weakness was a “correction driven by complacency” after markets had seen very little volatility in 2017, Formica told Reuters alongside fourth-quarter results. \nStock markets across Europe were lower early on Tuesday, on concerns around rising inflation. \nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index was down for the seventh straight session and a gauge of volatility .V2TX up more than 35 percent. \n“There was a huge consensus in terms of how people were positioned in markets and what we’ve seen is a change in people’s assessment of risk and volatility,” Formica said. “I actually don’t think that’s unhealthy.” \nAmid concerns about strong wage growth in the United States and the impact of a pronounced sell-off in fixed income, Formica pointed to strong corporate earnings growth, which supports companies. \n“It’s nothing that’s I‘m too worried about... it’s a correction rather than a structural underlying issue that’s been identified.” Reporting by Simon Jessop, editing by Maiya Keidan",
