    "text": "CAPE TOWN, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The South African central bank is investigating whether Steinhoff had breached any exchange control laws or regulations, the regulator said in a statement to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.\nThe South African Reserve Bank said it was ready to cooperate with local and international regulators as well as law enforcement authorities investigating Steinhoff. Were Steinhoff to collapse, it would not result in financial instability, the bank added. (Reporting by Wendell Roelf; Writing by Alexander Winning; Editing by James Macharia)\n ",
