David A. Happel has been appointed as the new chief executive officer, and current board member James Young, Ph.D., will assume the role of chairman of the board. Dr. Levy will continue to serve as a member of the board.\n\"I'm very pleased with the progress we have made over the last four years, including the excellent clinical results in our smoking cessation application as well as the progress we have made on our Parkinson's disease and opioid-tapering programs that target important unmet clinical needs,\" said Dr. Levy. \"With David's background and experience in both the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, and his focus on commercialization, he is the ideal person to take the company through its next chapter.\"\n\"It is an honor to succeed Alan, and I am very excited to build on the foundation that has been created at Chrono Therapeutics as the company continues to advance its proprietary SmartDermal therapeutics and technology platform into the later stages of clinical development and commercialization,\" said Mr. Happel.\nMr. Happel joins Chrono Therapeutics from Horizon Pharma, PLC where he was executive vice president of commercial development and strategy.
