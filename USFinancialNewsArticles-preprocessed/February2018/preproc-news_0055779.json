    "text": "Uptin Saiidi | @uptin Published 57 Mins Ago \nLockheed Martin boasted a giant display at the Singapore Airshow earlier this month, in which the military contractor sought to boast sales of the highly expensive F-35 throughout Asia. \nCNBC got a rare look inside an F-35 simulator, which is used for testing and development of the world's most advanced fighter jet. \nSeveral F-35s operated by the U.S. military were flown in from a military base in Japan, making it the first time an operating F-35 had been on Singapore's soil. \nJapan and South Korea previously committed to 42 and 40 aircraft, respectively, but the company is hoping to boost foreign military sales beyond the original nations supporting the program. \nWhile the U.S. is the primary backer, a number of countries have agreed to collectively contribute billions of dollars toward the developments costs and place orders for their very own jets. The list includes the U.K., Turkey, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Canada. Getty Images \nThe U.S. plans to eventually have more than 2,400 jets. Currently, more than 265 have been delivered and there's approximately 560 trained pilots around the world. \nThe program has drawn controversy and criticism over its cost overruns and delivery delays.",
