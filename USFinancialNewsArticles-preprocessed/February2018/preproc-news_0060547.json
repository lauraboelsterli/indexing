    "text": "February 28, 2018 / 1:08 PM / Updated 3 hours ago Rugby - England, Scotland will not face action over pre-match scuffle Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Six Nations Rugby has found no evidence of violent conduct by England and Scotland players before last weekend’s game at Murrayfield after an investigation into a pre-match scuffle. Scotland beat England 25-13 on Saturday to lift the Calcutta Cup for the first time in 10 years but the victory followed media reports that players from both teams were involved in a melee near the tunnel after the pre-match warm-up. Six Nations Rugby gathered material from the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) plus the BBC and match officials and looked at video footage for their probe. Rugby Union - Six Nations Championship - Scotland vs England - BT Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Britain - February 24, 2018 Scotland’s John Barclay celebrates with teammates and the Calcutta Cup trophy after the match REUTERS/Russell Cheyne “There was some evidence of pushing and shoving in the tunnel at the relevant time but no clear evidence of violent conduct or similar against any individual player,” Six Nations Rugby said in a statement on Wednesday. “No further disciplinary action will be taken.” It added that the RFU and SRU would be reminded about their players’ obligation to uphold the reputation of the tournament. England travel to France for their next clash on March 10 when Scotland visit Ireland. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris",
