    "text": "NEW YORK and SAN DIEGO, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Altegris, an alternative investment research and management firm, and Artivest, an alternative investment technology firm, announced today that they plan to merge under the name Artivest, pending customary corporate and regulatory conditions to closing. The joint 100-person team will service over $3 billion in client capital—immediately becoming the largest independent alternative investment technology and solutions firm for wealth managers, fund managers, and independent advisors.\nThe combination will accelerate the work of both companies to provide individuals and institutions of all sizes efficient access to alternative investments. In October 2017, a PwC industry report forecast that alternative investments will surpass $21 trillion in assets by 2025—more than doubling in size in eight years—and reaching 15% of all global assets under management.\n\"This integration will create the solutions-driven marketplace our clients want. After we formed a commercial relationship with Altegris last year, we realized our strategic goals align and our value propositions are highly complementary,\" said James Waldinger, CEO and Founder of Artivest. \"Altegris will expand our investment, operations, and distribution capabilities, immediately amplifying the power of our technology—and vice versa.\"\n\"Artivest has been heralded for its efforts to reshape the future of alternative investing. Combining Artivest's leading technology with Altegris' deep investing expertise benefits clients and employees alike,\" said Matt Osborne, Founder and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Altegris. \"By combining Altegris with Artivest into one forward-thinking firm, we are making a long-term commitment to alternative investment innovation,\" added Martin Beaulieu, Executive Chairman and CEO of Altegris.\nMr. Waldinger will serve as CEO and Mr. Beaulieu as Executive Chairman of the firm. Mr. Osborne will continue as CIO overseeing investment research and management, including oversight of the Altegris family of funds, which will retain the Altegris name.\nThe combination of the two organizations has wide support from the firms' backers. \"This merger scales up a great team to serve an even broader range of investors while it preserves the benefits of independent ownership,\" said Peter Thiel, Artivest's earliest angel investor. Thiel Capital will now take a seat on the Company's Board. A renowned venture capitalist and founder of PayPal and Palantir, Thiel was famously Facebook's first outside investor.\nWith offices in New York and San Diego, Artivest will remain privately held by employees and outside investors, led by Aquiline Capital Partners, Genstar Capital, KKR, and Thiel Capital.\nAbout Artivest\nArtivest offers technology-driven investment platforms for fund managers, wealth managers, and independent advisors.
