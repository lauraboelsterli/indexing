    "text": "Fourth Quarter Total Revenue of $88.7 Million, Up 60% Year-over-Year\nFiscal 2017 Total Revenue of $296.5 Million, Up 58% Year-over-Year\nCompany Sets Target of $1 Billion in Total Revenue in 2021\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MuleSoft, Inc. (NYSE: MULE), provider of the leading platform for building application networks, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017, ended December 31, 2017.\n“Robust market demand and strong sales execution enabled us to deliver fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 revenue well ahead of expectations,” said Greg Schott, chairman and CEO of MuleSoft. “We are excited about MuleSoft’s growth opportunity and expect to reach $1 billion in total revenue in 2021. Our disruptive platform is addressing one of the largest areas of enterprise IT spend, and we’re confident in our long-term strategy to become the de facto application network platform for our customers to become more agile and to transform their businesses.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights:\nRevenue: Total revenue was $88.7 million in Q4 2017, an increase of 60% year-over-year. Subscription and support revenue was $70.6 million, an increase of 57% year-over-year. Professional services and other revenue was $18.1 million, an increase of 75% year-over-year. Gross margin: GAAP gross margin was 71.2% in Q4 2017, compared to 72.7% in the year ago period. Non-GAAP gross margin was 72.9% in Q4 2017, compared to 73.2% in the year-ago period. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin for subscription and support and professional services revenue each increased year-over-year; however, total gross margin decreased due to the higher mix of services revenue, which has a lower gross margin than subscription and support. Operating loss: GAAP operating loss was $25.5 million in Q4 2017, compared to a GAAP operating loss of $12.8 million in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating loss in Q4 2017 was $16.0 million, compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $10.6 million in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue improved to 59% compared to 62% a year ago, despite higher commissions as a result of strong sales activity in the quarter. Net loss per share: GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was $0.19 based on 130.4 million weighted-average shares outstanding in Q4 2017, compared to GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.52 based on 25.4 million weighted-average shares outstanding in Q4 2016.\nNon-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was $0.12 based on 130.4 million non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding in Q4 2017, compared to non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.10 based on 112.6 million non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding in Q4 2016. Deferred revenue: Total deferred revenue was $211.4 million at the end of Q4 2017, an increase of 56% year-over-year. Short-term deferred revenue was $202.0 million at the end of Q4 2017, an increase of 55% year-over-year. Cash: Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $8.9 million in Q4 2017, compared to ($8.6) million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure that reflects cash from operating activities less cash used for capital expenditures, was $7.6 million for Q4 2017, compared to ($10.9) million in the year-ago period.\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $347.3 million at the end of Q4 2017.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights:\nRevenue: Total revenue was $296.5 million in FY 2017, an increase of 58% year-over-year. Subscription and support revenue was $238.0 million, an increase of 56% year-over-year. Professional services and other revenue was $58.5 million, an increase of 68% year-over-year. Gross margin: GAAP gross margin was 72.6% in FY 2017, compared to 73.9% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP gross margin was 74.1% in FY 2017, compared to 74.4% in the year-ago period. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin for both subscription and support and professional services revenue increased year-over-year; however, total gross margin decreased due to the higher mix of services revenue, which has a lower gross margin than subscription and support. Operating loss: GAAP operating loss was $79.8 million in FY 2017, compared to a GAAP operating loss of $48.4 million in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating loss in FY 2017 was $51.7 million, compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $31.9 million in the year-ago period. Net loss per share: GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was $0.75 based on 106.7 million weighted-average shares outstanding in FY 2017, compared to GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $2.73 based on 21.6 million weighted-average shares outstanding in FY 2016.\nNon-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was $0.41 based on 125.8 million non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding in FY 2017, compared to non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of $0.30 based on 110.9 million non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding in FY 2016. Cash: Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $2.0 million in FY 2017, compared to ($2.4) million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure that reflects cash from operating activities less cash used for capital expenditures, was ($2.9) million in FY 2017, compared to ($6.9) million in the year-ago period.\nOther Fourth Quarter 2017 and Fiscal Year 2017 Highlights:\nAppointment of Two New Board Members: MuleSoft appointed Yvonne Wassenaar and Marcus Ryu to its board of directors. Wassenaar and Ryu bring a combined 40 years of technology leadership experience to MuleSoft. Wassenaar is currently the CEO of Airware, a leading enterprise drone analytics company. Ryu is the CEO and co-founder of Guidewire Software, a leading provider of software to the global property-casualty industry. Forty-five customers with over $1.0 million in annual contract value: Executing successfully on its land-and-expand strategy and delivering value to customers, MuleSoft ended 2017 with 45 customers with over $1.0 million in annual contract value, up from 30 at year-end 2016. Top Place to Work in Multiple Geographies: MuleSoft was ranked the #1 Top Workplace for mid-sized companies by the Bay Area News Group, owner of the San Jose Mercury News. It is the fifth consecutive year that MuleSoft has been named a top employer on the list. In addition, MuleSoft was named one of the Best Places to Work for a third time by the San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal. Additionally, MuleSoft received accolades for being a top place to work in Australia, Argentina, and the United Kingdom.\nFinancial Outlook:\nMuleSoft is providing guidance for its first quarter ending March 31, 2018 as follows:\nTotal revenue between $87 million and $90 million Non-GAAP operating loss between $10 million and $13 million Non-GAAP net loss per share between $0.07 and $0.09 Weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 131 million\nMuleSoft is also providing guidance for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 as follows:\nTotal revenue between $405 million and $415 million Non-GAAP operating loss between $35 million and $40 million Non-GAAP net loss per share between $0.26 and $0.30 Non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 133 million\nAll forward-looking non-GAAP measures exclude estimates for stock-based compensation (“SBC”) expenses. We do not provide reconciliations of our forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections with respect to SBC expenses, which are excluded from these non-GAAP measures. SBC expenses are impacted by future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of our common stock, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to change. The actual amounts of the excluded SBC expenses will have a significant impact on our GAAP operating loss and GAAP net income (loss) per share. Accordingly, reconciliations of our forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are not available.\nConference Call Information:\nMuleSoft will host a conference call at 2 p.m. Pacific Time (5 p.m. Eastern Time) today, February 15, 2018, to discuss its financial results. A live webcast of the call will be available on the MuleSoft website at investors.mulesoft.com . A live dial-in will be available at (844) 340-9044 for domestic participants and at (412) 858-5204 for international participants.\nAbout MuleSoft\nMuleSoft’s mission is to help organizations change and innovate faster by making it easy to connect the world’s applications, data and devices.

If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include risks associated with: our limited operating history in a new and unproven market; engagement of our customers, including through renewals of subscriptions and expanded use of our platform, and our ability to attract new customers; our ability to continue to successfully enhance our platform and develop new services to meet the needs of our customers and address future advances in technology; risks associated with managing our rapid growth, including our ability to maintain our rate of revenue growth and manage our expenses and investment plans; execution of our plans and strategies, including our strategy to target larger organizations for sales of our platform; our ability to maintain and continually develop our technology and network infrastructure to ensure that customers can access our platform at any time and within an acceptable amount of time; increasing competition; our ability to recruit and retain our employees; general economic, market and business conditions; and the risks described in the other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the risks described under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 2, 2017, and which should be read in conjunction with our financial results, and is available on the SEC filings section of the Investor Relations page of our website at https://investors.mulesoft.com/ . All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, MuleSoft provides investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP weighted-average share count, and non-GAAP free cash flow. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures at the end of this press release.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding MuleSoft’s performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing MuleSoft’s performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nA limitation of non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not have uniform definitions. Further, our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, in isolation from, or as superior to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of SBC expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of SBC expense, the cash salary expense included in cost of revenue and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position.\nNon-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating loss. We define non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating loss as gross margin and operating loss, respectively, excluding expenses related to SBC. Although SBC is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, determining the fair value of certain of the stock-based instruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”), which are elements of our ongoing SBC expense, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control. For restricted stock unit awards, the amount of SBC expenses may not reflect the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. Management believes it is useful to exclude SBC in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies.\nNon-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders. We define non-GAAP net loss as net loss excluding expenses related to SBC. We define non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as non-GAAP net loss divided by the non-GAAP weighted-average outstanding shares.\nThe accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures.\nMuleSoft is a registered trademark of MuleSoft, Inc.
