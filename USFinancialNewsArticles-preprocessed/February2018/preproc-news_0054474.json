    "text": "Feb 23 (Reuters) - British bookmaker William Hill posted an 11 percent increase in annual pretax profit, led by growth in its online business and payout gains from more draws being played on Boxing Day English Premier League soccer games.\nWilliam Hill, which named a new chief executive and a finance head last year, said adjusted operating profit for the 52 weeks to Dec. 26 rose to 291.3 million pounds ($406 million) from 261.5 million pounds in 2016.\nRevenue from online business grew 13 percent, while adjusted profit surged 34 percent.\nIts gross win margin, which was soft in the first half, benefited from favourable sporting results in the fourth quarter to rise to 7.6 percent.
