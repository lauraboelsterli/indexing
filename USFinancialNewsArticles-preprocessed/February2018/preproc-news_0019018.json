Scott Stephen, who formerly held this position, has been named Chief Growth Officer and will oversee the expansion of ancillary entities such as Guaranteed Rate Insurance and Ravenswood Title Company as well as other growth initiatives across the company.\nCraig Lombardi, President, Online Division\nScott Stephen, Chief Growth Officer\n“Craig has the in-depth mortgage, sales and call center expertise necessary to leverage our platform and is the perfect choice to exponentially grow our Online Division,” says Chief Executive Officer and Founder Victor Ciardelli. “He joins the company at the exact right time with precisely the credentials and background we are seeking for this role. Scott has done a fantastic job nurturing the Online Division since its inception and will be a huge asset as he transitions to focus on other strategic expansion projects.”\nMost recently an Executive with Quicken Loans, Lombardi brings a wealth of experience in the mortgage space as well as a rich background in sales, domestic call center management and revenue growth strategy. In addition to Quicken Loans, where he also served as Director of Mortgage Banking for nearly six years, Lombardi previously held positions as Vice President, Business Intelligence and Sales with Protect America; Director of Program Sales for Revana; and Telesales Channel Manager at Clearwire.\n“Guaranteed Rate is an amazing entrepreneurial success story and I’m thrilled to be a part of their next growth chapter,” says Lombardi. “What really strikes me is how authentically each person lives the company’s core values every day, values that I very much believe in and live myself. There is tremendous opportunity for further success and expansion with our already impressive Online Division team. I am excited to work with this organization and make an immediate impact.”\nScott Stephen has been with Guaranteed Rate for six years and has been instrumental in cultivating the Online Division and in securing the naming rights deal for Guaranteed Rate Field, home of the White Sox. Prior to arriving at Guaranteed Rate, Stephen served as the Chief Operating Officer for two influential companies: Playboy Enterprises, one of America’s most iconic brands, and Yesmail, a pioneer in the digital marketing arena.\n“Our growth potential is limitless and I’m excited to tap into new revenue growth streams while leveraging the potential of our current entities,” says Stephen. “Guaranteed Rate is poised to continue its rapid rise and I’m honored to be a part of its history and future.”\nAbout Guaranteed Rate\nGuaranteed Rate is one of the largest retail mortgage lenders in the United States.
