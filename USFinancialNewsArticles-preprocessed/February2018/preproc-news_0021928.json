    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. (NYSE:WHG) today reported fourth quarter revenues of $33.9 million, compared to revenues of $31.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $33.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. The increases primarily related to higher average assets under management (\"AUM\") due to market appreciation.\nAUM at December 31, 2017 totaled $24.2 billion, up from $21.2 billion and $23.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nWe recorded $3.4 million in incremental income tax expense during the current quarter as a result of the tax reforms enacted in December 2017. This was primarily due to the mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings from our Canadian subsidiary and adjustments to deferred taxes reflecting the decrease in the federal tax rate.\nFourth quarter net income was $2.9 million compared with $7.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease primarily related to the tax reform noted above and higher employee compensation costs related to performance compensation and headcount increases, partially offset by higher total revenues. Diluted earnings per share (\"Diluted EPS\") of $0.34 compared to $0.92 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP Economic Earnings for the quarter decreased from $12.0 million, or $1.45 per share, in 2016's fourth quarter to $7.6 million, or $0.89 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFourth quarter net income totaled $2.9 million compared with $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the additional income tax expense as noted above, reduced by a one-time $2.5 million legal settlement charge, net of insurance recovery and taxes, which only impacted the third quarter of 2017. Diluted EPS for the quarter of $0.34 compared to $0.49 for the third quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP Economic Earnings for the quarter of $7.6 million, or $0.89 per share, compared to $9.0 million, or $1.07 per share, in the immediately preceding quarter.\nTotal revenues for fiscal 2017 were $133.8 million compared to $123.0 million in 2016. The increase was due to a $7.7 million increase in asset-based advisory fees and a $1.3 million increase in Trust fees reflecting higher average AUM, coupled with a $0.8 million increase in performance-based advisory fees earned in 2017.\nNet income for 2017 totaled $20.0 million, down from 2016's $22.6 million, primarily due to the $2.5 million legal settlement charge and incremental income tax expense, both noted above, partially offset by higher total revenues. Diluted EPS was $2.38 compared with $2.77 for 2016. Economic EPS was $4.63 compared with $5.03 in 2016.\nHighlights of our fourth quarter include:\nRevenues of $33.9 million increased $2.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 and were relatively flat with the third quarter of 2017.\n$3.4 million of incremental income tax expense was recorded related to tax reform.\nAUM reached a record $24.2 billion. Top quartile performance was achieved by our LargeCap Value and AllCap Value teams. A 10% increase was declared in our quarterly cash dividend rate to $0.68 per common share.\nBrian Casey, Westwood’s President & CEO, commented, “We were pleased to end the year with strong absolute and relative performance for our U.S. Value strategies. Our LargeCap and AllCap Value strategies delivered top quartile performance in the fourth quarter, while our SmallCap Value strategy finished the year with performance in the top third of its peer group. Looking to 2018, our focus remains, as it has for nearly 35 years, on identifying high-quality businesses with undervalued prospects and downside protection. Additionally, we are pleased to announce that the sale of our Omaha-based private wealth operations closed on January 12, 2018, with cash proceeds of $10.5 million.”\nWestwood’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.68 per common share, payable on April 2, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 9, 2018. At year end, Westwood had $105.6 million in cash and investments, stockholders’ equity of $156.4 million, and no debt.\nEconomic Earnings and Economic EPS are non-GAAP performance measures and are explained and reconciled with the most comparable GAAP numbers in the attached tables.\nWestwood will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results and other business matters at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time today.

We provide these measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income and earnings per share, which are reported on a GAAP basis. Management reviews Economic Earnings and Economic EPS to evaluate Westwood’s ongoing performance, allocate resources, and review our dividend policy. We believe that these non-GAAP performance measures, while not substitutes for GAAP net income or earnings per share, are useful for management and investors when evaluating Westwood’s underlying operating and financial performance and its available resources. We do not advocate that investors consider these non-GAAP measures without also considering financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe define Economic Earnings as net income plus non-cash equity-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and deferred taxes related to goodwill. Although depreciation on fixed assets is a non-cash expense, we do not add it back when calculating Economic Earnings because depreciation charges represent an allocation of the decline in the value of the related assets that will ultimately require replacement. In addition, we do not adjust Economic Earnings for tax deductions related to restricted stock expense or amortization of intangible assets. Economic EPS represents Economic Earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nSource:Westwood Holdings Group Inc",
