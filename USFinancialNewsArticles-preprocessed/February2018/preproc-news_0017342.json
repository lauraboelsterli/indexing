    "text": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece will not need a new international aid program after its third bailout ends in August, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici said in Athens on Thursday.\n“There won’t be a new program, there won’t be a fourth bailout or anything else,” Moscovici told reporters after meeting Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.\nAsked if measures to reduce Greece’s debt would be agreed by August, Moscovici said: “I think that in June there must be a comprehensive agreement as to how we will finally exit the program and how we can manage medium-term debt relief measures.”\nReporting by Angeliki Koutantou; Writing by Karolina Tagaris, editing by George Georgiopoulos\n ",
