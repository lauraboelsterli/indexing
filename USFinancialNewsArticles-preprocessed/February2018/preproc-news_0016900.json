With majority ownership and trusted senior management in place, we are now in a position to implement our platform and realize the full potential of this surgical center.”\nLuis Allende Ruiz, Crane Creek Administer, stated, “It is my honor to join Crane Creek and lead the implementation of First Choice’s delivery platform that will enable the facility to capture its full market opportunity. Given my extensive career in administration and senior level management positions at various hospitals, I was immediately interested and motivated to join the team once I learned more fully how the First Choice model is revolutionizing the delivery of healthcare in the industry.
