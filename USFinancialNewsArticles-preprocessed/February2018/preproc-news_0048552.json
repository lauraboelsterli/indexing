    "text": "1 COMMENTS Over the last six months, Walmart WMT -10.18% was richly rewarded by shareholders for its apparent success at competing head-to-head with Amazon.com . On Tuesday, it showed signs of falling behind.\nAfter three quarters of at least 50% e-commerce sales growth, Walmart reported that e-commerce revenue in the fourth quarter grew just 23% . Amazon’s revenue, including sales from Whole Foods, climbed 40% in the last period. Investors changed their minds on Walmart, sending its shares down nearly 10%.\nOn top of its slowdown in e-commerce growth, Walmart also missed analysts’ expectations, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.33 instead of $1.37. Besides that, the numbers were good. Revenue came in at $136.3 billion, ahead of estimates of $134.9 billion. U.S. same-store sales still increased 2.6%, and total sales climbed 4.1% from the same period a year earlier.\nThe drop confirmed fears that the company’s initial e-commerce burst, after its 2016 acquisition of Jet.com, has faded. Yet, as Greg Melich, a retail analyst at MoffettNathanson, points out, whether Walmart’s e-commerce sales grow 20% or 40%, online sales still only account for about 4% of the company’s annual revenue.\nWalmart, which says it expects e-commerce sales to grow 40% in the coming year, surprised investors by saying it has cut spending for its new sites, like Jet.com, Modcloth.com and Bonobos.com. Instead, it plans to focus on bringing customers to Walmart.com. That investment is being funded partly by store closures and job cuts , as the retailer shifts from store capacity to distribution capacity.\nThat makes sense. No matter how successful those brands are, Walmart will struggle against Amazon unless it can boost e-commerce sales at its giant, flagship brand. Mr. Melich argues that Amazon could grow from 5% to 10% of U.S. retail in the next five years, and Walmart needs to make sure that growth comes at the expense of other retailers.\nLast year, Walmart won praise for making smart investments in e-commerce. Nothing has changed, except that investors who had unrealistic expectations have turned negative. Walmart has a bright future in e-commerce, but given its huge size, investors need to temper their growth expectations.\nThe retail industry is undergoing another major shift -- to e-commerce.
