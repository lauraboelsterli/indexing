This acquisition adds premium content capabilities, including licensing, processing and delivery, for the benefit of customers and end users worldwide, positioning the company at the center of increased convergence across the content community and video distributors including major over-the-top (OTT) providers.\n“We are delighted to welcome Vubiquity and its customers to Amdocs and look forward to working together to deliver solutions as the media market continues to evolve at a rapid pace,” said Anthony Goonetilleke, Group President for Amdocs Technology. “With this acquisition, Amdocs stands ready to enable communication service providers and content producers to quickly expand and improve entertainment offerings to grow revenues while gaining increased consumer insights from content consumption.”\nConsistent with guidance provided on January 30, 2018, the impact of the acquisition on Amdocs’ diluted non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be neutral in fiscal year 2018, and accretive thereafter.
