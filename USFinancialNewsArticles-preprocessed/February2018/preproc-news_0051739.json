    "text": "Feb 23 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Louisiana on Friday revoked a permit for Energy Transfer Partnersâ€™ Bayou Bridge crude oil pipeline, halting work on a portion of the project following protests by local and environmental groups.\nThe decision by a U.S. District court judge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, underscores the growing clashes between energy pipeline operators expanding operations to accommodate new oil and gas flows from U.S. shale fields and environmentalists concerned about spills and other hazards.
