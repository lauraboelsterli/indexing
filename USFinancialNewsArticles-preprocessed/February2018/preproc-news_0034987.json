We believe that these steps were important in order to better capitalize on the improving product tanker market fundamentals. This improvement is being reflected in higher asset values and higher spot and forward time charter rates.”\nDeclaration of Dividend\nOn February 13, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share, payable on or about March 27, 2018 to all shareholders as of March 12, 2018 (the record date). As of February 13, 2018, there were 326,507,544 shares outstanding.\nDiluted Weighted Number of Shares\nDiluted earnings per share is determined using the if-converted method. Under this method, the Company assumes that the Convertible Notes (which were issued in June 2014) were converted into common shares at the beginning of each period and the interest and non-cash amortization expense associated with these notes of $5.6 million and $22.3 million during the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, were not incurred. Conversion is not assumed if the results of this calculation are anti-dilutive.\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's basic weighted average number of shares were 283,668,720 and 215,333,402, respectively. The weighted average number of shares, both diluted and under the if-converted method, were anti-dilutive for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 as the Company incurred net losses.\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's basic weighted average number of shares were 161,868,161 and 161,118,654, respectively. The weighted average number of shares, both diluted and under the if-converted method, were anti-dilutive for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 as the Company incurred net losses.\nAs of the date hereof, the Convertible Notes are not eligible for conversion.\nSummary of Recent and Fourth Quarter Significant Events\nBelow is a summary of the average daily TCE revenue (see Non-IFRS Measures section below) and duration for voyages fixed for the Company's vessels thus far in the first quarter of 2018 as of the date hereof (See 'Other operating data' table below for definition of daily TCE revenue):\nFor the LR2s in the pool: approximately $15,000 per day for 60% of the days. For the LR1s in the pool: approximately $9,500 per day for 60% of the days. For the MRs in the pool: approximately $14,750 per day for 60% of the days. For the ice-class 1A and 1B Handymaxes in the pool: approximately $12,000 per day for 60% of the days.\nBelow is a summary of the average daily TCE revenue earned on the Company's vessels during the fourth quarter of 2017:\nFor the LR2s in the pools: $15,465 per revenue day (includes the LR2s purchased from NPTI and operated in the Navig8 Alpha8 pool for a portion of the fourth quarter 2017). For the LR1s in the pools: $11,408 per revenue day (includes the LR1s purchased from NPTI and operated in the Navig8 LR8 pool for a portion of the fourth quarter 2017). For the MRs in the pool: $12,012 per revenue day. For the ice-class 1A and 1B Handymaxes in the pool: $10,140 per revenue day.\nRaised estimated net proceeds of $99.5 million in an underwritten public offering of 34.5 million shares of common stock (including 4.5 million shares of common stock that were issued when the underwriters fully exercised their option to purchase additional shares) at an offering price of $3.00 per share. Scorpio Services Holding Limited (a related party affiliate) purchased 6.7 million of these shares at the offering price. This offering, including the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option, closed in December 2017.\nAccepted delivery of STI Donald C Trauscht, STI Esles II and STI Jardins , three MR product tankers that were under construction, from Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co. Ltd. of South Korea (\"HMD\"). STI Donald C Trauscht was delivered in October 2017; STI Esles II and STI Jardins were both delivered in January 2018. As part of these deliveries, the Company drew down $20.7 million, $21.5 million and $21.5 million in October 2017, December 2017, and January 2018, respectively, from its 2017 Credit Facility to partially finance the purchase of these vessels.\nClosed on the previously announced finance lease arrangements for STI Onyx and STI Amber in October and November 2017, respectively, which raised $15.2 million in additional liquidity after the repayment of debt.\nPaid a quarterly cash dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.01 per share in December 2017.\nMerger with Navig8 Product Tankers Inc\nOn May 23, 2017, the Company entered into definitive agreements to acquire NPTI, including its fleet of 12 LR1 and 15 LR2 product tankers for 55 million common shares of the Company and the assumption of NPTI's debt. The merger was consummated as follows:\nOn May 30, 2017, the Company issued 50 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at an offering price of $4.00 per share for net proceeds of approximately $188.7 million, after deducting underwriters' discounts and offering expenses. The completion of this offering was a condition to closing the merger with NPTI.\nOn June 14, 2017, the Company acquired certain of NPTI’s subsidiaries that own four LR1 tankers for an aggregate acquisition price of $156.0 million, consisting of $42.2 million of cash and $113.8 million of assumed indebtedness (including accrued interest). The cash portion of the acquisition price (after considering cash flows from operations) formed part of the balance sheet of the combined company upon the closing of the merger on September 1, 2017.\nOn September 1, 2017, the Company acquired the remaining eight LR1 and 15 LR2 tankers upon the closing of the merger.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, certain vessels acquired from NPTI transitioned technical managers and/or transitioned from trading crude oil to clean products. The Company incurred approximately $3.1 million of additional costs as a result of these transitions and also incurred delays as the cargo tanks were cleaned. In addition, for a portion of the quarter, certain of these vessels operated outside of the Scorpio pools in the spot market at below market rates before regaining their vettings. The costs are discussed below under 'Explanation of Variances on the Fourth Quarter of 2017 Financial Results Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2016'.\nFinance Lease Agreements\nIn September 2017, the Company entered into finance lease agreements for five 2012 built MR product tankers ( STI Amber , STI Topaz , STI Ruby , STI Garnet and STI Onyx) with an unaffiliated third party for a sales price of $27.5 million per vessel. The financing for STI Topaz , STI Ruby and STI Garnet closed in September 2017. The financing for STI Onyx closed in October 2017 and the financing for STI Amber closed in November 2017. The Company's liquidity increased by $36.5 million in aggregate ($21.3 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $15.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017), after the repayment of outstanding debt, as a result of the closing of these transactions.\nEach agreement is for a fixed term of seven years at a bareboat charter rate of $9,025 per vessel per day, and the Company has three consecutive one-year options to extend each charter beyond the initial term. Furthermore, the Company has the option to purchase these vessels beginning at the end of the fifth year of the agreements through the end of the tenth year of the agreements. A deposit of $5.1 million per vessel was retained by the buyer and will either be applied to the purchase price of the vessel if a purchase option is exercised, or refunded to the Company at the expiration of the agreement (as applicable).\nAs a result of these transactions, the Company repaid the outstanding debt balance of (i) $44.6 million in aggregate for three vessels on its 2016 Credit Facility in September 2017, (ii) $13.8 million on its HSH Credit Facility for one vessel in October 2017 and (iii) $14.9 million on its 2016 Credit Facility for one vessel in November 2017. These agreements are being accounted for as financing transactions.\nTime Charter-in Update\nIn February 2018, the Company entered into a new time charter-in agreement on a 2013 built, LR2 product tanker for six months at $14,300 per day. The Company has an option to extend the charter for an additional six months at $15,310 per day. This vessel is expected to be delivered before the end of March 2018.\nIn January 2018, the Company entered into a new time charter-in agreement on a 2012 built, MR product tanker for one year at $14,000 per day. The Company has an option to extend the charter for an additional year at $14,400 per day. This vessel is expected to be delivered before the end of March 2018.\nIn November 2017, the Company exercised the option to extend the time charter on a 2013 built, MR product tanker for an additional six months at $13,250 per day effective December 2017. The Company also has an option to extend the charter for an additional year at $14,500 per day.\nIn November 2017, the Company exercised the option to extend the charter on a 2015 built, LR2 product tanker that is currently time chartered-in for an additional six months at $15,750 per day effective January 2018.\nIn November 2017, the Company entered into a new time charter-in agreement on a 2013 built, MR product tanker that was previously time chartered-in by the Company for one year at $13,950 per day effective January 2018. The Company has an option to extend the charter for an additional year at $15,750 per day.\n$250 Million Securities Repurchase Program\nIn May 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a Securities Repurchase Program to purchase up to an aggregate of $250 million of the Company's securities which, in addition to its common shares, currently consist of its (i) Convertible Notes, which were issued in June 2014, (ii) Unsecured Senior Notes Due 2020 (NYSE: SBNA), which were issued in May 2014 and (iii) Unsecured Senior Notes Due 2019 (NYSE: SBBC), which were issued in March 2017.\nIn April 2017, the Company acquired an aggregate of 250,419 of its Unsecured Senior Notes due 2017 for aggregate consideration of $6.3 million, which was the result of the cash tender offer of such notes. The remaining notes matured in October 2017 and were repaid in full.\nAs of the date hereof, the Company has the authority to purchase up to an additional $147.1 million of its securities under its Securities Repurchase Program. The Company expects to repurchase its securities in the open market, at times and prices that are considered to be appropriate by the Company, but is not obligated under the terms of the Securities Repurchase Program to repurchase any of its securities.\nConference Call\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call on February 14, 2018 at 9:00 AM Eastern Standard Time and 3:00 PM Central European Time.

These vessels were offhire for an aggregate of 102 days and the aggregate drydock cost was $6.4 million.\nThe Company has five MRs that are scheduled for drydock throughout 2018 and estimates that these vessels will be offhire for an aggregate of 100 days with estimated aggregate drydock costs of approximately $4.0 million.\nDebt\nSet forth below is a summary of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness as of the dates presented:\nIn millions of U.S. dollars Outstanding\nas of\nSeptember 30, 2017 Drawdowns\nand\n(repayments), net Outstanding\nas of\nDecember 31, 2017 Drawdowns\nand\n(repayments), net Outstanding\nas of\nFebruary 13, 2018 K-Sure Credit Facility (1) $ 283.5 $ (43.5 ) $ 240.0 $ — $ 240.0 KEXIM Credit Facility 333.0 — 333.0 (4.3 ) 328.7 Credit Suisse Credit Facility 53.5 — 53.5 — 53.5 ABN AMRO Credit Facility 115.5 (2.2 ) 113.3 (1.7 ) 111.6 ING Credit Facility 109.9 — 109.9 — 109.9 BNP Paribas Credit Facility (1) 31.0 11.6 42.6 — 42.6 Scotiabank Credit Facility 28.8 — 28.8 — 28.8 NIBC Credit Facility 34.7 — 34.7 — 34.7 2016 Credit Facility (2) 216.2 (20.2 ) 196.0 — 196.0 HSH Nordbank Credit Facility (3) 29.7 (14.3 ) 15.4 (0.4 ) 15.0 2017 Credit Facility (4) 101.8 40.0 141.8 20.3 162.1 DVB 2017 Credit Facility 79.9 (1.5 ) 78.4 (1.5 ) 76.9 Credit Agricole Credit Facility 110.0 (2.1 ) 107.9 — 107.9 ABN AMRO/K-Sure Credit Facility 54.3 (0.9 ) 53.4 — 53.4 Citi/K-Sure Credit Facility 114.1 (2.0 ) 112.1 — 112.1 Ocean Yield Sale and Leaseback 173.3 (2.7 ) 170.6 (0.9 ) 169.7 CMBFL Sale and Leaseback 68.0 (1.1 ) 66.9 — 66.9 BCFL Sale and Leaseback (LR2s) 109.9 (1.8 ) 108.1 (0.6 ) 107.5 CSSC Sale and Leaseback 268.1 (4.3 ) 263.8 (1.4 ) 262.4 BCFL Sale and Leaseback (MRs) (5) 66.6 42.6 109.2 (0.9 ) 108.3 2020 senior unsecured notes 53.8 — 53.8 — 53.8 2017 senior unsecured notes (6) 45.5 (45.5 ) — — — 2019 senior unsecured notes 57.5 — 57.5 — 57.5 Convertible Notes 348.5 — 348.5 — 348.5 $ 2,887.1 $ (47.9 ) $ 2,839.2 $ 8.6 $ 2,847.8 In December 2017, the Company refinanced the amounts borrowed relating to STI Soho under its K-Sure Credit Facility by repaying $13.3 million on the K-Sure Credit Facility and drawing $13.2 million on the BNP Paribas Credit Facility. The BNP Paribas Credit Facility was amended and restated to upsize its availability for purposes of this refinancing. The upsized portion of the credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.30%, and the remaining terms and conditions, including financial covenants, are similar to the facility that was in place prior to the refinancing. The Company wrote off $0.5 million of deferred financing fees during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of this transaction.\nIn November 2017, the Company repaid $14.9 million on its 2016 Credit Facility as a result of the closing of the previously announced finance lease for STI Amber. The Company wrote off $0.2 million of deferred financing fees during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of this transaction.\nIn October 2017, the Company repaid $13.8 million on its HSH Credit Facility as a result of the closing of the previously announced finance lease for STI Onyx. The Company wrote off $0.2 million of deferred financing fees during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of this transaction.\nThe Company drew down $20.7 million, $21.5 million and $21.5 million from its 2017 Credit Facility in October 2017, December 2017 and January 2018, respectively, to partially finance the purchases of STI Donald C Trauscht, STI Esles II and STI Jardins , respectively.\nIn September 2017, the Company entered into finance lease agreements with BCFL for five 2012 built MR product tankers ( STI Amber , STI Topaz , STI Ruby , STI Garnet and STI Onyx) for a sales price of $27.5 million per vessel. The financing for three of the vessels closed in September 2017. The financing for one of the vessels closed in October 2017, and the financing for the remaining vessel closed in November 2017. Each agreement is for a fixed term of seven years at a bareboat rate of $9,025 per vessel per day, and the Company has three consecutive one year options to extend each charter beyond the initial term. The Company also has the option to purchase these vessels beginning at the end of the fifth year of each agreement through the end of the tenth year of each agreement. A deposit of $5.1 million per vessel was retained by the buyer and will either be applied to the purchase price of the vessel if a purchase option is exercised, or refunded to the Company at the expiration of the agreement (as applicable). These agreements are being accounted for as financing transactions.\nIn October 2017, the Company's Unsecured Senior Notes due 2017 matured and were repaid in full.\nSet forth below are the expected, estimated future principal repayments on the Company's outstanding indebtedness which includes amounts due under sale and finance leaseback arrangements:\nIn millions of U.S.\ndollars Q1 2018 - principal payments made to date $ 12.9 Q1 2018 - remaining principal payments 33.8 Q2 2018 33.2 Q3 2018 51.1 Q4 2018 39.0 Q1 2019 63.6 Q2 2019 123.2 Q3 2019 411.9 Q4 2019 38.7 2020 and thereafter 2,053.2 $ 2,860.6\nNewbuilding Program\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had two MR product tankers under construction with HMD. Both of these vessels, STI Esles II and STI Jardins, were delivered in January 2018. The Company refers to these vessels as its Newbuilding Program, which concluded upon the delivery of STI Jardins .\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made installment payments of $54.1 million relating to vessels under its Newbuilding Program, which included the delivery of STI Donald C Trauscht in October 2017 and the final installment for STI Esles II , which was paid in December 2017 in advance of its delivery in January 2018.\nDuring January 2018, the Company paid $23.5 million as the final installment for the delivery of STI Jardins .\nAs part of these deliveries, the Company drew down $20.7 million, $21.5 million and $21.5 million in October 2017, December 2017 and January 2018, respectively, from its 2017 Credit Facility to partially finance the purchase of these vessels.\nExplanation of Variances on the Fourth Quarter of 2017 Financial Results Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2016\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net loss of $41.5 million compared to a net loss of $29.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The following were the significant changes between the two periods:\nTime charter equivalent, or TCE revenue, a Non-IFRS measure, is vessel revenues less voyage expenses (including bunkers and port charges). TCE revenue is included herein because it is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance irrespective of changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters, and pool charters), and it provides useful information to investors and management. The following table depicts TCE revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nFor the three months ended December 31, In thousands of U.S. dollars 2017 2016 Vessel revenue $ 148,394 $ 106,068 Voyage expenses (3,013 ) (420 ) TCE revenue $ 145,381 $ 105,648 TCE revenue increased $39.7 million to $145.4 million from $105.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase was driven by the growth of the Company's fleet to an average of 125.5 operating vessels during the three months ended December 31, 2017 from an average of 92.7 operating vessels during the three months ended December 31, 2016. This growth was the result of the merger with NPTI, which closed on September 1, 2017, and the delivery of eight vessels under our Newbuilding Program throughout 2017. TCE revenue per day remained consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, which reflects unfavorable market conditions that have been driven by an unfavorable supply and demand imbalance that began in 2016 and has persisted throughout 2017.\nVessel operating costs increased $27.9 million to $74.8 million from $46.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase was the result of an increase in the average number of owned and bareboat chartered-in vessels to 116.7 vessels from 77.0 vessels for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This fleet growth was primarily the result of the merger with NPTI, which closed on September 1, 2017 in addition to the delivery of eight vessels under the Company's Newbuilding Program throughout 2017. Additionally, the Company incurred approximately $1.2 million of take over costs for 10 vessels acquired from NPTI that transitioned technical management during the fourth quarter. These costs include additional crew severance and repatriation costs along with the costs for new spares, stores and other supplies but exclude termination fees of $0.4 million which were charged by the various technical managers and have been recorded as Merger transaction related costs, discussed below.\nVoyage expenses increased $2.6 million to $3.0 million from $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase was primarily the result of certain vessels acquired from NPTI that traded in the spot market during the fourth quarter of 2017 as these vessels transitioned technical managers or transitioned from trading crude oil to clean products. The vessels that transitioned from trading crude oil to clean products incurred approximately $0.7 million of bunker costs and port charges while their tanks were cleaned over an aggregate period of 72 days. These vessels also incurred an additional $0.7 million of directly attributable tank cleaning costs (such as labor and materials), which have been recorded as Merger transaction related costs, discussed below.\nCharterhire expense decreased $5.6 million to $18.0 million from $23.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was driven by lower average daily base rates on the Company's time chartered-in fleet to an average of $13,681 per vessel per day from an average of $16,262 per vessel per day for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company's time and bareboat chartered-in fleet increased to an average of 18.8 vessels, (8.8 time chartered-in vessels and 10.0 bareboat chartered-in vessels) from an average of 15.7 time chartered-in vessels for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. There were no bareboat chartered-in vessels during the three months ended December 31, 2016. The average daily base rate for the Company's bareboat chartered-in fleet was $7,362 per vessel per day for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation expense increased $12.8 million to $43.5 million from $30.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by the delivery of two LR2 and six MR tankers under the Company's Newbuilding Program during the year ended December 31, 2017, the delivery of the four LR1 vessels acquired from NPTI in June 2017, and the delivery of eight LR1 and 15 LR2 vessels acquired from NPTI in September 2017. These deliveries were offset by the sales of five MR vessels during 2017.\nMerger transaction related costs of $1.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 represent (i) $0.4 million of termination fees incurred to transition the technical management of certain vessels acquired from NPTI, (ii) approximately $0.7 million of costs directly attributable to the cleaning of the cargo tanks of certain vessels acquired from NPTI in order to transition these vessels from trading crude oil to trading clean products (includes directly attributable labor and materials costs but excludes bunker and port costs) and (iii) legal and advisory costs incurred as part of the merger with NPTI.\nFinancial expenses increased $17.0 million to $38.6 million from $21.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Financial expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2017 reflect a $1.0 million write-off of deferred financing fees that was recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2017. There were no write-offs of deferred financing fees during the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in financial expenses, after removing the effect of deferred financing fee write-offs, was primarily a result of (i) increased interest expense incurred as a result of the assumption of $806.4 million of indebtedness upon the closing of the merger with NPTI on September 1, 2017 and (ii) increases in LIBOR rates when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nScorpio Tankers Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income or Loss (unaudited) For the three months ended\nDecember 31, For the year ended\nDecember 31, In thousands of U.S. dollars except per share and share data 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue Vessel revenue $ 148,394 $ 106,068 $ 512,732 $ 522,747 Operating expenses Vessel operating costs (74,824 ) (46,933 ) (231,227 ) (187,120 ) Voyage expenses (3,013 ) (420 ) (7,733 ) (1,578 ) Charterhire (17,959 ) (23,521 ) (75,750 ) (78,862 ) Depreciation (43,535 ) (30,686 ) (141,418 ) (121,461 ) General and administrative expenses (11,370 ) (12,306 ) (47,511 ) (54,899 ) Loss on sales of vessels — — (23,345 ) (2,078 ) Merger transaction related costs (1,299 ) — (36,114 ) — Bargain purchase gain — — 5,417 — Total operating expenses (152,000 ) (113,866 ) (557,681 ) (445,998 ) Operating (loss) / income (3,606 ) (7,798 ) (44,949 ) 76,749 Other (expense) and income, net Financial expenses (38,619 ) (21,667 ) (116,240 ) (104,048 ) Realized loss on derivative financial instruments — — (116 ) — Unrealized (loss) / gain on derivative financial instruments — (229 ) — 1,371 Financial income 384 50 1,538 1,213 Other expenses, net 332 (22 ) 1,527 (188 ) Total other expense, net (37,903 ) (21,868 ) (113,291 ) (101,652 ) Net loss $ (41,509 ) $ (29,666 ) $ (158,240 ) $ (24,903 ) Loss per share Basic $ (0.15 ) $ (0.18 ) $ (0.73 ) $ (0.15 ) Diluted $ (0.15 ) $ (0.18 ) $ (0.73 ) (0.15 ) Basic weighted average shares outstanding 283,668,720 161,868,161 215,333,402 161,118,654 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (1) 283,668,720 161,868,161 215,333,402 161,118,654 (1) The dilutive effect of (i) unvested shares of restricted stock and (ii) the potentially dilutive securities relating to the Company's Convertible Notes were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

(2 ) Freight rates are commonly measured in the shipping industry in terms of time charter equivalent per day (or TCE per day), which is calculated by subtracting voyage expenses, including bunkers and port charges, from vessel revenue and dividing the net amount (time charter equivalent revenues) by the number of revenue days in the period. Revenue days are the number of days the vessel is owned or chartered-in less the number of days the vessel is off-hire for drydock and repairs. (3 ) Vessel operating costs per day represent vessel operating costs divided by the number of operating days during the period. Operating days are the total number of available days in a period with respect to the owned or bareboat chartered-in vessels, before deducting available days due to off-hire days and days in drydock. Operating days is a measurement that is only applicable to our owned, finance leased or bareboat chartered-in vessels, not our time chartered-in vessels.\nFleet list as of February 13, 2018 Vessel

Additional information about the Company is available at the Company's website www.scorpiotankers.com , which is not a part of this press release.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nReconciliation of IFRS Financial Information to Non-IFRS Financial Information\nThis press release describes time charter equivalent revenue, or TCE revenue, adjusted net income or loss and adjusted EBITDA, which are not measures prepared in accordance with IFRS (i.e. \"Non-IFRS\" measures). The Non-IFRS measures are presented in this press release as we believe that they provide investors and other users of our financial statements, such as our lenders, with a means of evaluating and understanding how the Company's management evaluates the Company's operating performance. These Non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nThe Company believes that the presentation of time charter equivalent revenue, adjusted net income or loss with adjusted earnings or loss per share, basic and diluted, and adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors or other users of our financial statements, such as our lenders, because they facilitate the comparability and the evaluation of companies in the Company’s industry. In addition, the Company believes that time charter equivalent revenue, adjusted net income or loss with adjusted earnings or loss per share, basic and diluted, and adjusted EBITDA are useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to that of other companies in the Company’s industry. The Company’s definitions of time charter equivalent revenue, adjusted net income or loss with the adjusted earnings or loss per share, basic and diluted, and adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as reported by other companies in the shipping industry or other industries.\nTime charter equivalent revenue is reconciled above in the section entitled 'Explanation of Variances on the Fourth Quarter of 2017 Financial Results Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2016'.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Loss\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 Per share Per share In thousands of U.S. dollars except per share data Amount basic diluted Net loss $ (41,509 ) $ (0.15 ) $ (0.15 ) Adjustments: Deferred financing fees write-off 970 0.00 0.00 Merger transaction related costs 1,299 0.00 0.00 Adjusted net loss $ (39,240 ) $ (0.14 ) (1 ) $ (0.14 )\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2016 Per share Per share In thousands of U.S. dollars except per share data Amount basic diluted Net loss $ (29,666 ) $ (0.18 ) $ (0.18 ) Adjustment: Unrealized loss on derivative financial instruments 229 — — Adjusted net loss $ (29,437 ) $ (0.18 ) $ (0.18 )\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 Per share Per share In thousands of U.S. dollars except per share data Amount basic diluted Net loss $ (158,240 ) $ (0.73 ) $ (0.73 ) Adjustments: Deferred financing fees write-off 2,467 0.01 0.01 Merger transaction related costs 36,114 0.17 0.17 Bargain purchase gain (5,417 ) (0.03 ) (0.03 ) Loss on sales of vessels 23,345 0.11 0.11 Adjusted net loss $ (101,731 ) $ (0.47 ) $ (0.47 )\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 Per share Per share In thousands of U.S. dollars except per share data Amount basic diluted Net loss $ (24,903 ) $ (0.15 ) $ (0.15 ) Adjustments: Deferred financing fees write-off 14,479 0.09 0.09 Unrealized gain on derivative financial instruments (1,371 ) (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Gain on repurchase of Convertible Notes (994 ) (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Loss on sales of vessels 2,078 0.01 0.01 Adjusted net loss $ (10,711 ) $ (0.07 ) $ (0.07 ) (1) Summation differences due to rounding\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nFor the three months ended\nDecember 31, For the year ended\nDecember 31, In thousands of U.S. dollars 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net loss $ (41,509 ) $ (29,666 ) $ (158,240 ) $ (24,903 ) Financial expenses 38,619 21,667 116,240 104,048 Unrealized loss / (gain) on derivative financial instruments — 229 — (1,371 ) Financial income (384 ) (50 ) (1,538 ) (219 ) Depreciation 43,535 30,686 141,418 121,461 Merger transaction related costs 1,299 — 36,114 — Bargain purchase gain — — (5,417 ) — Amortization of restricted stock 4,904 7,131 22,385 30,207 Loss on sales of vessels — — 23,345 2,078 Gain on repurchase of Convertible Notes (recorded within Financial income) — — — (994 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 46,464 $ 29,997 $ 174,307 $ 230,307 Forward-Looking Statements\nMatters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. The Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. The words \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intends,\" \"estimate,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"pending\" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, our management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections. We undertake no obligation, and specifically decline any obligation, except as required by law, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nIn addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of our operations, risks relating to the integration of the operations of Navig8 Product Tankers Inc. (“NPTI”) and the possibility that the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the acquisition of NPTI will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframe, the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the merger with NPTI and the related transactions, the failure of counterparties to fully perform their contracts with us, the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values, changes in demand for tanker vessel capacity, changes in our operating expenses, including bunker prices, drydocking and insurance costs, the market for our vessels, availability of financing and refinancing, charter counterparty performance, ability to obtain financing and comply with covenants in such financing arrangements, changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents or political events, vessels breakdowns and instances of off-hires, and other factors. Please see Scorpio Tankers’ filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a more complete discussion of certain of these and other risks and uncertainties.\nScorpio Tankers Inc.\n212-542-1616\nSource: Scorpio Tankers Inc.",
