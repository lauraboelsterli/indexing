    "text": "Florida eye doctor linked to Sen. Bob Menendez gets 17 years for Medicare fraud A politically prominent Florida eye doctor is sentenced to 17 years in prison for stealing $73 millio n. Dr. Salomon Melgen is sentenced for 67 crimes, including health-care fraud and falsifying patients' records. In a separate case, since dropped, Melgen was accused of bribing Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. Published 4 Hours Ago The Associated Press Mark Elias | Bloomberg | Getty Images In this 2013 file photo, Dr. Salomon Melgen examines a patient's eyes at his office in Port St. Lucie, Florida. \nA federal judge on Thursday sentenced a Florida eye doctor linked to Sen. Bob Menendez to 17 years in prison for stealing $73 million in one of history's largest Medicare frauds. \nU.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra sentenced Dr. Salomon Melgen for 67 crimes, including health-care fraud, submitting false claims and falsifying records in patients' files. He could have given Melgen a life sentence. \nIn a separate case, Melgen was accused of bribing Menendez, D-N.J. Those charges were recently dropped after their New Jersey trial ended with a hung jury. Federal prosecutors in that case abandoned efforts to retry Menendez and Melgen . \nIn addition to his prison sentence in the Medicare fraud case, Melgen was ordered to pay $42.6 million in restitution. \nProsecutors said Melgen was the nation's highest-paid Medicare provider for five-straight years. Evidence showed his business was built on fraud. Melgen convinced many elderly patients to undergo often painful tests and treatments they didn't need. ",
