    "text": "Yet another report indicates that Facebook is working on its own smart speaker devices, akin to Amazon's Alexa. \nOn Wednesday, DigiTimes reported that Facebook will launch two speakers with 15-inch LG touchscreens in July 2018 at the latest, part of the company's mission to \"connect the world.\" \nDigiTimes has a spotty record on reporting product launches, and Facebook was not immediately available to comment on the report to CNBC. \nBut the DigiTimes report comes after other similar reports. In August, Bloomberg said that Facebook is working on at least two separate speaker devices with Apple \"Siri-style\" voice assistants, and at least one has a laptop-like screen that could be released as soon as the spring. Business Insider also reported that Facebook was working on a product called Aloha .\nWe do know that Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook's CEO, has a keen interest in smart homes. Zuckerberg created a smart personal assistant, Jarvis, and has a fully rigged automation system in his home. \nFacebook is also expanding its ambitions in music and video on a grander scale. Facebook agreed to a music deal with Sony earlier this year , and has talked to media buyers about expanding its \"Watch\" video tab to compete with YouTube .\nFor more on the report, see the latest in Digitimes.",
