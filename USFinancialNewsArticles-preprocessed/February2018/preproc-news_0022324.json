The revenue for these support contracts is deferred and typically recognized over a one-year period, so Infinera's GAAP revenue for the one-year period after the acquisition will not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value. The non-GAAP adjustment eliminates the effect of the deferred revenue write-down. Management believes these adjustments to the revenue from these support contracts are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect revenue trends of Infinera's business.\n(2) Stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation effective January 1, 2006. The following table summarizes the effects of non-cash stock-based compensation related to employees and non-employees (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 30,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Cost of revenue $ 728 $ 779 $ 791 $ 3,065 $ 2,966 Research and development 3,841 4,040 4,011 15,845 13,732 Sales and marketing 2,264 3,025 3,037 11,288 11,043 General and administration 2,345 3,039 2,445 10,776 9,295 9,178 10,883 10,284 40,974 37,036 Cost of revenue - amortization from balance sheet* 1,118 1,284 1,058 4,746 3,497 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 10,296 $ 12,167 $ 11,342 $ 45,720 $ 40,533\n* Stock-based compensation expense deferred to inventory and deferred inventory costs in prior periods and recognized in the current period.\n(3) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of developed technology, trade names, and customer relationships acquired in connection with the Transmode acquisition. U.S. GAAP accounting requires that acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value and amortized over their useful lives. As this amortization is non-cash, Infinera has excluded it from its non-GAAP operating expenses, gross margin and net income measures. Management believes the amortization of acquired intangible assets is not indicative of ongoing operating performance and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.\n(4) Acquisition-related costs associated with the Transmode acquisition include legal, financial, employee retention costs and other professional fees incurred in connection with the transaction, including squeeze-out proceedings. These amounts have been adjusted in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because management believes that these expenses are non-recurring, not indicative of ongoing operating performance and their exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.\n(5) Restructuring and other costs are related to Infinera's plan to restructure its worldwide operations, which was announced during the fourth quarter of 2017. These costs consist of $13.6 million of inventory write-downs as a result of Infinera's product rationalization efforts, $9.4 million of severance and related costs, $7.3 million of facilities-related costs and $4.9 million of manufacturing and test asset impairments. Management has excluded the impact of these charges in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results as they are non-recurring in nature and its exclusion provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.\n(6) Intangible asset impairments are associated with previously acquired intangibles and acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”). The impairment of previously acquired intangibles was the result of management determining that the carrying value will not be recoverable. Acquired IPR&D impairment is associated with intangibles acquired with the Transmode acquisition, which Infinera does not anticipate utilizing in future products. Management has excluded the impact of these charges in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring and management believes that these expenses are not indicative of ongoing operating performance.\n(7) Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes, Infinera is required to amortize as debt discount an amount equal to the fair value of the conversion option that was recorded in equity as interest expense on its $150 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.75% convertible debt issuance in May 2013 over the term of the notes. Interest expense has been excluded from Infinera's non-GAAP results because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance and provides a better indication of Infinera's underlying business performance.\n(8) The gain on sale of a cost-method investment has been excluded in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring and management believes that this gain is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.\n(9) The impairment of cost-method investment has been excluded in arriving at Infinera's non-GAAP results because it is non-recurring and management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.\n(10) The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax is due to the net tax effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the IPR&D impairment related to the Transmode acquisition.\nInfinera Corporation\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except par values)\n(Unaudited) December 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 116,345 $ 162,641 Short-term investments 147,596 141,697 Short-term restricted cash 544 8,490 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $892 in 2017 and $772 in 2016 126,152 150,370 Inventory 214,704 232,955 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 42,596 34,270 Total current assets 647,937 730,423 Property, plant and equipment, net 135,942 124,800 Intangible assets 92,188 108,475 Goodwill 195,615 176,760 Long-term investments 31,019 40,779 Cost-method investment 5,110 7,000 Long-term restricted cash 4,597 6,449 Other non-current assets 5,262 3,897 Total assets $ 1,117,670 $ 1,198,583 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 58,124 $ 62,486 Accrued expenses 39,782 31,580 Accrued compensation and related benefits 45,751 46,637 Short-term debt, net 144,928 — Accrued warranty 13,670 16,930 Deferred revenue 72,421 58,900 Total current liabilities 374,676 216,533 Long-term debt, net — 133,586 Accrued warranty, non-current 17,239 23,412 Deferred revenue, non-current 22,502 19,362 Deferred tax liability 21,609 25,327 Other long-term liabilities 16,279 18,035 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Preferred stock, $0.001 par value Authorized shares -
