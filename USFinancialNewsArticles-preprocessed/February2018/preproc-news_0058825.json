    "text": "(Reuters) - Mylan NV ( MYL.O ) said on Monday non-executive director Wendy Cameron, who had been under investor pressure to step down, will retire.\nCameron used to head Mylan’s compensation committee when director Robert Coury came under fire for his near $100 million pay package last year, at a time of growing backlash from U.S. consumers over the price of the company’s life-saving allergy treatment EpiPen.\nMore than a third of the investors voting at the generic drugmaker’s annual meeting last year cast votes against Coury, while over half voted against Cameron.\nThe company said it had nominated Pauline van der Meer Mohr for election to its board.\nReporting by Manas Mishra In Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza\n ",
