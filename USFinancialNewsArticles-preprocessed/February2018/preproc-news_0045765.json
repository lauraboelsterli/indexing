    "text": "BALTIMORE, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Miles & Stockbridge announced today that the law firm's principals have elected Nancy W. Greene as chairman and Joseph W. Hovermill as president and chief executive officer of the firm, succeeding John B. Frisch. Greene becomes the first woman to lead the 250-lawyer firm in its 86-year history. Greene and Hovermill will be joined by Christopher R. Johnson , who has been appointed by the board to serve as executive vice president and to join Greene and Hovermill as the third member of a newly created executive committee.\nA board member since 2017, Greene recently served as co-leader of the firm's Real Estate and Transactional Finance Practice Group. Hovermill, a board member since 2011 and senior member of the firm's Products Liability and Mass Torts Practice Group, has served as president and chief operating officer since 2015. Johnson has served on the board since 2014 and recently served as co-leader of the firm's Corporate & Securities Practice Group.\n\"We are genuinely honored to have been elected chairman and chief executive officer of Miles & Stockbridge by our fellow principals last night at the firm's Annual Meeting,\" said Greene and Hovermill in a memo to the firm today.\n\"John Frisch has been a remarkable values-based leader and mentor,\" said Greene. \"As he leaves his chairman post, Miles & Stockbridge is incredibly strong. Joe and I look forward to continuing our firm's efforts to place clients and the value we deliver at the center of everything we do.\"\n\"We both joined the firm in the '90s, as our first jobs in private practice, and have built our legal careers, leadership roles and enduring relationships here,\" said Hovermill. \"And, now, we take on wholeheartedly the opportunities and challenges of leading a firm we know through and through, into the next decade.\"\nIn planning for this leadership transition, the firm took a close look at the structure, roles and responsibilities of an optimal senior leadership team. The result is the formation of an executive committee. This team structure allows Greene, Hovermill and Johnson to maintain active legal practices while leading the firm. They begin serving in their new roles immediately.\nGreene and Hovermill will each play leading roles in managing the firm's operations. In her capacity as firm chairman, Greene will be responsible for evaluating and leading the executive committee's development of the firm's vision and core strategies. Her focus on the firm's culture will include driving the firm's well-regarded diversity and inclusion efforts to an even higher level. She will also be charged with maintaining and enhancing the firm's civic profile in the communities the firm calls home.\nAs chief executive officer, Hovermill will bring his disciplined leadership to the execution of the firm's strategic plan and key priorities. He will also be responsible for enhancing the firm's profile in the legal community.\nAs executive vice president, Johnson will focus on strategic growth across the firm with a near-term priority of adding lawyers in the firm's Tysons Corner and Washington, D.C. offices.\n\"This is an exciting moment for our firm,\" said Frisch, who served as Miles & Stockbridge's chairman and chief executive officer for the past 15 years. \"Nancy joins a select group of women, I believe fewer than 15 across the Am Law 200, who serve as firm chairs. She is an outstanding lawyer and extraordinary leader who has played an integral role in developing and carrying out our firm's vision and strategic plan.\n\"In recognition of the leadership Joe has provided as president and chief operating officer across our operations, it is fitting that his title is now chief executive officer,\" continued Frisch. \"With a sharp bias toward action, Joe has also played a key role in the development and execution of our strategic plan, especially focusing on our efforts to achieve operational excellence. He will now bring this energy and discipline to the execution of other aspects of our firm plan.\"\nFrisch will continue to work at Miles & Stockbridge supporting the firm's efforts in a variety of areas, including diversity and inclusion, and maintaining the firm's community and civic profile and commitment.\nAbout Nancy Greene\nNancy W.
