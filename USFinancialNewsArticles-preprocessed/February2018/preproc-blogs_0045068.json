    "text": "CNBC.com Bloomberg Getty Images Roger Lynch, speaks during an event at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, when he was Sling's CEO in January 2016. Lynch has been appointed as Pandora's new CEO. \nPandora shares jumped more than 9 percent after reporting significant growth in subscription revenue. \nThe music streaming company reported mixed fourth quarter financial results on Wednesday, beating analyst expectations for revenue, but missing on earnings by about 14 cents. \nThe company reported a 63 percent bump in subscription revenue, an important metric for the music streaming company, bringing the yearly total to $97.7 million. Pandora also tallied 5.48 million subscribers, a 25 percent increase from the previous year. \nPandora also announced intentions to invest $45 million into new growth initiatives, like ad-tech, non-music content, device integration and marketing technology, as it continues to build out its \"Premium Access\" on-demand services, to better compete with companies, like Spotify.
