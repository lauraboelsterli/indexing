    "text": "RICHARDSON, Texas, Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intrusion Inc. (OTCQB:INTZ), (“Intrusion”) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nIntrusion’s net income for the fourth quarter 2017 was $0.2 million, compared to a net loss of $0.3 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Net loss for the year 2017 was $30 thousand, compared to a net loss of $1.6 million for 2016. The fiscal year 2017 net loss of $30 thousand included $900 thousand other income reported in the third quarter 2017.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter 2017 was $2.1 million, compared to $1.4 million in the fourth quarter 2016. Revenue for the year 2017 was $6.9 million, compared to $6.1 million in 2016.\nGross profit margin was 58% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 64% of revenue in the fourth quarter 2016 and 56% of revenue in the third quarter 2017. For the year, the gross profit margin decreased to 59%, compared to 64% in 2016. Gross profit margin decreased in 2017 mainly due to increased levels of material and labor costs included in deliverables during 2017.\nIntrusion’s fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses were $1.0 million, compared to $1.2 million in the fourth quarter 2016. For the year 2017, operating expenses were $4.8 million, compared to $5.3 million in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Intrusion reported cash and cash equivalents of $0.2 million, a working capital deficiency of $0.8 million, and debt of $2.9 million. Comparably, as of December 31, 2016, Intrusion reported cash and cash equivalents of $0.1 million, working capital deficiency of $0.8 million and debt of $3.1 million.\n“We booked $9.8 million of orders in 2017, which included $4.4 million of orders in the fourth quarter. This compares to $4.8 million of orders in 2016. This significant build up in bookings of orders during 2017, especially in the fourth quarter, is the result of our increased sales efforts in the Trace Cop business segment. This focus will continue and we expect to see continued success with additional growth in revenue,” stated G. Ward Paxton, Chairman, President and CEO of Intrusion.\nIntrusion’s management will host its regularly scheduled quarterly conference call to discuss the Company’s financial and operational progress at 4:00 P.M., CST today.
