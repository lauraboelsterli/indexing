(Nasdaq:SRCL) today reported results for the fourth quarter and the full-year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also provided additional details on its Business Transformation, which is expected to deliver $850 million to $1 billion of cumulative Adjusted EBITDA* benefits over the next five years.\n“Stericycle has evolved significantly over the past 28 years, and today we are executing a company-wide, comprehensive strategy to position Stericycle for continued success well into the future,” said Charles A. Alutto, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our strategy focuses on building a best-in-class enterprise performance management (“EPM”) operating model and includes streamlining our portfolio, realigning our processes and organizational structure to drive efficiency, and implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. We believe that the implementation of our strategic plan, combined with the continued trend of customers outsourcing services to focus on their core businesses, will accelerate Stericycle’s growth and profitability across our markets and deliver greater value to our shareholders.”\nBUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND PILLARS OF SUCCESS\nStericycle today provided additional details regarding its Business Transformation, which the Company began executing during the fourth quarter of 2017, to improve long-term operational and financial performance. As part of the Business Transformation, Stericycle plans to build a best-in-class EPM operating model to enable the Company to operate more efficiently, provide an enhanced experience to customers, better capitalize on future growth opportunities, and establish greater controls and oversight to drive more consistent results. Additionally, a key component of the Business Transformation is the implementation of an ERP system, which will leverage standard processes throughout the organization to accelerate decision making, expedite acquisition integration, remediate compliance and control issues, and enable real-time analytics. For further information, see the accompanying Transformation Overview at http://investors.stericycle.com .\nKey initiatives of the Business Transformation include:\nPortfolio Rationalization: Executing on a comprehensive review of the Company’s global service lines to identify and pursue the divestiture of non-strategic assets. Operational Optimization: Standardizing route planning logistics, modernizing field operations, and driving network efficiency across facilities. Organizational Excellence and Efficiency: Redesigning the Company’s organizational structure to optimize resources and align around a global shared business services model. Commercial Excellence: Aligning our sales and service organizations around the customer, standardizing our customer relationship management processes, and expanding customer self-service options. Strategic Sourcing: Reducing spend through global procure-to-pay processes and leveraging organizational scale.\nTransformation initiatives, inclusive of the implementation of best-in-class systems, are expected to deliver Adjusted EBITDA between 2018 and 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 9%* and an Adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate of 6% to 10%*. Over this same period, the Company projects that it will generate a substantial amount of free cash flow, equivalent to a compound annual growth rate of 10% to 14%*. Stericycle expects to record approximately $275 to $300 million in adjusting items and capital expenditures associated with the Business Transformation over five years, with those investments delivering an anticipated internal rate of return greater than 85%.\nFOURTH-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR:\nRevenues of $887.8 million, a decrease of 2.1%\nGross profit of $344.0 million a decrease of 6.2%, and Adjusted gross profit of $345.1 million, a decrease of 7.5%\nEarnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.97, due primarily to the favorable impact of $1.52 from U.S. tax reform, offset by a $0.79 non-cash goodwill impairment charge in Latin America and $0.20 of Business Transformation related expenses.

Alutto, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We began execution of our Business Transformation with the reorganization of our global workforce and are now focused on implementing additional measures to drive efficiencies. By standardizing our global processes and consolidating our disparate business systems, we will better position the company for long-term growth and improved financial performance.”\nRevenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $887.8 million, a decrease of 2.1% from $906.4 million in the fourth quarter of last year.

Adjusted EPS was $1.00 for the current quarter and the same quarter last year. The current quarter is inclusive of $0.14 of non-cash fixed asset depreciation and write-off charges.

Ginnetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “We have made significant progress repaying our outstanding debt and continue to execute a disciplined capital deployment plan. In all, we believe the incremental benefits of the Business Transformation combined with our strong cash flow generation will provide the Company with numerous levers for additional value creation.”\nU.S. CORPORATE TAX REFORM COMMENTARY\nWith the newly approved U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $129.8 million as an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017. This provisional amount is based on a benefit of $167.7 million for the expected reversal of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, less a one-time transition tax of $24.3 million on remitted foreign earnings and profits and $13.6 million of expected foreign withholding taxes.\n“The benefit of recently-enacted U.S. tax reform legislation will provide additional cash flow that we intend to utilize in support of our capital allocation priorities,” said Ginnetti.\n* The Company is unable to forecast the comparable long-range U.S. GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and related unpredictability of non-recurring adjusted items exclusive of the Business Transformation investments referenced above.\nFINANCIAL OUTLOOK\nStericycle today provided financial guidance for the full-year 2018, as summarized in the following table.\n(In millions, except per share data) Revenues $3,480 - $3,630 Regulated Waste and Compliance Services $1,920 - $1,970 Secure Information Destruction Services $870 - $910 Communication and Related Services $355 - $385 Manufacturing and Industrial Services $335 - $365 Income from Operations $365 - $370 Adjusted EBITDA (a) $760 - $810 Interest Expense $95 - $100 Tax Rate 26.0% - 26.5% Depreciation $130 - $140 Intangible Amortization $120 - $130 Diluted Earnings Per Share $2.09 - $2.21 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share $4.45 - $4.85 Shares Outstanding 90.5 Net Cash from Operating Activities $510 - $560 Capital Expenditures $160 - $180 Free Cash Flow $330 - $400 (a) Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is Income from operations excluding specified items, inclusive of Depreciation and Intangible Amortization.\nThe Company’s guidance does not include amounts related to future acquisitions, divestitures or non-recurring litigation matters as the Company is not able to forecast these items without unreasonable effort.

This provides insight to how our diluted share count will be affected after these preferred shares are converted to common shares.\nThe impact of excluding the preferred stock dividend from Adjusted Diluted EPS is $0.10 and $0.11 for the fourth quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively.
