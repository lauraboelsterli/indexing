    "text": "ARLINGTON, Va., Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Arlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE: AI) (the \"Company\" or \"Arlington\") today reported net income available to common shareholders of $7.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted common share, income before income taxes available to common shareholders of $20.8 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share, and non-GAAP core operating income of $16.5 million, or $0.58 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. A reconciliation of non-GAAP core operating income to GAAP net income (loss) before income taxes appears at the end of this press release.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\n$0.25 per diluted common share of GAAP net income, including a $0.48 per diluted common share income tax provision $0.73 per diluted common share of GAAP pre-tax income $0.58 per diluted common share of non-GAAP core operating income $13.43 per common share of book value $13.40 per common share of tangible book value $0.55 per common share dividend\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\n$0.66 per diluted common share of GAAP net income, including a $1.52 per diluted common share income tax provision $2.18 per diluted common share of GAAP pre-tax income $2.26 per diluted common share of non-GAAP core operating income $2.275 per common share dividend\n\"Arlington produced strong results for both the fourth quarter and the year delivering a 20% economic return to shareholders in 2017, measured as the change in tangible book value per common share plus common share dividends, through an environment in which the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates 100 basis in twelve months,\" said J. Rock Tonkel, Jr., the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"The Company's earnings for the fourth quarter benefited from lower prepayment speeds leading to higher yields on agency mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") as well as lower net funding costs, demonstrating the benefit of the Company's substantial interest rate hedge position. As of year-end, the notional amount of the Company's interest rate swaps was 98% of its outstanding repurchase agreement financing. The maturities of the Company's interest rate swaps are well matched to the expected life of the Company's agency MBS funded with repurchase agreement financing, which mitigates the impact of rising interest rates on the Company's spread earnings. In addition, available agency MBS spread returns on new investments have improved since the start of the year, further muting the impact of rising interest rates on the Company's spread earnings. The Company continues to believe that its hedged agency MBS investment portfolio is well positioned to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to shareholders on a tax advantaged basis.\"\nOther Fourth Quarter Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's agency MBS investment portfolio totaled $5,351 million in fair value, consisting of $4,054 million of specified agency MBS and $1,297 million of net long to-be-announced (\"TBA\") agency MBS. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's $5,351 million agency MBS investment portfolio was comprised of the following:\n$255 million of 3.0% coupon 15-year agency MBS $2,082 million of 3.5% coupon 30-year agency MBS $2,804 million of 4.0% coupon 30-year agency MBS $210 million of 4.5% coupon 30-year agency MBS\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's $4,054 million specified agency MBS portfolio had a weighted average amortized cost basis of $105.60 and a weighted average market price of $104.89. The Company's fixed-rate agency MBS are comprised of securities backed by specified pools of mortgage loans selected for their lower propensity for prepayment. Weighted average pay-up premiums on the Company's agency MBS portfolio, which represent the estimated price premium of agency MBS backed by specified pools over a generic TBA agency MBS, were approximately six-tenths of a percentage point as of December 31, 2017, relatively unchanged from September 30, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's net long TBA agency MBS investment portfolio had a purchase price of $1,296 million and market value of $1,297 million, resulting in a net GAAP carrying fair value of $1 million. Under GAAP, the gross fair value of the agency MBS underlying the Company's TBA commitments is not recognized on the balance sheet as the Company accounts for its TBA commitments as derivative instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $3,667 million of repurchase agreements outstanding with a weighted average rate of 1.56% and remaining weighted average maturity of 13 days secured by an aggregate of $3,859 million of agency MBS at fair value.\nInterest income less interest expense on short-term secured financing on the Company's agency MBS portfolio was $16.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $16.0 million for the third quarter of 2017, including the amortization of the Company's net premium on its agency MBS of $8.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $8.8 million for the third quarter of 2017. The Company's weighted average yield on its agency MBS was 2.86% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2.80% for the third quarter of 2017, and the actual weighted-average constant prepayment rate (\"CPR\") for the Company's agency MBS was 9.55% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 10.29% for the third quarter of 2017. The Company's weighted average cost of repurchase agreement funding was 1.37% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 1.31% during the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of its cost of borrowing and the value of its agency MBS portfolio including interest rate swap agreements, U.S. Treasury note futures, put and call options on 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures, and options on agency MBS.\nUnder the terms of the Company's interest rate swap agreements, the Company pays semiannual interest payments based on a fixed rate and receives quarterly variable interest payments based upon the prevailing three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") on the date of reset. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $3,600 million in notional amount of interest rate swap agreements with a weighted average pay fixed rate of 1.67% and a remaining weighted average maturity of 5.1 years. The Company's weighted average net pay rate of its interest rate swap agreements was 0.28% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 0.47% during the third quarter of 2017.\nIn addition to interest rate swap agreements, the Company held $650 million in equivalent notional amount of short positions in 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures that were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2017 when the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate was 2.35% and held $21.6 million in equivalent notional amount of short positions in 5-year U.S. Treasury note futures that were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2017 when the 5-year U.S. Treasury rate was 2.06%.\nThe Company reported TBA dollar roll income of $7.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $6.4 million for the third quarter of 2017. The implied weighted-average net interest spread of the Company's TBA dollar rolls was 1.98% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2.10% for the third quarter of 2017. TBA dollar roll income is considered the economic equivalent of investing in agency MBS financed with a repurchase agreement and is calculated as the price discount of a forward-settling purchase of a TBA agency MBS relative to the \"spot\" sale of the same security. Under GAAP, the Company accounts for its TBA commitments as derivative instruments and recognizes income from TBA dollar rolls as a component of net investment gains and losses in the Company's financial statements.\nExcluding TBA dollar roll income and interest rate swap net interest expense included in non-GAAP core operating income, the Company had net investment losses on its investment portfolio of $28.5 million and net investment gains on its related interest rate derivative hedging instruments of $34.0 million for a net investment gain on its hedged investment portfolio of $5.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to taxation as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As of December 31, 2017, the Company estimated its net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforward at $60.7 million that begins to expire in 2027, its net capital loss (\"NCL\") carryforward at $314.3 million that begins to expire in 2019, and its alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") credit carryforward at $9.1 million that does not expire. The Company's estimated loss and tax credit carry-forwards as of December 31, 2017 are subject to potential adjustments up to the time of filing the Company's income tax returns.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which provides for substantial changes to the taxation of individuals and corporations with an effective date of January 1, 2018. For corporate tax payers, the federal income tax rate was lowered from 35% to 21%. Under GAAP accounting, the Company is required to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period the legislation is enacted. As a result of the decrease in the Company's effective tax rate, the Company recorded a charge to its income tax provision of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act does not have an impact on the amount of the Company's existing NOL and NCL carryforwards or its ability to utilize them.\nAs part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the corporate AMT is repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Any AMT credit carryforward after that date can be continued to be utilized to offset the taxpayer's regular tax liability. Further, for 2018 through 2020, to the extent that AMT credit carryforwards exceed the regular tax liability, 50% of the excess AMT credit carryforwards would be refundable in cash with any remaining AMT credit carryforwards fully refundable in 2021. Since the ultimate collectability of the AMT credit carryforward is now certain with a significant portion of it likely to be realized through a cash refund, the Company has reclassified its AMT credit carryforward from net deferred tax asset to other assets on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. For GAAP purposes, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of $0.8 million, or $0.03 per common share, and an AMT credit carryforward within other assets on its consolidated balance sheet of $9.1 million, or $0.32 per common share as of December 31, 2017.\nDistributions to Shareholders\nThe Company's Board of Directors approved a distribution to common shareholders of $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The distribution was paid on January 31, 2018 to shareholders of record as of December 29, 2017. The Company's Board of Directors also approved a distribution to its Series B preferred shareholders of $0.4375 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The distribution was paid on January 2, 2018 to shareholders of record as of December 11, 2017.\nThe Company has also announced the tax characteristics of the distributions paid to its common and preferred shareholders in calendar year 2017. The Company's distributions paid to common shareholders in 2017 of $2.35 per share consisted of $1.266051 per share of qualified dividends and $1.083949 per share as a return of capital. The Company's distributions paid to its Series B preferred shareholders in 2017 of $0.6755 per share were all qualified dividends. Shareholders should receive a Form 1099-DIV containing this information from their brokers, transfer agents or other institutions. The fourth quarter of 2017 distributions to the Company's common and preferred shareholders paid in January 2018 will be reported as a 2018 distribution for federal income tax purposes.\nAs a C corporation, distributions to common and preferred shareholders of current or accumulated earnings and profits are qualified dividends eligible for the 23.8% maximum federal income tax rate whereas similar distributions to shareholders by a REIT of current or accumulated earnings and profits are nonqualified dividends subject to the higher 43.4% maximum effective federal tax rate for 2017 (33.4% maximum effective federal tax rate beginning January 1, 2018), each inclusive of the 3.8% Medicare tax rate, on ordinary income. Any distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits would be reported as returns of capital instead of qualified dividends. Distributions that are classified as returns of capital are nontaxable to the extent they do not exceed a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Company's stock, or as a capital gain to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Company's stock.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call for investors at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, February 7, 2018 to discuss the Company's fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.\nInvestors may listen to the earnings call via the internet at: http://www.arlingtonasset.com/index.php?s=19 . Replays of the earnings call will be available for 60 days via webcast at the Internet address provided above, beginning two hours after the call ends.\nAdditional Information\nThe Company will make available additional quarterly information for the benefit of its shareholders through a supplemental presentation that will be available at the Company's website, www.arlingtonasset.com . The presentation will be available on the Webcasts and Presentations section located under the Updates & Events tab of the Company's website.\nAbout the Company\nArlington Asset Investment Corp.

Economic net interest income is comprised of the following:\nnet interest income determined in accordance with GAAP; TBA agency MBS dollar roll income, which is calculated as the price discount of a forward-settling purchase of a TBA agency MBS relative to the \"spot\" sale of the same security, earned ratably over the period beginning on the settlement date of the sale and ending on the settlement date of the forward-settling purchase; and net interest income or expense incurred from interest rate swap agreements.\nIn the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income prepared in accordance with GAAP, TBA agency MBS dollar roll income and the net interest income or expense incurred from interest rate swap agreements are reported as a component of the overall periodic change in the fair value of derivative instruments within the line item \"gain (loss) from derivative instruments, net\" of the \"investment gain (loss), net\" section. We believe that economic net interest income assists investors in understanding and evaluating the financial performance of the Company's long-term-focused, net interest spread-based investment strategy, prior to the deduction of core general and administrative expenses.\nCore General and Administrative Expenses\nCore general and administrative expenses are non-interest expenses reported within the line item \"total general and administrative expenses\" of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income less stock-based compensation expense.\nNon-GAAP Core Operating Income Results\nThe following table presents the Company's computation of core operating income for the last four fiscal quarters (unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nGAAP net interest income\n$\n69,734\n$\n15,657\n$\n14,867\n$\n18,933\n$\n20,277\nTBA dollar roll income\n21,291\n7,171\n6,424\n4,298\n3,398\nInterest rate swap net interest expense\n(17,334)\n(2,434)\n(4,198)\n(5,293)\n(5,409)\nEconomic net interest income\n73,691\n20,394\n17,093\n17,938\n18,266\nCore general and administrative expenses\n(14,644)\n(3,768)\n(3,171)\n(3,681)\n(4,024)\nPreferred stock dividend\n(251)\n(133)\n(83)\n(35)\n—\nNon-GAAP core operating income\n$\n58,796\n$\n16,493\n$\n13,839\n$\n14,222\n$\n14,242\nNon-GAAP core operating income per\ndiluted common share\n$\n2.26\n$\n0.58\n$\n0.52\n$\n0.58\n$\n0.60\nWeighted average diluted common\nshares outstanding\n26,011\n28,580\n26,856\n24,552\n23,897\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP pre-tax net income (loss) to non-GAAP core operating income for the last four fiscal quarters (unaudited, amounts in thousands):\nYear Ended\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nGAAP income (loss) before income taxes\n$\n57,038\n$\n20,948\n$\n23,691\n$\n(1,191)\n$\n13,590\nLess:\nTotal investment (gain) loss, net\n(5,874)\n(10,238)\n(13,368)\n15,970\n1,762\nStock-based compensation expense\n3,926\n1,179\n1,373\n473\n901\nPreferred stock dividend\n(251)\n(133)\n(83)\n(35)\n—\nAdd back:\nTBA dollar roll income\n21,291\n7,171\n6,424\n4,298\n3,398\nInterest rate swap net interest expense\n(17,334)\n(2,434)\n(4,198)\n(5,293)\n(5,409)\nNon-GAAP core operating income\n$\n58,796\n$\n16,493\n$\n13,839\n$\n14,222\n$\n14,242\nNon-GAAP core operating income is used by management to evaluate the financial performance of the Company's long-term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as assist with the determination of the appropriate level of periodic dividends to common stockholders. The Company believes that non-GAAP core operating income assists investors in understanding and evaluating the financial performance of the Company's long-term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as its earnings capacity. A limitation of utilizing this non-GAAP financial measure is that the effect of accounting for \"non-core\" events or transactions in accordance with GAAP does, in fact, reflect the financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored when evaluating and analyzing our financial results. For example, the economic cost or benefit of hedging instruments other than interest rate swap agreements, such as U.S. Treasury note futures or options on U.S. Treasury note futures, do not affect the computation of non-GAAP core operating income. In addition, the Company's calculation of non-GAAP core operating income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Therefore, the Company believes that net income and comprehensive income determined in accordance with GAAP should be considered in conjunction with non-GAAP core operating income.\nThe following tables present information on the Company's investment and hedge portfolio as of December 31, 2017 (unaudited, dollars in thousands):\nAgency MBS:\nFair Value\nSpecified agency MBS\n$\n4,054,424\nNet long agency TBA position\n1,296,978\nTotal\n$\n5,351,402\nSpecified Agency MBS:\nUnpaid\nPrincipal\nBalance\nNet\nUnamortized\nPurchase\nPremiums\nAmortized\nCost Basis\nNet\nUnrealized\nGain (Loss)\nFair Value\nMarket\nPrice\nCoupon\nWeighted\nAverage\nExpected\nRemaining\nLife\n30-year fixed rate:\n3.5%\n$\n1,009,752\n$\n47,932\n$\n1,057,684\n$\n(17,716)\n$\n1,039,968\n$\n102.99\n3.50\n%\n7.6\n4.0%\n2,658,650\n154,153\n2,812,803\n(8,920)\n2,803,883\n105.46\n4.00\n%\n6.4\n4.5%\n196,961\n14,446\n211,407\n(855)\n210,552\n106.90\n4.50\n%\n5.0\n5.5%\n19\n—\n19\n2\n21\n111.00\n5.50\n%\n5.7\nTotal/weighted-average\n$\n3,865,382\n$\n216,531\n$\n4,081,913\n$\n(27,489)\n$\n4,054,424\n104.89\n3.90\n%\n6.5\nNet Long Agency TBA Positions:\nNotional Amount:\nNet Long (Short)\nPosition\nImplied Cost\nBasis\nImplied\nFair Value\nNet Carrying\nAmount\n3.0% 15-year MBS purchase commitments\n$\n250,000\n$\n254,873\n$\n254,766\n$\n(107)\n3.5% 30-year MBS purchase commitments\n1,015,000\n1,041,496\n1,042,212\n716\nTotal TBA commitments, net\n$\n1,265,000\n$\n1,296,369\n$\n1,296,978\n$\n609\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements:\nWeighted-average:\nNotional\nAmount\nFixed Pay\nRate\nVariable\nReceive\nRate\nNet Receive\n(Pay) Rate\nRemaining\nLife (Years)\nFair Value\nYears to maturity:\nLess than 3 years\n$\n1,300,000\n1.28\n%\n1.51\n%\n0.23\n%\n1.8\n$\n(248)\n3 to less than 7 years\n700,000\n1.87\n%\n1.48\n%\n(0.39)\n%\n3.9\n(454)\n7 to 10 years\n1,600,000\n1.90\n%\n1.55\n%\n(0.35)\n%\n8.3\n(2,636)\nTotal / weighted-average\n$\n3,600,000\n1.67\n%\n1.52\n%\n(0.15)\n%\n5.1\n$\n(3,338)\nU.S. Treasury Note Futures:\nMaturity Date\nNotional Amount\nNet Fair Value\n5-year U.S. Treasury note futures\nMarch 2018\n$\n21,600\n$\n(20)\n10-year U.S. Treasury note futures\nMarch 2018\n650,000\n(1,321)\nThe following table presents information about the components of the Company's net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 (unaudited, dollars in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2017\nAs of September 30, 2017\nGross Amount\nTax Effected\nGross Amount\nTax Effected\nOrdinary deferred tax assets:\nNOL carryforward\n$\n60,681\n$\n15,619\n$\n69,720\n$\n27,121\nAMT credit carryforward (1)\n—\n—\n8,952\n8,952\nDeferred net loss on designated derivatives\n17,020\n4,381\n17,268\n6,717\nStock-based compensation\n7,768\n1,999\n6,589\n2,563\nNet unrealized gain on designated derivatives\n(82,434)\n(21,218)\n(56,651)\n(22,037)\nOther, net\n72\n19\n351\n137\nTotal ordinary deferred tax assets, net\n3,107\n800\n46,229\n23,453\nCapital deferred tax assets:\nNCL carryforward\n314,276\n80,895\n309,751\n120,493\nNet unrealized loss on investments\n91,030\n23,431\n82,135\n31,951\nValuation allowance\n(405,306)\n(104,326)\n(391,886)\n(152,444)\nTotal capital deferred tax assets, net\n—\n—\n—\n—\nTotal deferred tax assets, net\n$\n3,107\n$\n800\n$\n46,229\n$\n23,453\n(1)\nIn response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's repeal of corporate AMT and its associated refund provisions applicable to existing AMT credits, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reclassified its AMT credit carryforward from \"deferred tax assets, net\" to \"other assets\" on its consolidated balance sheets.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arlington-asset-investment-corp-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300594580.html\nSOURCE Arlington Asset Investment Corp.",
