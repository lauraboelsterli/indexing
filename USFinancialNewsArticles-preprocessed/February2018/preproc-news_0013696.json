    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - A French judge decided on Tuesday to keep Swiss Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan in custody pending a possible trial for allegations of rape, a source with the prosecutorâ€™s office said.\nRamadan, who denies the allegations, was notified on Friday that he would be the target of a full investigation and had been in detention since.\nAfter a debate between his lawyers, prosecutors and magistrates, judges decided not to release him, taking the inquiry a step further.\nUnder French law, investigating magistrates can still decide not to hold a trial, depending on the evidence. Temporary custody is usually reserved for cases where the accused might be a flight risk.\nReporting by Emmanuel Jarry; writing by Michel Rose\n ",
