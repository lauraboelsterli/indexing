    "text": "2018 Production Estimated to Grow 25% YOY at Midpoint\n3-Year Production CAGR (2018-2020) Expected to Exceed 28% Per Year\n****NOTE: 4Q17 conference call slides available at www.energen.com ****\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Energen Corporation (NYSE: EGN) (“Energen” or the “company”) today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nSTRONG EXECUTION DRIVES STRONG 4Q17 AND CY17\n4Q17 production of 97.4 mboepd exceeded guidance by 14% and surpassed 3Q17 production by 20%. 4Q17 oil production of 58.1 mbopd exceeded guidance by 8% and surpassed 3Q17 oil production by 19%. CY17 production of 76.1 mboepd grew 39% from CY16 on strength of Generation 3 completions and greater activity level. 4Q17 adjusted EBITDAX of $241 mm grew 39% from 3Q17 and beat internal expectations by 24%. Per-unit LOE and net SG&A beat guidance midpoints by 10% and 9%, respectively. Additions in 2017 replaced production by ≈415%, driving 40% increase in YE17 proved reserves. CY17 proved developed F&D cost totaled $8.38/boe. Updated inventory supports net undeveloped resource potential of 2.7 billion BOE.\nGEN 3 PATTERN WELLS CONTINUE TO GENERATE OUTSTANDING RESULTS\nGen 3 performance drives strong IRRs through higher EURs and/or acceleration. Updated type curves support superior economics. 25 gross/21 net wells turned to production in 4Q17; 64% were multi-zone pattern wells completed in batches. New wells reflect outstanding 24-hr. and 30-day IP rates in Midland and Delaware basins; 4Q17 Delaware Basin wells generated average 24-hour IP rate of 402 boepd/1,000’ and average 30-day IP rate of 272 boepd/1,000’.\nBRINGING VALUE FORWARD IN CY18\nDrilling and development capital (including facilities) estimated to range from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. Annual production estimated to range from 91.5-98.5 mboepd. Capital plans include drilling approximately 130 gross/120 net horizontal wells and completing approximately 123 gross/113 net horizontal wells (including 30 gross/28 net DUCs at YE17).\n3-YEAR OUTLOOK (2018-2020) LEVERAGES SUPERIOR ECONOMICS TO FURTHER DRIVE SHAREHOLDER VALUE\nAnnual oil production estimated to grow at 3-year CAGR of ≈28%. Annual production estimated to reach ≈160 mboepd in 2020, with 4Q exit rate of ≈170 mboepd. Drilling and development capital estimated to increase to $1.6-$1.8 billion in 2020. YE20 EBITDAX estimated to be ≈$1.6 billion (3-year CAGR: ≈35%). Balance sheet ensures capital flexibility as net debt to EBITDAX expected to remain between 1.0x-1.5x.\nComments from the CEO\n“Energen’s breakout year of 2017 culminated with another excellent quarter of execution, growth, and financial strength,” said Energen Chief Executive Officer James McManus. “In the 4 th quarter as well as the year, we delivered on our drilling and development plans and exceeded expectations for oil and total production as well as for lease operating and net SG&A expenses.\n“As a result of implementing a clearly-defined strategy based on decisions made by the company’s Board and management, Energen is poised to build on its strong performance in 2017. Over the last five years, the Board and management have strategically divested non-core assets and transformed Energen into a low-cost Permian pure-pay with a strong foundation for profitable growth. As we look out over the next three years, we plan to leverage the superior economics of our Permian Basin assets in the Delaware and Midland basins to further drive shareholder value.\n“We begin 2018 with a portfolio of high quality, oil-focused assets in the Delaware and Midland basins,” McManus said. “The company is delivering strong returns with the continued implementation of Generation 3 frac designs that are driving significant production growth. At the same, the company remains focused on cost reductions and operating efficiencies and a strong balance sheet that supports growth, capital flexibility, and value creation,” he added.\n“Our Gen 3 frac designs are generating strong internal rates of return through higher EURs and/or acceleration, and we estimate that we can generate a 3-year compound annual growth rate (2018-2020) in excess of 28 percent a year while maintaining a net debt to EBITDAX multiple between 1.0x and 1.5x,” McManus said.\n“We are extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and confident that Energen is well-positioned to continue delivering strong results and creating shareholder value.”\n4Q17 Operations Update\nIn 4Q17 Energen turned to production 20 gross (16 net) wells in the Midland Basin and 5 gross (5 net) wells in the Delaware Basin. Their early performance continues to reflect outstanding results from Gen 3 frac designs; 64 percent were multi-zone pattern wells completed in batches. During the quarter, Energen operated 6 horizontal drilling rigs and 2 frac crews.\n4Q17 Wells Turned to Production\nArea # Wells Avg.\nCompleted\nLateral\nLength\nAvg. Peak 24-Hr IP\nAvg.

Adjusting for a non-cash loss on mark-to-market derivatives of $(37.5 million); a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $240.1 million resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and miscellaneous non-cash items totaling $(1.4) million: Energen had adjusted net income in 4Q17 of $61.3 million, or $0.63 per diluted share. This compares with an adjusted net loss in 4Q16 of $(26.6 million), or $(0.27) per diluted share. [See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” beginning on p. 10 for more information and reconciliation.]\nEnergen’s adjusted 4Q17 net income of $61.3 million exceeded internal expectations by $28.6 million largely due to better-than-expected production; lower-than-expected depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A), lease operating expense (LOE), and net salaries and general and administrative expense (SG&A); and higher realized oil prices.\nEnergen’s adjusted EBITDAX in 4Q17 totaled $241.0 million; this was 39 percent higher than adjusted EBITDAX in 3Q17 and 24 percent above internal expectations. In the same period a year ago, Energen’s adjusted EBITDAX totaled $82.1 million.

Total capital invested in 2017 including leasehold/mineral acquisitions and FF&E totaled $1.2 billion in 2017 and $217 million in the fourth quarter. During 4Q17, Energen added approximately 1,600 net acres of proved and unproved leasehold for some $16 million.\nLiquidity and Leverage Update\nAt December 30, 2017, Energen had cash of $0.4 million, long-term debt of $527.9 million, and $255.0 million drawn on its $1.05 billion line of credit. The company’s net debt-to-adjusted EBITDAX at year-end 2017 totaled 1.2x.\n2018 Overview\nEnergen plans to invest $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion of capital for drilling and development activities in 2018 (approximately $550-$650 million in each of the Delaware and Midland basins). Approximately 81 percent of the capital will be invested in drilling and developing operated wells; some 13 percent is allocated to saltwater disposal wells and other facilities; and the remainder is expected to be spent on non-operated and other activities. For its unhedged volumes, Energen’s 2018 plans assume recent strip prices of $58 WTI per barrel of oil, $0.65 per gallon of NGL, and $2.75 Henry Hub per Mcf of gas.\nThe company plans to drill approximately 130 gross/120 net horizontal wells in 2018 and complete approximately 123 gross/113 net horizontal wells, including 30 gross/28 net year-end 2017 drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs). The working interest of completed wells in 2018 is approximately 90 percent, and the average lateral length is approximately 8,000’. The company estimates its YE18 DUCs will total approximately 37 gross/35 net. Energen also plans to drill 7 gross/7 net vertical wells in the Midland Basin and complete 6 gross/6 net of them.\nDuring 2018, the company plans to run an average of 9 drilling rigs and 4.5 frac crews.\nPrimary horizontal well targets in 2018 are the Wolfcamp A and B in the Delaware Basin; the Jo Mill, Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp A and B zones in the northern Midland Basin; and the Wolfcamp A and B in the central Midland Basin.

LOE per boe in CY18 is estimated to range from $5.05-$5.25 in the Midland Basin, $5.35-$5.55 in the Delaware Basin, and $21.55-$21.75 in the Central Basin Platform/Northeast Shelf areas (“Platform”). Net SG&A per boe in CY18 is estimated to be comprised of cash of $1.85-$2.05 per boe and non-cash, equity-based compensation of $0.45-$0.65 per boe.\nPer BOE, except where noted 2018e CY17 Actual LOE (production costs, marketing & transportation) $6.40 - $6.60 $6.61 Production & ad valorem taxes (% of revenues, excluding hedges) 6.2% 6.0% DD&A expense $14.00 - $14.50 $17.23 Salaries and general & administrative expense, net $2.30 - $2.70 $3.05 Exploration expense (seismic, delay rentals, etc.) $0.15 - $0.20 $0.29 Interest expense ($MM) $46.5 - $51.5 $38.4 FF&E depreciation ($MM) $4.0 - $5.0 $ 4.6 Accretion of discount on ARO ($MM) $5.5 - $7.0 $5.8 Effective tax rate (%) 22% - 24% 37% Per BOE, except where noted 1Q18e 2Q18e 3Q18e 4Q18e LOE $6.20 - $6.40 $6.75 - $6.95 $6.55 - $6.75 $6.15 - $6.35 Production & ad valorem taxes* 6.4% 6.2% 6.2% 6.2% DD&A expense $14.70 - $15.20 $14.45 - $14.95 $13.85 - $14.35 $13.15 - $13.65 SG&A, net $2.80 - $3.20 $2.40 - $2.80 $2.30 - $2.70 $1.80 - $2.20 Exploration expense $0.15 - $0.20 $0.15 - $0.20 $0.15 - $0.20 $0.15 - $0.20 Effective tax rate (%) 22% - 24% 22% - 24% 22% - 24% 22% - 24% * % of revenues, excluding hedges\n3-Year Outlook\nEnergen’s management believes the quality of its deep inventory in the Permian Basin supports a 3-year compound annual production growth rate of more than 28 percent a year (2018-2020). This growth comes as Energen maintains an outstanding balance sheet while increasing capital investment to bring forward the value of its inventory. Energen estimates that its annual production will grow from 95 mboepd (at guidance midpoint) in 2018 to more than 160 mboepd in 2020 and that 4Q production will increase from 107 mboepd (at guidance midpoint) in 2018 to approximately 135 mboepd in 2019 and 170 mboepd in 2020.\nAt recent strip prices, Energen estimates that its capital plans support annual investment in drilling and development activities in a range of $1.4-$1.6 billion in 2019 and $1.6-$1.8 billion in 2020. Energen’s EBITDAX at year-end 2020 is estimated to be approximately $1.6 billion, representing a 3-year CAGR of approximately 35 percent a year. (Oil prices used in the 3-year outlook reflect recent strip prices of $58 per barrel in 2018, $54 in 2019, and $52 in 2020).\nYE17 Proved Reserves Increase 40% to 444 MMBOE\nEnergen’s proved reserves at year-end 2017 totaled 444 mmboe, up approximately 40 percent from year-end 2016. Reserve additions of 115.5 mmboe replaced production by 415 percent and were driven by an active drilling and completion program in the Midland and Delaware basins that featured Gen 3 frac designs. Proved reserves in the Delaware Basin alone rose 177 percent. The CY17 proved developed finding and development (F&D) cost totaled $8.38 per boe.\nProved developed F&D per boe is defined as exploration and development costs divided by the sum of reserves associated with discoveries and extensions placed on production during 2017, transfers from proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2016, and revisions (excluding price-related revisions) of previous estimates of proved developed reserves in 2017.\nCommodity prices used for calculating reserves at year-end 2017 were higher than those at year-end 2016. WTI oil prices rose 20 percent to $51.34, while NGL prices (before transportation and fractionation) increased 46 percent to 57 cents per gallon and Henry Hub natural gas prices increased 20 percent to 2.98 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).\nProved Reserves by Basin (MMBOE)\n2017 2017 2017 Basin YE16 2017\nAcquisitions/ Additions Price/Other YE17 Production\n(Divestitures) Revisions Midland Basin 236.4 (15.5 ) -- 49.0 23.9 293.8 Delaware Basin 39.1 (9.4 ) 0.2 66.3 11.8 108.1 Platform/Other 40.9 (3.0 ) -- 0.1 4.1 41.1 TOTAL 316.3 (27.8 ) 0.2 115.5 39.8 444.0 NOTE: Totals may not sum due to rounding\nProved Reserves by Commodity (MMBOE)\nCommodity 2017 2016 Oil 257 200 Natural gas liquids 91 58 Natural gas 96 58 TOTAL 444 316 NOTE: Totals may not sum due to rounding\nYE17 3P Reserves & Contingent Resources (MMBOE)\nBasin Proved Probable Possible Contingent Total Resources Midland Basin 294 154 130 979 1,557 Delaware Basin 108 40 46 1,243 1,437 Platform/Other 42 -- -- 1 43 TOTAL 444 194 176 2,223 3,037\nNOTE: Totals may not sum due to rounding\nThe definitions of probable and possible reserves and contingent resources imply different probabilities of potential recovery in each classification; the quantities reported here are unrisked and based on the company’s estimate of current costs to drill wells in each basin and bring associated production to market.

Actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered may differ substantially from estimates. We make no commitment to drill all of the drilling locations that have been attributed these quantities. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of our on-going drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling, and production costs, availability of drilling and completion services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, regulatory approvals, and geological and mechanical factors. Estimates of unproved reserves, type/decline curves, per-well EURs, and resource potential may change significantly as development of our oil and gas assets provides additional data. Additionally, initial production rates contained in this news release are subject to decline over time and should not be regarded as reflective of sustained production levels.\nFinancial, operating, and support data pertaining to all reporting periods included in this release are unaudited and subject to revision.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Net Income is a Non-GAAP financial measure (GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles) which excludes the effects of certain non-cash mark-to-market derivative financial instruments. Adjusted income from continuing operations further excludes impairment losses, income (loss) associated with divestitures, and the benefit of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Energen believes that excluding the impact of these items is more useful to analysts and investors in comparing the results of operations and operational trends between reporting periods and relative to other oil and gas producing companies.
