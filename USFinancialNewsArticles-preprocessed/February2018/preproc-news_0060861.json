Ross will retire in June 2018 after serving in the position for 25 years.\nBoard Chairman Seamus Mallon said, \"Dr. Rooney is no stranger to Ireland. His family has a history of supporting Irish charities, and this experience combined with his considerable success as a leader in academics will make him a great addition to American College Dublin.\"\nThe Irish-American Rooney family were founding members of the Ireland Fund, a worldwide charitable organization that has raised millions of dollars for Irish charities.\nRooney previously served as dean of the College of Hospitality Management at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida.

He is also a board member of Dromoland Castle in County Clare, Ireland, the Economic Council of Palm Beach County and the Society of Human Resource Management.\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he is the son of Patrick and Sandra Rooney.

He is married to Kelly and has three children, Joseph Jr., Lawrence and Melissa.\nRooney earned his doctorate in Business Administration from Nova Southeastern University. He also graduated from Florida International University with his master's degree and Indiana University of Pennsylvania with his bachelor's degree.\nAbout American College Dublin\nAmerican College Dublin (ACD) is an Irish-American university offering bachelor's and master's degrees accredited in the U.S. and Ireland.
