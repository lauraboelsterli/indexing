    "text": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Jamieson Wellness Inc. (“Jamieson Wellness” or the “Company”) (TSX: JWEL) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. All amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars. Certain metrics, including those expressed on an adjusted basis, are non-IFRS measures. See “Non-IFRS Financial Measures” below.\nHighlights of Fourth Quarter 2017 Results versus Fourth Quarter 2016 Results\nRevenue increased 28.3% to $84.3 million; Adjusted EBITDA increased 28.0% to $18.8 million; Net Income was $3.7 million and Adjusted Net Income increased 91.1% to $9.7 million; Earnings per diluted share were $0.09 and Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.25.\nHighlights of Full Year 2017 Results versus Full Year 2016 Results\nRevenue increased 21.1% to $300.6 million; Adjusted EBITDA increased 31.4% to $61.5 million; Net Loss was $23.8 million and Adjusted Net Income increased 152.8% to $27.6 million; Pro forma* net loss per share was $0.63 and pro forma* adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.70.\n* Pro forma fiscal 2017 earnings per share calculations reflect the basic and diluted shares outstanding following completion of the Company’s initial public offering in July 2017.\n“Fiscal 2017 was a year of significant accomplishments as we strengthened the Jamieson Wellness platform with two strategic acquisitions, completed a successful initial public offering and generated strong growth achieving our revenue and profit targets,” said Mark Hornick, President and Chief Executive Officer of Jamieson Wellness. “We concluded the year with strong fourth quarter results, including 11.1% organic growth led by Jamieson Canada and growth with strategic partners. As we enter 2018, we see incremental international growth opportunities and will continue to deliver market leading innovation to capitalize upon the growing global nutrition market.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenue increased 28.3% to $84.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $65.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and was driven by an 18.8% increase in Jamieson Brands revenue and a 78.7% increase in Strategic Partners revenue. The increase in the Jamieson Brands revenue was primarily driven by the acquisition of Body Plus and organic growth of Jamieson Brands’ domestic volumes. The increase in Strategic Partners was primarily driven by 55.2% growth in the legacy business driven by expanding business with existing customers and additional volumes from strong consumer demand, along with the incremental revenue associated with the acquisition of Sonoma.\nGross profit increased 30.3% to $30.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $23.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and gross profit margin increased 50 basis points to 36.6% from 36.1% in the same respective period. The increase in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by sales mix, manufacturing efficiencies and includes higher relative margins from Body Plus and Sonoma.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased 29.5% to $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $11.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A increased 10 basis points to 16.9% from 16.8% in the prior year period. The increase as a percentage of revenue reflected the inclusion of $0.5 million of public company costs and the higher SG&A as a percentage of revenue associated with the acquired businesses.\nOperating income increased 30.3% to $14.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and operating margin increased 20 basis points to 17.7% from 17.5% in the same respective periods.\nInterest expense and other financing costs were $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The change was driven by lower borrowings including discharge of the note payable to Jamieson Finco LP in pre-IPO reorganization and lower interest rates on the Company’s new credit facility entered into in January 2017.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.7 million compared to net loss of $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Net Income, which excludes all non-operating expenses, increased 91.1% to $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 excludes costs associated with public offerings, acquisitions, restructuring activities, foreign exchange losses and related tax effects. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 excludes costs associated with preferred share accretion, acquisitions, restructuring activities, foreign exchange gains and related tax effects. A detailed reconciliation of reported net income to non-IFRS adjusted net income is included in the tables accompanying this release under the heading Non-IFRS measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 28.0% to $18.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was consistent to the prior year at 22.4%.\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\nThe Company generated $17.6 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter of compared to $12.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Management uses these non-IFRS financial measures for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of ongoing operations and in analyzing the Company’s business performance and trends. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company’s results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s financial information reported under IFRS. We use non-IFRS measures, including “gross profit”, “gross profit margin”, “operating margin” “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA margin”, “Adjusted Net Income” and “Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share” to provide supplemental measures of the Company’s operating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company’s core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to prepare annual operating budgets and to determine components of management compensation. Definitions of non-IFRS measures can be found in our MD&A.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income\nThree months ended December 31,\nFor the year ended December 31,\n($ in 000's) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) 3,733 (18,722 ) (23,787 ) (25,166 ) Adjustments to net income (loss): Share-based compensation 978 912 4,171 3,651 Amortization of fair value adjustments - - 1,694 - Amortization of deferred financing fee - - 3,078 - Foreign exchange loss (gain) 116 (154 ) 331 (192 ) Termination benefits and related costs 1,633 234 4,132 1,420 Acquisition costs - 789 2,444 789 Purchase consideration accounted for as compensation expense 2,521 - 8,427 - Public offering costs 1,200 - 10,720 - Net interest forgiveness - - (11,001 ) - Preferred share accretion - 24,123 28,796 30,434 Other 472 (2,784 ) 1,004 397 Related tax effects (904 ) 703 (2,427 ) (423 ) Adjusted net income 9,749 5,101 27,582 10,910 Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in 000's) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) 3,733 (18,722 ) (23,787 ) (25,166 ) Add: Provision for income taxes 3,130 2,414 8,156 3,706 Interest expense and other financing costs 2,140 5,686 4,733 22,926 Preferred share accretion - 24,123 28,796 30,434 Depreciation of property, plant, and equipment 1,336 1,100 5,106 4,316 Amortization of intangible assets 855 808 3,396 3,230 - - Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) 11,194 15,409 26,400 39,446 Add EBITDA adjustments: Share-based compensation 1,712 1,233 6,325 4,934 Amortization of fair value adjustments - - 1,694 - Foreign exchange loss (gain) 116 (154 ) 331 (192 ) Termination benefits and related costs 1,633 234 4,132 1,420 Acquisition costs - 789 2,444 789 Purchase consideration accounted for as compensation expense 2,521 - 8,427 - Public offering costs 1,200 - 10,720 - Other 472 (2,784 ) 1,004 397 Adjusted EBITDA 18,848 14,727 61,477 46,794\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222006436/en/\nInvestor Relations\nICR\nScott Van Winkle\n617-956-6736\nScott.VanWinkle@ICRinc.com\nor\nMedia\nICR\nMary Nelson\n646-277-1219\nMary.Nelson@ICRinc.com\nSource: Jamieson Wellness Inc.",
