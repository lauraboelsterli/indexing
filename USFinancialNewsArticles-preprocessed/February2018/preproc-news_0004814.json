    "text": "ARLINGTON, Va., Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Albion River is the new name of Albion Heath Capital Partners and its affiliate Albion & Heath LLC, effective February 1 st , 2018. The Arlington, Virginia and New York, New York based multifamily office continues to make direct investments in Aerospace, Defense and Infrastructure related opportunities.\nAlbion River is led by Darren Farber and Mark Schneiderman, out of the Arlington, Virginia and New York, New York offices respectively.\n\"The firm was originally established to provide advisory services to investors and corporations in highly regulated industries. These engagements led to direct investment opportunities, which became the sole focus of the firm several years ago. Our rebranding as Albion River provides the opportunity to distinguish historical advisory work from our direct investing activities,\" said Darren Farber, Albion River's Managing Partner.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/albion-river-is-the-new-name-of-albion-heath-capital-partners-300592007.html\nSOURCE Albion River",
