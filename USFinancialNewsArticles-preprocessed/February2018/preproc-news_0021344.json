Mr. Chen joined Digitone Group in 2014 to provide leadership to optimize company visibility and interests overseas for corporate branding and positioning, and is currently CEO of Digitone's DST Robotics business. Previously, he worked for Formica, as the General Manager of its Greater China business.

Prior to joining Barco, Mr. Chen was the General Manger of the China and Hong Kong region for Waters Corporation where, among other managerial responsibilities, he was responsible for developing and implementing marketing strategies to grow the Chinese market. Prior to his time at Waters Corporation, Mr. Chen held various managerial rolls of increasing importance at Hilti China. Mr. Chen began his career as an electrical engineer at Capital Iron & Steel Co. He received his MBA from Brigham Young University and a BS in Electrical engineering from the North China University of Technology, Beijing, China.\nMr. Chen commented, \"I am excited to join the board of Biostage on behalf of our investment group. Regenerative medicine is a new frontier of modern medicine. Biostage has a very promising technology platform in regenerative medicine and we are honored to participate in such a noble mission as developing and delivering this technology to patients in need, especially children suffering from esophageal atresia. I look forward to working closely with the Biostage team to advance our technology to IND filings and we will strive for continuous improvement of our corporate governance. We are also committed to helping Biostage on financing and market expansion into China, which has half of the new esophageal cancer patients worldwide every year, by leveraging all our resources. During DST's investment due diligence process with Biostage, we were particularly impressed by the open and transparent manner the company had with us. We will continue to promote an open and transparent culture inside the company and also in the communications with all stakeholders, particularly our shareholders. We also thank the company's shareholders for their loyalty and strongly encourage them to take a long-term view of this company and stay with us. We firmly believe that Biostage will be successful in both the U.S. and China markets. We are looking forward to the opportunities to maximize our shareholders' value through our strategic positioning, expertise, teamwork and dedication.\"\nBiostage also announced that On February 1, 2018, John F. Kennedy resigned as Chairman and member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Kennedy said, \"I believe this is the right moment in Biostage's development to allow another person with a different set of skills and experience to bring leadership to Biostage. I wish nothing but future success to the company.\"\nOn February 6, 2018, the Board appointed John Canepa, who is currently a member of the Audit Committee of the Board, to serve as the Chairman of the Audit Committee to fill the vacancy created as a result of Mr. Kennedy's resignation.\nJim McGorry, Biostage's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"I and the other members of the company's Board are pleased to welcome Jason as the new Chairman. His robust business experience, particularly in Asia, will be invaluable as Biostage develops our plans to provide solutions to a region with the world's highest incidence of esophageal cancer.\" Mr. McGorry continued, \"I would also like to thank John Kennedy for his years of service to Biostage. John has been a trusted friend and leader. John's steady and practical leadership has steered Biostage to this exciting moment.\"\nUpcoming Business Update\nOn Tuesday, Feb 13th 2018 at 9:00 AM ET, Biostage will host a conference call with a live audio webcast to provide a business update.
