It’s time to increase the pressure,” he said.\nTrade union Verdi, which is also negotiating for energy workers, is calling for a 6 percent wage increase. It said the next round of talks was scheduled for Feb. 27.\nA spokesman for E.ON said the group was confident a fair and balanced wage deal could be reached that would adequately reflect employee interests, the company’s economic situation as well the competitive environment.\nEarlier this month, industrial workers in southwestern Germany struck a hard-fought deal with employers on pay and working hours, setting a benchmark for millions of workers across Europe’s largest economy.\nThat agreement, between labour union IG Metall and the Suedwestmetall employers’ federation, foresees a 4.3 percent raise from April and other payments spread over 27 months.
