Major U.S. indexes extended their winning streak to five days on Thursday, with the Dow and S&P 500 breaking above their 50-day moving averages as bond yields hit fresh multiyear highs.\nOn the U.S. data front, jobless claims increased by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 230,000, rebounding from a near 45-year low. The producer price index, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent in January, in line with expectations.\nSymbol Name Price Change %Change NIKKEI --- HSI --- ASX 200 --- SHANGHAI --- KOSPI --- CNBC 100 --- Over in Asia, activity was lower than normal with markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam closed.\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei rallied 1.19 percent, notching a weekly gain of 1.58 percent. Utilities were among the biggest gainers, with Kansai Electric Power ending 5.89 percent higher and Chubu Electric Power rising 6.52 percent.\nUsed-car dealer Idom soared 2.37 percent on news that it is partnering with Uber in Africa.\nBeer manufacturer Sapporo Holdings slumped 2.81 percent after reporting a 16 percent drop in 2017 operating profit.\nIn wobbly trade, the yen hit a new 15-month high at 105.54 per dollar, extending gains for a second straight day.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration reappointed Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda for another five-year term in an indication that the country's stimulus policy will stay the course.\nAustralia's benchmark ASX 200 reversed earlier gains to close slightly lower, weighed down by manganese miner South32 . The stock slid 5.1 percent despite reporting strong first-half profit numbers on Thursday.\nHealth-care stocks led the gains on the ASX 200. Private hospital operator Healthscope jumped 6.46 percent on hopes of a potential sale of its Asian pathology business.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia plans to leave interest rates at their current record lows for a while, Governor Philip Lowe said on Friday, adding that he hoped for gradual improvement in the unemployment rate.\nMeanwhile, the Australian dollar hit a new two-week high of $0.7969, extending gains into a second session.",
