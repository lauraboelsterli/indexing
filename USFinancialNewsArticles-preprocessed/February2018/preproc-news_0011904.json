    "text": " 21 PM / Updated 32 minutes ago Koeman named as Netherlands coach Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nZEIST, Netherlands (Reuters) - Ronald Koeman has been appointed as coach of the Netherlands national team up to and including the 2022 World Cup, the Dutch football association (KNVB) announced on Tuesday. \nThe 54-year-old former international defender is the seventh coach in eight years for the Dutch team, who were runners-up at the 2010 World Cup and finished third in Brazil four years later but failed to qualify for the 2018 finals in Russia. \nHe will be expected to help the Dutch to qualify for the next European Championship in 2020 and World Cup two years thereafter, reviving the team’s fortunes in the process. \nKoeman, who earned 78 caps for the Netherlands, succeeds Dick Advocaat, who had been brought in midway through last year after the sacking of Danny Blind in March. \nHis first assignment will be a friendly against England at the Amsterdam Arena on March 23, followed by a meeting with Portugal in Geneva three days later. The Dutch are helping the two Russia-bound teams prepare for this year’s World Cup. \nKoeman has been out of work since being dismissed by Everton last October after a poor run of form in the Premier League. \nHe did, however, enjoy significant success as a club coach in his homeland winning three Eredivisie titles - two with Ajax Amsterdam (2001-02, 2003-04) and one with PSV Eindhoven (2006-07). \nHe has also coached Vitesse Arnhem, Benfica, Valencia, AZ Alkmaar, Feyenoord and Southampton. \nHis coaching career began as an assistant to Guus Hiddink with the Dutch side in 1997 but he left after a year to take up a similar role under Louis van Gaal at Barcelona. \nFormer Dutch international Kees van Wonderen will be Koeman’s assistant with Patrick Lodewijks as goalkeeper coach.
