    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 3:59 PM / in 6 minutes Indonesia church attacker may have been exposed to radicalism: police chief Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nJAKARTA (Reuters) - A sword-wielding attacker who injured at least three churchgoers and a police officer in Indonesia’s Yogyakarta city at the weekend had attempted to travel to Syria and had showed signs of being radicalized, the national police chief said on Monday. \nThe attack comes amid heightened concerns over religious tension in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, which has also seen a recent resurgence in homegrown militancy. \n“There is a strong and concerning indication that he was exposed to radicalism. Radicalism which is pro-violence,” National Police Chief Tito Karnavian told reporters in Jakarta. \nPolice are currently investigating whether the attacker acted alone or with the help of a larger network. \nAuthorities estimate there are hundreds of sympathizers of the group Islamic State in the country. Many who traveled to Syria to join the group have returned as it loses territory in the Middle East, and officials believe they could pose a security threat to Southeast Asia. \nFour people were killed and 20 injured in 2016 after an Islamic State-linked cell used guns and bombs to mount an attack in the heart of Jakarta’s business district.

Police shot him twice in the leg and he was being treated at a local hospital. They previously said the suspect had been shot in the stomach.
