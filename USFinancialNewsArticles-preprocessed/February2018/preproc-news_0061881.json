    "text": "(Corrects typographical error in first paragraph)\nBAGHDAD, Feb 25 (Reuters) - An Iraqi court sentenced 16 Turkish women to death by hanging for joining Islamic State, a judiciary spokesman said on Sunday.\nThe central criminal court issued the sentences “after it was proven they belong to the Daesh terrorist group and after they confessed to marrying Daesh elements or providing members of the group with logistical aid or helping them carry out terrorist attacks,” said Judge Abdul-Sattar al-Birqdar, referring to the militant group using an Arabic acronym.\nAll the verdicts can be appealed, he told Reuters.\nReporting by Ahmed Rasheed; Writing by Ahmed Aboulenein; editing by John Stonestreet\n ",
