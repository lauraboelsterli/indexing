(NASDAQ: EVBG), the global leader in critical event management and enterprise safety software applications to help keep people safe and businesses running faster, today announced that Rodney Billingsley has joined the company as Vice President of Public Sector Sales. An experienced leader in serving the Federal and public sector markets, Billingsley will lead Everbridge’s state, local and federal government sales operations. He will also spearhead the opening of a new Everbridge office in Washington, D.C., further extending the company’s presence in the federal government market.\nEverbridge currently supports the operational resilience needs of more than 40 different federal agencies , including the Bureau of the Census, the General Services Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the United States Office of Personnel Management. Billingsley will oversee the expansion of these efforts, aligned with the company’s momentum toward obtaining official Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) compliance. Everbridge will be completing an assessment by an accredited Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) to verify compliance with the stringent FedRAMP requirements (NIST SP 800-53r4). In addition, Everbridge has received Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) Authorization and Accreditation, and its platform has been certified and designated as an approved technology by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY Act (Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology).\nBillingsley brings over 20 years of experience to the role. He joins Everbridge from enterprise cloud infrastructure provider Tintri, where he served as Senior Federal Director for the past few years, running the company’s governmental sales and business development activities. Prior to that position, he was Federal Vice President at SimpliVity Corporation, a hyperconverged platform maker that was acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Billingsley also has held public sector sales leadership roles at VMware, EMC and StorageTek.\n“Everbridge is committed to extending its leadership in critical event management across all levels of government – from serving local communities, to deploying solutions on a statewide basis, to enabling federal government agencies with integrated solutions to rapidly respond to – and even avoid – sudden, unexpected disruptions,” said Bob Hughes, President of Everbridge. “With Rodney’s leadership and our new Washington, D.C. presence, we look forward to expanding our customer base even further across the government sector.”\nIn addition to its federal customers, Everbridge has an industry leading market presence serving state and local governments. The company serves nine of the ten largest cities in the United States, over 9,000 public safety agencies, and provides the critical event management platform used to keep residents safe and informed statewide, including Connecticut, Florida, New York and Vermont, as well as for the National Capital Region.\n“I’m excited to join a company with such a strong customer base already in place,” added Billingsley. “Everbridge’s cloud-based platform provides a highly secure, reliable and scalable solution that can increase the speed and agility of all facets of the public sector in managing critical events.”\nAbout Everbridge\nEverbridge, Inc.
