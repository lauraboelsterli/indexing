The replay may be accessed for up to two weeks by dialing 855-859-2056 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 5777769, or by visiting investor.analog.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\nSchedules E and F of this press release provide the reconciliation of the Company’s historical non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures.\nManagement uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company’s core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company’s earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s core business. Management also believes that the non-GAAP liquidity measure free cash flow is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities.\nThe following item is excluded from our non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:\nAcquisition-Related Expenses: Expenses incurred as a result of current and prior period acquisitions and primarily include expenses associated with the fair value adjustments to inventory, property, plant and equipment and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology and customer relationships. Expenses also include severance payments, equity award accelerations and the fair value adjustment associated with the replacement of share-based awards related to the Linear Technology acquisition. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to specific transactions and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.\nThe following items are excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:\nAcquisition-Related Transaction Costs: Costs directly related to the Linear Technology acquisition, including legal, accounting and other professional fees, as well as integration-related costs. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.\nRestructuring-Related Expense: These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, severance, and other cost reduction efforts. We excluded these expenses from our non-GAAP measures because apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.\nThe following item is excluded from our non-GAAP other expense and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:\nAmortization of Deferred Financing Costs: In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, in connection with the Linear Technology acquisition, the Company obtained bridge financing commitments and incurred financing fees which were to be amortized into interest expense over the term of the bridge financing commitments. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company replaced a portion of the bridge financing commitments with proceeds from the issuance of $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes. As a result, the Company accelerated $7.2 million of the unamortized bridge financing commitment fees into interest expense. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.\nThe following items are excluded from our non-GAAP provision for income taxes and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:\nTax-Related Items: Tax adjustments associated with the non-GAAP items discussed above. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $10 million tax expense associated with a prior period tax liability. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, in relation to the provisional impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional discrete tax charge of $687 million related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings and recorded a provisional discrete tax benefit of $640 million from remeasuring its US tax liabilities at the lower 21% statutory tax rate. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.\nThese non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Company’s use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.\nAbout Analog Devices\nAnalog Devices (Nasdaq: ADI) is the leading global high-performance analog technology company dedicated to solving the toughest engineering challenges.
