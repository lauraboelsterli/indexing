Immuno-oncology is currently one of the fastest growing therapeutic fields in medicine.\nThe Company's development pipeline is based on two novel proprietary platforms:\nThe first platform, ONCOS, uses oncolytic viruses as potential multi-target, neo-antigen therapeutic cancer vaccines. ONCOS uses an adenovirus that has been engineered to be an immune activator that selectively targets cancer cells. In phase I trials it has demonstrated immune activation at lesional level which was associated with clinical benefit. In an ongoing phase I combination trial in advanced melanoma we are seeking important proof of concept data for checkpoint inhibitor refractory patients.\nThe second platform, TG, uses neo-antigen cancer vaccines designed to specifically treat tumors that express mutated forms of RAS. Mutations to the RAS protein are common in many cancers and are known to drive aggressive disease progression and treatment resistance. There is a high unmet medical need for therapies that are effective against tumors that express these mutations. The TG platform's therapeutic potential stems from its ability to enable the patient's immune system to develop a cellular response with the potential to identify and destroy tumors bearing any RAS mutations. In early 2017, key proof of concept data for the TG platform from a clinical trial of TG01 in resected pancreatic cancer patients showed encouraging overall survival and is already providing guidance for the future clinical development of this platform.\nTargovax's development pipeline has three novel therapeutic candidates in clinical development covering six indications.\nBoth platforms are protected by an extensive portfolio of Intellectual Property (IP) and know-how and have the potential to yield multiple product candidates in a cost-effective manner. Additionally, Targovax has other products in early stages of development.\nThis information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.\nSource: Targovax ASA",
