    "text": "ATLANTA, Kazmarek Mowrey Cloud Laseter LLP (KMCL), a nationally recognized boutique environmental and energy law firm announced today that prominent Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania attorney Paul Stockman has joined the firm as a Partner and opened KMCL's new Pittsburgh office. KMCL's Pittsburgh office expands the firm's presence on the U.S. East Coast.\nStockman has a broad-based complex trial and appellate litigation practice, with substantial focus on litigation of energy, environmental, insurance coverage, and toxic tort disputes. He has represented a variety of clients in proceedings in federal and state trial and appellate courts in Pennsylvania and throughout the U.S. as well as before administrative tribunals and commercial arbitration panels.\n\"We are thrilled that Paul is joining us, and we are excited to establish an office in Pittsburgh,\" said KMCL's Bob Mowrey. Mowrey added that a Pittsburgh office extends KMCL's capabilities and geographic reach that the firm has established with our Atlanta and Birmingham offices. \"Paul Stockman is a first-rate attorney with a stellar reputation and significant client relationships in environmental, oil and gas, insurance recovery, and toxic tort matters,\" Mowrey said. He added that \"Pittsburgh is an excellent location for our firm given the great companies headquartered and operating in and near there, and the city's manufacturing heritage.\" KMCL's Pittsburgh office will initially be located in One PPG Place in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\"I was drawn to KMCL because of its deep bench of superb environmental attorneys, the firm's prominence, and its success representing clients nationally,\" said Stockman. \"The quality and sophistication of KMCL's work is second to none, and I'm excited to join such a great team. Few if any other firms—including major U.S. law firms—match KMCL's depth and capabilities on environmental issues,\" he added. Stockman noted that KMCL's boutique model brings the agility to respond quickly to fast-changing client needs and expectations, and to developments in the broader marketplace. \"I am also excited to join a team where building true partnership relationships within the firm and with our clients is a core value,\" he added.\nStockman also emphasized that Pittsburgh is the nerve center for the Appalachian Basin \"shale plays\"—remarkable natural gas formations representing \"the most exciting development in American energy law in decades.\" The U.S. Energy Information Administration recently highlighted that Appalachian gas production has increased 200% since 2012. \"This fact has broad impacts on the U.S. economy and on KMCL's client base; for example, in addition to driving down U.S. energy costs, such production is prompting a renaissance in U.S. chemical manufacturing,\" he added. These developments point to a growing need in the market for sophisticated legal representation on oil and gas matters, including real property, regulatory, and midstream facility development matters. \"I look forward not only to building on KMCL's national environmental litigation reputation, but expanding its energy-related practice,\" said Stockman.\nStockman has more than 25 years of experience with Am-Law 100 firms representing manufacturing and other heavily regulated clients. Before joining KMCL, he was a Partner with McGuireWoods' Pittsburgh office since 2012. Prior to McGuireWoods, Stockman was a partner at K&L Gates, where he had practiced since 1993. He earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard University and his J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law, where he was an editor of the Virginia Law Review. After law school, Stockman served as a law clerk to the Hon. Judge Ellsworth A. Van Graafeiland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nKMCL is a preeminent boutique environmental and energy law firm founded by nationally-known environmental lawyers who were formerly partners of Am-Law 100 law firms. KMCL's boutique platform provides clients with unparalleled expertise, creativity, and value.\nKMCL serves clients nationwide including Fortune 100 companies, mid-sized business and industry, utilities, and state and local governments. The firm focuses on environmental and energy matters, including providing regulatory, transactional, and strategic advice; defending clients against agency enforcement matters; and handling complex environmental, energy, and toxic tort litigation.\nKMCL's offices are located in Atlanta, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nKMCL is recognized as a leading environmental practice in prominent law firm ranking guides, including Chambers USA, America's Leading Lawyers for Business; U.S. News Best Law Firms; and Super Lawyers.\nwww.kmcllaw.com\n releases/nationally-recognized-environmental-and-energy-firm-expands-footprint-to-pittsburgh-300595336.html\nSOURCE Kazmarek Mowrey Cloud Laseter LLP",
