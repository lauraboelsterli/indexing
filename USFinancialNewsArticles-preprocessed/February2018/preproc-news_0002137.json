(the “Company” or “OSI Systems”) (NASDAQ: OSIS) today announced financial results for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2017.\nDeepak Chopra, OSI Systems’ Chairman and CEO, stated, “We are pleased to report an excellent second quarter as we achieved record revenues, operating margin expansion and strong cash flow. We executed on strategic initiatives and grew our backlog, positioning the Company well for the remainder of fiscal 2018.”\nThe Company reported revenues of $277.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 14% from the $242.5 million reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $47.0 million, or ($2.47) per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $19.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of $13.4 million, or $0.68 per diluted share.\nAs a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017, the Company recognized a charge of $56 million, or $2.96 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The charge included management’s current estimate of the tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year end, the Tax Act’s lower corporate tax rate will be phased in, and is expected to result in a U. S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 28% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, which is a reduction from 35%. The Company’s reported tax rate, which includes the charge, was 465.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and 231.4% for the first half of the fiscal year. The Company’s tax rate, excluding the Tax Act related charge and certain discrete tax items, was 28.0% for the fiscal 2018 second quarter and 28.2% for the first half of the fiscal year. The provisional estimates are based on the Company's initial analysis of the Tax Act. The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final impacts of the Tax Act may differ materially from the amounts estimated above, due to, among other things, changes in interpretation of the Tax Act, any legislative action that may be taken to address questions arising due to the Tax Act, and any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act. The Company currently anticipates finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the end of the 2018 calendar year.\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, revenues rose 15% to $534.7 million, compared with the same period a year ago. Net loss in this period was $36.8 million, or ($1.95) per diluted share, compared with net income of $5.5 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Non-GAAP net income for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $34.6 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $22.1 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, for the comparable prior-year period.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company's book-to-bill ratio for equipment and related services (non-turnkey) was 1.1. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's backlog was approximately $830 million, compared with $738 million as of June 30, 2017. Operating cash flow during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $50 million, and capital expenditures were $8 million. For the comparable period in the prior year, operating cash flow was $20 million, and capital expenditures were $2 million.\nMr. Chopra commented, “Our Security division achieved record second fiscal quarter revenues of $172 million, up 23% compared with the prior-year period. This included approximately $20 million of revenues generated by the explosive trace detection business we acquired in July 2017. This business nicely complements our pre-existing product portfolio, and we are progressing well with our integration efforts. As we announced, shortly after the end of the second quarter, we signed a new two-year agreement with Mexico’s customs and tax authority to continue providing security inspection services in a wide-ranging program utilizing cargo and vehicle screening systems in Mexico. The anticipated sales from this agreement are consistent with the expectations reflected in our previous financial guidance for fiscal 2018.”\nMr. Chopra continued, “Our Healthcare division revenues were up 3%. Excluding $4.5 million of revenues in Q2 of fiscal 2017 attributable to a non-core business that was divested in February 2017, Healthcare sales were up 13%, which marked the fourth consecutive quarter of solid year-over-year organic growth.”\nMr. Chopra concluded, “Our Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division performed well in the quarter as year-over-year sales grew 5%. We continually strive to find opportunities where our technology, capabilities, and geographic presence differentiate us among our peers.”\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company is raising its fiscal 2018 sales guidance to $1,055 million - $1,090 million, representing growth of 10% - 13% compared to the prior year. In addition, the Company is increasing its non-GAAP earnings guidance to $3.45 - $3.67 per diluted share. Actual sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share could vary from this guidance.\nThe Company’s fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis only. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to GAAP diluted EPS (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate compilation of reconciling items and certain information is not available.\nPresentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis earnings release includes a presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income (loss) by segment, and non-GAAP operating margin, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of these non-GAAP figures for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 is provided to allow for the comparison of the underlying performance of the Company, net of impairment, restructuring and other charges (including certain legal costs), amortization of intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, non-cash interest expense related to convertible debt, and their associated tax effects, and the impact from discrete income tax items including charges resulting from the implementation of the Tax Act. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide (i) additional insight into the ongoing operations of the Company, (ii) meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s results (excluding amounts management does not view as reflective of ongoing operating results) for planning, forecasting and assessing the performance of the business, (iii) a meaningful comparison of results of current periods against results of past periods and (iv) comparable financial results to those of peer companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be assessed in isolation or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information are provided in the accompanying tables. The financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from those financial results should be carefully evaluated.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast beginning at 1:30 pm PT (4:30 pm ET) today to discuss its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
