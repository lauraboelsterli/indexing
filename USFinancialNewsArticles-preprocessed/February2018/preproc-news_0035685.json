    "text": "SAN DIEGO, AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AMN), the leader and innovator in healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services, today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. Financial highlights are as follows:\nDollars in millions, except per share amounts.\nQ4 2017\n% Change\nQ4 2016\nFull Year\n2017\n% Change\nFull Year\n2016\nRevenue\n$509.1\n4%\n$1,988.5\n5%\nGross profit\n$162.1\n2%\n$644.4\n4%\nNet income\n$41.2\n56%\n$132.6\n25%\nDiluted EPS\n$0.84\n56%\n$2.68\n25%\nAdj. diluted EPS*\n$0.63\n2%\n$2.56\n5%\nAdjusted EBITDA*\n$64.4\n6%\n$256.4\n8%\n* See \"Non-GAAP Measures\" below for a discussion of our use of non-GAAP items and the table entitled \"Supplemental Financial and Operating Data\" for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items.\nHighlights\nAMN Healthcare delivered another record year in 2017, achieving milestone levels for revenue and profitability. MSP revenue reached $800 million in 2017, representing 40% of consolidated revenue. Nurse and Allied segment grew full year revenue 5% year over year, with 8% growth excluding labor disruption staffing. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $509 million increased 4% year over year; Travel Nurse revenue up by 8%, and Travel Allied up 6%. Executed a new $400 million revolving credit facility, adding long-term liquidity for further investment in growth opportunities. The Company's effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 29% for 2018 due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\"In 2017, AMN Healthcare achieved many new milestones, while partnering with our clients and healthcare professionals to enable the delivery of quality patient care every day. As a result we hit new highs in revenue and earnings and delivered a total shareholder return of 28%,\" said Susan R. Salka, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. \"This performance is a direct result of our organization's unwavering focus on providing exceptional service in an unpredictable year for the healthcare industry. We are grateful for the incredible efforts of everyone on the AMN team, which made strides in broadening our portfolio of solutions and making an impact in the communities we serve.\"\n\"AMN enters 2018 uniquely positioned as the most capable partner and go-to problem-solver to help our clients balance their labor supply, cost and flexibility,\" added Ms. Salka. \"With favorable economic and macro conditions along with the best talent and solutions in the industry, we are set up well for another year of growth.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nConsolidated revenue for the quarter was $509 million, a 4% increase over prior year and 3% higher than the third quarter of 2017.\nRevenue for the Nurse and Allied Solutions segment was $321 million, higher by 4% year over year and up 6% sequentially. The Travel Nurse division continued to perform well with revenue up 8% year over year and 6% sequentially. Allied division revenue increased 6% year over year and 2% sequentially.\nLocum Tenens Solutions segment revenue was $108 million, up 4% year over year and down 3% on a sequential basis. Other Workforce Solutions segment revenue was $80 million reflecting an increase of 5% year over year and down 1% sequentially, with year-over-year growth driven by the interim leadership, VMS, health information management and workforce optimization businesses, partially offset by declines in the permanent placement businesses.\nGross margin was 31.8%, lower by 70 basis points year over year and 50 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year gross margin decline was due primarily to lower bill-to-pay spreads in Locum Tenens and a business mix change in the Other Workforce Solutions segment. The sequential gross margin decline was driven primarily by the lower Locum Tenens gross margin and a seasonal business mix shift.\nSG&A expenses were $100 million, or 19.7% of revenue, compared with $101 million, or 20.7% of revenue, in the same quarter last year. Expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased year over year due to improved operating leverage. SG&A was $101 million, or 20.3% of revenue, in the previous quarter.\nNet income was $41 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared with $26 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.63. Adjustments exclude amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, net of tax, and a one-time income tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted EBITDA was $64 million, a year-over-year increase of 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.6%, representing a 10 basis point increase both year over year and on a sequential basis.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 300,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $43.52 per share, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of $13 million.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nFull year 2017 consolidated revenue was $1,988 million, an increase of 5% from prior year. Nurse and Allied Solutions segment revenue was $1,239 million, a year-over-year increase of 5%. Locum Tenens Solutions segment revenue was $431 million, 2% growth compared with the prior year. Other Workforce Solutions segment revenue was $319 million, an annual increase of 9%.\nFull year gross margin was 32.4% compared with 32.6% for the prior year. The decrease was due to lower bill to pay spreads in the Locum Tenens Solutions segment and an unfavorable change in business mix in our Other Workforce Solutions segment, partially offset by higher gross margin in the Nurse and Allied Solutions segment driven primarily by lower direct costs during 2017.\nFull-year SG&A expenses were $400 million, representing 20.1% of revenue compared with 20.9% for the prior year. The decrease in SG&A margin was due primarily to operating leverage on the revenue growth.\nFull-year net income was $133 million, and net income per diluted common share was $2.68. Adjusted net income per diluted common share was $2.56. Adjustments excluded amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, net of tax, excess tax benefits relating to a change in stock compensation accounting, and a one-time income tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Full-year adjusted EBITDA grew 8% to $256 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.9% in fiscal 2017 represented a 40 basis point increase over prior year.\nAt December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $15 million. Cash flow from operations was $19 million for the quarter and $115 million for the full year. Capital expenditures were $9 million in the quarter and $27 million for the year. The Company ended the year with total debt outstanding of $325 million, with a leverage ratio as calculated in accordance with the Company's credit agreement of 1.3 to 1.\nAs noted in a previously issued press release, on February 9, 2018, the Company entered into a new $400 million revolving credit facility, replacing the previous $275 million credit facility. This five-year agreement includes lower pricing and improved terms.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Outlook\nMetric\nGuidance*\nConsolidated revenue\n$516 - $522 million\nGross margin\n32.0%\nSG&A as percentage of revenue\n20.0%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n12.5-13.0%\n*\nNote: Guidance percentage metrics are approximate. For a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA margin, see the table entitled \"Reconciliation of Guidance Adjusted EBITDA Margin to Guidance Operating Margin\" below.\nProjected year-over-year growth of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 is approximately 5%. Travel Nurse Staffing, our largest business, is expected to grow revenue 8-9% year over year. No labor disruption revenue is included in the first quarter guidance, nor was there any in the prior-year quarter.\nWith the recent passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company estimates its effective income tax rate will be approximately 29% in 2018. Implementing regulations are pending and could change our expectations about how to apply the new law.\nConference Call on February 15, 2018\nAMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

These non-GAAP financial measures include (1) adjusted EBITDA, (2) adjusted EBITDA margin and (3) adjusted diluted EPS.

unallocated corporate overhead, acquisition and integration costs and share-based compensation.\n(3)\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income plus interest expense (net of interest income) and other, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition and integration costs and share-based compensation. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA provides an effective measure of the Company's results, as it excludes certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance and is a measure used in the Company's credit agreement and the indenture governing our 5.125% Senior Notes due 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor has it been presented as an alternative to income from operations or net income as an indicator of operating performance. Although management believes that some of the items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are not indicative of the Company's operating performance, these items do impact the statement of comprehensive income, and management therefore utilizes adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure in conjunction with GAAP measures such as net income.\n(4)\nAdjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.\n(5)\nThe consolidated effective tax rate for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was favorably affected by the recording of excess tax benefits relating to equity awards vested and exercised during the period. As a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement on January 1, 2017, we no longer record excess tax benefits as an increase to additional paid-in capital, but record such excess tax benefits on a prospective basis as a reduction of income tax expense, which amounted to $68,000 and $5,449,000 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The magnitude of the impact of excess tax benefits generated in the future, which may be favorable or unfavorable, is dependent upon the Company's future grants of share-based compensation, the Company's future stock price on the date awards vest or exercise in relation to the fair value of the awards on the grant date or the exercise behavior of the Company's stock appreciation rights holders. Since these favorable tax benefits are largely unrelated to our current year's income before taxes and is unrepresentative of our normal effective tax rate, we excluded their impact on adjusted diluted EPS for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. In addition, during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a discrete net tax benefit of $14,039,000 and a discrete tax expense of $1,000,000 from a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and prior period share based awards, respectively. We excluded these non-cash items from adjusted diluted EPS for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as they were unrelated to our current year's income before taxes.\n(6)\nAdjusted diluted EPS represents GAAP diluted EPS excluding the impact of (A) amortization of intangible assets, (B) acquisition and integration costs, (C) deferred financing costs, (D) tax effect, if any, of the foregoing adjustments, (E) excess tax benefits relating to equity awards vested and exercised since January 1, 2017, and (F) discrete tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's corporate rate reduction on the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities and discrete tax expense from prior period share-based awards. Management included this non-GAAP measure to provide investors and prospective investors with an alternative method for assessing the Company's operating results in a manner that is focused on its operating performance and to provide a more consistent basis for comparison between periods. However, investors and prospective investors should note that this non-GAAP measure involves judgment by management (in particular, judgment as to what is classified as a special item to be excluded from adjusted diluted EPS). Although management believes the items excluded from adjusted diluted EPS are not indicative of the Company's operating performance, these items do impact the statement of comprehensive income, and management therefore utilizes adjusted diluted EPS as an operating performance measure in conjunction with GAAP measures such as GAAP diluted EPS.\n(7)\nAverage healthcare professionals on assignment represents the average number of nurse and allied healthcare professionals on assignment during the period presented.\n(8)\nDays filled is calculated by dividing the locum tenens hours filled during the period by eight hours.\n(9)\nRevenue per day filled represents revenue of the Company's locum tenens solutions segment divided by days filled for the period presented.\n(10)\nLeverage ratio represents the ratio of the consolidated funded indebtedness (as calculated per the Company's credit agreement) at the end of the subject period to the consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as calculated per the Company's credit agreement) for the twelve-month period ended at the end of the subject period.\n(11)\nGuidance percentage metrics are approximate.\n releases/amn-healthcare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300599761.html\nSOURCE AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.",
