    "text": " 37 AM / in 11 minutes UPDATE 1-Chevron sells 1st condensate cargo from Australia's Wheatstone LNG Reuters Staff \n* Chevron sells cargo to PTT for Feb loading dates \n* Woodside to market 2nd cargo loading in April-May (Adds details) \nBy Florence Tan and Jessica Jaganathan \nSINGAPORE, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has sold the first condensate cargo to be exported from the Wheatstone LNG project in Australia to Thailand’s PTT, three sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday. \nThe 650,000-barrel cargo will load in February and was likely done at a small discount to dated Brent, they said. \nChevron has chartered an Aframax-sized oil tanker Maersk Princess to load condensate from Australia on Feb. 21 and that is likely to be for the PTT sale, according to one of the sources and shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. \nChevron declined to comment. PTT does not typically discuss commercial matters and did not immediately respond to an email request for comment. \nCondensate production capacity of the Wheatstone and Lago fields, and nearby third-party fields, is 30,000 barrels per day, Chevron has said on its website, and original development plans called for the oil to load from the Ashburton terminal on the northern coast of Western Australia. \nThe condensate - an ultra light oil that is often produced alongside natural gas - is expected to have an API gravity of about 66 degrees, the sources said. \nWoodside Petroleum - one of the partners in the Wheatstone project - could market a second condensate cargo from the project for loading in April-May, the sources said. \nWoodside as well does not usually comment on commercial matters and did not respond to an email enquiry. \nChevron’s chief executive said on Friday that the second train at Wheatstone LNG should come online in the second quarter this year. \nThe project started production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in October and exported its first super-chilled gas cargo to Japan in the same month.
