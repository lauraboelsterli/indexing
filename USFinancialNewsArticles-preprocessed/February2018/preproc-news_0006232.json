Our Sovereign Advisory practice also remained active, advising governments, sovereign and sub-sovereign entities across developed and emerging markets.\nRestructuring operating revenue was $262 million for 2017, up 30% from 2016. During or since 2017, we have been engaged in a broad range of highly visible and complex restructuring and debt advisory assignments, including publicly announced roles for: CGG; J.Crew; Takata; Toshiba; and Toys “R” Us.\nFourth Quarter\nFinancial Advisory operating revenue was $335 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, 17% lower than the record fourth quarter of 2016.\nStrategic Advisory operating revenue was $302 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, 18% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRestructuring operating revenue was $33 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, 8% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPlease see M&A transactions on which Lazard advised in the fourth quarter, or continued to advise or completed since December 31, 2017, as well as Capital Advisory, Sovereign Advisory and Restructuring assignments, on pages 8 –11 of this release.\nAsset Management\nIn the text portion of this press release, we present our Asset Management results as 1) Management fees and other revenue, and 2) Incentive fees.\nFull Year\nAsset Management operating revenue was a record $1,240 million for 2017, 20% higher than 2016.\nManagement fees and other revenue was a record $1,194 million for 2017, 18% higher than 2016. Incentive fees were $46 million for 2017, compared to $16 million for 2016.\nAverage assets under management (AUM) for 2017 was a record $227 billion, 16% higher than 2016.\nAUM as of December 31, 2017 was a record $249 billion, up 26% from December 31, 2016. Net inflows for 2017 were $3.1 billion.\nFourth Quarter\nAsset Management operating revenue was a record $339 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, 23% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016.\nManagement fees and other revenue was a record $320 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, 22% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016, and 3% higher than the third quarter of 2017. Incentive fees were $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $12 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAverage AUM for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a record $244 billion, 22% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016, and 4% higher than the third quarter of 2017.\nAUM as of December 31, 2017, increased 5% from September 30, 2017. The sequential increase was primarily driven by market appreciation, foreign exchange movement, and net inflows of $137 million.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nCompensation and Benefits\nIn managing compensation and benefits expense, we focus on annual awarded compensation (cash compensation and benefits plus deferred incentive compensation with respect to the applicable year, net of estimated future forfeitures and excluding charges). We believe annual awarded compensation reflects the actual annual compensation cost more accurately than the GAAP measure of compensation cost, which includes applicable-year cash compensation and the amortization of deferred incentive compensation principally attributable to previous years’ deferred compensation. We believe that by managing our business using awarded compensation with a consistent deferral policy, we can better manage our compensation costs, increase our flexibility in the future and build shareholder value over time.\nAdjusted compensation and benefits expense 1 for 2017 was $1,481 million, 12% higher than 2016, with a consistent deferral policy. The corresponding adjusted compensation ratio 1 was 55.8% for 2017, compared to 56.5% for 2016.\nAwarded compensation expense 1 for 2017 was $1,476 million, 12% higher than 2016. The corresponding awarded compensation ratio 1 was 55.6% for 2017, compared to 56.2% for 2016.\nWe take a disciplined approach to compensation, and our goal is to maintain a compensation-to-operating revenue ratio over the cycle in the mid- to high-50s percentage range on both an awarded and adjusted basis, with consistent deferral policies.\nNon-Compensation Expense\nAdjusted non-compensation expense 1 for 2017 was $461 million, 6% higher than 2016. The ratio of non-compensation expense to operating revenue 1 was 17.4% for 2017, compared to 18.5% for 2016.\nAdjusted non-compensation expense 1 for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $127 million, 10% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily reflecting increased marketing costs and investments in the business. The ratio of non-compensation expense to operating revenue 1 was 18.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 16.8% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOur goal remains to achieve an adjusted non-compensation expense-to-operating revenue ratio over the cycle of 16% to 20%.\nTAXES\nThe provision for taxes, on an adjusted basis 1 , was $159 million for full-year 2017 and $28 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate on the same basis was 24.1% for full-year 2017, compared to 23.7% for full-year 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our U.S. GAAP provision for income taxes included a charge of approximately $420 million, primarily relating to the reduction in certain deferred tax assets, with an offsetting benefit of approximately $203 million relating to the reduction in our Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA) obligation.\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND BALANCE SHEET\nOur primary capital management goals include managing debt and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nIn 2017, Lazard returned $716 million to shareholders, which included: $341 million in dividends; $307 million in share repurchases of our Class A common stock; and $68 million in satisfaction of employee tax obligations in lieu of share issuances upon vesting of equity grants.\nDuring 2017, we repurchased 7.0 million shares of our Class A common stock for an average price of $44.10 per share. In line with our objectives, these repurchases more than offset the potential dilution from our 2016 year-end equity-based compensation awards (net of estimated forfeitures and tax withholding to be paid in cash in lieu of share issuances), which were granted at an average price of $43.42 per share. As of January 30, 2018, our remaining share repurchase authorization was $220 million.\nOn January 31, 2018, Lazard declared dividends totaling $1.71 per share, comprised of a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and an extra cash dividend of $1.30 per share, on Lazard’s outstanding Class A common stock. The dividends are payable on February 23, 2018, to stockholders of record on February 12, 2018.\nLazard’s financial position remains strong. As of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $1,484 million, and stockholders’ equity related to Lazard’s interests was $1,201 million.\n***\nCONFERENCE CALL\nLazard will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. EST on February 1, 2018, to discuss the company’s financial results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2017.

See attached financial schedules and related notes for a detailed explanation of adjustments to corresponding U.S. GAAP results. We believe that presenting our results on an adjusted basis, in addition to U.S. GAAP results, is the most meaningful and useful way to compare our operating results across periods.\n2 Fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2017 were affected primarily by the following charges:\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our U.S. GAAP provision for income taxes included a charge of approximately $420 million primarily relating to the reduction in certain deferred tax assets, with an offsetting benefit of approximately $203 million relating to the reduction in our Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA) obligation. On a U.S. GAAP basis, these items resulted in a net charge of $1.81 (diluted) per share in the quarter, and $1.64 (diluted) per share for full-year 2017. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 adjusted results exclude pre-tax charges of (i) $9.9 million and $25.3 million, respectively, of costs associated with the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, and (ii) $6.8 million and $11.4 million, respectively, of office space reorganization costs primarily relating to incremental rent expense, lease abandonment costs and an onerous lease provision. On a U.S. GAAP basis, these items collectively resulted in a net charge of $10.6 million, or $0.09 (diluted) per share, in the fourth quarter and a net charge of $23.4 million, or $0.18 (diluted) per share, for full-year 2017. Full-year 2017 adjusted results also exclude post-tax charges of $6.6 million of acquisition-related items, primarily reflecting changes in fair value of contingent consideration associated with certain business acquisitions. On a U.S. GAAP basis, this resulted in a charge of $0.05 (diluted) per share for full-year 2017.\nLAZ-EPE\nFINANCIAL ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS\nMergers and Acquisitions (Completed in the fourth quarter of 2017)\nAmong the large, publicly announced M&A Advisory transactions or assignments completed during the fourth quarter of 2017 on which Lazard advised were the following:\nLevel 3 Communications on its $34 billion sale to CenturyLink Gilead’s $11.9 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma Paysafe’s £3.0 billion recommended sale to a consortium of funds managed or advised by Blackstone and CVC Express Scripts’ $3.6 billion acquisition of eviCore healthcare Anheuser-Busch InBev’s $3.2 billion transition of its 54.5% stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa to The Coca-Cola Company Blackstone and Alliance Industries Group on the $2.0 billion sale of Alliance Automotive Group to Genuine Parts Blackstone in CF Corporation’s $1.8 billion consortium acquisition of Fidelity & Guaranty Life Special Committee of the Board of Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT I in the company’s $1.0 billion acquisition of real estate assets and the third party asset management business from Phillips Edison Limited Partnership Landauer’s $770 million sale to Fortive Hotel Investment Partners €631 million sale to Blackstone Investcorp’s €605 million sale of Esmalglass to Lone Star Funds Accella Performance Materials’ $670 million sale to Carlisle Companies SciClone Pharmaceuticals’ $605 million sale to a consortium led by GL Capital Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan’s sale of a minority stake in Busy Bees to Temasek IPFS’s acquisition of Premium Assignment Corporation from SunTrust The Ferrero Group’s acquisition of Ferrara Candy Company The Carlyle Group’s acquisition of ADB SAFEGATE IK Investment Partners’ sale of Schenck Process to Blackstone KKR Credit’s sale of its shareholding in URSA to Xella International ITS ConGlobal on its sale to AMP Capital\nMergers and Acquisitions (Announced)\nAmong the ongoing, large, publicly announced M&A transactions and assignments on which Lazard advised during or since the 2017 fourth quarter, or completed since December 31, 2017, are the following:\nAetna’s $77 billion sale to CVS Health Altice on its $40 billion group reorganization, including the spin-off of Altice USA and new Altice Europe structure Unibail-Rodamco’s $24.7 billion acquisition of Westfield Sempra Energy’s acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in Oncor, valuing Oncor at $18.8 billion Calpine’s $17.1 billion sale to a consortium led by Energy Capital Partners Great Plains Energy’s $14 billion merger of equals with Westar Energy Sanofi’s $11.6 billion acquisition of Bioverativ Safran’s €8.7 billion acquisition of Zodiac Aerospace Thales’ €5.6 billion acquisition of Gemalto through a recommended all-cash offer WGL Holdings’ $6.4 billion sale to AltaGas Bacardi’s $5.1 billion acquisition of Patrón Tequila WestRock’s $4.9 billion acquisition of KapStone Sanofi’s €3.9 billion acquisition of Ablynx Hammerson’s £3.4 billion recommended all-share offer for Intu Properties AVEVA’s $4.7 billion combination with Schneider Electric’s industrial software business NJJ Capital in the €3.5 billion consortium acquisition of eir Clayton, Dubilier & Rice on their acquisition of a 40% stake in Belron, valuing Belron at €3.0 billion The Ferrero Group’s $2.8 billion acquisition of Nestlé’s U.S. confectionary business Genworth Financial’s $2.7 billion sale to China Oceanwide Special Committee of the Board of Directors of General Communication, Inc.
