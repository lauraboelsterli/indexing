    "text": "SANTA ROSA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: KEYS), a leading technology company that helps enterprises, service providers, and governments accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, announced today that Mark Pierpoint has been named senior vice president of Keysight, and president of the Ixia Solutions Group effective February 7, 2018. Pierpoint had been serving as acting president of Ixia Solutions Group since previous president Bethany Mayer resigned from Keysight effective December 1, 2017.\nPrior to Pierpoint’s leadership role with Keysight’s Ixia Solutions Group, he was the vice president and general manager of Internet Infrastructure Solutions within the company’s Communications Solutions Group since 2015, responsible for developing and delivering solutions across the commercial communications network, from network access points to data centers and the cloud. Prior to that role, he led Keysight’s modular software and instrument initiatives. Pierpoint joined the business in 1987 when it was part of Hewlett-Packard and has held multiple management positions in R&D, marketing and operations across various businesses and geographies. He earned his Ph.D. in microwave engineering and his bachelor’s degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom.\n“In his role as acting president of the Ixia Solutions Group, Mark has demonstrated leadership in successfully completing the system integration of Ixia into Keysight and delivering customer solutions to make networks and applications stronger,” said Ron Nersesian, Keysight’s CEO and president. “I look forward to working with Mark to accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world.”\n“As founder of Ixia, I am proud to be part of Keysight and delighted to see Mark take over as president of this great business,” said Errol Ginsberg. “His strong technical background, style and leadership are a great cultural fit to take Ixia solutions to the next level for customers’ network test, visibility, and security.”\nKeysight acquired Ixia in April 2017. Keysight’s Ixia Solutions Group provides testing, visibility, and security solutions to strengthen networks and cloud environments for enterprises, service providers, and network equipment manufacturers. Ixia Solutions offer organizations trusted environments in which to develop, deploy, and operate.
