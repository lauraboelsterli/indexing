    "text": "Strong Fourth Quarter Distribution Coverage Ratio of 1.59x, Full Year Coverage of 1.18x Net income of $17.1 million for 2017 Detailed 2018 Cash Flow Guidance to be Released on February 21st\nKILGORE, Texas, Martin Midstream Partners L.P. (Nasdaq:MMLP) (the \"Partnership\") announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nRuben Martin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Martin Midstream GP LLC, the general partner of the Partnership said, “During the fourth quarter, the Partnership generated strong cash flow with adjusted EBITDA of $49.3 million which exceeded our guidance level. Based on this solid performance, distributable cash flow was $31.2 million with a 1.59 times distribution coverage ratio for the quarter. For the full year 2017, the Partnership's adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow were approximately $156.2 and $91.1 million, respectively. When compared to full year guidance, we fell modestly short of cash flow expectations by $1.2 million, however, we exceeded distributable cash flow expectations by $0.8 million and generated a solid distribution coverage of 1.18 times. As is typical in our business cycle, we often follow the third quarter, our seasonally weakest, with our strongest cash flowing quarter. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter, we saw the positive seasonal impacts of our fertilizer and butane businesses fully restored.\n“As expected, based on price performance and a strong storage season last summer, we realized robust performance from our Natural Gas Services segment. Specifically, our butane optimization business exceeded expectations during the quarter. Also within the segment, we experienced better than anticipated interruptible services revenue from our Cardinal Gas Storage division. For the full year 2017, our Natural Gas Services segment trailed guidance by $0.7 million, or 0.7%. Generally speaking, we met our cash flow target within the segment as our slight miss to guidance was primarily due to the continued delay with the WTLPG pipeline tariff challenge process currently in front of the Texas Railroad Commission. Last year our expected cash flow included a resolution to this matter by the end of the third quarter. As this did not occur, our cash flow attributed to distributions from WTLPG were below planned levels.\n“Our Terminalling and Storage segment missed fourth quarter and full year guidance estimates primarily attributed to repair expenses and lost revenue from Hurricane Harvey. During the fourth quarter, the Partnership incurred hurricane related costs totaling $2.8 million, of which $2.4 million related to the Terminalling and Storage segment. For the full year 2017, the Terminalling and Storage segment missed cash flow guidance by approximately $4.3 million, or 7.3%, again the majority of this variance to guidance was attributed to the negative impact of Hurricane Harvey during the third and fourth quarters. Looking ahead, we expect a full recovery of cash flow in our specialty and legacy terminalling divisions and the full year benefit of our Hondo asphalt terminal in 2018.\n“Our Sulfur Services segment posted a strong fourth quarter. We exceeded cash flow guidance by $3.6 million, or approximately 70.6%. This is primarily attributed to stronger than forecasted fertilizer margins as product volume sold matched our expectation during the quarter. Additionally, within the segment, we experienced strong demand for our prilling services as the export pricing alternative was greater than domestic prices. For the full year 2017, the Sulfur Services segment exceeded cash flow guidance by approximately $4.2 million, or 14.1%.\n“Marine Transportation modestly outperformed our guidance expectations for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017. During the quarter we benefitted from a continued reduction in operating expenses. For the full year 2017, we cut operating expenses by approximately $8.4 million reflective of the reduction in our fleet by 13 assets over the last two years. Based on this commitment to cost reduction, we exceed 2017 full year cash flow guidance by approximately $0.3 million, or 4.5%.\n“As 2017 finished with a strong distribution coverage, we remain comfortable with the current annualized distribution run-rate of $2.00 per unit. We look forward to February 21 when we will deliver our full year detailed 2018 cash flow guidance.”\nThe Partnership had net income for the fourth quarter 2017 of $18.8 million, or $0.47 per limited partner unit. The Partnership had net income for the fourth quarter 2016 of $17.9 million, or $0.49 per limited partner unit. For the fourth quarter of 2016, net income was positively impacted by the gain on disposition of the Partnership's terminalling assets located in Corpus Christi, Texas of $37.3 million and negatively impacted by non-cash impairment charges of $27.0 million. Of these non-cash impairment charges, $15.3 million occurred in our Terminalling and Storage segment and was related to the discontinuation of certain organic growth projects no longer deemed economically viable. Additionally, our Marine Transportation segment experienced an $11.7 million non-cash charge related to the planned disposal of certain inland and offshore non-core transportation assets. The Partnership's adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2017 was $49.3 million compared to adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2016 of $52.3 million.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17.1 million, or $0.44 per limited partner unit. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $31.7 million, or $0.65 per limited partner unit. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was positively impacted by the gain on disposition of the Partnership's terminalling assets located in Corpus Christi, Texas of $37.3 million and negatively impacted by non-cash impairment charges of $31.1 million. Of these non-cash impairment charges, $15.3 million occurred in our Terminalling and Storage segment and was related to the discontinuation of certain organic growth projects no longer deemed economically viable. Additionally, our Marine Transportation segment experienced an $11.7 million non-cash charge related to the planned disposal of certain inland and offshore non-core transportation assets and a $4.1 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. The Partnership's adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $156.2 million compared to adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $176.6 million.\nThe Partnership's distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $31.2 million compared to distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $35.8 million.\nThe Partnership's distributable cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $91.1 million compared to distributable cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $113.7 million.\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $305.7 million compared to $236.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $946.1 million compared to $827.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDistributable cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures which are explained in greater detail below under the heading \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.\" The Partnership has also included below a table entitled \"Reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Distributable Cash Flow\" in order to show the components of these non-GAAP financial measures and their reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measurement.\nIncluded with this press release are the Partnership's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 and certain prior periods. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K, to be filed with the SEC on February 16, 2018.\nAn attachment accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/8b25966a-2220-4b67-b6ad-a8a5eabca95f .\nInvestors' Conference Call\nAn investors’ conference call to review the fourth quarter results will be held on Thursday, February 15, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Central Time.

The Partnership's primary business segments include: (1) natural gas services, including liquids transportation and distribution services and natural gas storage; (2) terminalling, storage and packaging services for petroleum products and by-products; (3) sulfur and sulfur-based products processing, manufacturing, marketing and distribution; and (4) marine transportation services for petroleum products and by-products.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements about the Partnership's outlook and all other statements in this release other than historical facts are within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These and all references to financial estimates rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the Partnership's control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. While the Partnership believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in anticipating or predicting certain important factors. A discussion of these factors, including risks and uncertainties, is set forth in the Partnership's annual and quarterly reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Partnership disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any , including financial estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Partnership's management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements other than its financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to analyze its performance. These include: (1) net income before interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), (2) adjusted EBITDA and (3) distributable cash flow. The Partnership's management views these measures as important performance measures of core profitability for its operations and the ability to generate and distribute cash flow, and as key components of its internal financial reporting. The Partnership's management believes investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA . Certain items excluded from EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing an entity's financial performance, such as cost of capital and historical costs of depreciable assets. The Partnership has included information concerning EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because it provides investors and management with additional information to better understand the following: financial performance of the Partnership's assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; the Partnership's operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other similarly situated entities; and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects. The Partnership's method of computing adjusted EBITDA may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other entities. The economic substance behind the Partnership's use of adjusted EBITDA is to measure the ability of the Partnership's assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support its indebtedness and make distributions to its unitholders.\nDistributable Cash Flow. Distributable cash flow is a significant performance measure used by the Partnership's management and by external users of its financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to compare basic cash flows generated by the Partnership to the cash distributions it expects to pay unitholders. Distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for the Partnership's unitholders since it serves as an indicator of the Partnership's success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not the Partnership is generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in its quarterly distribution rates. Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit's yield, which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure presented in accordance with GAAP. The Partnership's method of computing these measures may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other entities.\nAdditional information concerning the Partnership is
