    "text": "Feb 8 (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co, the biggest U.S. tire maker, reported a fourth-quarter loss on Thursday due to a $299 million charge related to changes in tax laws.\nThe company posted a net loss of $96 million, or 39 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $561 million, or $2.14 per share, a year earlier.\nHowever, revenue rose 8.8 percent to $4.07 billion, boosted by higher sales of its tires in the Americas region, its biggest market.
