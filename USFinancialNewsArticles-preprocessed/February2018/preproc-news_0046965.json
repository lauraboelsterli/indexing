    "text": "By Tom Huddleston Jr. 12:37 PM EST \nBlack Panther sprung into the record books with a massive opening weekend that came at the hands of a mostly non-white audience—not to mention with more women than your typical superhero flick. \nThe trailblazing superhero movie from Walt Disney’s Marvel Studios easily topped Hollywood’s box office with one of the biggest theatrical debuts ever, grossing more than $426 million worldwide over the President’s Day holiday weekend. Millions of people around the world lined up at their local movie theater to watch Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa/Black Panther battle for the throne in the fictional African country of Wakanda. \nIn the U.S., 37% of the movie’s overall audience was African-American, which is well above the norm as the average movie audience is about 15% African-American, according to box office tracking company ComScore. White moviegoers made up just 35% of Black Panther ‘s audience over its opening weekend. That an exceptional percentage of African-American viewers turned out for the highly-anticipated movie’s debut is not so surprising, considering that the movie had generated considerable buzz, thanks to its overall critical acclaim and the fact that it boasts an African-American director (a first for a Marvel superhero movie) and a mostly black cast led by Boseman, Lupita Nyong’o, Michael B. Jordan, and Angela Bassett. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nThe real surprise from Black Panther ‘s huge arrival was just how high its box-office totals have climbed in only a few days. The movie is the latest and largest rejoinder to outdated and extremely misguided Hollywood concerns over the ability of movies featuring black-led casts and storylines to become legitimate blockbusters. Following recent strong box-office showings from movies like last year’s Get Out and Girls Trip , along with 2015’s Straight Outta Compton (all three of which were distributed by Universal Pictures), Black Panther ‘s roaring success serves as yet another lesson that increased diversity on the big screen can also provide a boost at the box office. \nPaul Dergarabedian, ComScore’s senior media analyst, raised the idea of Black Panther as “a game changer in terms of its ability to erase outdated perceptions of what can constitute a blockbuster/superhero movie,” in an e-mail to Fortune . “The across the board appeal of the film reflects that there are no apparent cultural limitations on the interest and love that people have for Black Panther ,” he added. \nMeanwhile, a higher percentage of women also showed up for Black Panther ‘s opening weekend. Women represented 45% of the movie’s audience, which is less than the average moviegoing population but more than the typical female turnout for a superhero movie. The average superhero movie (many of which are led by mostly male characters) draws a 62% male audience, though Black Panther and last year’s Wonder Woman have bucked that trend . \nWarner Bros.’s Wonder Woman scored box-office success with a majority female audience when it opened last summer . While Black Panther ‘s main character is male, the movie features several lead female characters—including Nyong’o, as well as T’Challa’s sister, Shuri, played by Letitia Wright . And, like Wonder Woman ‘s island of female warriors, Black Panther ‘s fictional Wakanda features the Dora Milaje, an elite squad of women fighters sworn to protect the country’s king. \nWhether the issue is finding more screen time for minorities and women in Hollywood , Black Panther is the latest example that diversity and inclusion can be sound investments in the movie business.
