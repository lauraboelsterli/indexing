    "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday it would adhere to commitments under its 2015 international nuclear agreement, signed with six world powers to limit its disputed nuclear program.\nRelated Coverage U.S. calls for action to halt Iran's growing 'network of proxies' “We will adhere to our commitments made,” Rouhani said at an event in New Delhi. “After signing a contract, haggling with it is ridiculous.”\nUnder the agreement signed with the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of many sanctions.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing for changes to the agreement.\n“If the U.S. violates this agreement... you will see that America will regret this decision,” he said adding his country had always adhered to contracts deals so long as other party did not violate the contract.\nRouhani arrived in India on a three-day visit part of efforts to expand bilateral ties and cooperation in economic development.\nReporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
