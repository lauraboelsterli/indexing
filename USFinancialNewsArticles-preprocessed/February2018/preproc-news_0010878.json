    "text": "February 5, 2018 / 11:20 PM / in 13 hours Trump calls Democrats 'treasonous' for chilly State of the Union reception Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday accused Democrats of being “un-American” and “treasonous” for their lack of applause during his State of the Union address last week when he spoke of rising wages and historically low African-American unemployment. \n“They would rather see Trump do badly than our country do well. That’s what it means,” Trump said during an address on tax reform at a manufacturing plant in Ohio. “It’s very selfish. It was bad energy.” \n“They were like death and un-American,” said Trump. “Somebody said ‘treasonous.’ I mean, eh. I guess, why not? Can we call that treason, why not? I mean they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much,” he said. \nTreason is a capital offense and punishable by death in the United States. \nDemocrats gave Trump a decidedly cool reaction during the State of the Union. While falling unemployment has begun to lift wages, business executives are mixed on how much to credit Trump.

Wage growth, however, has been sluggish, although it has shown signs of picking up recently. \nDuring last Tuesday’s address, the president touted his tax cuts and regulation rollbacks as the reason Americans are finally seeing more wages after “years and years” of stagnation. \n“Every American should be alarmed by how @realDonaldTrump is working to make loyalty to him synonymous with loyalty to our country,” Representative Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, said in a tweet. “That is not how democracy works.” \nPelosi’s counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, declined a request for comment.
