    "text": "0 COMMENTS After quarters upon quarters of declining sales, Macy’s M 4.59% may be turning a corner. For the first time in three years it reported positive sales growth .\nShares jumped 4.5% Tuesday morning. In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Jeffrey Gennette declared that the company’s leadership has found a “clear path to return Macy’s to growth.”\nAdjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in at $2.82, beating estimates of $2.71, and revenue reached $8.67 billion, an increase of 1.8% over the same period last year. For fiscal year 2017, earnings were $5.04 a share, compared with $1.99 a share a year ago.\nMuch of the company’s success is due to an unusually strong holiday season and consumer optimism. It also acknowledged the benefits of U.S. tax cuts, which boosted earnings by 7 cents a share. \nAnd the company is learning from past mistakes—for instance, by maintaining a healthy inventory so it doesn’t need additional discounts and can respond swiftly to trends. There is a lot of talk of “testing” and “iterating” with initiatives such as its new loyalty program .\nThat emphasis on aggressive experimentation is smart in a challenged industry. Yet Macy’s is still very much in transition. Its guidance for 2018 is optimistic, promising earnings of between $3.55 and $3.75 a share. But it is worth keeping in mind that the industry is suffused with optimism at the moment.\n“If they had to give full-year guidance three months ago or six months from now, it would look different,” says Simeon Siegel of Nomura Securities. “But right now you’re coming on the heels of a strong holiday season and tax savings.”\nNone of retail’s structural challenges have disappeared. Macy’s, which had seemed to be among the industry’s losers, suddenly looks as if it stands a chance of making it out among the winners. As Mr. Gennette acknowledged, though, “We still have a lot to do and a lot to improve.”\nWrite to Elizabeth Winkler at elizabeth.winkler@wsj.com",
