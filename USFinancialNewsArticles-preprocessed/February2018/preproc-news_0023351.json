    "text": "The Trump administration released the full text of its infrastructure proposal to Congress on Monday.\nThe plan includes $200 billion in federal funds that are intended to stimulate more than $1.5 trillion in spending mostly from local and state governments and private entities over a decade. \nIn a letter addressed to Congress at the beginning of the proposal, President Donald Trump asks lawmakers to \"act soon\" on a bill that would:\nStimulate at least $1.5 trillion in new investment over the next decade; Shorten the approval process for projects to two years or less; Focus on infrastructure needs for rural areas; Encourage training for American workers; Create opportunities for state and local governments to invest in \"large-scale infrastructure projects.\" Trump, who often touts his history as a real estate developer, made infrastructure one of the pillars of his presidential campaign. However, the president has indicated that he is skeptical of public-private partnerships, a key part of the White House's plan .",
