    "text": "PARIS, Feb 13 (Reuters) - French investment bank Natixis reported an unexpected rise in quarterly net profit, as stronger revenue growth in asset management helped offset a widespread trading slowdown.\nNatixis, majority owned by retail banking group BPCE, said net income had risen 5 percent to 518 million euros ($640.35 million). Analysts had expected a 22 percent fall in profits to 386 million euros, according to a Reuters poll.\nRevenues fell 1 percent over the period to 2.51 billion euros, compared to 2.31 billion euros expected by analysts.\n“The 4Q17 tax rate notably benefited from a 100 million euros positive impact from the U.S. tax reforms (write-down of deferred tax liabilities),” the bank said in a statement.\n$1 = 0.8089 euros Reporting by Maya Nikolaeva Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
