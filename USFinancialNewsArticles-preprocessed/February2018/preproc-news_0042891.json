A widely recognized leader in the cable industry, Bergman will bring experience in the development and deployment of new digital technologies and expertise in operational and customer enhancements.\n“Technology is accelerating the transformation of global infrastructure markets and project delivery approaches,” said Steve Edwards, Chairman and CEO of Black & Veatch. “Nomi’s experience in innovation and the adoption of revolutionary technologies within large-scale, distributed organizations will add tremendous value to the Board as we chart Black & Veatch’s path forward.”\nAs Senior Executive, Bergman serves as a senior advisor to the Advance/Newhouse partnership businesses and corporate development program, providing advice to the company in matters related to strategy, technology and investments.\n“Black & Veatch has a well-earned reputation as a leader in the critical human infrastructure sector delivering strong value and performance for its clients and employee shareholders,” said Bergman. “With the rise of data analytics, machine learning and advanced communications and transportation technologies, it is important to respect our heritage, while focusing on how we must evolve to be successful in the future. I look forward to working with the Board, and professionals across the company’s global operations, to build upon our successes.”\nPreviously, Bergman was a founding member of the Bright House Networks team, spending 15 years with the multi-state cable operator (MSO) based in Syracuse, New York, until its merger with Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable in 2016. At Bright House Networks, she focused on mobile, data and video communications, information technology and data services, advanced advertising, and emerging technologies centered on reimagining and improving the customer experience. In 2009, she was recognized with the Distinguished Vanguard Award for Leadership, which is the National Cable & Telecommunications Association’s (NCTA’s) highest award.\nEditors Notes:\nBergman received a B.S. in Economics and Statistics from the University of Rochester where she later provided service to Board of Trustees.
