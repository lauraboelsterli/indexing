Total revenue for the full year 2017 was $679.7 million, down 1.2% from $688.0 million in 2016.\nSegment Revenue\nFoundry Services Group revenue in the fourth quarter was $80.6 million, up 3.6% year-over year, and up 0.3% from $80.4 million in the prior quarter. Standard Products Group revenue in the fourth quarter was $93.9 million, down 8.4% year-over- year, and down 2.4% sequentially, which primarily reflected changes in the mobile OLED business in both periods.\nTotal Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin\nTotal gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $49.4 million or 28.3% as a percentage of sales as compared with gross profit of $46.1 million or 25.5% gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2016, and $50.3 million or 28.5% gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2017.\nSegment Gross Profit Margin\nFoundry Services Group gross profit margin was 31.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 30.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 30.3% in the third quarter of 2017. The Standard Products Group gross profit margin was 25.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with 21.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 26.9% in the third quarter of 2017.\nOperating Income, Net Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA\nOperating income, on a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter was $7.6 million, as compared with $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $15.5 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nNet income, on a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter was $43.7 million or $1.28 per basic share and $0.99 per diluted share, as compared with a net loss on a GAAP basis of $49.8 million or $1.42 per basic share in the fourth quarter of 2016, and compared with net income of $5.6 million or $0.16 per basic share and $0.15 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarter of 2017, totaled $9.1 million or $0.27 per basic share and $0.23 per diluted share, as compared with Adjusted Net Income of $1.6 million or $0.05 per basic share and $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016, and compared with Adjusted Net Income of $11.4 million or $0.33 per basic share and $0.28 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the fourth quarter was $20.5 million or 11.8% of revenue, as compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 million or 7.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016, and compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $24.7 million or 14.0% of revenue in the third quarter of 2017.\nManagement believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in conjunction with GAAP results, can provide a meaningful understanding of the factors and trends affecting MagnaChip's business and operations and assist in evaluating our core operating performance. However, such non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or as a better indicator of our operating performance than measures that are presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included in this press release.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $128.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter, about flat with $128.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2017.\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our operating segments:\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nNet Sales\nFoundry Services Group\n$\n80,629\n$\n77,809\n$\n320,089\n$\n273,961\nStandard Products Group\nDisplay Solutions\n53,671\n64,796\n209,539\n281,967\nPower Solutions\n40,241\n37,718\n149,836\n131,468\nTotal Standard Products Group\n93,912\n102,514\n359,375\n413,435\nAll other\n39\n139\n208\n573\nTotal net sales\n$\n174,580\n$\n180,462\n$\n679,672\n$\n687,969\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nAmount\n% of\nNet Sales\nAmount\n% of\nNet Sales\nGross Profit\nFoundry Services Group\n$\n25,564\n31.7%\n$\n23,592\n30.3%\nStandard Products Group\n23,748\n25.3\n22,358\n21.8\nAll other\n39\n100.0\n139\n100.0\nTotal gross profit\n$\n49,351\n28.3%\n$\n46,089\n25.5%\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nAmount\n% of\nNet Sales\nAmount\n% of\nNet Sales\nGross Profit\nFoundry Services Group\n$\n95,458\n29.8%\n$\n69,412\n25.3%\nStandard Products Group\n92,227\n25.7\n87,194\n21.1\nAll other\n208\n100.0\n(380)\n(66.3)\nTotal gross profit\n$\n187,893\n27.6%\n$\n156,226\n22.7%\nF ourth Quarter 2017 and Recent Company Highlights\nMagnaChip:\nDeveloped a multi-level thick IMD (Inter-Metal Dielectric) process for a capacitor with ultra-high breakdown voltage, which is useful for electric vehicles and for applications in the industrial, communications and healthcare markets. Announced it now offers a 0.35-micron 700V Ultra-High Voltage process technology (UHV) that reduces mask counts, manufacturing time and cost for power-related AC-DC products. This UHV process technology offers 700V nLDMOS, 700V JFET, and 5.5V CMOS devices suitable for manufacturing AC-DC converter ICs and LED driver ICs. Hosted its annual Foundry Technology Symposium in Hsinchu, Taiwan in October 2017 to showcase the Company's latest technology offerings and provide a wide-ranging overview of its manufacturing capabilities, specialty technologies, target applications and end-markets. The event drew record attendance.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Outlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018, MagnaChip anticipates:\nRevenue to be in the range of $158 million to $164 million, down sequentially 7.8% at the mid-point of the projected range, due to typical seasonal factors and ongoing portfolio optimization activities. The guidance for the first quarter compares with revenue of $174.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $161.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. An increase in silicon wafer prices, a lower fab utilization rate due to seasonal factors and product portfolio optimization activity will result in gross profit margin to be in the range of 26% to 28%. This compares to 28.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 25.7% in the first quarter of 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call\nMagnaChip will hold a conference call on February 6 at 5 p.m. EST to discuss the fourth quarter and 2017 financial results.
