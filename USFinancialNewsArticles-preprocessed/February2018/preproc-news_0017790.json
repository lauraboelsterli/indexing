People are getting their justice rather quickly.\"\nThe #MeToo movement became a social force after The New York Times' blockbuster expose in October revealed a pattern of sexual abuse and unwanted physical contact by disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.\nKatie Kramer | CNBC Bill Murray Since late last year, numerous women have come forward to share their stories of alleged sexual harassment and assault from powerful men in Hollywood and politics.\n\"It's interesting when this kind of movement happens,\" Murray said. \"It creates a kind of compost or fertilizer to make the next stage happen. ... Obviously, things swing back and forth.\"\nMurray, who was interviewed at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament, earned his first Emmy for his work in \"Saturday Night Live\" and starred in such movies as the '80s \"Ghostbusters\" films and the 1993 \"Groundhog Day.\"\nDuring his interview , Murray also spoke on his decision to play former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\nâ€”The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Bill Murray talks politics, Hollywood and impersonating Steve Bannon show chapters Bill Murray talks politics, Hollywood and impersonating Steve Bannon 3 Hours Ago | 07:43 Sign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
