Slideshow (5 Images) The tournament, at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, is near Woods’ South Florida home. He is currently playing at the Genesis Open in Southern California. Woods had been undecided as late as early this week on whether he would play in the tournament for the first time since 2014. The last time the 14 times major winner competed on consecutive weeks on the PGA Tour was the 2015 PGA Championship and the Wyndham Championship, the tour said.
