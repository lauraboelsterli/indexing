    "text": "LEBANON, Tenn., Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (\"Cracker Barrel\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: CBRL) today reported its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended January 26, 2018.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nComparable restaurant sales growth of 1.1% and traffic of -0.9% outperformed the casual dining industry. Net income was $91.1 million, a 72.9% increase over prior year second quarter net income of $52.7 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.79, including a $1.63 per share benefit resulting from the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), compared to $2.19 in the prior year second quarter. Of this $1.63 per share tax benefit, $1.06 resulted from a one-time non-cash revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liability. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.73 when excluding the non-cash revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liability. (See non-GAAP reconciliation below.)\nCommenting on the second quarter, Cracker Barrel President and Chief Executive Officer Sandra B. Cochran said, \"I am pleased that we delivered positive comparable store sales in both restaurant and retail, improved upon our first quarter sales results, and outperformed the casual dining industry. Our second quarter operating income margin was pressured by several factors such as expenses related to our initiatives and increased commodity inflation. Our teams continue to make meaningful progress on key business initiatives as we set the foundation for future growth.\"\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nRevenue\nThe Company reported total revenue of $787.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, representing an increase of 2.0% over the second quarter of the prior year. Cracker Barrel comparable store restaurant sales increased 1.1%, including a 2.0% increase in average check partially offset by a 0.9% decrease in comparable store restaurant traffic. The average menu price increase for the quarter was approximately 2.3%. Comparable store retail sales increased 0.5% from the prior year quarter.\nCracker Barrel comparable store restaurant traffic, average check and comparable store restaurant sales and retail sales for the fiscal months of November, December and January and the second quarter were as follows:\nNovember\nDecember\nJanuary\nSecond\nQuarter (1)\nComparable restaurant traffic\n0.0%\n-1.5%\n-1.2%\n-0.9%\nAverage check\n1.9%\n1.6%\n2.4%\n2.0%\nComparable restaurant sales\n1.9%\n0.1%\n1.2%\n1.1%\nComparable retail sales\n2.9%\n-4.0%\n6.7%\n0.5%\n(1)\nThe Company estimates second quarter inclement weather reduced traffic and sales by\napproximately 0.3%.\nOperating Income\nOperating income in the second quarter was $76.7 million, or 9.7% of total revenue, a decrease from the prior year quarter result of $82.7 million, or 10.7% of total revenue. As a percentage of total revenue, increases in other store operating expenses, cost of goods sold, and general and administrative expenses were partially offset by reductions in labor and related expenses.\nDiluted Earnings per Share\nGAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.79, which includes a $1.63 per share benefit from the Tax Act. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.73, a $0.54 increase over the prior year second quarter.\nTaxes\nThe Tax Act, which became effective on January 1, 2018 and prior to the end of our second quarter, lowered the federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This rate change yielded a second quarter blended federal statutory tax rate of 26.9% for the Company. The second quarter effective tax rate was -24.9%, which includes both the change of the statutory rate as well as the full recognition of the tax benefit of certain capitalized assets and a non-cash benefit of approximately $25 million from the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liability.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nDriven primarily by changes in the anticipated tax rate, the Company now expects to report GAAP earnings per diluted share for the 2018 fiscal year of between $10.35 and $10.55 and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the 2018 fiscal year of between $9.30 and $9.50. The Company continues to anticipate total revenue of approximately $3.1 billion, reflecting the expected opening of eight or nine new Cracker Barrel stores and three new Holler & Dash Biscuit House restaurants. The Company now expects comparable store restaurant sales of between 1.0% and 2.0% and continues to anticipate approximately flat comparable store retail sales. The Company now expects food commodity inflation in the range of 2.5% to 3.0% for the year. The Company projects an operating income margin in the range of 9.5% to 10.0% of total revenue for fiscal 2018. The Company expects depreciation expense between $95 million and $100 million; net interest expense in the range of $15 million and $16 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $150 million to $160 million.\nThe Company now estimates a blended effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 between 11% and 14%. For the full fiscal year, the enactment of the Tax Act will result in a total tax benefit of approximately $45 million to $50 million. The Company plans to reinvest approximately $10 million to $12 million of the tax benefit to further strengthen the brand, support strategic initiatives, and enhance the employee experience. The Company emphasizes these tax estimates are subject to change.\nThe Company's 2018 fiscal year is a 53-week year. The Company estimates the impact of the 53 rd week, which is included in its guidance and reflects the anticipated change associated with the Tax Act, to contribute earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.35.\nThe Company expects to report earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2018 of between $1.85 and $1.95. The Company reminds investors that its outlook for fiscal 2018 reflects a number of assumptions, many of which are outside the Company's control.\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Conference Call\nAs previously announced, the live broadcast of Cracker Barrel's quarterly conference call will be available to the public on-line at investor.crackerbarrel.com today beginning at 11:00 a.m. (ET).

Company makes reference to adjusted earnings per share when excluding a one-time non-cash revaluation of a net deferred tax liability. The Tax Act, which became effective on January 1, 2018 and prior to the end of our second quarter, lowered the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a provisional tax benefit for re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities due to this rate change, of approximately $25 million. The Company believes that excluding this item and its related tax effects from its financial results reflects the current cash impact of tax reform for the Company's second quarter, and, as such may provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the Company's financial results. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income or earnings per share information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFY 2018\nSecond Quarter Ended\nGAAP Reported Earnings per Diluted Share\n$ 3.79\nOne-time Non-Cash Revaluation of Net Deferred Tax Liability\n($1.06)\nAdjusted Earnings per Diluted Share\n$2.73\nInvestor Contact:\nAdam Hanan\n(615) 443-9887\nMedia Contact:\nJanella Escobar\n(615) 235-4618\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cracker-barrel-reports-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2018-and-updates-earnings-guidance-for-fiscal-2018-300600957.html\nSOURCE Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.",
