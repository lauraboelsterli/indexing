The suspect, 19-year-old former student Nikolas Cruz, was booked on 17 counts of premeditated murder Thursday, The Associated Press reported. \nThe tragedy is just the latest in a series of hundreds of events over the last five years. Everytown has been tracking shootings in schools and universities since 2013. It reports any time a firearm is discharged within a school building or on campus, whether accidentally or intentionally and whether or not anyone has been harmed. \nHere are the other 290 school shootings tracked by Everytown for Gun Safety.
