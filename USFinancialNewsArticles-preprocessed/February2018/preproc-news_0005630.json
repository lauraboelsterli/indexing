    "text": "(Adds details, Quote: s, background)\nBy Maria Kiselyova and Olga Sichkar\nMOSCOW, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Billionaire businessman Mikhail Fridman, a member of the supervisory board of Russian food retailer X5, said it was difficult to predict how his inclusion on an “oligarchs’ list” by the United States would affect his business empire.\nDrawn up as part of a sanctions package signed into law in August 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the list of Russian executives on Tuesday.\nInclusion does not mean individuals will necessarily be subject to sanctions but does cast the shadow of the risk of sanctions.\nFridman and his partners control Alfa Group, which includes top Russian private bank Alfa Bank, its biggest food retailer X5 Retail Group and other assets.\nFridman is also a principal shareholder in LetterOne which invests in energy, telecoms, technology and other areas.\nThe list includes people with wealth of $1 billion and higher.\n“Based on the criteria of the report neither I nor my partners could have avoided inclusion,” Fridman told reporters in Moscow on Thursday. “We have been on the Forbes list for quite a long time.”\nHe said it was hard to estimate the consequences for X5 or his other businesses but the inclusion was unlikely to do “any favours (for the business)”.\nOn Thursday, X5 began trading on the Moscow Exchange. Its main listing is on the London Stock Exchange where the company has been trading since 2005.\nThe additional listing should boost X5’s stock liquidity and open it to additional investors, Chief Financial Officer Svetlana Demyashkevich told reporters at a ceremony which she attended along with Fridman and other executives.\nGiven the risk of sanctions facing Russia’s wealthiest people, the finance ministry plans to give them priority in a sovereign Eurobond issue due later this year.\nAsked about that, Fridman, whose wealth is estimated by Forbes at $14.4 billion, said he did not have any immediate plans to take part.\n“If the terms are attractive, then maybe I’ll think about (investing) my personal funds,” he said.
