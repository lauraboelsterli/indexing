    "text": "Second Fiscal Quarter Notables:\nSecond quarter sales of $110.3 million GAAP net income of $7.9 million or $0.14 per diluted share Non-GAAP net income of $10.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share Record sales and earnings for a second fiscal quarter\nNORWOOD, Mass., Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Xcerra Corporation (NASDAQ:XCRA) today announced financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nNet sales for the quarter were $110,276,000 compared to the prior quarter’s net sales of $120,286,000. GAAP net income for the quarter was $7,931,000, or $0.14 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring and related provision charges of $1,070,000, acceleration of debt financing costs of $891,000, amortization of purchased intangible assets of $137,000, and deal related expenses of $536,000, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $10,565,000, or $0.19 per diluted share.\nDave Tacelli, president and chief executive officer, commented, \"We reported record second quarter sales and profit for what is usually our seasonally slow fiscal quarter. Our sales were up nearly 40% and non-GAAP net income up approximately 200% compared to fiscal Q2FY17. Early indications for calendar 2018 are that the favorable business cycle will continue, driven by the automotive, industrial and mobility markets. In addition to the strong business environment, we gained share in all of our major product areas in calendar year 2017, and look to extend those gains in 2018.\nDuring the fiscal year, we made an investment in a Malaysian-based handler company which will expand our addressable market. We expect to launch a new product from this investment in the second half of the calendar year.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook\nFor the fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2018, net sales are expected to be in the range of $110 million to $115 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.23 per share, assuming 56 million shares outstanding. The non-GAAP net income per share guidance excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets of approximately $0.1 million.\nThe Company will conduct a conference call tomorrow, February 23, 2018, at 8:30AM EST to discuss this release. The conference call may be accessed via telephone by dialing 877.853.5334. The call will be simulcast via the Xcerra web site http://www.xcerra.com/events-presentations.html . Audio replays of the call can be heard through March 2, 2018, via telephone by dialing 855.859.2056; conference ID number 1687266. A replay of the webcast can be accessed by visiting our web site 90 minutes following the conference call at http://www.xcerra.com/events-presentations.html .\nInformation About Non-GAAP Measures\nXcerra supplements its GAAP financial results by providing non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter ended January 31, 2018 excludes the amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring charges, and other one-time adjustments. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful for internal comparison to historical operating results as well as to the operating results of its competitors, and believes that this information is useful to investors for the same purposes. A reconciliation between the Company’s GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the attached tables. Readers are reminded that non-GAAP information is merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.\nSafe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements\nAny statements in this presentation about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company, financial guidance on revenue, financial operating results (including net income or loss), and earnings or loss per share, continued customer adoption of recent product introductions, product developments, potential customer expansion and any other statements about management's future expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
