    "text": "LANGLEY, U.K., Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Travelport Worldwide Limited (NYSE: TVPT) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights (for full year 2017 unless stated otherwise)\nNet revenue increased 4% to $2,447 million , including Travel Commerce Platform revenue growth of 5% to $2,341 million Net income increased $125 million to $140 million; Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% to $590 million Income per share (diluted) increased $1.00 to $1.13; Adjusted Income per Share (diluted) increased 17% to $1.44 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 6% to $318 million; Free Cash Flow increased 4% to $200 million Fourth quarter net revenue increased 5%; net income increased $54 million; and Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% 2018 guidance issued, including net revenue growth expected to be 4% to 6%, Adjusted EBITDA growth (1)% to 3% and Free Cash Flow growth 5% to 15%\nGordon Wilson, President and CEO of Travelport, commented:\n\"In 2017, Travelport again delivered on or exceeded guidance on all financial growth targets. In line with our strategy, we achieved a strong performance in Asia and Latin America where our air share grew as we won new business. In addition, Beyond Air revenue grew by 11% in 2017 as we continued to benefit from investment in growing our digital solutions, including mobile apps, hospitality and commercial payments.\nOur ongoing focus and investments in our platform saw a record level of new business signed and onboarded in 2017, with more to come onstream progressively during 2018, more than offsetting the loss of one travel agency account in the Pacific. We continue to lead our industry, being the first global distribution system to be certified at the highest level by IATA for its NDC Application Programming Interface as an Aggregator, and we have advanced further ahead of our peers with over 250 airlines now able to show their full merchandised value proposition to users of the Travelport platform. We are, therefore, well positioned for good underlying growth in 2018, particularly in the second half of the year. Travelport has a proven track record for strong cash generation that supports sustainable and profitable growth over the longer term, while presenting options for higher returns to our shareholders in line with our capital allocation policy.\"\nThree months ended\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in $ thousands, except per share amounts)\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet revenue\n573,567\n545,432\n5%\n2,447,279\n2,351,356\n4%\nOperating income\n52,430\n20,750\n153%\n285,889\n200,613\n43%\nNet income/(loss)\n45,370\n(9,110)\n*\n140,280\n15,046\n*\nIncome/(loss) per share – diluted\n$\n0.37\n$\n(0.05)\n*\n$\n1.13\n$\n0.13\n*\nAdjusted EBITDA\n138,017\n130,764\n6%\n590,013\n574,349\n3%\nAdjusted Operating Income\n83,141\n73,881\n13%\n351,606\n340,898\n3%\nAdjusted Net Income\n44,140\n28,257\n56%\n181,174\n154,494\n17%\nAdjusted Income per Share – diluted\n$\n0.35\n$\n0.23\n51%\n$\n1.44\n$\n1.23\n17%\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n43,320\n85,161\n(49)%\n317,662\n299,019\n6%\nFree Cash Flow\n4,998\n47,831\n(90)%\n200,148\n191,559\n4%\nCash dividend per share\n$\n0.075\n$\n0.075\n—\n$\n0.300\n$\n0.300\n—\n* Percentage calculated not meaningful\nThe Company refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share - diluted, Capital Expenditures, Net Debt and Free Cash Flow.

Within Travel Commerce Platform revenue, Air revenue increased by $12 million or 3%. Beyond Air revenue increased by $19 million, or 14%. This increase in Beyond Air revenue was driven by a 46% increase in eNett net revenue to $54 million primarily due to an increase in the volume of payments settled with existing customers and new customer wins. Technology Services revenue decreased by $3 million, or 12%, primarily due to the sale of IGT Solutions Private Ltd.

Within Travel Commerce Platform revenue, Air revenue increased by $50 million, or 3%. Beyond Air revenue increased by $61 million, or 11%. This increase in Beyond Air revenue was driven by a 29% increase in eNett net revenue to $194 million primarily due to an increase in the volume of payments settled with existing customers and new customer wins.

International RevPas increased 8% to $8.54, and United States RevPas increased 1% to $4.69.\nInternational Travel Commerce Platform revenue increased by $32 million, with Europe and Middle East and Africa contributing a majority of this increase, mainly due to:\nAn increase in RevPas of 10% and 5%, respectively An increase in Reported Segments of 3% and 4%, respectively Growth in payment solutions in these regions\nFull Year 2017\nReported Segments increased by 4 million, or 1%, driven by a 2% increase in International Reported Segments.

International RevPas increased 4% to $8.35, and United States RevPas increased marginally to $4.48.\nInternational Travel Commerce Platform revenue increased by $109 million, with Asia Pacific, Europe and Middle East and Africa contributing to most of this increase. Revenue from these regions increased 10%, 4% and 7%, respectively, mainly due to:\nAn increase in RevPas of 5%, 3% and 8%, respectively Reported Segments growth in Asia Pacific and Europe Growth in payment solutions in these regions\nDiscussion of Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2017 (continued)\nOperating Income\nFourth Quarter 2017\nOperating income increased by $32 million to $52 million mainly due to the following:\n$28 million increase in net revenue $24 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, lower non-core corporate costs, recovery of bad debts and lower employee incentive accruals; offset by $22 million increase in cost of revenue primarily due to an increase in travel distribution cost per segment driven by pricing and higher volume related incentives along with incremental costs from our payment solutions business\nFull Year 2017\nOperating income increased by $85 million to $286 million mainly due to the following:\n$96 million increase in net revenue $63 million decrease in SG&A primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, lower non-core corporate costs and lower employee incentive accruals; offset by $75 million increase in cost of revenue primarily due to an increase in Reported Segments and, an increase in travel distribution cost per segment driven by pricing and higher volume related incentives along with incremental costs from our payment solutions business\nNet Income (Loss)\nFourth Quarter 2017\nNet income increased by $54 million from a net loss of $9 million in 2016 to net income of $45 million in 2017 mainly due to the following:\n$32 million increase in operating income $18 million decrease in the provision for income taxes primarily due to the favorable impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate enacted under the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"U.S. Tax Reforms\") $2 million decrease in interest expense, net, primarily due to lower interest rates and a lower debt balance, offset by the unfavorable impact of fair value changes on interest rate derivative instruments\nFull Year 2017\nNet income increased by $125 million to $140 million due to the following:\n$85 million increase in operating income $40 million decrease in interest expense, net, due to lower interest rates, a lower debt balance and the favorable impact of fair value changes on interest rate derivative instruments\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nFourth Quarter 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $42 million to $43 million, primarily as a result of the negative impact of fluctuations in working capital and an increase in income tax payments, offset by an increase in operating income and lower customer loyalty payments.\nFull Year 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $19 million to $318 million, primarily as a result of an increase in operating income, the positive impact of fluctuations in working capital and lower cash interest and customer loyalty payments, offset by an increase in income tax payments.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFourth Quarter 2017\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $7 million, or 6%, to $138 million due to the following:\n$28 million increase in net revenue; offset by $19 million increase in cost of revenue (excluding a $2 million net increase related to items that are excluded from net income to determine Adjusted EBITDA) $2 million increase in SG&A (excluding a $26 million net decrease related to non-core corporate costs that are excluded from net income to determine Adjusted EBITDA)\nFull Year 2017\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $16 million, or 3%, to $590 million due to the following:\n$96 million increase in net revenue; offset by $78 million increase in cost of revenue (excluding a $3 million net decrease related to items that are excluded from net income to determine Adjusted EBITDA) $2 million increase in SG&A (excluding a $64 million net decrease related to non-core corporate costs that are excluded from net income to determine Adjusted EBITDA)\nAdjusted Net Income\nFourth Quarter 2017\nAdjusted Net Income increased by $16 million to $44 million mainly due to the following:\n$54 million increase in net income; offset by $39 million decrease in adjustments, net of tax, for non-core corporate costs within SG&A, as discussed above, including a favorable tax impact of the U.S. Tax Reforms\nFull Year 2017\nAdjusted Net Income increased by $27 million to $181 million mainly due to the following:\n$125 million increase in net income; offset by $99 million decrease in adjustments, net of tax, due to (i) a decrease in non-core corporate costs within SG&A, as discussed above, including a favorable tax impact of the U.S. Tax Reforms, (ii) lower amortization of acquired intangible assets and (iii) the positive impact of fair value changes related to interest rate derivative instruments included within net income\nFree Cash Flow\nFourth Quarter 2017\nFree Cash Flow decreased by $43 million to a cash inflow of $5 million, primarily due to a $42 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities.\nFull Year 2017\nFree Cash Flow increased by $9 million to a cash inflow of $200 million, primarily as a result of a $19 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities, offset by a $10 million increase in cash additions to property and equipment.\nNet Debt\nNet Debt decreased from $2,205 million as of December 31, 2016 to $2,108 million as of December 31, 2017 and is comprised of $2,230 million in total debt less $122 million in cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in total debt of $115 million (which includes $124 million of voluntary prepayments of principal amount of term loans) was offset by an $18 million lower cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.\nImpact of 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"U.S. Tax Reforms\")\nThe U.S. Tax Reforms, signed into law on December 22, 2017, have resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we have provisionally recognized (i) an increased tax charge due to a decrease in deferred tax assets of $51 million, fully offset by the release of the associated valuation allowance, (ii) an income tax benefit of $22 million from the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and (iii) a benefit of $2 million related to the release of a valuation allowance held on alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards. In addition, we provisionally determined (i) a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings (\"Transition Tax\") of approximately $6 million (tax of approximately $2 million), which was fully offset using U.S. federal net operating losses, and (ii) a provisional impact of $3 million from the accelerated depreciation of qualifying capital expenditure, which was fully equalized resulting in no impact on the provision for income taxes.\nOur preliminary estimate of the impact of the U.S. Tax Reforms, including the Transition Tax, is subject to the finalization of management's analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Reforms, the impact on state income taxes, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the U.S. Tax Reforms that may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates that could be beneficial or adverse. We expect to complete the accounting during the one-year measurement period from the enactment date.\nImpact of Foreign Exchange Movements\nOur results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars. With approximately 91% of our net revenue denominated in U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter of 2017, exchange rate movements in this currency have a low impact on our net revenue. eNett, which represented approximately 9% of our net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017, is the largest source of non-U.S. dollar net revenue.\nOf our costs and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017, excluding depreciation on property and equipment, amortization of customer loyalty payments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-core corporate costs, approximately 62% were denominated in U.S. dollars.\nAs part of our rolling hedging program, we employ foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly against the British pound, the Euro and the Australian dollar, which are the main non-U.S. dollar components of our costs and expenses. The year-on-year impact of foreign exchange rate movements on Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was immaterial.\nFull Year 2018 Financial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements, as well as those made elsewhere within this press release, reflect expectations as of February 20, 2018. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Results may be materially different and are affected by many factors detailed in this release and in Travelport's quarterly and annual Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") filings and/or furnishings, which are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .\nLooking ahead, we expect the following:\n(in $ millions, except per share amounts)\nFY 2018\nGuidance\nGrowth\nNet revenue\n$ 2,535 - $ 2,585\n4 % - 6 %\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$ 585 - $ 605\n(1) % - 3 %\nAdjusted Net Income (1)\n$ 170 - $ 185\n(6) % - 2 %\nAdjusted Income per Share – diluted (2)\n$ 1.34 - $ 1.46\n(7) % - 1 %\nFree Cash Flow (3)\n$ 210 - $ 230\n5 % - 15 %\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA guidance consists of Adjusted Net Income guidance excluding expected depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and expected amortization of customer loyalty payments of $250 million to $260 million, expected interest expense, net (excluding the impact of unrealized gain (loss) on interest rate derivative instruments) of approximately $110 million and expected related income taxes of approximately $55 million. Adjusted Net Income guidance excludes the expected impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $40 million, expected equity-based compensation and related taxes and corporate and restructuring costs of $60 million to $70 million, income from discontinued operations of approximately $28 million related to release of indemnity provisions for liabilities accrued upon sale of Gullivers Travel Associates in 2011, and an expected income tax benefit related to the adjustments above of $10 million to $15 million. We are unable to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to net income (loss) determined under U.S. GAAP due to the unavailability of information required to reasonably predict certain reconciling items such as loss on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of long-lived assets, unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments, and the related tax impact of these adjustments.\n(2)\nAdjusted Income per Share — diluted guidance consists of Adjusted Net Income divided by our expected weighted average number of dilutive common shares for 2018 of approximately 127 million.\n(3)\nFree Cash Flow guidance reflects expected net cash provided by operating activities for 2018 of $320 million to $350 million less cash additions to property and equipment of $110 million to $120 million.\nOur guidance assumes spot foreign exchange rates as of February 13, 2018, together with the impact of foreign exchange rate hedges undertaken during 2017 as part of our rolling hedging program. As of February 13, 2018, spot foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound, the Euro and the Australian dollar are weaker than the equivalent average foreign exchange rates in 2017. The mid-point of our guidance assumes approximately $5 million of negative impact to Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 because of a weaker U.S. dollar, which includes the benefit from foreign exchange rate hedges undertaken during 2017.\nOur 2018 financial guidance includes the impact of the loss of a large travel agency, as previously communicated, which management estimates will have a negative impact, year-on-year, of approximately $85 million to net revenue and $45 million to Adjusted EBITDA. The migration of this travel agency away from Travelport commenced in July 2017 and substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Therefore, the year-on-year financial impacts described above will be weighted approximately two-thirds to the first half of 2018.\nIn 2017 we saw a record level of new business signed and onboarded, with further new volumes to come onstream progressively during 2018. We are, therefore, well positioned for good underlying growth in 2018, particularly in the second half of the year. Furthermore, we remain on track to achieve our 2020 financial targets, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements since those targets were set in May 2017.\nIn relation to our commercial payments business, eNett, we currently anticipate that eNett will grow net revenue by at least 30% in 2018. This is subject to exchange rate movements given that eNett's net revenue is largely denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nCapital Allocation\nWe have continued to reduce our ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, which was 3.6 times at the end of 2017 (2016: 3.8 times). We currently anticipate that Net Debt will be approximately 3.3 to 3.4 times Adjusted EBITDA for 2018.\nWe continue to pursue our longer-term leverage target range of 2.5 to 3.0 times, while ensuring that the strategic needs of the Company are fully funded. Travelport's Board of Directors intend to formally review our capital allocation at the end of this year, which will include an evaluation of opportunities to increase returns to shareholders.\nDividend\nOn February 16, 2018, Travelport's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend will be payable on March 15, 2018 to shareholders on record as at market close on March 1, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company's fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call will be held later today (on February 20, 2018) beginning at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time).\nA live audiocast of the presentation and accompanying slides will be available via the Investor Center section of Travelport's website at ir.travelport.com .
