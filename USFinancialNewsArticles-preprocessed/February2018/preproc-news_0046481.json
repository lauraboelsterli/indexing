    "text": "February 20, 2018 / 9:11 PM / Updated an hour ago White House says Trump son-in-law Kushner can do job without security clearance Reuters Staff 1 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, can continue in his role as a senior White House adviser even if he does not obtain a security clearance, the White House said on Tuesday. Kushner has been operating under a temporary clearance for the past year while the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducts a background investigation. Under an order issued on Friday by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Kushner will lose the temporary clearance in less than a week. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters that Kushner will continue the work he has been doing the past year whether he gets a full security clearance or not. He has been trying to get the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table. Reporting by Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",
