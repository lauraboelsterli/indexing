These supposedly lumbering giants have found surprisingly agile ways to navigate the new landscape and turn disruption to their advantage. \nThe comprehensive study developed by the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV), draws from frank, in-depth interviews with 12,875 C-suite executives, from 6 C-suite roles across 112 countries and will be released in full at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona by Jesus Mantas and Saul Berman, both executives and long-time business consultants from IBM Services. \nThe IBV is IBM Services' internal think tank organization and is regarded as the world's top thought leadership source, according to Source Global Research, and this report builds on the culmination of 15 years of knowledge and research. \nSo, how did industry incumbents stage this remarkable come back? Re-allocation of capital was key. \n\"It's essential for leaders transforming their organizations to go beyond acquiring new skills: they need to create a continued learning culture in their organizations\" says Jesus Mantas, Managing Partner, Cognitive Assets and GBS Ventures. By identifying smart new start-ups and being able to quickly invest in or acquire them, incumbents were able to own the disruption, and the platforms and data that came with them. \nTakao Wada, the president and representative director of Persol Tempstaff Japan, says: \"In the wake of digital disruption, our enterprise has shifted its strategy to investing in digital start-ups as this will drive information sharing and innovation.\" \nThe Dollar Shave Club is a clear example. When this, and other, smart new subscription services entered the market, it created mass volatility. Unilever eventually stepped in and acquired Dollar Shave. Now many businesses offer subscription services, from retail and consumer products and even the auto industry. \"\"\"by remaining fluid, and able to adapt and change we remain most competitive in this new ever evolving environment\" - 19th Global C-suite Study \nThis re-allocation of capital towards start-ups with innovative or disruptive technologies have enabled incumbents to buy the technology they needed to stay competitive. Other smart incumbents are allocating capital to build platforms of their own and leveraging that data to find new competitive edge. \"Future economic returns and value will increasingly be driven by participation – or even better, leadership – in platforms\" states Saul Berman, Partner, VP & Chief Strategist, IBM Services. \nIBM's report says owning platforms and leveraging data is what will drive future innovation. \"Data will be critical. Data is the new currency.\" The report goes on to say that \"by remaining fluid, and able to adapt and change we remain most competitive in this new ever evolving environment.\" \nA chief marketing officer from the energy and utilities sector in the United Kingdom puts it like this: \"Our challenge is creating vast digital change on a short timescale; disrupting our sector without disrupting our current high service levels to our customers. We are investing in technology to become more agile and enable something closer to a state of continuous transformation.\" \nAt Mobile World Congress, IBM will be hosting an exclusive launch on Monday, February 26th for the Global C-Suite Study which will be streamed live on IBM.com/globalcsuitestudy and Facebook . \nIf you are in-person at MWC, you can register to attend the launch at on ibm.com , occurring 15:45 - 17:00 (Hall 8.0 NEXTech Theatre C). \nIBM Services is the professional services arm of IBM, made up of business, technology and industry experts who apply advanced technology and help clients design, build and run businesses. \nIn an era of unpredictable disruption, companies need to do more than transform. You must fearlessly reimagine your business — to the core — designing and building the platforms necessary for growth.
