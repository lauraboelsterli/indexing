    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill-Lynch’s barometer of market sentiment remained in ‘sell’ territory on Friday, after a week of market turmoil which has left U.S. equities down more than 10 percent from their peaks and in so-called ‘correction’ territory.\nBAML’s ‘Bull & Bear’ signal fell to 8.5 from 8.6 last week but that, according to its strategists, remains in “excess bullish” territory and still signals a “sell”.\nThe indicator had jumped from 7.9 to 8.6 on Jan 30, driven up by record inflows to equities and bullish hedge fund risk appetite.\nReporting by Helen Reid\n ",
