    "text": "February 19, 2018 / 8:33 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago Motor racing-Williams hire former McLaren head of aerodynamics Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Former McLaren head of aerodynamics Doug McKiernan has joined the Williams Formula One team as chief engineer in a move that will see him working with technical head Paddy Lowe again. McKiernan left McLaren in 2015, after a period of ‘gardening leave’, before that team began a failed partnership with Honda and two years after Lowe departed for current champions Mercedes. “Having worked with Doug closely between 2007 and 2012, I am sure that his talent and experience will significantly strengthen our team and we are delighted that he is joining us,” said Lowe. “Since returning to Williams last year, it has become clear that in order to help move the team forward we need greater engineering resources.” Williams finished fifth of 10 teams last year. The new season starts in Australia on March 25. (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ken Ferris)",
