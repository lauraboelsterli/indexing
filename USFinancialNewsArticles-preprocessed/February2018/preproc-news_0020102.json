Mississippi also ranked in the top five states with the highest percentage of student loans in default. \nDan Davenport, the Director of Student Financial Aid Services at the University of Idaho explains that college degrees are still a wise investment that communities make in their futures, as well as an important investment that students make in themselves. \n\"The student really is a stock we are investing in,\" says Davenport. \"If we make smart decisions, work hard and get the degree, the stock value will grow.\" \nDavid C. Bloomfield , professor of education leadership, law and policy at Brooklyn College and The City University of New York Graduate Center agrees: \"Completed degree programs from reputable institutions are still the most reliable investment in future income and well-being.\" \nLike this story?
