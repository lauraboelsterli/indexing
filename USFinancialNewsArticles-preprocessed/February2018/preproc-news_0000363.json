    "text": "(Corrects paragraph 5 to say net income rose 42.6 pct, not 42.5 pct)\nFeb 1 (Reuters) - McKesson Corp posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, as the biggest U.S. drug distributor continues to benefit from its tie-up with Walmart .\nMcKesson and Walmart came together in 2016 to exert their combined negotiating power when buying generic drugs.\nMcKesson said its third-quarter results were also buoyed by growth in most of its segments. The companyâ€™s North America distribution business, its biggest, rose 8 percent.\nTotal revenue increased about 7 percent to $53.62 billion.\nNet income attributable to McKesson jumped 42.6 percent to $903 million, or $4.33 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31.\nExcluding items, McKesson earned $3.41 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $2.94, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company also narrowed its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast range to between $12.50 and $12.80 per share, from $11.80 to $12.50 as a result of a lower tax rate and share count.
