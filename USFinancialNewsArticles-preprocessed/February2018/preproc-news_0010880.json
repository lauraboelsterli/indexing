    "text": "~ Announces plan to explore strategic alternatives for Specialty Papers Business Unit ~\nYORK, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Glatfelter (NYSE: GLT) today reported a net loss of $10.1 million, or $0.23 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a net loss of $16.2 million, or $0.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $15.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share compared with $17.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.\nOn an adjusted basis, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding pension expense (“Adjusted EBITDA”) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, totaled $41.5 million and $41.7 million, respectively. Adjusted earnings and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financials measures for which reconciliations to the nearest GAAP-based measure are provided within this release. Consolidated net sales totaled $399.9 million and $390.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Composite Fibers’ and Advanced Airlaid Materials’ net sales increased, on a constant currency basis, by 7.7% and 3.1%, respectively. Specialty Papers’ net sales declined 6.9% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison.\n“Our fourth-quarter operating performance reflects continued strength of our engineered materials businesses,” said Dante C. Parrini, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Composite Fibers delivered a 22% increase in operating income compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings were driven by strong volume growth of 18%, as well as improved operating efficiencies and cost optimization initiatives. Advanced Airlaid Materials grew operating profit by 9% over the fourth quarter a year ago with shipments up 2%. Demand for our airlaid products remains strong as this business brings new capacity to the market, with shipments from Fort Smith, Arkansas on schedule for the first quarter. Our fourth quarter’s results, on an adjusted earnings basis, also benefited from an unusually low effective tax rate of 6.7%.”\nMr. Parrini said, “Our Specialty Papers business continued to face challenging market conditions which, when coupled with operating inefficiencies, led to lower profitability during the quarter. We are encouraged by recent announcements of price increases and additional industry capacity being taken out of the market which should be constructive for the business going forward. Our focus remains on aggressively pursuing cost efficiencies and process improvements to improve profitability.\n“As we look ahead into 2018, we expect our cash flow profile to improve significantly with the completion of our major capital programs. For our Airlaid business, we are in the process of completing customer qualifications and product testing for our new Fort Smith facility which is on schedule for commercial shipments later in the first quarter. We expect to deliver 10% to 15% volume growth in 2018 as a result of this new capacity. For Composite Fibers, we expect solid shipment growth as demand remains strong. For Specialty Papers, we are encouraged by recently announced price increases in uncoated free sheet and carbonless products while we remain focused on operational factors that are in our control.”\nMr. Parrini concluded, “Our Board of Directors and management team regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance shareholder value and have decided to explore a range of potential strategic alternatives for Specialty Papers. Our strategic review process reflects a strong commitment to maximizing shareholder value by accelerating the growth potential for Composite Fibers and Advanced Airlaid Materials, and determining the best option for Specialty Papers.”\nA possible outcome of the strategic review process may include, but is not limited to, the sale of the Specialty Papers business. At this time, the Company’s Board has not set a timetable for the completion of the process nor has it made any decisions related to any specific strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the review of strategic alternatives will result in a particular outcome. The Company does not intend to provide any updates unless or until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary. The Company has retained Credit Suisse as its financial advisor to assist in the review of strategic alternatives for the Specialty Papers business.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of results on a GAAP basis to an adjusted earnings basis, a non-GAAP measure:\nThree months ended December 31 2017 2016 In thousands, except per share Amount EPS Amount EPS Net loss $ (10,080 ) $ (0.23 ) $ (16,180 ) $ (0.37 ) Adjustments (pre-tax) Cost optimization actions 361 3,446 Fox River environmental matter — 40,000 Pension settlement charge — 7,306 Specialty Papers' environmental compliance 541 1,703 Airlaid capacity expansion costs 3,820 1,353 Total adjustments (pre-tax) 4,722 53,808 Income taxes (1) (519 ) (19,983 ) U.S. Tax Reform 20,922 — Total after-tax adjustments 25,125 0.58 33,825 0.78 Adjusted earnings $ 15,045 $ 0.34 $ 17,645 $ 0.40 (1) Tax effect on adjustments calculated based on the incremental effective tax rate of the jurisdiction in which each adjustment originated and the related impact of valuation allowances.

Fourth Quarter Business Unit Results\nComposite Fibers\nThree months ended December 31 Dollars in thousands 2017 2016 Change Tons shipped 41,308 35,110 6,198 17.7 % Net sales $ 143,671 $ 125,349 $ 18,322 14.6 % Operating income 16,828 13,784 3,044 22.1 % Operating margin 11.7 % 11.0 % Composite Fibers’ net sales increased $18.3 million, or 14.6%, primarily due to higher shipping volumes and $8.6 million of favorable currency translation partially offset by $3.7 million from lower selling prices.\nComposite Fibers’ fourth quarter of 2017 operating income totaled $16.8 million, an increase of $3.0 million compared to the year-ago period. Higher shipping volumes, higher machine utilization rates and solid operating performance improved earnings by $9.0 million. This business unit’s cost optimization program delivered its targeted results. The combination of lower selling prices and higher raw material prices decreased earnings by $6.3 million. Currency translation favorably impacted results by $0.3 million.\nAdvanced Airlaid Materials\nThree months ended December 31 Dollars in thousands 2017 2016 Change Tons shipped 25,533 24,932 601 2.4 % Net sales $ 65,656 $ 60,852 $ 4,804 7.9 % Operating income 7,191 6,594 597 9.1 % Operating margin 11.0 % 10.8 % Advanced Airlaid Materials’ net sales increased $4.8 million in the quarter-over-quarter comparison primarily due to a 2.4% increase in shipping volumes from continued growth of personal hygiene and wipes products and $2.9 million favorable impact from currency translation.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 9.1% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison and totaled $7.2 million. The improvement was driven by a $1.0 million benefit from higher volumes.\nSpecialty Papers\nThree months ended December 31 Dollars in thousands 2017 2016 Change Tons shipped 186,005 196,573 (10,568 ) (5.4 )% Net sales $ 190,589 $ 204,665 $ (14,076 ) (6.9 )% Energy and related sales, net 1,780 2,128 (348 ) (16.4 )% Operating income 3,497 13,260 (9,763 ) (73.6 )% Operating margin 1.8 % 6.5 % Specialty Papers’ net sales decreased $14.1 million, or 6.9%, as its markets continued to be impacted by a supply-demand imbalance resulting in lower selling prices of $4.0 million.\nSpecialty Papers’ operating income totaled $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $13.3 million the same period a year ago. Lower shipping volume and selling prices negatively impacted results by $5.8 million and raw material and energy inflation negatively impacted results by $2.7 million. Results also declined due to $1.3 million of higher depreciation expense, $1.1 million of higher freight costs and lower productivity and manufacturing efficiency related to a paper machine shutdown, somewhat offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOther Financial Information\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $21.5 million on pre-tax income of $11.4 million. Reported results include the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The TCJA significantly revised the U.S. federal corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a repatriation tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be repatriated to the United States, and imposing limitations on the deduction of interest expense. U.S. GAAP accounting for income taxes requires the impacts of any tax law change on deferred income taxes to be recorded in the quarter that the tax law change is enacted. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $20.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. This amount consists of two components: (i) a $41.8 million charge relating to tax on deemed repatriation of previously unremitted earnings of non-US subsidiaries and (ii) a $20.9 million benefit resulting from the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities due to the new lower corporate income tax rate and other impacts.\nThe Company’s provisional estimate of the one-time charge relating to the TCJA is based on its initial analysis of available information and estimates. The provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the enactment of the TCJA as provided by recent guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOn adjusted earnings, the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $1.1 million on adjusted pre-tax income of $16.1 million. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 6.7% compared with 13.6% in the same quarter a year ago. The current quarter’s tax provision includes the release of a valuation allowance.\n2017 Full Year\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of results determined on a GAAP basis to adjusted earnings:\nYear ended December 31 2017 2016 In thousands, except per share Amount Diluted\nEPS\nAmount Diluted\nEPS\nNet income $ 7,914 $ 0.18 $ 21,554 $ 0.49 Adjustments (pre-tax) Cost optimization actions 9,988 3,534 Fox River environmental matter — 40,000 Pension settlement charge — 7,306 Specialty Papers' environmental compliance 3,617 8,348 Airlaid capacity expansion costs 10,854 2,661 Timberland sales and related costs (188 ) — Total adjustments (pre-tax) 24,271 61,849 Income taxes (1) (1,641 ) (22,719 ) U.S. Tax Reform 20,922 — Total after-tax adjustments 43,552 0.98 39,130 0.90 Adjusted earnings $ 51,466 $ 1.16 $ 60,684 $ 1.38 (1) Tax effect on adjustments calculated based on the incremental effective tax rate of the jurisdiction in which each adjustment originated and the related impact of valuation allowances.

(Refer to the calculation of these measures provided in this release.)\nOutlook\nComposite Fibers’ shipping volumes in the first quarter of 2018 are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter. Selling prices and raw material and energy prices are expected to be slightly higher compared with the fourth quarter.\nAdvanced Airlaid Materials’ shipping volumes in the first quarter of 2018 are expected to be approximately 5% higher than the fourth quarter due to commencement of commercial shipments from the Fort Smith, Arkansas facility and overall higher customer demand. For the full year 2018, we continue to anticipate shipping volumes to be 10% to 15% higher than 2017 driven by the start-up of the Fort Smith facility. Selling prices and raw material and energy prices are expected to increase slightly compared with the fourth quarter.\nSpecialty Papers’ shipping volumes in the first quarter of 2018 are expected to be relatively flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. Average selling prices are expected to increase by approximately $20 per ton while raw material and energy prices are expected to increase by approximately $2 million compared to the fourth quarter. Operational challenges in the first quarter are expected to impact profitability in a magnitude similar as was experienced in the fourth quarter. The first quarter will also reflect higher seasonal energy consumption.\nCorporate costs are expected to increase approximately $1 million in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nStart-up costs associated with Advanced Airlaid Materials’ capacity expansion are expected to be approximately $3 million, after tax, incurred primarily in the first half of 2018.\nInterest expense is expected to total approximately $22 million for the full year 2018.\nConsolidated capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $67 million to $72 million in 2018.\nThe effective tax rate on adjusted earnings is expected to be approximately 33% for the full year 2018.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, the Company will hold a conference call at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern) today to discuss its fourth quarter results.

The Company uses non-GAAP adjusted earnings to supplement the understanding of its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings is meant to present the financial performance of the Company’s core operations, which consist of the production and sale of specialty papers, composite fibers papers and airlaid non-woven materials. Management and the Company’s Board of Directors use non-GAAP adjusted earnings to evaluate the performance of the Company’s fundamental business in relation to prior periods. For purposes of determining adjusted earnings, the following items are excluded:\nCost optimization actions. These adjustments reflect charges incurred in connection with initiatives to optimize the cost structure of certain business units in response to changes in business conditions. The costs are primarily related to headcount reduction efforts, asset write-offs and certain contract termination costs. Specialty Papers environmental compliance. These adjustments reflect non-capitalized, one-time costs incurred by the business unit directly related to the compliance with the U.S. EPA Best Available Retrofit Technology rule and the Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology rule. This adjustment includes costs incurred during the transition period in which the newly installed equipment was brought on-line. Airlaid capacity expansion costs. These adjustments reflect non-capitalized, one-time costs incurred related to implementation of a new business system and the start-up of a new airlaid production facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Timberland sales and related costs. These adjustments exclude gains from the sales of timberlands as these items are not considered to be part of our core business, ongoing results of operations or cash flows. These adjustments are irregular in timing and amount and may significantly impact our operating performance. U.S. Tax Reform. These adjustments reflect amounts estimating the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The TCJA includes, among many provisions, a tax on the mandatory repatriation of earnings of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and a change in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Fox River environmental matter. This adjustment reflects charges incurred to increase our reserve for estimated costs related to government oversight, remediation activity and long term monitoring and maintenance at the Fox River site. These costs are irregular in timing and as such may not be indicative of our past or future performance. Pension settlement charge. This adjustment reflects the one-time charge incurred during 2016 in connection with the settlement of certain pension liabilities as part of a voluntary offer to vested terminated participants. Our qualified pension plan is overfunded and this action did not require us to contribute any cash.\nUnlike net income determined in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP adjusted earnings does not reflect all charges and gains recorded by the Company for the applicable period and, therefore, does not present a complete picture of the Company’s results of operations for the respective period. However, non-GAAP adjusted earnings provide a measure of how the Company’s core operations are performing, which management believes is useful to investors because it allows comparison of such operations from period to period. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCalculation of Adjusted EBITDA, excluding pension Three months ended\nDecember 31\nYear ended\nDecember 31\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ (10,080 ) $ (16,180 ) $ 7,914 $ 21,554 Income tax provision 21,477 (17,207 ) 31,421 (10,748 ) Depreciation and amortization 19,705 16,101 76,048 65,826 Interest expense, net 4,713 3,856 17,535 15,616 Pension expense 1,670 1,369 6,645 5,495 Adjustments to earnings Cost optimization actions, net of depreciation (385 ) 3,446 5,517 3,534 Fox River environmental matter - 40,000 - 40,000 Pension settlement charge - 7,306 - 7,306 Specialty Papers' environmental compliance 541 1,703 3,617 8,348 Airlaid capacity expansion costs 3,820 1,353 10,854 2,661 Timberland sales and related costs - - (188 ) - Adjusted EBITDA, excluding pension $ 41,461 $ 41,747 $ 159,363 $ 159,592 Calculation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow Three months ended\nDecember 31\nYear ended\nDecember 31\nIn thousands 2017 2016 2017 2016 Cash from operations $ 51,466 $ 56,673 $ 104,262 $ 116,110 Less: Capital expenditures (30,132 ) (43,210 ) (132,304 ) (160,158 ) Add back: Airlaid capacity expansion 12,797 9,614 45,644 30,681 Add back: Specialty Papers' environmental compliance projects 550 16,926 13,168 69,470 Exclude: Cellulosic biofuel/Alternative fuel mixture credits — — — (4,277 ) Adjusted free cash flow $ 34,681 $ 40,003 $ 30,770 $ 51,826 Net Debt December 31 December 31 In thousands 2017 2016 Current portion of long-term debt $ 11,298 $ 8,961 Long term debt 470,098 363,647 Total 481,396 372,608 Less: Cash (116,219 ) (55,444 ) Net Debt $ 365,177 $ 317,164\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180206005670/en/\nGlatfelter\nInvestors:\nJohn P.
