Common Stockholders to FFO are presented in the attached schedule \"Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.\"\nACQUISITIONS AND SALES\nIn mid-December, EastGroup acquired Gwinnett Progress Center in Atlanta for $29.3 million. The value-add property acquisition includes four newly completed distribution buildings totaling 392,000 square feet and an additional 10.5 acres for future development. Two of the buildings, known as Hurricane Shoals 1 & 2, contain 260,000 square feet; these buildings, which are currently 23% leased, were added to the Company's operating portfolio immediately upon acquisition. The other two buildings, Progress Center 1 & 2, contain 132,000 square feet and are currently 4% leased; these buildings are considered to be in the lease-up phase of development and are expected to transfer from the Company's development program to its operating portfolio at the earlier of 90% occupancy or one year after shell completion (April 2018). EastGroup has future plans to construct an 85,000 square foot distribution building on the acquired land, which is adjacent to the Hurricane Shoals 1 & 2 buildings. This acquisition increased the Company's ownership in the Atlanta market to over 700,000 square feet.\nAlso in December, the Company acquired the 20% noncontrolling interest in two buildings, University Business Center 125 and 175, in Santa Barbara for $4.7 million. The acquisition adds 27,000 square feet to the Company's operating portfolio. EastGroup now owns 100% of both buildings.\nIn total for the year, EastGroup acquired 708,000 square feet of operating properties, 132,000 square feet of development-stage properties, and 90 acres of land for $82 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company sold 14 acres of land in El Paso for $2.9 million. The sale generated a gain of $333,000 which was included in FFO.\nTotal sales for the year, which include 514,000 square feet of operating properties and 19 acres of land, generated gross proceeds of $42 million. The gains on sales of operating properties of $21,855,000 are included in Gain on sales of real estate investments; these gains from sales of depreciable real estate investments are excluded from FFO. The net gains on sales of land of $293,000 are included in Other on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income; the net gains on sales of land are included in FFO.\nSubsequent to year-end, EastGroup closed the sale of World Houston 18, a 33,000 square foot, non-EastGroup developed, single-tenant building in Houston, for $2.5 million. The transaction generated a gain on sale, which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2018. The gain will not be included in FFO.\nDEVELOPMENT\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company began construction of four development projects: Falcon Field in Phoenix, Airport Commerce Center 3 in Charlotte, and Settlers Crossing 1 & 2 in Austin.\nThe Company began construction on the following projects during 2017:\nDevelopment Properties Started in 2017\nLocation\nSize\nAnticipated\nConversion Date\nProjected\nTotal Costs\n(Square feet)\n(In thousands)\nOak Creek VII\nTampa, FL\n116,000\n04/2018\n$\n7,500\nSteele Creek VII\nCharlotte, NC\n120,000\n09/2018\n8,600\nHorizon XII\nOrlando, FL\n140,000\n12/2018\n12,100\nKyrene 202 III, IV & V\nPhoenix, AZ\n166,000\n02/2019\n13,800\nCreekView 121 3 & 4\nDallas, TX\n158,000\n03/2019\n14,200\nEisenhauer Point 5\nSan Antonio, TX\n98,000\n03/2019\n7,500\nEisenhauer Point 6\nSan Antonio, TX\n85,000\n03/2019\n5,200\nHorizon X\nOrlando, FL\n104,000\n04/2019\n8,000\nFalcon Field\nPhoenix, AZ\n96,000\n05/2019\n9,000\nAirport Commerce Center 3\nCharlotte, NC\n96,000\n07/2019\n7,300\nSettlers Crossing 1\nAustin, TX\n77,000\n10/2019\n7,400\nSettlers Crossing 2\nAustin, TX\n83,000\n10/2019\n8,000\nTotal Development Properties Started\n1,339,000\n$\n108,600\nAt December 31, 2017, EastGroup's development program consisted of 18 projects (2,166,000 square feet).

This was the Company's 152 nd consecutive quarterly cash distribution to shareholders. EastGroup has increased or maintained its dividend for 25 consecutive years. The Company has increased it 22 years within that period, including increases in each of the last six years. The Company's payout ratio of dividends to FFO was 59% for the year. The annualized dividend rate of $2.56 per share yielded 3.0% on the closing stock price of $84.36 on January 30, 2018.\nFINANCIAL STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY\nEastGroup continues to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. Debt-to-total market capitalization was 26.6% at December 31, 2017. The Company had interest and fixed charge coverage ratios of 5.72x for the fourth quarter and 5.19x for the year, and a debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) ratio of 5.79x for the fourth quarter and 6.14x for the year.\nAs previously announced, in December, EastGroup closed $60 million of senior unsecured private placement notes with an insurance company. The notes have a seven-year term and a fixed interest rate of 3.46% with semi-annual interest payments. The notes will not be and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.\nAlso in December, the Company refinanced a $75 million unsecured term loan, resulting in a 30 basis point reduction in the loan's interest rate. The loan, which has a maturity date of December 20, 2020, now has an effectively fixed interest rate of 3.452%. The refinancing will provide a net annual savings to the Company of approximately $170,000.\nDuring the fourth quarter, EastGroup issued and sold 332,852 shares of common stock under its continuous equity program at an average price of $91.95 per share, providing net proceeds to the Company of $30.3 million. During the year, the Company issued and sold a total of 1,370,457 shares of common stock under the program at an average price of $80.71 per share, providing net proceeds to the Company of $109.2 million.\nOUTLOOK FOR 2018\nEPS for 2018 is estimated to be in the range of $1.92 to $2.02. Estimated FFO per share attributable to common stockholders for 2018 is estimated to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.55.

For 2017, this metric excluded straight-line rent adjustments only. See the Definitions section of this press release for additional information about the change in this operating metric.\nDEFINITIONS\nThe Company's chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions: (1) property net operating income (PNOI), defined as Income from real estate operations less Expenses from real estate operations (including market-based internal management fee expense) plus the Company's share of income and property operating expenses from its less-than-wholly-owned real estate investments, and (2) funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (FFO). EastGroup defines FFO consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' definition, as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property and impairment losses, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nPNOI and FFO are supplemental industry reporting measurements used to evaluate the performance of the Company's investments in real estate assets and its operating results. The Company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry's calculations of PNOI and FFO provides supplemental indicators of the properties' performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. PNOI and FFO as calculated by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other REITs. Investors should be aware that items excluded from or added back to FFO are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance.\nEastGroup sometimes refers to PNOI from Same Properties as \"Same PNOI\" in this press release and the accompanying reconciliation. Same Properties is defined as operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period. Development properties are excluded until held in the operating portfolio for both the current and prior year reporting periods.\nThe Company's chief decision makers also use adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) in making decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net Income, excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property, plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nIn a press release dated January 17, 2018, the Company, along with a group of other leading industrial REITs (the Industrial REIT Group), announced that the Industrial REIT Group has agreed on a consistent methodology to calculate various non-GAAP property operating metrics. These non-GAAP metrics include common methodologies for determining property stabilization and occupancy as well as reporting of comparative changes in rental rates and tenant retention rates. In addition, the Industrial REIT Group has agreed on the definition of the annual pool of properties (same property pool) used in calculating same property net operating income growth (same property NOI). Specifically, the annual same property pool will only include properties held as of the beginning of the prior calendar year which were stabilized (according to the agreed upon definition) throughout both periods presented.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2018, all members of the Industrial REIT Group have agreed to calculate these non-GAAP metrics based on the agreed upon methodologies. These conforming changes do not have a material impact on EastGroup's non-GAAP metrics for periods prior to 2018. The outlook for 2018 included in this earnings release is based on the revised methodologies.\nAs a result of the efforts of the Industrial REIT Group, EastGroup will make the following conforming changes, effective January 1, 2018:\nThe Company will transfer development properties to the operating portfolio at the earlier of 90% occupancy or one year after shell completion. EastGroup's previous policy was to transfer properties at the earlier of 80% occupancy or one year after shell completion. The calculation of the Company's rental rate change will no longer exclude leases for space which has been vacant for more than 24 months. All leases will be included, with the exception of short-term leases with terms less than 12 months and leases of first generation space in properties acquired or developed by EastGroup. The calculation of same property NOI without straight-line rent adjustments will be adjusted to also exclude amortization of above/below market rent adjustments.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nEastGroup will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the results of its fourth quarter and review the Company's current operations on Thursday, February 1, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
