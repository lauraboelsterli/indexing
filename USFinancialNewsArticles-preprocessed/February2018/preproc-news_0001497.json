    "text": "Third quarter orders of $40 million, backlog increased to $96 million Diluted loss per share of $1.19, included non-cash impairment charges Third quarter revenue of $17 million, adjusted earnings per share were breakeven Fiscal 2018 revenue guidance narrowed to approximately $75 million\nBATAVIA, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Graham Corporation (NYSE:GHM), a global business that designs, manufactures and sells critical equipment for the oil refining, petrochemical, power and defense industries, today reported financial results for its third quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2017. Graham’s current fiscal year ends March 31, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”).\nNet sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $17.3 million, compared with net sales of $22.7 million in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”).\nNet loss and diluted loss per share in the fiscal 2018 third quarter were $11.6 million and $1.19 per share, respectively. Excluding non-cash charges for goodwill and intangible asset impairments as well as other related charges and the impact of the tax reform legislation passed in December 2017, net income and earnings per share (“EPS”) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were breakeven, compared with $1.8 million, or $0.19 per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nJames R. Lines, Graham’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Order levels in the third quarter illustrate signs of improvement in the end markets we serve, particularly the refining industry in North America. We believe, however, that it is premature to anticipate that these are consistent trends. The early stages of prior energy recoveries were marked with volatility, including both strong and weak order patterns.”\nHe continued, “Our commercial nuclear power business has been unfavorably impacted by general factors affecting that industry and, as a result, we have recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges during this quarter. While we don’t anticipate growth, we expect to hold this portion of our business steady over the next few years. Our commercial nuclear power business accounted for approximately 12% of our revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Sales Summary\n(See accompanying financial tables for a breakdown of sales by industry and region)\nThe $5.4 million, or 24%, decline in sales during the fiscal 2018 third quarter compared with the prior-year quarter was broad based. It included a $2.7 million reduction in sales to the power market, a $1.7 million decline to the other commercial, industrial and defense markets, and a $0.9 million reduction to the refining market.\nFrom a geographic perspective, sales to the Company’s U.S. market decreased $6.2 million compared with the prior-year third quarter, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in sales to international markets. U.S. sales represented 65% of consolidated sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter, compared with 77% in the prior-year third quarter.\nFluctuations in Graham’s sales among geographic locations and industries can vary measurably from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing and magnitude of projects. Graham does not believe that such quarter-to-quarter fluctuations are indicative of business trends, which it believes are more apparent on a trailing twelve month basis.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Operating Performance Review\n($ in millions except per share data) Q3 FY18 Q3 FY17 Change Net sales $ 17.3 $ 22.7 $ (5.4) Gross profit $ 3.6 $ 6.3 $ (2.7) Gross margin 20.7% 27.8% Operating (loss) profit $ (15.3) $ 2.5 $ (17.8) Operating margin -88.5% 11.0% Net (loss) income $ (11.6) $ 1.8 $ (13.4) Diluted EPS $ (1.19) $ 0.19 $ (1.38) Adjusted net income $ (0.0) $ 1.8 $ (1.8) Adjusted diluted EPS $ 0.00 $ 0.19 $ (0.19) Third quarter fiscal 2018 gross profit was negatively impacted by lower sales. Gross margin was negatively impacted by a weaker mix of projects, as well as under-absorption of overhead costs due to lower sales.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $4.1 million were $0.3 million higher than the prior-year period. The increase was attributable to bad debt charges in Graham’s commercial nuclear power business associated with the Westinghouse bankruptcy. SG&A as a percent of sales was 24% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with 17% in the same prior-year period.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company revalued its commercial nuclear power business, resulting in a $14.8 million pre-tax ($12.9 million after tax) non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, unfavorably impacting operating results.\nJeffrey Glajch, Graham’s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “The charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, as well as other charges associated with our commercial nuclear power business, were prompted by several factors. These include the culmination of the 2017 Westinghouse bankruptcy which eventually resulted in the stoppage of two of four new nuclear reactor construction projects, and the increasingly intense competitiveness of energy sources in the U.S. which has resulted in a reduction in spending on existing nuclear plants. Moreover, as pricing continues to drop, several of our competitors are better positioned than us due to their vertical integration. After several initial years of satisfactory financial performance by our nuclear power business, market conditions over recent years made it more challenging, culminating in its revaluation.”\nAlso during the fiscal 2018 third quarter, Graham recorded a $1.4 million favorable adjustment to income taxes upon adoption of the new federal tax reform act. That adjustment included $2.0 million related to and a partial offset against the after tax impairment charges noted above. The adjustment also included a $0.6 million charge relating to deferred tax assets.\nAdjusted net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS remove impairment charges of $12.9 million after tax, the bad debt charges in SG&A associated with the Westinghouse bankruptcy of $0.2 million after tax, and a $1.4 million tax benefit for adoption of new federal tax rates resulting from the tax reform legislation passed in December 2017, all described above.\nTo summarize, the decrease in adjusted net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS during the third quarter compared with the prior-year quarter was primarily due to lower sales and weaker project mix.\nAdjusted EBITDA ($ in millions) Q3 FY18 Q3 FY17 Change Adjusted EBITDA $ 0.4 $ 3.1 $ (2.7) Adjusted EBITDA margin 2.1% 13.6% Adjusted EBITDA (defined as consolidated net income before interest expense and income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, a bad debt charge associated with the Westinghouse bankruptcy, and restructuring charges where applicable) during the fiscal 2018 third quarter was also negatively impacted by the factors discussed above.\nGraham believes that, when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales), which are non-GAAP measures, help in the understanding of its operating performance. Graham’s credit facility also contains ratios based on EBITDA. See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Graham’s use of adjusted net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as well as a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nNine Month Year-to-Date Fiscal 2018 Review\n($ in millions except per share data) YTD FY18 YTD FY17 Change Net sales $ 55.4 $ 66.1 $ (10.7) Gross profit $ 12.3 $ 15.4 $ (3.1) Gross margin 22.2% 23.3% Operating (loss) profit $ (14.3) $ 4.2 $ (18.5) Operating margin -25.8% 6.3% Net (loss) income $ (10.7) $ 3.2 $ (13.9) Diluted EPS $ (1.09) $ 0.33 $ (1.42) Adjusted net income $ 1.2 $ 3.7 $ (2.5) Adjusted diluted EPS $ 0.12 $ 0.38 $ (0.26) Year-to-date sales decreased 16% compared with the same fiscal 2017 year-to-date period. International sales increased to $18.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and represented 33% of total sales, compared with $17.0 million, or 26% of sales, in the same prior-year period. Sales to the U.S. were $37.2 million, or 67%, of year-to-date net sales in fiscal 2018 compared with $49.2 million, or 74% of fiscal 2017 same period net sales.\nThe decrease in gross profit was due to lower volume resulting from the 16% reduction in sales when compared with the same prior-year period.\nSG&A in the year-to-date fiscal 2018 period was $11.4 million, up $0.8 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A was 21% for year-to-date fiscal 2018 compared with 16% in the same prior-year period. The increase in SG&A was principally related to the benefit of insurance proceeds received in the prior year.\nThe fiscal 2018 year-to-date operating results were impacted by the $14.8 million pre-tax ($12.9 million after tax) non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recognized in the third quarter, as described previously.\nThe year-to-date operating results included $0.3 million and $0.6 million of pre-tax restructuring charges for severance costs in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe year-to-date fiscal 2018 results were also impacted by the $1.4 million favorable adjustment to income taxes upon implementation of the tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017. As noted above, that adjustment included $2.0 million related to, and a partial offset against, the after tax impairment charges. The adjustment also included a $0.5 million charge relating to deferred tax assets.\nFiscal 2018 year-to-date adjusted net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS excluded $12.9 million net of tax impairment charges, $0.2 million net of tax bad debt charges associated with the revaluation of the Company’s commercial nuclear power business, $0.2 million net of tax for a nonrecurring restructuring charge and $1.4 million tax benefit for adoption of the new federal tax rates as a result of the tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017. Fiscal 2017 year-to-date adjusted net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS excluded $0.4 million net of tax for a nonrecurring restructuring charge.\nTo summarize, the decrease in adjusted net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS during the nine month year-to-date period compared with the prior-year period was primarily due to lower sales and weaker project mix.\nAdjusted EBITDA ($ in millions) YTD FY18 YTD FY17 Change Adjusted EBITDA $ 2.8 $ 6.5 $ (3.7) Adjusted EBITDA margin 5.0% 9.9% Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by the factors discussed above.\nGraham believes that, when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales), which are non-GAAP measures, help in the understanding of its operating performance. Graham’s credit facility also contains ratios based on EBITDA. See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Graham’s use of adjusted net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as well as a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nSeeking Opportunities to Effectively Utilize Available Capital\nCash, cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2017 were $74.2 million, up $0.7 million from March 31, 2017. The increase resulted primarily from positive operating cash flow and minimal capital expenditures during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.\nFiscal 2018 year-to-date cash provided by operations was $3.9 million, compared with $10.7 million year-to-date in fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of timing of working capital utilization and lower net income.\nFiscal 2018 year-to-date capital expenditures were $0.5 million, compared with $0.2 million year-to-date in fiscal 2017. The Company has lowered its anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 to be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million. The majority of the Company’s capital investments during fiscal 2018 are expected to be used for productivity enhancements, information technology upgrades and other items.\nDividend payments were $2.6 million in the first nine months of both fiscal 2018 and 2017.\nGraham had neither borrowings under its credit facility, nor any long-term debt outstanding, at December 31, 2017.\nOrders and Backlog Strengthened\nDriven by the refining industry in North America, orders grew to $40.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, up $22.8 million over the prior-year’s third quarter. Orders from U.S. customers were $19.1 million, or 47% of total orders, and orders from international markets were $21.4 million, or 53%. More than 80% of the international orders were from Canada. The fiscal 2018 third quarter orders included $27.6 million, or 68% of the total, for refining markets.\nOrders for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were $68.7 million, compared with $57.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Such increase was driven by the refining industry, which was up $19.1 million. Orders from U.S. customers were $42.0 million, or 61%, and orders from international markets were $26.7 million, or 39%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Nearly 75% of international orders were from Canada. This compares with 69% U.S. and 31% international in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.\nGraham expects that the balance between domestic and international orders, as well as orders by industry, will continue to be variable between quarters.\nBacklog at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $96.2 million, up from $73.0 million and $82.6 million at the end of the previous quarter and from the end of fiscal 2017, respectively.\nWhile refinery backlog increased significantly, the Company continues to believe that its backlog mix by industry highlights the success of its diversification strategy to increase sales to the U.S. Navy. Backlog by industry at December 31, 2017 was approximately:\n51% for U.S. Navy projects 35% for refinery projects 6% for power projects, including nuclear 4% for chemical/petrochemical projects 4% for other industrial applications\nThe expected timing for the Company’s backlog to convert to sales is as follows:\nWithin next 12 months: 55% to 60% Within 12 to 24 months: 5% to 10% Beyond 24 months: 25% to 35%\nNarrowing FY 2018 Guidance\nThe Company is narrowing its fiscal 2018 guidance:\nRevenue anticipated to be approximately $75 million Gross margin expected to be between 21% and 22% SG&A expense expected to be between $15.0 and $15.5 million Effective tax rate anticipated to be between 24% and 26%, excluding the tax impact of the impairment charges and implementation of the tax reform legislation\nMr. Lines concluded. “We now have clearer visibility on the remainder of fiscal 2018, causing us to tighten our guidance around our previously provided ranges. Looking forward into fiscal 2019, we anticipate that our current backlog will favorably impact our fiscal first half, especially with regards to refining and U.S. Navy work. Our pipeline remains active and we are well prepared for the eventual recovery of our energy markets. Additionally, we remain diligent in our search for potential strategic acquisitions to enhance our growth.”\nWebcast and Conference Call\nGraham’s management will host a conference call and live webcast today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to review its financial condition and operating results for the third quarter fiscal 2018, as well as its strategy and outlook.

Adjusted net income is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, commonly known as GAAP. Nevertheless, Graham believes that providing non-GAAP information such as Adjusted net income is important for investors and other readers of Graham's financial statements, as it is used as an analytical indicator by Graham's management to better understand operating performance. Because Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted net income, as presented, may not be directly comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nGraham Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation—Unaudited\n(Amounts in thousands)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income $ (11,622 ) $ 1,840 $ (10,677 ) $ 3,222 + Net interest income (139 ) (97 ) (447 ) (265 ) + Income taxes (3,536 ) 754 (3,174 ) 1,198 + Depreciation & amortization 556 581 1,667 1,746 + Restructuring charge - - 316 630 + Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 14,816 - 14,816 - + Bad debt charge on commercial nuclear power business 280 - 280 - Adjusted EBITDA $ 355 $ 3,078 $ 2,781 $ 6,531 Adjusted EBITDA margin % 2.1 % 13.6 % 5.0 % 9.9 % Non-GAAP Financial Measure:\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense and income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, a charge associated with the revaluation of the nuclear business, and a nonrecurring restructuring charge. In the fiscal 2018 periods presented, Adjusted EBITDA also includes a charge associated with the revaluation of the nuclear business and a nonrecurring restructuring charge. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, commonly known as GAAP. Nevertheless, Graham believes that providing non-GAAP information such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are important for investors and other readers of Graham's financial statements, as they are used as analytical indicators by Graham's management to better understand operating performance. Graham’s credit facility also contains ratios based on EBITDA. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as presented, may not be directly comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nGraham Corporation\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018\nAdditional Information—Unaudited\nORDER & BACKLOG TREND ($ in millions) Q117 Q217 Q317 Q417 FY2017 Q118 Q218 Q318 Total Total Total Total Total Total Total Total Orders $ 14.6 $ 24.8 $ 17.7 $ 9.0 $ 66.1 $ 11.1 $ 17.1 $ 40.5 Backlog $ 99.9 $ 104.0 $ 99.1 $ 82.6 $ 82.6 $ 72.9 $ 73.0 $ 96.2 SALES BY INDUSTRY FY 2018 ($ in millions) FY 2018 Q1 % of Q2 % of Q3 % of 6/30/17 Total 9/30/17 Total 12/31/17 Total Refining $ 3.6 18% $ 4.7 28% $ 5.4 31% Chemical/ Petrochemical $ 7.2 34% $ 5.7 33% $ 4.2 24% Power $ 4.0 19% $ 1.9 11% $ 1.7 10% Other Commercial, Industrial and Defense $ 6.1 29% $ 4.9 28% $ 6.0 35% Total $ 20.9 $ 17.2 $ 17.3 SALES BY INDUSTRY FY 2017 ($ in millions) FY 2017 Q1 % of Q2 % of Q3 % of Q4 % of FY2017 % of 6/30/16 Total 9/30/16 Total 12/31/16 Total 3/31/17 Total Total Refining $ 7.2 32% $ 6.7 32% $ 6.3 28% $ 4.0 15% $ 24.2 26% Chemical/ Petrochemical $ 5.2 23% $ 5.1 24% $ 4.3 19% $ 6.9 27% $ 21.5 23% Power $ 4.7 21% $ 6.1 29% $ 4.4 19% $ 4.8 19% $ 20.0 22% Other Commercial, Industrial and Defense $ 5.3 24% $ 3.2 15% $ 7.7 34% $ 9.9 39% $ 26.1 28% Total $ 22.4 $ 21.1 $ 22.7 $ 25.6 $ 91.8 Third Quarter Fiscal 2018\nAdditional Information—Unaudited\n(Continued)\nSALES BY REGION FY 2018 ($ in millions) FY 2018 Q1 % of Q2 % of Q3 % of 6/30/17 Total 9/30/17 Total 12/31/17 Total United States $ 14.8 71% $ 11.1 65% $ 11.3 65% Middle East $ 0.9 4% $ 1.0 6% $ 1.0 6% Asia $ 3.4 16% $ 2.6 15% $ 2.3 13% Other $ 1.8 9% $ 2.5 14% $ 2.7 16% Total $ 20.9 $ 17.2 $ 17.3 SALES BY REGION FY 2017 ($ in millions) FY 2017 Q1 % of Q2 % of Q3 % of Q4 % of FY2017 % of 6/30/16 Total 9/30/16 Total 12/31/16 Total 3/31/17 Total Total United States $ 16.3 73% $ 15.4 73% $ 17.5 77% $ 20.0 78% $ 69.2 75% Middle East $ 1.0 4% $ 0.5 2% $ 0.8 3% $ 0.9 4% $ 3.2 4% Asia $ 3.1 14% $ 1.2 6% $ 1.6 7% $ 1.8 7% $ 7.7 8% Other $ 2.0 9% $ 4.0 19% $ 2.8 13% $ 2.9 11% $ 11.7 13% Total $ 22.4 $ 21.1 $ 22.7 $ 25.6 $ 91.8\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180201005126/en/\nGraham Corporation\nJeffrey F.
