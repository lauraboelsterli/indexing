    "text": "LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The price of crude oil will likely come under pressure later this year from rising output at U.S. onshore developments as well as conventional fields, Chief Executive Eldar Saetre told Reuters on Wednesday.\n“I think we will most likely be below $70 a barrel,” he said when asked about expectations for crude prices in 2018.\nNorth Sea Brent crude currently trades at a spot price of $66.9, down from $70.78 in late January.
