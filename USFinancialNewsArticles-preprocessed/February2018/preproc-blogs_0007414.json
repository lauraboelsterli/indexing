    "text": "Amgen reports profit below analyst views, but beats expectations on earnings outlook Amgen earned $2.89 per share, 14 cents below analysts' average expectations. Revenue for the quarter fell 3 percent to $5.8 billion, about in line with analysts' expectations. For 2018, Amgen forecast adjusted earnings per share between $12.60 and $13.70 and revenue between $21.8 billion and $22.8 billion. Published 15 Hours Ago Reuters Robert Galbraith | Reuters \nAmgen on Thursday reported a fourth-quarter profit well below Wall Street estimates, hurt by a steep decline in sales of blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel and higher-than-expected expenses, and its shares fell more than 3 percent. \nBut the world's biggest biotechnology company provided a 2018 earnings forecast range with a midpoint that easily exceeded analysts' estimates and announced a $10 billion share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate due to U.S. tax reform. \nExcluding items, Amgen earned $2.89 per share, 14 cents below analysts' average expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. \nFor 2018, Amgen forecast adjusted earnings per share of $12.60 to $13.70 and revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings of $12.71 per share and $22.8 billion in revenue. \n\"It's a big slow-growing biopharmaceutical company,\" said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. \"We're all waiting for them to do at least a modest size deal. They need another product or two.\" \nAmgen projected a 2018 adjusted tax rate of 14 percent to 15 percent. Some other large drugmakers have announced rates of about 17 percent or 18 percent. AbbVie . surprised investors last week by announcing a 9 percent adjusted tax rate, rising to 13 percent over five years. \nAmgen said it plans capital investments of about $3.5 billion over the next five years, with 75 percent of that in the United States. The company said it decided to build a new biomanufacturing plant in the United States and will add jobs to build and run the facility. Amgen expects to announce the plant location in the second quarter. \nRevenue for the quarter fell 3 percent to $5.8 billion, about in line with analysts' expectations. \nEnbrel sales fell 13 percent to $1.37 billion due to lower demand and net selling price in a highly competitive market. \nSales of its next biggest product, the infection fighter Neulasta, were flat at $1.11 billion. \nProlia for osteoporosis grew 24 percent to $463 million. \nThe company said it incurred $79 million in expenses in Puerto Rico for Hurricane Maria recovery and additional incremental expenses related to tax planning. \nIt posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $4.26 billion, or $5.89 per share, as it took a $6.1 billion charge related to U.S. tax reform. That compared with a profit of $1.93 billion, or $2.59 per share, a year ago. \nAmgen shares fell to $179.35 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $185.56. Related Securities",
