    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ) will ask regulators in Brussels to look at its proposed $31 billion offer for Sky ( SKYB.L ) after it made an approach to the British company, a spokesman for the company said on Tuesday.\nThe U.S. cable group confirmed its interest in Sky earlier on Tuesday and said the move, which did not constitute a firm offer, was designed to start the regulatory process because it sees a narrow window in which it can secure a takeover, before Rupert Murdochâ€™s Fox ( FOXA.O ) seals its bid for Sky.\nReporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Alistair Smout\n ",
