    "text": "BRASILIA, Feb 6 (Reuters) - A section of a busy roadway overpass collapsed on Tuesday in the center of Brazilâ€™s capital, plunging slabs of concrete on top of parked cars and an outdoor restaurant, images on GloboNews television showed.\nFiremen were on the scene in Brasilia but there was no immediate reports of wounded, trapped or dead people.\nThe overpass is part of the main freeway that cuts through the center of the modernistic Brazilian capital built in the late 1950s and inaugurated in 1960.\nThe planned city, which is a UNESCO world heritage site, is beginning to show its age. On Sunday, a section of an apartment building collapse on a garage, destroying two dozen cars, but no one was hurt. (Reporting by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Alistair Bell)\n ",
