    "text": "EDGEWOOD, N.Y., Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (“CPI Aero®”) (NYSE American:CVU) announced today that James “Jay” Mulhall has joined the company in the role of Senior Director, Business Development and Strategy, Defense Markets. Mr. Mulhall recently retired after a 33-year career at Northrop Grumman. His last position was Senior Director of Business Development with the Military Aircraft Systems (MAS) Division, a unit of Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. In this role, he was responsible for coordination of all customer engagement and business development activities for all program and captures within a MAS portfolio that included E-2D Advanced Hawkeye (US Navy and International), E-8C Joint STARS (legacy and recapitalization), Directed Energy Programs (laser programs), F-18 and F-35 (subcontracts with Boeing and Lockheed Martin).\nDouglas J. McCrosson, President and CEO of CPI Aero, remarked: “We are excited to have Jay join CPI Aero where he will be a key member of my direct-reporting staff. We anticipate that increased spending by the United States and other countries will create new avenues of growth for CPI Aero, particularly in the area of electronic warfare (EW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and autonomous systems.
