A lawsuit against dating app Tinder IAC, -1.03% has sparked a debate about discrimination and pricing. \nTinder will no longer be able to charge older users more than younger ones, a Superior Court of Los Angeles County judge ruled last week . \nThe dating app company had started to charge users in pricing “tiers” in 2015 and, shortly after, Allan Candelore, a Tinder user in California who was older than 30 when he subscribed to Tinder Plus, sued Tinder. Consumers 30 and older were charged $19.99 per month for Tinder Plus, while those under 30 were either charged $9.99 or $14.99 per month. \nCharging users different prices is discriminatory, the Judge Brian Currey ruled, saying it violates two state laws: The Unruh Act and the Unfair Competition Law, because it amounts to age-based price discrimination . Although Tinder determined in its research that younger users have less income than older ones, some older users may not fit that mold and will be “more budget constrained,” the ruling said. \nThat’s why it violates the rules: It “employs an arbitrary, class-based generalization about older users’ incomes,” the judge wrote. \nWhen is it illegal to charge certain consumers more? \nIt is not always illegal to charge consumers different prices, said Benjamin Shiller, an assistant professor of economics at Brandeis University who has studied “personalized pricing,” the term for setting unique prices for individuals. Offering a discount to certain groups is also often legal, such as a discount to senior citizens or to students. \nBut California has especially stringent anti-discrimination rules, including the Unruh Act, said Brian Kabateck, a consumer attorney who is a founding and managing partner at Kabateck Brown Kellner in California. Case in point: Discounts for “ladies’ nights” in bars are illegal in California, while they are legal in some other states, he said. \nCharging different prices does become a problem, however, when a consumer can make the case that pricing discriminates against a class of people who are protected by anti-discrimination laws. And they vary by state. \nThe case raises more questions about ‘personalized pricing’ \nThe lawsuit against Tinder is just the first salvo against personalized pricing based on gender or age. Analytics technology has now made it possible for retailers to collect data on consumers and offer them higher or even lower prices, said Ira Rheingold, the director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C. \nA 2012 investigation in The Wall Street Journal showed several retailers, including Staples, Discover Financial Services DFS, -1.76% Rosetta Stone and Home Depot HD, -1.81% displayed different prices on their websites for different people. The retailers said a variety of factors contributed to that, including the geographic location of the consumers — such as their proximity to another, similar retail store — and their browsing history. \nBut dynamic pricing based on your socio-economic background is not as easy to detect. An online retailer may glean your age and Ivy League alma mater from Facebook FB, -1.99% he said. There’s a “real danger there.” That information may appear to be inconsequential, “but those things can become proxies for age or race,” Rheingold said. \nWomen and men are charged differently for similar products \nThere are ways to charge men and women different prices for products that are effectively the same. New York City’s Department of Consumer Affairs published a study in 2015 that showed products for women such as pink razors cost 7% more on average than those for men. But there were no legal consequences for retailers who charged more. “Shoppers should think twice before automatically buying the ‘female version’ of any product ,” wrote Julie Menin, the commissioner of the Department. \nDry cleaning services also often charge more for women’s clothing items than men’s, but many say that is because the women’s items require more specialized care. \nCompanies, however, can be penalized for charging other firms higher prices for the same products, if it hinders competition, Shiller said. The Robinson-Patman Act , an antitrust law requires companies to treat customers in “a proportionately equal manner.” \nIt often applies to companies who sell two of the same or similar products at different prices to different buyers, within a brief period of time. It also must be proven that those sales cause injury to competition , and other criteria must also be met, including the grade and quality of the products. See also",
