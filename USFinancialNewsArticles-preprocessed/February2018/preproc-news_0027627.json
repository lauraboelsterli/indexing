Macron and other EU leaders have said that the EU’s remaining 27 member states are all united behind Barnier over Brexit as the two sides enter talks over a future trade relationship. “I don’t want to waste too much time on the issue,” Macron told reporters in a question-and-answer session at the Elysee Palace.
