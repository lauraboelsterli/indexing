    "text": " 03 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago South Africa's Zuma to quit if conditions met in deal with Ramaphosa - Times Live news Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s Times Live online news service cited sources on Tuesday as saying President Jacob Zuma will resign as soon as a list of preconditions has been finalised in a deal struck with deputy president and African National Congress leader Cyril Ramaphosa. \nThe ANC’s secretary-general, Ace Magashule, who attended a meeting between the two, would not confirm whether Zuma had agreed to resign, but other ANC leaders said a deal was struck that would see Zuma “go in a dignified way”, Times Live said.
