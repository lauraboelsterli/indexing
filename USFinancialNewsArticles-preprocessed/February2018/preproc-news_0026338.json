    "text": "PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EncounterCare Solutions (OTC:ESCL) is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, CyberFuels Inc. will begin selling its EcoFlex 96 fuel in Texas. Under the new Texas state statutes, “Any state fleet with more than 15 vehicles, excluding emergency vehicles may not purchase or lease a motor vehicle unless it uses compressed gas, propane, ethanol or fuel blends of at least 85% ethanol or methanol.”\nCyberFuels has multiple blends that contain fuel methanol and denatured ethanol.\nRonald Mills, President of CyberFuels stated the acquisition of the bulk distribution facility will allow CyberFuels to deliver its fuel into the Houston and Dallas markets.\nAdditionally, the planned acquisition of the Bulk Distribution Facility will also allow for the immediate opening of a new “CyberFuels”, Inc. gas station which is in the works for the Houston market. The planned acquisition will immediately increase FY 2018 revenue by an estimated $2.8 million dollars.\nAbout CyberFuels™: CyberFuels, Inc. delivers custom blended synthetic fuels to suit almost any engine's need.\nEcoFlex96™ offers high octane alternatives to regular gasoline.\nOur gasoline and alcohol blended fuels offer superior performance over similar traditional gasoline blends. Unlike other fuel options, there is no need to retrofit the vehicle for consumption of our fuel blends.\nAll of our fuels can be transported, stored and pumped like regular gasoline.\nThe CyberFuels lines of products also include our \" Dynamo™ \" brands.\nDynamo™ Diesel Cetane Booster:\nIndependent lab certified to reduce Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM) by 20% and overall emissions by 21% and has been shown to deliver an average Cetane rating over 52 when added to regular diesel fuel at fill up, Dynamo™ Diesel Cetane Booster also improves engine performance, power, and increases miles per gallon along with improving cold flow, increasing lubricity and cleaning fuel injectors.\nDynamo™ Gasoline Octane Booster:\nImproves octane and increases the miles per gallon (mpg). Dynamo™ Gasoline Octane Booster allows consumers to purchase regular 87 octane gasoline and increase the power and performance of that fuel to equal that of superior high test 93 octane gasolines, by adding a bottle of our Dynamo™ Gasoline Octane Booster to their tank at fill up.
