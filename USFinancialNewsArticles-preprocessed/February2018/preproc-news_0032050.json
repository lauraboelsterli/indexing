It will allow us to develop new supply that we expect to be materially value accretive,” Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in a statement.\nWoodside will be offering one new share for every nine shares owned at A$27 a share, a 13 percent discount to Woodside’s last trade.\n$1 = 1.2724 Australian dollars Reporting by Sonali Paul; editing by Diane Craft\n ",
