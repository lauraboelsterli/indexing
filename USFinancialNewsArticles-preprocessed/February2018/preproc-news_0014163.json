    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Integrity Marketing Group, LLC (“Integrity”), one of the nation’s largest independent distributors of life and health insurance products, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of American Independent Marketing, Inc. (“AIM” or “the Company”), a national wholesaler of Long-Term Care and Medicare Supplement products. As part of the deal, AIM founder John Wane becomes an owner in Integrity. Financial terms of the private transaction were not disclosed.\nFounded in 1981 and headquartered in Yakima, Washington, AIM is one of the largest marketing organizations in the Western United States with over 6,000 agents. The combined business will produce almost $750 million in annualized premiums and expands Integrity’s national presence to nearly 130,000 independent agents and almost 300 full-time employees. The Company will continue to operate under the AIM brand and all employees will stay on in their current roles.\n“After running AIM for more than 30 years, succession planning was important and I began looking for a partner that would allow me to stay involved in the business but take over day-to-day management,” said John Wane, Founder & Owner of AIM. “Integrity was the clear choice because it is built on a partnership philosophy that my team and I really relate to, and would provide me with upside opportunity by being part of a larger group. I’ve known most of the Integrity partners for many years and I’m more excited about the opportunity ahead than at any time in my 50 years in the insurance business.”\n“John Wane is a legend in the Senior Market who is widely recognized for his innovation and leadership in the Long-Term Care industry, and we’re excited for him and his team to join the Integrity family,” said Bryan W. Adams, Co-Founder & CEO of Integrity. “This partnership not only strengthens our position in the Western U.S., it also further diversifies our revenue with a significant Long-Term Care business that is currently growing at more than double the market.”\n“At Integrity, we are looking for respected market leaders to join our platform, and AIM is a perfect addition,” added Steve Young, Chairman of Integrity. “But this is not just about acquiring companies. We are investing heavily in the systems, technology and people at Integrity to take our businesses to the next level, and we are excited to work with John Wane and the AIM team to help them reach their highest potential.”\nIn 2017, the combined company helped more than 400,000 Americans plan for their important life and health insurance needs, making Integrity the clear leader in the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Final Expense and Long-Term Care markets.\nAbout Integrity Marketing Group\nIntegrity Marketing Group, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is the nation’s leading independent distributor of life and health insurance products focused on serving the Senior Market. Founded in 2006, Integrity develops and distributes life and health insurance products with insurance carrier partners and markets these products through its distribution network, which includes other large insurance agencies located throughout the country that have almost 130,000 independent agents. Integrity serves nearly one million clients with almost 300 employees. In 2017, Integrity helped insurance carriers place almost $750 million in new premium.
