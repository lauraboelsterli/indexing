To participate, please dial 888.317.6003 (domestic) or 412.317.6061 (international) at least ten minutes prior to the scheduled start of the call (Passcode: 3321963). The teleconference can also be accessed via a live webcast at www.brixmor.com in the Investors section. A replay of the teleconference will be available through midnight ET on February 27, 2018 by dialing 877.344.7529 (domestic) or 412.317.0088 (international) (Passcode: 10114966) or via the web through February 12, 2019 at www.brixmor.com in the Investors section.\nThe Company's Supplemental Disclosure will be posted at www.brixmor.com in the Investors section. These materials are also available to all interested parties upon request to the Company at investorrelations@brixmor.com or 800.468.7526.\nNON-GAAP DISCLOSURES\nThe Company presents the non-GAAP performance measures set forth below. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income (presented in accordance with GAAP) or other GAAP financial measures, as an indicator of financial performance and are not alternatives to, or more meaningful than, cash flow from operating activities (presented in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP performance measures have limitations as they do not include all items of income and expense that affect operations, and accordingly, should always be considered as supplemental financial results to those presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company's computation of these non-GAAP measures may differ in certain respects from the methodology utilized by other REITs and, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by such other REITs. Investors are cautioned that items excluded from these non-GAAP measures are relevant to understanding and addressing financial performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to net income is presented in the attached table.\nNAREIT FFO\nNAREIT FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") defines FFO as net income (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP excluding (i) gain (loss) on disposition of operating properties, and (ii) extraordinary items, plus (iii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties, (iv) impairment of operating properties and real estate equity investments, and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.\nThe Company believes NAREIT FFO assists investors in analyzing Brixmor's comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating properties, real estate-related depreciation and amortization of continuing operations, impairment of operating properties and real estate equity investments, extraordinary items, and after adjustments for joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis, investors can compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods.\nSame Property NOI\nSame property NOI is a supplemental, non-GAAP performance measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. Same property NOI is calculated (using properties owned for the entirety of both periods excluding properties under development), as total property revenues (base rent, ancillary and other, expense reimbursements, and percentage rents) less direct property operating expenses (operating costs, real estate taxes and provision for doubtful accounts). Same property NOI excludes corporate level income (including management, transaction, and other fees), lease termination fees, straight-line rental income, amortization of above- and below-market rent and tenant inducements, straight-line ground rent expense and income / expense associated with the Company's captive insurance entity.\nThe Company believes same property NOI assists investors in analyzing Brixmor's comparative operating and financial performance because it eliminates disparities in NOI due to the acquisition, disposition or stabilization of development properties during the period presented and therefore provides a more consistent metric for comparing the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods.\nABOUT BRIXMOR PROPERTY GROUP\nBrixmor Property Group, a real estate investment trust (REIT), is a leading owner and operator of high-quality, open-air shopping centers. The Company's more than 475 retail centers comprise 83 million square feet in established trade areas across the nation and are supported by a diverse mix of highly productive non-discretionary and value-oriented retailers, as well as consumer-oriented service providers.
