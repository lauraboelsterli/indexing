Excluding the impact of Ultra Chem, the increase in revenues was driven by a 2.1% increase in volume, primarily in the Chemicals line of business, as well as 11.9% higher average selling prices.\nGross profit was $106.9 million, or 11.5%, and $84.4 million, or 10.6%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Company's centralized platform allowed it to effectively manage supply constraints affecting various product lines. Additionally, specialty mix increased in both the Chemicals and Plastics lines of business.\nThe Company reported net income of $26.5 million and a net loss of $8.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $44.2 million and $33.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. For a description of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to its most comparable GAAP financial measure, please read \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nFirst Quarter 2018 Performance\nThe results of the Company's operating performance are described below and, unless otherwise indicated, are a comparison of the three months ended December 31, 2017 with the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Period Over Period 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Chemicals Sales and operating revenues $ 431.9 $ 352.4 $ 79.5 22.6 % Gross profit 58.4 42.7 15.7 36.8 % Plastics Sales and operating revenues 462.2 412.5 49.7 12.0 % Gross profit 41.9 36.0 5.9 16.4 % Other Sales and operating revenues 35.5 29.9 5.6 18.7 % Gross profit 6.6 5.7 0.9 15.8 % Consolidated Sales and operating revenues 929.6 794.8 134.8 17.0 % Gross profit 106.9 84.4 22.5 26.7 %\nSegment Highlights\nChemicals - Sales and operating revenues for the Chemicals line of business for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $431.9 million, including $20.5 million in revenues from Ultra Chem, and $352.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact from Ultra Chem, the increase in revenue was driven by a 12.2% increase in average selling prices as well as a 4.0% increase in volume.\nGross profit was $58.4 million, or 13.5%, and $42.7 million, or 12.1%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by improved specialty mix compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Additionally, gross profit increased due to strong execution leveraging the Company's centralized pricing platform to effectively manage supply constraints.\nPlastics - Sales and operating revenues for the Plastics line of business were $462.2 million and $412.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The increase in revenue was primarily attributed to a 12.3% increase in average selling prices, resulting from supply constraints in various product lines in North America and line card expansion in EMEA.\nGross profit was $41.9 million, or 9.1%, and $36.0 million, or 8.7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by organic supplier growth in EMEA and strong commercial execution strengthened by leveraging the Company's centralized platform to effectively manage supply constraints affecting various product lines. Approximately $0.9 million of the increase in gross profit was due to the impact of the strengthening of exchange rates of various currencies versus the USD as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nOther - Sales and operating revenues for the Other segment were $35.5 million and $29.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher transportation costs in the most recent fiscal quarter.\nNexeo Solutions to Hold Earnings Conference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings on Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. CT (10:00 a.m. ET).

The Company’s management has included this measure because they believe it is indicative of the Company’s operating performance, is used by investors and analysts to evaluate the Company and can facilitate comparisons across periods. As presented by the Company’s management, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, certain non-GAAP financial measures as presented for financial reporting purposes herein may differ from similarly titled measures in the applicable covenants in our credit facilities.\nThe Company evaluates performance on the basis of adjusted EBITDA, which it defines as its consolidated net income (loss), plus the sum of interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization, other operating expenses, net (which primarily consists of acquisition and integration-related expenses, employee stock-based compensation expense, and other restructuring and transformational expenses), impairment charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and other income (expense), net, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, debt refinancing costs and other non-operating activity. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA is indicative of the Company’s operating performance and that it is used by investors and analysts to evaluate companies with similar capital structures. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of operating performance because:\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes the effects of income taxes, as well as the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization;\nthe Company uses adjusted EBITDA in setting performance incentive targets;\nthe Company considers gains (losses) on the acquisition, disposal and impairment of assets as resulting from investing decisions rather than ongoing operations; and\nother significant one-time items, while periodically affecting the Company's results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of its results.\nThe Company evaluates performance on the basis of adjusted net income, which it defines as its consolidated net income (loss), plus the change in fair value of contingent consideration obligation net of tax impact. Contingent consideration is comprised of two components, the Deferred Cash Consideration and the Tax Receivable Agreement (\"TRA\"), which have a non-cash impact and can change significantly quarter to quarter dependent on key valuation inputs. In order to estimate the fair value of the Deferred Cash Consideration, the Company estimates the value of the Excess Shares using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the market price of the Company’s common stock at each valuation date being a significant input to this model. Unobservable inputs to the valuation are the expected volatility during the applicable period as well as a marketability discount to reflect the illiquidity of the Excess Shares given their terms. The Company estimates the fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration related to the TRA based on a discounted cash flow model which incorporates assumptions of projected taxable income, projected income tax liabilities and an estimate of tax benefits expected to be realized as a result of the Business Combination. Key inputs to the valuation are prevailing tax rates and market interest rates impacting the discount rate. Management believes that adjusted net income is indicative of the Company’s operating performance and that it is used by investors and analysts to evaluate companies with similar capital structures. The Company believes that adjusted net income is an important indicator of operating performance because:\nAdjusted net income excludes the effects of the change in fair value of contingent consideration obligation net of tax impact, which have a non-cash impact and can change significantly quarter to quarter dependent on key valuation inputs.\nA reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to net income (loss) from continuing operations for Nexeo Solutions, Inc. and Subsidiaries, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is included at the end of this release.\nAbout Nexeo Solutions, Inc.\nNexeo Solutions is a leading global chemicals and plastics distributor, representing products from world-class producers to a diverse customer base.
