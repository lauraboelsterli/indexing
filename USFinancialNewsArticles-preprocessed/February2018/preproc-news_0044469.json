    "text": "Latvia: Latvian defense ministry says corruption claims may be disinformation campaign February 21st, 2018 Europe \nCorruption allegations that led to the suspension of Latvia’s central bank governor on Tuesday may be part of a disinformation campaign aimed at damaging trust in the country and influencing October elections, its Defence Ministry said. \nIt did not say who might be behind what it called a “massive information operation from outside”, but said it was “identical in structure and execution” to campaigns that preceded recent French, German and U.S. elections. \nThose have been blamed on Russia, which denies meddling in elections in the West. The Kremlin could not be reached for comment late on Tuesday and the Foreign Ministry in Moscow said it was unable to comment at this time. \n  reuters.com",
