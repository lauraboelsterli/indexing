Camden's definitions and calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other REITs, and thus may not be comparable. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance, or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.\nFFO\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) currently defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\")), excluding gains (or losses) associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties, real estate depreciation and amortization, impairments of depreciable assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Our calculation of diluted FFO also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, including certain non-controlling interests, which are convertible into common shares. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties, and depreciation, FFO can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate investments between periods or to different companies. A reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO is provided below:\nAdjusted FFO\nIn addition to FFO, we compute Adjusted FFO (\"AFFO\") as a supplemental measure of operating performance. AFFO is calculated utilizing FFO less recurring capital expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities. Our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other REITs, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other REITs. A reconciliation of FFO to AFFO is provided below:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 87,989 $ 40,893 $ 196,422 $ 819,823 Real estate depreciation and amortization 66,448 61,214 257,540 243,908 Real estate depreciation from discontinued operations — — — 4,327 Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 2,253 2,250 8,903 9,194 Income allocated to non-controlling interests 1,093 1,187 4,438 18,403 Gain on sale of operating properties, net of tax (43,231 ) — (43,231 ) (294,954 ) Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax — — — (375,237 ) Funds from operations $ 114,552 $ 105,544 $ 424,072 $ 425,464 Less: recurring capitalized expenditures (20,783 ) (15,475 ) (64,758 ) (59,084 ) Adjusted funds from operations $ 93,769 $ 90,069 $ 359,314 $ 366,380 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: EPS diluted 97,068 90,844 92,515 89,903 FFO/AFFO diluted 97,068 91,926 93,594 91,794 Total earnings per common share - diluted $ 0.91 $ 0.45 $ 2.13 $ 9.05 FFO per common share - diluted $ 1.18 $ 1.15 $ 4.53 $ 4.64 AFFO per common share - diluted $ 0.97 $ 0.98 $ 3.84 $ 3.99 Expected FFO\nExpected FFO is calculated in a method consistent with historical FFO, and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected earnings per common share (EPS). Guidance excludes gains, if any, on properties not currently held for sale due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales.

NOI is further detailed in the Components of Property NOI schedules on page 11 of the supplemental. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income attributable to common shareholders because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs.

The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income attributable to common shareholders because it represents income before non-cash depreciation and the cost of debt, and excludes gains or losses from property dispositions.
