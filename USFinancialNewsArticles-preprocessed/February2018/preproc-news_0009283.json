    "text": "February 5, 2018 / 7:56 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago EU's chief negotiator tells Britain - Time has come to make a Brexit choice Guy Faulconbridge , Andrew MacAskill 5 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - The European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told Britain on Monday that the time had come for Britain to make a choice on what sort of relationship it wanted with the bloc after Brexit. \nBritain has ruled out staying in any customs union with the EU after Brexit, but the nature of its trading relationship with the world’s biggest trading bloc has split Theresa May’s government and Conservative Party. \nBarnier, speaking after talks in Downing Street with Prime Minister May and Brexit Secretary David Davis, bluntly called on Britain to clarify how it saw the future relationship with the EU after it leaves on March 29, 2019. \n“The only thing I can say: without a customs union and outside the single market, barriers to trade and goods and services are unavoidable,” Barnier told reporters in Downing Street. “Time has come to make a choice.” \n“We need also clarity on the UK proposals for the future partnership,” Barnier said. \nBritain, Davis said, wanted a comprehensive free trade agreement and a customs agreement to make trade as frictionless as possible while being free to strike free trade deals with swiftly growing countries across the world. \nDavis said the talks with Barnier had been constructive and that he was confident Britain could get agreement on a time-limited transition period by the March economic council which is scheduled for March 13. \nWith little more than a year left before Britain’s March 2019 exit from the European Union, May’s party remains deeply divided over what sort of relationship should be built between the EU and the world’s sixth-largest economy. \nSuch are the divisions within May’s government, that the debate over the extent of Britain’s possible post-Brexit participation in an EU customs union has taken place in public with key ministers offering a range of views. \n“The conditions are clear: Everyone has to play by the same rules during this transition,” Barnier said. “The certainty about the transition will only come with the ratification of the withdrawal agreement.” BREXIT TARIFFS?

REUTERS/Stefan Rousseau/Pool \nMembership of the, or a, customs union after Brexit, would prevent London from striking trade deals with countries outside the EU in future. \nWhile May has repeatedly said that Britain will leave the customs union, some ministers hope that Britain could remain in some sort of bespoke customs arrangement with the EU after Brexit. \nMay’s spokesman told reporters that Britain would leave the customs union and would not be a member of a customs union with the EU after Brexit.

It also limits checks and other bureaucracies at borders between members. Related Coverage Key dates in Brexit process \nUnless Britain negotiates a new trade deal with the EU, its exports would run into the union’s external tariffs, which average about 5 percent across all goods, including 10 percent for cars and over 200 percent on certain types of poultry. \nBut May is under pressure from eurosceptic members in her party to quit the trading arrangement because for them the key prize is chance to sign new trade deals with other nations such as the United States, China and India. \nMay will hold two cabinet meetings on Wednesday and Thursday at which she will try to heal the deep divisions among her ministers over the best way to leave the EU. \nIf no deal is reached by October of this year, many businesses fear Britain could face a disorderly exit that would weaken the West, disrupt the peace in Northern Ireland, imperil Britain’s $2.7 trillion economy and undermine London’s position as the only financial centre to rival New York.
