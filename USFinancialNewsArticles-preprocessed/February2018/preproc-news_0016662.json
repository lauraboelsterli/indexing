    "text": "February 8, 2018 / 2:17 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago Russian interior ministry wants checks on Otkritie insurance unit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMOSCOW, Feb 8 (Reuters) - A deputy chairman of Russia’s central bank Vladimir Chistyukhin said on Thursday that Russia’s interior ministry has proposed a joint audit of Otkritie bank’s insurance unit Rosgosstrakh. \nThe central bank took Otkritie on in a bailout last year, putting a temporary administration in charge of what was once Russia’s largest private lender to check its balance sheet and handle the bank’s recovery. \nChistyukhin declined to comment on why the ministry had requested the joint audit of Rosgosstrakh. \nThe central bank will discuss with the ministry whether there is a need for the new audit or existing documents and information found by the central bank are enough, he said.
