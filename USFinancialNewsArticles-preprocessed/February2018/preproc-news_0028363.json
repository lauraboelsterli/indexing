    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Feb. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Singing Machine Company, Inc. (“Singing Machine” or the “Company”) (OTCQX:SMDM) – the North American leader in consumer karaoke products – today announced its financial results for its third quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThird Quarter and Year-to-Date Highlights:\nNet sales for the quarter increased by $5.1 million (31%) to $21.5 million; net sales year-to-date increased 18% to $58.2 million. Gross margin for the quarter decreased by 3.0% to 27.9%; year-to-date gross margin held steady to last year at 25.5% (compared to 25.7% in the prior year same quarter). Income from operations for the quarter increased by 15% to $2.4 million. Due to newly signed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Company recognized a one-time valuation adjustment to its deferred tax assets of approximately $330,000 in addition to the normal income tax provision, which resulted in the Company recognizing a total income tax provision of approximately ($1.1 million). Net income for the quarter decreased 12% to approximately $1.2 million; year-to-date net income decreased by $1.3 million to $1.4 million. Year-to-date earnings per share of $0.04; EBITDA earnings per share of $0.08.\nSinging Machine reports net sales of approximately $21.5 million for the quarter-ended December 31, 2017 period, compared to approximately $16.3 million in the same quarter the prior year. The increase in net sales is primarily due to new promotional shipments to an existing major customer and the Company expanding its distribution nationwide to an existing customer’s brick and mortar retail locations. Year-to-date net sales increased by 18% to approximately $58.2 million compared to $49.3 million reported in the same period in the prior year. The primary reason for the growth was due to one major retailer ordering additional inventory for expanded holiday promotions, continued sales growth online with a major e-commerce retailer, as well as expanded nationwide distribution with an existing retailer.\nGross profit margin decreased by 3% from 30.9% to 27.9%. The decrease in gross margin was due to a higher mix of promotional product shipping in the 3 rd quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit margin for the nine-month period held comparable to last year at 25.5% compared to 25.7% last year.\nTotal operating expenses increased to approximately $3.6 million compared to $3.0 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily a result of an increase of approximately $0.36 million in variable selling expenses commensurate with the overall increase in net sales. The balance of the increase was due to an increase in general and administrative expenses related to new hires in the sales and marketing department and legal expenses associated with the Toys “R” Us Bankruptcy.\nThe Company reported a 14% increase to income from operations from $2.1 million to approximately $2.4 million for the quarter primarily due to the increase in overall sales.\nAn income tax provision was recognized for the quarter for $1.1 million based on an estimated full year effective tax rate of 34%. The $1.1 million income tax provision also includes a one-time additional income tax provision of $.33 million due to reduced valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets caused by changes in tax laws enacted on December 22, 2017.\nNet income for the quarter decreased to $1.2 million from approximately $1.3 million in the same quarter of the prior year. The primary reason for the reduction in net income was due to the one-time tax provision charge described above. The Company reported earnings per share of $0.03 on a fully diluted basis for the quarter and $0.04 for the nine-month period.\nManagement Commentary:\nGary Atkinson, Singing Machine CEO commented, “We’re pleased with our 31% growth for the quarter and 18% growth in overall net sales year-to-date. This quarter we made strong strides towards our goal to make Singing Machine a global brand. Had it not been for the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy back in September 2017, this would have been a record-breaking year for Singing Machine in terms of sales and bottom-line profits. Despite the short-term disruption, we remain confident about our long-term business plan to continue to grow the business. This quarter we saw tremendous growth in our digital music streaming and download services with an 88% growth in music revenue compared to last year with all key metrics improving.”\nBernardo Melo, Vice President of Sales, commented, “Singing Machine continues to win the holiday season with successful holiday promotions across all retailers. The great results reported this year are the result of our expanded retailer distribution both domestically and abroad. We expanded domestically with new nationwide brick and mortar distribution with one major retailer. We also saw success abroad as we made our first shipments of karaoke products to Japan – a new territory for us. We also saw a strong debut of our new Singing Machine Kids line of toy products that hit the shelves at many major retailers this year and sold-thru over 80%. With many more exciting product releases scheduled in our karaoke and toy categories for 2018, we look forward to continuing our growth strategy.”\nEarnings Call Information:\nThe Company will host a conference call today, Wednesday, February 14, beginning at 10:00 am Eastern time to discuss these results and answer questions.
