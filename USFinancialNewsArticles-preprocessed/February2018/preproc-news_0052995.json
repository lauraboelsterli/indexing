    "text": "0 COMMENTS Mozambique is preparing to restart restructuring talks with owners of debt it defaulted on in 2016, according to the country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance. The Ministry announced a meeting March 20 in London “to present to creditors the key elements of debt restructuring proposals.”\nMozambique borrowed the debt—$726 million of bonds and about $1.2 billion of loans—in a series of irregular deals in 2013 and 2014 that are now the subject of an international investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The scandal over the debt prompted multilateral lenders like the International Monetary Fund to stop providing direct budgetary aid to Mozambique until the country fully accounts for how the borrowed money was spent .\nTalks with creditors stalled last year because bondholders who had already agreed to a restructuring in 2016 demanded preferential treatment to owners of the loans . It is unclear whether the government’s new proposal will include such a feature.\nThe London meeting is expected to be held at offices of law firm White & Case LLP, which is handling Mozambique’s restructuring, and the government also plans to update investors on economic and fiscal developments, according to the announcement.\nWrite to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com",
