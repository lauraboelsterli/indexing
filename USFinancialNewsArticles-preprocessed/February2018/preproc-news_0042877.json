    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 20 (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Walmart Inc on Tuesday reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit even as comparable sales in the U.S. market rose for the 14th consecutive quarter.\nSales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 2.6 percent, excluding fuel, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. Analysts forecast a gain of 2 percent, according to a poll by research firm Consensus Metrix.\nAdjusted earnings per share increased to $1.33 per share, missing expectations of $1.37 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nOnline sales grew 23 percent during the quarter, slower than the previous quarterâ€™s 50 percent rise.
