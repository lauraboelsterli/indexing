    "text": "HICKORY, N.C., Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Transportation Insight, a global Enterprise Logistics Provider and end-to-end supply chain strategist, announces that Senior Director of Integrated Solutions Bill Loftis has been named a Provider Pro to Know by Supply & Demand Chain Executive. Loftis is recognized for his ability to transform supply chain metrics into meaningful business intelligence that supports development of holistic strategies to improve asset utilization, eliminate waste and accelerate performance.\n\"As an expert in strategic network design and flow strategies, horizontal and collaborative distribution solutions and transportation network modelling, Bill advances solutions that help shippers lower reliance on unnecessary resources, and ultimately, reduce their carbon footprint as their business grows,\" says Transportation Insight President and CEO Chris Baltz. \"His academic approach to supply chain design provides value to many of our 1,500 Transportation Insight clients. We are delighted with his recognition for supply chain excellence.\"\nLoftis' supply chain perspectives have appeared in numerous industry publications, including Supply Chain Brain which published \"Horizontal Collaboration and Its Impact on Transportation, Sustainability, Service and Profits\" and \"Transportation Technology Advanced in BI and Cross-Functional Integration.\" He has also presented industry research at the Grocery Manufacturers Association Supply Chain Conference and the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals annual conference.\nLoftis' work with hundreds of Global 1000 and Fortune 500 Consumer Packaged Goods companies has applied analytics-supported solutions to improve carrier sourcing, optimize private fleets, consolidate vendors, outsource execution, and control and manage inbound and outbound freight spending. His perspective on managing strategic carrier relationships and leveraging their strengths helps shippers mitigate challenges arising as capacity tightens and demand accelerates.\n\"Capacity concerns intensified by driver shortages and regulations accelerate the need to study strategies that facilitate the use of shared resources,\" Loftis says. \"Those resources will be better utilized with fuller trucks and warehouses, and there can also be a reduction in vehicle miles, fuel consumption and air pollution emission.\"\n\"Service requirements are on top of everyone's mind. Inventory solutions are compounded for businesses that are still highly siloed,\" Loftis continues. \"As a result, many companies are making deliberate efforts to integrate their supply chain. Transportation Insight helps shippers better leverage inventory supply, demand and placement, order fulfillment and network design strategies to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce total landed cost and understand product profitability. By focusing on inventory, we help our clients address aspects of the process that make a difference to the end customer.\"\nLoftis authored Transportation Insight's grocery retail supply chain point of view, which solves key challenges in food, beverage and fresh logistics networks. His work with some of the world's largest food and beverage companies has helped them improve transportation planning and execution to reduce expenses, utilize capacity efficiently and improve executive decision-making. Integrated supply chain solutions that align with clients' business needs create positive enterprise-wide results.\nLoftis is among three Transportation Insight thought leaders to receive recognition as 2018 Pros to Know. Executive Vice President of Enterprise Business Solutions Ken Wacker and Vice President of Solutions Engineering Sophie Dabbs were also selected as Pros to Know from more than 300 nominations. With this year's awards, Transportation Insight's industry experts have received Pro to Know recognition nine times in the past five years. Transportation Insight is a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay ® Excellence Awardee.\nThe Pros to Know Awards recognize supply chain executives, and manufacturing and non-manufacturing enterprises, that are leading initiatives to help prepare their companies' supply chains for the significant challenges of today's business climate.
