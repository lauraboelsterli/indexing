    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TETRA Technologies, Inc. (or the \"Company\") (NYSE:TTI) today announced that it has entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement with the members of SwiftWater Energy Services, LLC (\"SwiftWater\"), providing for the purchase by TETRA of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in SwiftWater. SwiftWater is engaged in the business of providing water management and water solutions to oil and gas operators in the Permian Basin market.\nSwiftWater's adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $16-20 million for the 12 months following the closing of the acquisition, not including the benefit of anticipated synergies between SwiftWater and TETRA, and is expected to immediately be accretive to the Company on an earnings per share, cash flow per share, and free cash flow basis during 2018.\nThe addition of SwiftWater expands TETRA's market share in the Permian, which is one of the fastest growing basins for oilfield services globally, by adding significant capacity as well as incremental products and services.\n\"The agreement to acquire SwiftWater Energy Services shows further implementation of our strategic plans, growing our water management businesses to better serve our customers, delivering improved returns for shareholders, and providing new opportunities for employees. Our focus will continue to be identifying additional growth opportunities in our current business lines, while continuing to deliver the high levels of customer service, safety, and operational excellence our customers demand,\" said TETRA's Chief Executive Officer, Stuart M. Brightman.\n\"We see excellent synergies with nominal customer overlap between our and SwiftWater's operations in the Permian Basin, and both companies continue to see strong demand for water management solutions, creating excellent opportunities for cross-selling products and services. The acquisition of SwiftWater is expected to provide our customers an enhanced, more efficient, diverse, and strategically positioned portfolio of services.\n\"We are excited to welcome SwiftWater's quality professionals to the TETRA family, and look forward to integrating SwiftWater's highly complementary products and services into an expanded TETRA portfolio.\"\nPrior to closing, TETRA and SwiftWater will continue their respective operations, delivering high-quality products, operations and excellent customer service safely, as they have always done.\nThe closing of this transaction is anticipated to take place in the coming weeks, following the completion of customary closing conditions and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Anti-Trust Improvements Act.\nTransaction Details\nUnder the terms of the purchase agreement, consideration of $40 million of cash, subject to a working capital adjustment, and 7,772,021 shares of common stock (\"Common Stock\"), par value $0.01 per share, will be paid by TETRA at closing. The shares of Common Stock were valued at $3.86 per share. The sellers will also have the right to receive earnout payments, in an aggregate amount of up to $15 million, calculated on EBITDA and revenue of the combined water management, production testing and fluids businesses of both SwiftWater and of TETRA in the Permian Basin in respect of the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. This earnout structure reflects the consolidation of the combined businesses of TETRA and SwiftWater in the Permian Basin, and will help drive synergies and cross-selling opportunities. The earnout may be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock, at the election of TETRA. The purchase agreement contains negotiated representations, warranties and covenants by the Sellers and TETRA, which are believed to be customary for transactions of this kind.\nAbout the Companies\nTETRA is a geographically diversified oil and gas services company, focused on completion fluids and associated products and services, water management, frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, compression services and equipment, and selected offshore services including well plugging and abandonment, decommissioning, and diving.
