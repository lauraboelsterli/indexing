    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 1:31 PM / in 24 minutes Smugglers holding migrants feared drowned in Libya shipwreck: official Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nTRIPOLI (Reuters) - About 20 people feared to have drowned on a boat that sank off Libya late last week were brought back to shore by smugglers and are being held at an unknown location, an embassy official said on Wednesday. \nThe group includes eight Pakistanis, one of whom called officials to say that smugglers were holding him in a locked room with other survivors. \nPreviously, just three people were known to have survived after a boat carrying more than 90 people sank off the western Libyan town of Zuwara. \nThe bodies of 12 Pakistanis who died in the incident have been recovered and brought to a morgue in the capital, Tripoli, awaiting repatriation. \nThe victims are mostly from Gujrat in northern Pakistan, according the embassy official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. \nA total of 32 Pakistanis are believed to have been on the boat, and the number who died is still unclear, he said. \nLibya is the main gateway for migrants trying to cross to Europe by sea, though numbers have dropped sharply since July as Libyan factions and authorities - under pressure from Italy and the European Union - have begun to block departures. \nZuwara was a top departure point until a local backlash against smuggling in 2015. \nSo far this year, just over 3,500 migrants are recorded to have crossed from Libya to Italy, about 60 percent fewer than during the same period last year, according the Italian Interior Ministry. \nPakistanis are the third largest national group, after Eritreans and Tunisians. \nPakistanis resident in Libya for decades, many working in the gold business, have tried to leave because of the collapse in the value of the Libyan dinar and a severe liquidity crisis. Others have found their way to Libya through smuggling networks. Reporting by Aidan Lewis and Hani Amara; Editing by Alison Williams",
