    "text": "RACINE, Wis., Feb. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- JOHNSON OUTDOORS INC. , (NASDAQ:JOUT), a leading global innovator of outdoor recreation equipment and technology, today announced higher sales and operating profit during the Company’s seasonally slow first fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2017.\n“We’re pleased by the strong start to the year, particularly pre-season performance in Fishing and Diving which highlight the importance of our ongoing focus on innovation that delivers bigger, better new product success. Continued progress in our work to reposition Eureka ® for the future and taking actions to strengthen efficiency in Watercraft Recreation are key priorities in the face of very challenging market conditions,” said Helen Johnson-Leipold, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nFirst Quarter Results\nDuring the first fiscal quarter, the Company is ramping up for the primary selling period of its warm-weather outdoor recreation products across the second and third fiscal quarters. Total Company net sales in the quarter rose 24 percent to $116.6 million compared to net sales of $93.7 million in the prior year quarter. Key contributing factors to the results were:\nContinued positive momentum in new products from Minn Kota ® and Humminbird ® brands drove a 33 percent increase in pre-season Fishing sales. Growth in new core life-support products spurred a 17 percent jump in Diving revenue. Sales in Camping were flat year-over-year due to ongoing market challenges. Tightened retail inventory levels due to overall kayak market declines led to lower Watercraft Recreation sales.\nTotal Company operating profit for the first fiscal quarter was $7.0 million, a $6.6 million improvement over $0.5 million in the prior year first quarter. Significantly higher sales volume, and margin expansion due to a favorable mix of new products sold, drove the favorable quarter-to-quarter comparison. Gross profit gains more than offset the increase in operating expense, driven in part by implementation of the Company’s digital transformation strategy.\nNew U.S. tax reform legislation prompted a change in the valuation of deferred tax assets and a one-time transition tax on previously tax-deferred foreign earnings, resulting in a charge of $6.4 million and an unfavorable year-over-year comparison in net income. The Company reported net income of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, versus $4.1 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the previous year’s quarter.\nOther Financial Information\nAt December 29, 2017, the Company reported cash and short-term investments, net of debt, of $78.3 million versus $38.9 million in the prior year. Depreciation and amortization was $3.2 million compared to $3.1 million in the previous year’s quarter. Capital spending increased to $6.5 million in the current quarter versus $2.7 million in the prior year quarter due to strategic investment in systems upgrades and digital transformation. In December 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of record as of January 11, 2018 which was payable on January 25, 2018.\n“We continue to benefit from our ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency, enabling us to strengthen margins, keep working capital in check and spend today for the future,” said David W. Johnson, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Additionally, the balance sheet remains strong, providing us the financial capacity and flexibility to strategically invest in growing our business while also paying a cash dividend to our shareholders.”\nWebcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio web cast at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, February 2, 2018. A live listen-only web cast of the conference call may be accessed at Johnson Outdoors' home page. A replay of the call will be available on the website for the subsequent 30 days.\nAbout Johnson Outdoors Inc.\nJ OHNSON O UTDOORS is a leading global outdoor recreation company that inspires more people to experience the awe of the great outdoors with innovative, top-quality products.
