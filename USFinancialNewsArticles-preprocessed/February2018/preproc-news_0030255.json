VIPs, however, won at a higher rate than usual, pushing net profit for the country’s No. 2 casino operator down to A$32.9 million ($26 million), compared to a consensus estimate of A$89 million.\nStar shares fell as much as 7 percent by mid-session, their biggest decline in two and a half years, giving the company a market value of A$4.7 billion. The broader market was flat.\nBekkier said he was unfazed by the lower win rate since the company had logged several half-year periods of higher-than-usual house wins.\nThe company said “normalised” interim profit, in which casinos re-calculate results with a consistent win rate to give a clearer view of their performance, rose 12 percent to A$120.4 million.\n“I am really, really happy with how this business is developing, how it’s bounced back in the North Asian business and how our diversification strategy continues to get traction,” he said.\nA recovery in Asian gambling hub Macau, the only Chinese territory where gambling is allowed, was helping send VIPs to Australia because “no player that comes to Australia has not played in Macau before”, he added.\nStar, which plans to build a new resort in the middle of the tourist-friendly Brisbane city, declared an interim dividend of 7.5 cents per share, unchanged from the previous year.\nCrown Resorts, 47 percent-owned by billionaire James Packer, reports first-half results on Feb. 22.
