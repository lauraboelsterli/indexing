    "text": "1 COMMENTS Government bonds strengthened Wednesday, recouping some of their losses after renewed concerns over the course of Federal Reserve policy had sent yields jumping.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.870%, compared with 2.910% Tuesday. Long bonds also bounced higher, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond—which often reflects investors’ longer-term outlook for the economy—down to 3.130% from 3.175% Tuesday.\nBond yields, which fall as prices rise, declined overnight as data showed the pace of growth in China’s manufacturing sector falling sharply in February . Yields then held on to their declines after Commerce Department data showed growth in the U.S. economy was slightly weaker than initially thought at the end of last year .\nGross domestic product expanded at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.5% during the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That revision marked a deceleration from the department’s initial 2.6% estimate, but was in line with what economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected.\nBond yields have hit multiyear highs in recent weeks, pressured by signs that inflation could be accelerating and that there may not be enough demand to meet additional Treasurys issuance.\n“We’ve shifted from a deflationary narrative to more of a reflationary one, and that’s driven a good deal of the move we’ve seen in Treasury yields this month,” said Lisa Hornby, fixed-income portfolio manager at Schroders.\nMore recently, bonds have also come under pressure as the Federal Reserve has hinted it could raise interest rates more quickly than investors had expected at the start of the year. Bond yields jumped Tuesday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cited the possibility that inflation —a threat to bonds because it chips away at the purchasing power of their fixed payments—could accelerate.\nSome investors, like Ms. Hornby, remain skeptical that prices will pick up at a pace that will threaten markets.\n“Inflation is rising, but won’t likely move to more pernicious levels,” she said.\nStill, with Mr. Powell new to the Fed chairmanship, his comments on inflation and growth will likely continue to be closely watched by investors looking to gauge whether the Fed will tweak the course of monetary policy. Mr. Powell is expected to deliver additional comments Thursday at a semiannual address before the Senate Banking Committee.\n“The seller’s won yesterday’s sweepstakes, but today and tomorrow are where we are likely to find out who wins this latest Fed expectation tug of war,” said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James.\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com",
