In addition, the Company provided its initial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018.\n\"Continued improvements to our product offering and successful execution of marketing campaigns drove robust financial results this quarter, closing out a strong year,\" said Avishai Abrahami, Co-founder and CEO of Wix. \"Most notably, Wix ADI improved considerably throughout the year, driving conversion improvements and increases in collections per subscription. These successes, combined with upcoming new products and enhancements, underscore our position of strength for the year ahead.\"\nLior Shemesh, CFO of Wix, added, \"The growth in collections and free cash flow in Q4 closes a year of ongoing strengthening to our business fundamentals and exceeded our initial expectations since the beginning of the year. For the third consecutive year, we grew collections over 41%, and this year we did it along with nearly doubling our free cash flow. This outstanding momentum is reflected in our initial 2018 outlook and provides us with confidence in our ability to continue to generate growth and increase free cash flow moving forward.\"\nQ4 2017 and Full Year 2017 Financial Summary\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\n$ in thousands\n2016\n2017\nY/Y growth\nPrior Q4 2017 Outlook\nRevenue\n$84,176\n$118,545\n41%\n$116,000 - 117,000\nCollections\n$97,652\n$132,203\n35%\n$126,000 - 127,000\nOperating (Loss)\n$(4,742)\n$(7,523)\nNM\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\n$3,879\n$9,703\n150%\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n$19,714\n$24,941\n27%\nFree Cash Flow\n$18,683\n$19,555\n5%\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n$ in thousands\n2016\n2017\nY/Y growth\nPrior FY 2017 Outlook\nRevenue\n$290,103\n$425,636\n47%\n$423,000 - 424,000\nCollections\n$342,069\n$483,989\n41%\n$478,000 - 479,000\nOperating (Loss)\n$(44,032)\n$(50,011)\nNM\nNon-GAAP Operating\nIncome (Loss)\n$(12,529)\n$9,099\nNM\nNet Cash Provided by\nOperating Activities\n$40,573\n$83,052\n105%\nFree Cash Flow\n$36,158\n$70,683\n95%\n$68,000 - 69,000\nAdditional Q4 2017 Results and Highlights\nGross margin on a GAAP basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 85%, the same as the fourth quarter of 2016 Non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017, calculated as non-GAAP gross profit as a percent of revenue, was also 85%, the same as in the fourth quarter of 2016 GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $(6.6) million, or $(0.14) per share, compared to a net loss of $(5.9) million, or $(0.13) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016 Non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.2 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to a non-GAAP net income of $3.0 million, or $0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $24.9 million, while capital expenditures totaled $5.4 million, leading to free cash flow of $19.6 million, compared to $18.7 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 5% year over year increase Added 170,000 net premium subscriptions in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reach 3.2 million as of December 31, 2017, a 31% increase over the total number of subscriptions at the end of 2016 Added 5.3 million registered users in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Wix grew its collaboration with Google throughout the last year by expanding the breadth of products it utilizes including G Suite, Google Cloud Platform, Google Maps API, YouTube and AdWords. Official Launch of Wix Code: In December 2017, Wix officially launched Wix Code to all users. Wix Code is a powerful development platform that allows users to significantly extend the functionality of their online presence.

Since its launch, over 140,000 users have put Wix Code to use, marking a fantastic start to this innovative product set. New Wix Tools Help Users with Site Accessibility: Wix has added Site Accessibility into the Wix Editor, now available for all sites on Wix. With these tools, a user can make their websites work better with assistive technologies or navigable with just a keyboard. Now any user can easily make any site accessible, for free.\nFinancial Outlook\nWix is introducing its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018.

Collections represents the total cash collected by us from our customers in a given period and is calculated by adding the change in deferred revenues for a particular period to revenues for the same period. Non-GAAP gross margin represents gross profit calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and amortization, divided by revenue. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) represents operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, amortization, and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP net income (loss) represents net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expense, amortization, and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share represents non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of shares used in computing GAAP loss per share. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures.\nThe presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. The Company has not reconciled its guidance as to free cash flow to cash flow from operations because it does not provide guidance for cash flow from operations. As items that impact cash flow from operations are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the Company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to cash flow from operations is not available without unreasonable effort.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties.
