If PEMEX does not receive the Majority Consents for a series, it will not purchase any of the Any and All Notes of such series, and the indenture for such series will not be amended. PEMEX reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to waive any and all conditions to any Offer.\nMaximum Series Cap; Waterfall Tender Cap; Proration\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Statement, PEMEX is offering to purchase an aggregate principal amount of Waterfall Notes of a series in an aggregate principal amount that results in the payment of the aggregate amount that such holders are entitled to receive for each series of Waterfall Notes validly tendered, including accrued interest, not to exceed the Maximum Series Cap for such series (the \"Series Aggregate Purchase Price\"). In addition, PEMEX will only accept for purchase Waterfall Notes in an aggregate principal amount that results in the payment of a combined Series Aggregate Purchase Price for all series, not to exceed U.S.$400 million (the \"Waterfall Tender Cap\"). PEMEX reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to increase any of the Maximum Series Caps or the Waterfall Tender Cap at any time, subject to applicable law.\nSubject to the Waterfall Tender Cap and the Maximum Series Cap for each series of Waterfall Notes, all Waterfall Notes validly tendered in the Waterfall Tender Offers accepted for payment on the Early Tender Date or the Expiration Date, as applicable, will be accepted based on the Acceptance Priority Level (with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 3 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level), set forth in the table above under the heading \"Waterfall Tender Offers\". All Waterfall Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any Waterfall Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted in the Waterfall Tender Offers, and all Waterfall Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any Waterfall Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted in the Waterfall Tender Offers. However, Waterfall Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase in priority to other Waterfall Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date, even if such Waterfall Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than Waterfall Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date.\nIf the Series Aggregate Purchase Price for any series of Waterfall Notes exceeds the Maximum Series Cap for such series, subject to the terms and conditions of the Waterfall Tender Offers, PEMEX will accept for purchase on a pro rata basis, based on the Maximum Series Cap for such series, Waterfall Notes of such series that have been validly tendered and not yet accepted for purchase in the Waterfall Offer (with appropriate adjustment to avoid purchase of Waterfall Notes in a principal amount other than U.S.$10,000 and an integral multiple of U.S.$1,000 in excess thereof), provided that in no event shall PEMEX be obligated to purchase an aggregate principal amount of Waterfall Notes of a series that would result in the Series Aggregate Purchase Price for such series exceeding the Maximum Series Cap for such series. Any tendered Waterfall Notes not accepted for purchase will be promptly credited to such Holder's account with DTC or otherwise returned to the Holder without cost.\nFurther Information\nGlobal Bondholder Services Corporation will act as the Depositary and Information Agent for the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitation.

With effect from such termination, any Exchange Securities or Tender Offer Securities blocked in DTC will be released.\nHolders are advised to check with any bank, securities broker or other intermediary through which they hold Exchange Securities or Tender Offer Securities as to when such intermediary needs to receive instructions from a holder in order for that holder to be able to participate in, or (in the circumstances in which revocation is permitted) revoke their instruction to participate in, the Offers, before the deadlines specified herein and in the Exchange Offer Documents, Retail Tender Offer Documents or Statement, as applicable. The deadlines set by each clearing system for the submission and withdrawal of tender instructions will also be earlier than the relevant deadlines specified herein and in the Exchange Offer Documents, Retail Tender Offer Documents or Statement, as applicable.\nThis announcement is for informational purposes only. This announcement is not an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any Tender Offer Securities or Exchange Securities. The Exchange Offers are being made solely pursuant to the Offering Memorandum and related documents, the Retail Tender Offers are being made solely pursuant to the Offer to Purchase and related documents and the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitation are being made solely pursuant to the Statement. The Offers are not being made to holders of Exchange Securities or Tender Offer Securities in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. In any jurisdiction in which the securities laws or blue sky laws require the Offers to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offers will be deemed to be made on behalf of PEMEX by the Dealer Managers for the Offers or one or more registered brokers or dealers that are licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.\nThe New Money Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\").

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the \"PRIIPs Regulation\") for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.\nThis communication and any other documents or materials relating to the Offers have not been approved by an authorized person for the purposes of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the \"FSMA\").
