    "text": "A daily morning look at the financial stories you need to know to start the day. \nSTOCKS/ECONOMY \n-Stock futures are sharply lower after Thursday's flat close followed a whipsaw day of wild swings. Investors are increasingly spooked by rising interest rates . \n-The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond is up to 2.79 percent. \n-We get the January jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET. The consensus estimate is that 180,000 net new jobs were created and there was a 0.3 percent gain in average hourly earnings. Anything more than that expected wage increase could push interest rates even higher and fuel a stock selloff.",
