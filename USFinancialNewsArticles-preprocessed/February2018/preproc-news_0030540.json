    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PetVivo Holdings, Inc. ( www.petvivo.com ) (OTCMARKET:PETV) an emerging biomedical device Company, is moving Mr. David Merrill, a member of the Board of Directors, to cover the newly formed position of Special Revenue Consultant. His role under this title will be to oversee Marketing and Sales to successfully drive our product launch into meaningful revenues.\n“Mr. Merrill’s enjoyed a 40+ year career in the Medical Device arena, serving as an executive at Medtronic, St. Jude and I-Flow Kimberly Clark. Merrill’s focus was on sales and market development internationally. He served as Vice President, CRM, Asia-Pacific at Medtronic, and Vice President, International, at I-Flow/Kimberly Clark,” stated Wes Hayne, PetVivo CEO. “As one of his first actions he is announcing the addition of Tami Wenthold to represent sales and market development in Minnesota. Tami will join representatives located in Nebraska, Ohio, and Arizona.”\n“You can feel the momentum building. Our field sales team is booming with enthusiasm. Meetings have been scheduled with Key Opinion Leaders during the NVAC meeting later this week. It’s an exciting time to be a member of the Kush-PetVivo team,” Merrill stated.\nFirst small batch processing to test the production format is expected to be produced within a week. Petvivo is using a date of mid-March to mid-April for commercial release. An independent sales team is being assembled along with training, market materials and the numerous items and issues that make up a typical product launch. Veterinaries should start hearing about the product with a soft launch through April and May 2018.\nCompany management and representatives have been attending industry trade shows in anticipation of the “Kush” product launch. Cynthia Sweatt, Office Director/Sales Co-Ordinator attended the Veterinary Meeting & Expo (VMX) show last week in Orlando, Florida. As the country’s largest trade show of its kind, it was previously called the North American Veterinary Community (NAVC) show. February 15-17 of this week, Wes Hayne (CEO), Randy Wenthold, (Chief Science Officer) and Cynthia Sweatt, (Office Director/Sales Co-Ordinator) will all be in attendance for the Minnesota Veterinary Medical Association (MVMA) in Rochester, Minnesota. During their stay in Rochester they will be spending a fair amount of time at Elite Custom Solutions, which will be hosting the manufacturing of “Kush”.\nAbout PetVivo Holdings, Inc.\nPetVivo Holdings Inc. (OTCPINK:PETV) is an emerging biomedical device company focused on the licensing and commercialization of innovative medical devices for pets and pet therapeutics. PetVivo is leveraging investments made in the human medical device industry to commercialize therapeutics for pets in a capital and time efficient way. A key component of this strategy is the accelerated timeline to revenues for veterinary medical devices, which enter the market much earlier than the more stringently regulated pharmaceuticals.\nPetVivo's strategy is to commercialize proprietary products from human medical device companies specifically for the companion animal market. The company’s product pipeline includes seventeen animal and human therapeutics. A portfolio of twenty patents protects the company’s products, production processes and biomaterials. PetVivo’s lead product, a veterinarian-administered joint injection for the treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs, is scheduled for launch later this year.\nThe Company will also be seeking licensing partners to commercialize its portfolio of proprietary human clinical therapeutics in large market sectors, including: cardiovascular, orthopedic, urology and aesthetics.\n(All Press Releases Will Be Available for Viewing on Facebook or the Web at www.petvivo.com )\nForward-Looking commercial Statements:\nThe foregoing material may contain forward-looking statements.
