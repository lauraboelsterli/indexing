    "text": "ENCINO, Calif., Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Research Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB: RSSS), a pioneer in providing cloud-based solutions for scientific research, reported financial results for its fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal Second Quarter 2018 Summary vs. Year-Ago Quarter\nTotal revenue increased 12% to $6.8 million. Platform revenue up 89% to $413,000, with a 92% increase in total Platform deployments to 184. Annual recurring revenue was up 89% to $1.7 million. Transaction revenue up 9% to $6.4 million, with customer count up 12% to 1,044. Transaction count up 6% to 205,019. Total gross margin up 280 basis points to 25.4%. Net loss from continuing operations was $0.7 million, or $(0.03) per share, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million, or $(0.05) per share.\nManagement Commentary\n\"Our second quarter showed continued robust growth in our SaaS-based Platforms offering, which helped support a strong quarter in our Transactions business,\" said Peter Derycz, president and CEO of Research Solutions. \"Version 2.0 of our Article Galaxy Platform went live in December and the early feedback on user experience has been quite positive. We look forward to completing the migration by March and implementing other major framework additions, like self-registration, in the next several months.\n\"We began the calendar year with a particularly strong month in our Platforms business, and look forward to building upon this momentum as the year unfolds. We expect this will be driven not only by the framework additions, but weekly improvements produced by our gadget factory, and a sales & marketing department we are refining to drive optimum efficiency and investment returns.\"\nFiscal Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue increased 12% to $6.8 million compared to $6.1 million in the same year-ago quarter.\nPlatform subscription revenue increased 89% to $413,000 compared to $219,000 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to a 92% increase in the total number of paid Platform deployments to 184. The quarter ended with annual recurring revenue up 89% to $1.7 million (see the company's definition of annual recurring revenue below).\nTransaction revenue increased 9% to $6.4 million compared to $5.9 million in the same year-ago quarter. Total active customers increased 12% from 936 to 1,044, and transaction count increased 6% from 193,000 to 205,000 (see the company's definition of active customer accounts and transactions below).\nTotal gross margin increased 280 basis points to 25.4% from 22.6% in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by a 150 basis point increase in Transactions gross margin and a revenue mix shift to the higher-margin Platforms business.\nTotal operating expenses were unchanged at $2.4 million compared to the year-ago quarter, aligned with the company's strategy to optimize its sales resources, including the reallocation of expenses and more efficient ways of acquiring customers through content generation and digital and inbound marketing.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $0.7 million, or $(0.03) per share, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million, or $(0.05) per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $(0.3) million compared to $(0.7) million in the year-ago quarter (see definition and further discussion about the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, below).\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 were $4.9 million compared to $5.8 million at June 30, 2017. There were no outstanding borrowings under the company's $2.5 million revolving line of credit. Apart from a $0.3 million office lease liability due to new accounting guidance for leases, the company had no long-term liabilities or other debt.\nFurther details about these results are available in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is available in the investor relations section of the company's website at www.researchsolutions.com.\nConference Call\nResearch Solutions President and CEO Peter Derycz and CFO Alan Urban will host an investor conference call to discuss these results and the company's outlook, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Wednesday, February 14, 2018\nTime: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-855-327-6837\nInternational dial-in number: 1-631-891-4304\nConference ID: 10004236\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

The quantity of customers per month is defined as customers with at least one transaction during the month.\nA transaction is an order for a unit of copyrighted content fulfilled or managed in the Platform.\nThe company defines annual recurring revenue as the value of contracted Platform subscription recurring revenue normalized to a one-year period.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measure â€“ Adjusted EBITDA\nResearch Solutions' management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various financial metrics. In addition to the company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the company's operating results.\nThe tables below provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense, other income (expense), foreign currency transaction loss, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, income from discontinued operations, gain on sale of discontinued operations, and other potential adjustments that may arise.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss):\nQuarter Ended December 31,\nSix Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet Income (loss)\n$ (624,580)\n$ (842,960)\n$ 218,380\n$ (1,397,545)\n$ (1,253,626)\n$ (143,919)\nAdd (deduct):\nInterest expense\n3,000\n3,000\n-\n6,000\n6,000\n-\nOther income (expense)\n(11,312)\n(5,424)\n(5,888)\n(24,114)\n(10,134)\n(13,980)\nForeign currency translation loss\n(485)\n17,631\n(18,116)\n(12,872)\n20,955\n(33,827)\nProvision for income taxes\n9,816\n9,337\n479\n21,567\n22,942\n(1,375)\nDepreciation and amortization\n46,330\n32,426\n13,904\n86,898\n62,895\n24,003\nStock-based compensation\n314,565\n303,097\n11,468\n600,807\n405,686\n195,121\nIncome from discontinued operations\n-\n(222,626)\n222,626\n-\n(318,515)\n318,515\nGain on sale of discontinued operations\n(79,353)\n-\n(79,353)\n(136,502)\n-\n(136,502)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ (342,019)\n$ (705,519)\n$ 363,500\n$ (855,761)\n$ (1,063,797)\n$ 208,036\nAbout Research Solutions\nResearch Solutions, Inc.
