Among those were economic influence, power, citizenship and quality of life, which collectively helped determine each country's success as a modern nation. \nEntrepreneurship is the most highly-weighted bucket in the overall \"Best Countries\" score, McPhillips says. \nTo determine which countries are most encouraging of entrepreneurs, researchers looked at the following 10 attributes: connectedness to the rest of the world, education of the population, entrepreneurial, innovative, provides easy access to capital, skilled labor force, technological expertise, transparency of business practices, well-developed infrastructure and well-developed legal framework. show chapters 1:52 PM ET Wed, 26 April 2017 | 01:15 \nThe rankings are part of an analysis project called the 2018 Best Countries Report, conducted now for three years by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and global consumer insights firm Y&R's BAV Group. \n\"The Best Countries report speaks to the effect a nation's brand can have on its economic prosperity and perceived standing in the world,\" Wharton professor of marketing David Reibstein said in a statement. \nHere are the top 10 best countries for entrepreneurs as detailed in the 2018 U.S. News & World Report: 10.
