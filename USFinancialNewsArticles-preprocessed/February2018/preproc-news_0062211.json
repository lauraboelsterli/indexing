    "text": "February 27, 2018 / 7:50 PM / in 24 minutes U.S. finds China aluminum foil imports dumped, subsidized: trade group Reuters Staff 3 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has made a final determination that imports of some aluminum foil from China are being sold in the United States at less than their fair value and producers are benefiting from subsidies from Beijing, an aluminum trade group said on Tuesday. The Aluminum Association said in a statement that antidumping and countervailing duties would be levied on a number of Chinese firms, with dumping margins ranging from 48.64 percent to 106.09 percent and anti-subsidy rates of 17.14 percent to 80.97 percent. The Commerce Department’s formal announcement on the decision has not yet been released publicly. The duties, which would take effect for five years, remain subject to a finding of injury to U.S. producers by the International Trade Commission (ITC), which is due to announce its decision by March 15. U.S. President Donald Trump is due to decide soon whether to impose much broader duties on steel and aluminum imports under a national security investigation, amid mounting trade friction with China. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser, Liu He, will visit the United States this week, China’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday, to exchange views “on China-U.S. relations and the two countries’ economic and trade cooperation.” The foil case, the first the U.S. aluminum industry has brought against China’s aluminum sector, could serve as a litmus test for the “Section 232” decision and other aluminum anti-dumping cases aimed at curbing excess Chinese production. In 2016, imports of aluminum foil from China were valued at an estimated $389 million, Commerce Department figures show. Last month, a group of U.S. aluminum foil producers told the ITC their industry had been devastated by Chinese imports and needed anti-dumping duties to survive and invest. “The Aluminum Association and its foil-producing members are extremely pleased with the Commerce Department’s final determinations,” the group’s president, Heidi Brock, said in the statement announcing the decision. “U.S. aluminum foil producers are among the most competitive producers in the world, but they cannot compete against products that are sold at unfairly low prices and subsidized by the Government of China,” Brock said. According to the U.S. trade group, the Commerce Department antidumping margins will be set at 48.64 percent for Jiangsu Zhongji Lamination Materials Co Ltd, at 106.09 percent for Hangzhou Dingsheng Import & Export Co Ltd, 84.94 percent for cooperative respondents and 106.09 pecent for all other producers in China. Countervailing duty margins will be 17.14 percent for Jiangsu Zhongji Lamination Materials, 19.98 percent for Hangzhou Dingsheng Import & Export, 18.56 percent for all others except for non-cooperative correspondents, which face a rate of 80.97 percent, the association said, citing Commerce Department figures.
