(the “Company”) (NASDAQ: LNTH), parent company of Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc. (“LMI”), a global leader in the development, manufacture and commercialization of innovative diagnostic imaging agents and products, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full 2017.\nThe Company’s worldwide revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $81.2 million. This represents an increase of 9.3% compared to $74.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, worldwide revenues totaled $331.4 million, compared to $301.9 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of a $5.0 million up-front payment received in the second quarter of 2017 from GE Healthcare under the flurpiridaz F 18 collaboration and license agreement, full year 2017 revenue totaled $326.4 million, exceeding 2017 guidance of $323 million to $325 million. Full year revenue results were driven by 19.5% growth in worldwide sales of DEFINITY ® , 5.5% growth in worldwide sales of TechneLite ® and 7.9% growth in worldwide sales of Xenon.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $97.1 million, or $2.47 per diluted share, compared to $4.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 net income totaled $123.4 million, compared to $26.8 million in 2016. The full year improvement is primarily attributable to the release of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, as well as DEFINITY and Xenon revenue growth and lower interest expense following the refinancing and subsequent repricing of our debt facility during 2017. This was partially offset by increased operating expenses for sales and marketing as well as costs related to strategic initiatives.\nThe Company’s fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA (as outlined in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation provided below) was $20.8 million, or 25.7% of revenues, compared to $19.8 million, or 26.7% of revenues, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $94.1 million, or 28.4% of revenues, compared to $78.3 million, or 25.9% of revenues, for 2016. Excluding the impact of a $5.0 million up-front payment received in the second quarter of 2017 from GE Healthcare under the flurpiridaz F 18 collaboration and license agreement, full year Adjusted EBITDA totaled $89.1 million, or 27.3% of revenues, exceeding 2017 guidance of $86 million to $88 million. Higher Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2017 was driven by DEFINITY and Xenon revenue growth, partially offset by sales and marketing expenses attributable to sales growth in DEFINITY as well as costs related to strategic initiatives.\n“We are pleased to announce such a successful finish to 2017, a milestone year for the Company on many fronts,” commented Mary Anne Heino, President and CEO. “Our performance and improved balance sheet have positioned us well to make the requisite investments in our own internal initiatives as well as potential external opportunities to augment our strong core business and future growth.”\nOutlook\nThe Company anticipates worldwide revenues for full year 2018 of approximately $337 million to $342 million, compared to $326.4 million in 2017 (which excludes the $5 million up-front payment received from GE Healthcare). For the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects worldwide revenues in the range of $78 million to $83 million.\nThe Company anticipates full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, as described in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation provided later in this release, of $85 million to $90 million, representing 24.9% to 26.7% of anticipated worldwide revenues. For the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $18 million to $21 million.\nThe Company’s guidance for worldwide revenues and Adjusted EBITDA are .

be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts.\n– Tables Follow –\nLantheus Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands,
