    "text": "(Reuters) - Kenya’s Dickson Chumba cruised to victory at the Tokyo Marathon, beating Japan’s Yuta Shitara who set a national record on Sunday.\nChumba, who previously won the event in 2014, sprinted clear from the lead pack near the 36-km mark and held off a late charge from Shitara to cross the line in two hours, five minutes and 30 seconds.\nShitara was 41 seconds adrift as he finished ahead of Kenya’s Amos Kipruto, who timed 2:06:33.\nThe 26-year-old Shitara’s 2:06:11 becomes the fastest time in history for a Japanese man ahead of Toshinari Takaoka’s 2:06:16 finish in Chicago in 2002.\nIn the women’s category, Ethiopia’s Birhane Dibaba and Ruti Aga claimed the top two positions in 2:19:51 and 2:21:19, respectively.\nAmerican Amy Cragg came across in 2:21:42 to take third spot. Hiroko Yoshitomi was the first to cross the line among Japanese women, claiming sixth place in 2:30:16.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru\n ",
