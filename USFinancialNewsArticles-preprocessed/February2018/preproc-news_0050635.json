This marks a new growth chapter for OSL and we are forecasting 2018 as the year cryptocurrencies become mainstream. Growth in the cryptocurrency space shows no signs of slowing and having talented professionals, with strong financial and investment backgrounds, means we can deliver world-class OTC trading services.\"\nWayne Trench, CEO, said today, \"My vision for the business is to ensure OSL builds and retains global market leadership in cryptocurrency brokerage, attracting world-class clients and talent in the process. As a strong believer in the utility of digital assets, as well as the underlying blockchain technology, I am delighted to have joined the OSL team. This is a particularly exciting time in the crypto-space as institutional adoption is ramping up aggressively. This is precisely where OSL can deliver significant value in terms of execution, regulatory compliance, best in class security and bank-like risk controls.\"\nJulia Pang, COO, continued, \"OSL is the largest and most experienced Asia-based digital asset broker, consistently ranking amongst the top three globally. OSL is respected within the industry for strong corporate governance and a robust risk framework. Our focus for 2018 is to become the \"go to\" resource for institutional crypto investment flow and my appointment is part of this mission.
