Its nickel division recorded another operating loss, at 125 million euros, with Bories saying cost savings at its New Caledonia mining operations were offset by problems at its Sandouville plant in France.\n* The group is considering a plan to raise manganese mine output in Gabon by over 30 percent in future. It has estimated the investment at 450 million euros, with a decision expected mid-2019.\n$1 = 0.8097 euros Reporting by Gus Trompiz and Benjamin Mallet; Editing by Mathieu Rosemain and Adrian Croft\n ",
