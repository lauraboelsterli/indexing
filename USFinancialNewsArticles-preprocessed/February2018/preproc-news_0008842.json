    "text": "JAKARTA, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Indonesiaâ€™s largest lender by assets PT Bank Mandiri will consider buying a bank in the Philippines after its non-performing loan (NPL) ratio falls to below 3 percent, chief executive Kartika Wirjoatmodjo told reporters on Tuesday.\nHe did not share further details about the plan.\nMandiri has lowered its NPL ratio to 3.46 percent in 2017 from 4 percent a year earlier, which has helped the bank increase net profit by 49 percent.
