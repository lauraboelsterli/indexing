    "text": "- Fourth Quarter 2017 Comparable Portfolio RevPAR Growth of 6.0% -\n- EBITDA Outperformance Driven by Newly Acquired Assets –\n- Exceeds High-End of 2017 Guidance –\nPHILADELPHIA, Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hersha Hospitality Trust (NYSE:HT) (“Hersha,” “Company,” “we” or “our”), owner of high quality hotels in urban gateway markets and coastal destinations, today announced results for the full-year and fourth quarter\nFull-Year and Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet income applicable to common shareholders was $75.7 million, or $1.79 per diluted common share, in 2017, compared to net income applicable to common shareholders of $95.6 million, or $2.18 per diluted common share, in 2016.\nNet loss applicable to common shareholders was ($14.3 million), or ($0.36) per diluted common share, in fourth quarter 2017, compared to net income applicable to common shareholders of $1.1 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share, in fourth quarter 2016. The decrease in full year and fourth quarter 2017 net income and net income per diluted common share was primarily due to a decline in gains on dispositions of hotel assets.\nMr. Jay H. Shah, Hersha’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our portfolio grew substantially in the fourth quarter as we outperformed in all of our core markets. The outperformance was driven by several of our newly acquired assets that are exhibiting strong fundamental growth and are benefitting from our revenue and asset management strategies. In addition, strength in the South Florida market from Hurricane related recovery efforts and the abatement of Zika fears allowed us to exceed our internal growth forecasts and beat the high end of our 2017 financial guidance range. Our comparable portfolio delivered 6.0% RevPAR growth and 110 basis points of EBITDA margin growth during the fourth quarter 2017. Margins at our recently refreshed and newly acquired hotels benefited from a combination of cost containment initiatives and innovative pricing and distribution strategies.”\nMr. Shah continued, “Results over the prior quarter and in early 2018 leave us encouraged for continued growth in corporate travel spending and sustained leisure demand. As we look into 2018, we are encouraged by favorable comps and positive fundamentals from our market-leading clusters on the West Coast, New York, Boston, and South Florida. We’ve spent the last several years on selective capital recycling opportunities and meaningful ROI-generating capital investments at a number of our hotels, positioning them to leverage domestic and global GDP growth and the reacceleration of lodging fundamentals.”\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (“AFFO”) in 2017 decreased by $12.9 million, or 11.7%, to $96.9 million, compared to $109.8 million in 2016. The Company’s weighted average diluted common shares and units of limited partnership interest in Hersha Hospitality Limited Partnership (“OP Unit”) outstanding declined to approximately 44.8 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to approximately 45.7 million as of December 31, 2016. AFFO per diluted common share and OP Unit in 2017 was $2.16, a 10.0% decrease from AFFO of $2.40 per diluted common share and OP Unit reported in 2016.\nAFFO in the fourth quarter 2017 decreased by $1.6 million, or 7.0%, to $21.4 million, compared to $23.0 million in the fourth quarter 2016. AFFO per diluted common share and OP Unit in the fourth quarter 2017 was $0.48, a 7.7% decrease from AFFO per diluted common share and OP Unit of $0.52 in the same quarter in 2016. An explanation of certain non- used in this press release, including, among others, AFFO, as well as reconciliations of those non- , to GAAP net income, is included at the end of this press release.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nRevenue per available room (“RevPAR”) at the Company's 38 comparable hotels increased 6.0% to $184.59 in the fourth quarter 2017. The Company’s average daily rate (“ADR”) for the comparable hotel portfolio increased 1.8% to $223.94, while occupancy grew 330 basis points to 82.4%. Hotel EBITDA margins for the comparable hotel portfolio increased 110 basis points to 33.4%.\nThe best performing assets during the fourth quarter were in the Company’s South Florida portfolio, which reported 22.5% RevPAR growth to $174.86. Performance was driven by hurricane-related compression and a resurgence in leisure travel to Miami as waning Zika fears, stronger economic growth and stabilization of international inbound tourism drove strong demand. We remain bullish on the Miami market and foresee robust operating fundamentals in 2018 and beyond, benefitting from advantageous comps and the reopening of the Miami Beach Convention Center.\nWest Coast\nThe West Coast portfolio, which includes California and Seattle, consisted of eight hotels as of December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter 2017, the Company’s comparable West Coast hotel portfolio reported RevPAR growth of 3.3% to $164.03, driven by a 1.9% ADR increase to $208.09. The West Coast portfolio’s outperformance was driven by the Sanctuary Beach Resort, recording 13.0% RevPAR growth, due to an increase in demand and marketing strategies that leveraged the new Salt Wood Kitchen & Oysterette following its renovation. Looking ahead in 2018, fundamentals for our market-leading hotels on the West Coast remain strong and we believe will continue to drive profitability and free cash flow growth.\nNew York City and Manhattan\nThe New York City portfolio, which includes the five boroughs, consisted of ten hotels as of December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter 2017, the Company’s comparable New York City hotel portfolio reported RevPAR growth of 3.1% to $236.26, driven by an occupancy increase of 207 basis points to 94.2%. The Company’s comparable Manhattan portfolio, which consisted of seven hotels as of December 31, 2017, reported RevPAR growth of 1.6% to $266.05 driven by an occupancy increase of 102 basis points to 95.0%. Hersha’s Manhattan portfolio reported GOP and Hotel EBITDA margins of 53.9% and 41.8%, respectively, in the fourth quarter 2017. The Company’s comparable Manhattan portfolio has outperformed the Manhattan market in 14 of the previous 16 quarters as a result of a young, well-located and purpose built hotel cluster that appeals to the tastes and preferences of today’s traveler.\nPhiladelphia\nThe Philadelphia Urban and Metro portfolio, which includes Center City and the surrounding suburbs, consisted of four hotels as of December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter 2017, the Company’s comparable hotel portfolio reported RevPAR growth of 9.8% to $169.10, driven by an ADR increase of 7.4% to $226.75. The Philadelphia portfolio’s outperformance was driven by continued stabilization post acquisition at the Philadelphia Westin, which experienced RevPAR and ADR growth of 9.8% and 7.8%, respectively. Following a challenging third quarter with difficult comps from the DNC in 2016, the Philadelphia market saw a rebound in leisure activity in the market related to favorable city-wide activities such as the Army-Navy game in December.\nDispositions\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company closed on the sale of the 80-room Holiday Inn Express in Chester, NY for $8.4 million or $105,000 per key.\nFinancing\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company maintained financial flexibility with $18 million of cash and cash equivalents and significant capacity on the Company’s $250 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2017, 67.0% of the Company’s consolidated debt was fixed rate debt or hedged through interest rate swaps and caps. The Company’s total consolidated debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.85% and a weighted average life-to-maturity of approximately 4.2 years.\nSubsequent Events\nOn February 6, 2018, the Cindat joint venture successfully refinanced the existing debt on seven assets in Manhattan owned in the joint venture owned by the Company and Cindat Capital Management Limited. The joint venture entered into a new $300 million senior mortgage loan and $85 million of mezzanine financing and refinanced the existing $285 million senior loan, the $50 million mezzanine loan and redeemed $43.2 million of Hersha’s 9% cumulative redeemable preferred interest in the joint venture.\nOn February 16, 2018, the Company sold the 140-room Hyatt House in Gaithersburg, MD for $19.0 million or $136,000 per key.\nShare Repurchase Activity\nIn the fourth quarter 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 1.7 million common shares for an aggregate repurchase price of $30.4 million. Since January 1, 2014, the Company has repurchased $232.3 million in common shares, representing 21.8% of the January 1, 2014 float.\nIn the fourth quarter 2017, Hersha’s Board of Trustees approved a new share repurchase program of up to $100 million of the Company’s outstanding common shares. The new repurchase program expires on December 31, 2018, unless extended by the Board of Trustees.\nDividends\nHersha paid a cash dividend of $0.4297 per Series C Preferred Share, $0.40625 per Series D Preferred Share, and $0.40625 per Series E Preferred Share ending December 31, 2017. The preferred share dividends were paid January 16, 2018 to holders of record as of January 1, 2018.\nThe Company also declared cash dividends totaling $0.28 per common share and per limited partnership unit ending December 31, 2017. These common share dividends and limited partnership unit distributions were paid January 16, 2018 to holders of record as of January 5, 2018.\nFirst Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company is providing its operating and financial expectations for the first quarter and full-year 2018.

We calculate FFO applicable to common shares and Common Units in accordance with the April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of NAREIT, which we refer to as the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated assets, plus certain non-cash items, such as loss from impairment of assets and depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our interpretation of the NAREIT definition is that non-controlling interest in net income (loss) should be added back to (deducted from) net income (loss) as part of reconciling net income (loss) to FFO. Our FFO computation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do.\nThe GAAP measure that we believe to be most directly comparable to FFO, net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, includes loss from the impairment of certain depreciable assets, our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures and land, depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses on property sales, non-controlling interest and preferred dividends. In computing FFO, we eliminate these items because, in our view, they are not indicative of the results from our property operations. We determined that the loss from the impairment of certain depreciable assets, including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and land, was driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of certain hotel properties and other assets as determined by our analysis of those assets in accordance with applicable GAAP. As such, these impairments have been eliminated from net income (loss) to determine FFO.\nHersha also presents Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO), which reflects FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition further adjusted by:\nadding back non-cash share based compensation expense; adding back acquisition and terminated transaction expenses; adding back contingent considerations; adding back amortization of deferred financing costs; adding back adjustments for the amortization of discounts and premiums; adding back write-offs of deferred financing costs on debt extinguishment, both for consolidated and unconsolidated properties; adding back straight-line amortization of ground lease expense and prior period tax assessment expenses; and adding back unconsolidated joint venture management company transaction costs and state and local tax expense related to prior period assessment.\nFFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company’s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. We consider FFO and AFFO to be meaningful, additional measures of our operating performance because they exclude the effects of the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because they are widely used by industry analysts as performance measures. We evaluate our performance by reviewing AFFO, in addition to FFO, because we believe that adjusting FFO to exclude certain recurring and non-recurring items as described above provides useful supplemental information regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of AFFO, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income (loss), more completely describes our operating performance. We show both FFO from consolidated hotel operations and FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures because we believe it is meaningful for the investor to understand the relative contributions from our consolidated and unconsolidated hotels. The display of both FFO from consolidated hotels and FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures allows for a detailed analysis of the operating performance of our hotel portfolio by management and investors. We present FFO and AFFO applicable to common shares and OP Units because our OP Units are redeemable for common shares. We believe it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO and AFFO applicable to all common shares and OP Units. Certain amounts related to depreciation and amortization and depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations in the prior year FFO reconciliation have been recast to conform to the current year presentation. In addition, based on guidance provided by NAREIT, we have eliminated loss from the impairment of certain depreciable assets, including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and land, from net (income) loss to arrive at FFO in each year presented.\nThe following table reconciles FFO and AFFO for the periods presented to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss) applicable to common shares, for the same periods:\nHERSHA HOSPITALITY TRUST Funds from Operations (FFO) and Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) (in thousands, except shares and per share data) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net (loss) income applicable to common shares $ (14,335 ) $ 1,133 $ 75,699 $ 95,579 (Loss) income allocated to noncontrolling interest (776 ) 204 5,072 4,477 (Income) loss from unconsolidated joint ventures (164 ) (587 ) (13,767 ) 1,823 Gain on disposition of hotel properties (806 ) (21,000 ) (90,350 ) (115,839 ) Loss from impairment of depreciable assets 3,869 - 5,926 - Depreciation and amortization 22,518 18,131 83,752 75,390 Funds from consolidated hotel operations applicable to common shares and Partnership units 10,306 (2,119 ) 66,332 61,430 Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint venture investments 164 587 13,767 (1,823 ) Income from remeasurement of investment in unconsolidated joint ventures - - (16,240 ) - Depreciation and amortization of difference between purchase price and historical cost (302 ) (225 ) (1,207 ) (418 ) Interest in depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures 2,751 3,421 11,366 14,819 Funds from unconsolidated joint venture operations applicable to common shares and Partnership units 2,613 3,783 7,686 12,578 Funds from Operations applicable to common shares and Partnership units 12,919 1,664 74,018 74,008 Add: Loss on remediation of hurricane damage, excluding impairment of depreciable assets 669 - 2,424 - Lease Buyout 26 16,831 (268 ) 16,831 Non-cash extinguishment of issuance costs upon redemption of Preferred Shares - - - 4,021 Non-cash share based compensation expense 3,818 2,255 9,286 8,048 Acquisition and terminated transaction costs 82 827 2,203 2,560 Tax expense related change in tax law and gain from remeasurement of investment in unconsolidated joint venture 2,856 - 4,689 - Amortization of deferred financing costs 561 679 2,278 2,624 Interest in amortization of deferred financing costs of unconsolidated joint venture 371 389 1,476 987 Amortization of discounts and premiums (127 ) (174 ) (604 ) (1,265 ) Deferred financing costs and debt premium written off in debt extinguishment 4 111 590 1,187 Straight-line amortization of ground lease expense 232 159 834 640 State and local tax expense related to reassessment of prior period assessment - 292 - 162 Adjusted Funds from Operations $ 21,411 $ 23,033 $ 96,926 $ 109,803 AFFO per Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares and Partnership Units Outstanding $ 0.48 $ 0.52 $ 2.16 $ 2.40 Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares and Partnership Units Outstanding 44,152,788 44,636,006 44,834,724 45,740,227\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Our interpretation of Adjusted EBITDA is that EBITDA derived from our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures should be added back to net income (loss) as part of reconciling net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA. Our Adjusted EBITDA computation may not be comparable to EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA reported by other companies that interpret the definition of EBITDA differently than we do. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA to be a meaningful measure of a REIT's performance because it is widely followed by industry analysts, lenders and investors and that it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, GAAP net income (loss) as a measure of the Company's operating performance.\nHERSHA HOSPITALITY TRUST Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net (loss) income applicable to common shareholders $ (14,335 ) $ 1,133 $ 75,699 $ 95,579 (Loss) income allocated to noncontrolling interest (776 ) 204 5,072 4,477 (Income) loss from unconsolidated joint ventures (164 ) (587 ) (13,767 ) 1,823 Gain on disposition of hotel properties (806 ) (21,000 ) (90,350 ) (115,839 ) Property losses in excess of insurance recoveries and impairment of assets 4,538 - 8,350 - Non-operating interest income (34 ) (143 ) (271 ) (362 ) Distributions to Preferred Shareholders 6,045 5,374 24,169 17,380 Interest expense 11,082 10,425 42,662 44,352 Extinguishment of issuance costs upon redemption of Preferred Shares - - - 4,021 Income tax expense (benefit) 3,682 (375 ) 5,262 (4,888 ) Deferred financing costs and debt premium written off in debt extinguishment 4 111 590 1,187 Depreciation and amortization 22,518 18,131 83,752 75,390 Acquisition and terminated transaction costs 82 827 2,203 2,560 Lease Buyout 26 16,831 (268 ) 16,831 Non-cash share based compensation expense 3,818 2,255 9,286 8,048 Straight-line amortization of ground lease expense 232 159 834 640 Unconsolidated joint venture management company transition costs and state and local tax expense related to reassessment of prior period assessment - 292 - 162 Adjusted EBITDA from consolidated hotel operations 35,912 33,637 153,223 151,361 Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint venture investments 164 587 13,767 (1,823 ) Gain on remeasurement of investment in unconsolidated joint venture - - (16,240 ) - Depreciation and amortization of difference between purchase price and historical cost (302 ) (225 ) (1,207 ) (418 ) Adjustment for interest in interest expense, depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures 4,442 5,440 17,821 22,443 Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated joint venture operations 4,304 5,802 14,141 20,202 Adjusted EBITDA $ 40,216 $ 39,439 $ 167,364 $ 171,563\nHotel EBITDA\nHotel EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in the hotel industry for a specific hotel or group of hotels. We believe Hotel EBITDA provides a more complete understanding of the operating results of the individual hotel or group of hotels. We calculate Hotel EBITDA by utilizing the total revenues generated from hotel operations less all operating expenses, property taxes, insurance and management fees, which calculation excludes Company expenses not specific to a hotel, such as corporate overhead. Because Hotel EBITDA is specific to individual hotels or groups of hotels and not to the Company as a whole, it is not directly comparable to any GAAP measure. In addition, our Hotel EBITDA computation may not be comparable to Hotel EBITDA or other similar metrics reported by other companies that interpret the definition of Hotel EBITDA differently than we do. Management believes Hotel EBITDA to be a meaningful measure of performance of a portfolio of hotels because it is followed by industry analysts, lenders and investors and that it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, operating income (loss) as reported in our unaudited summary results as a measure of our hotel portfolio’s operating performance.\nHERSHA HOSPITALITY TRUST
