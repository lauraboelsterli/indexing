    "text": "Evgenii Dadonov scored a hat trick to lift the Florida Panthers to a 6-5 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday.\nVincent Trocheck, Jamie McGinn and Derek MacKenzie also scored for the Panthers.\nEvgeni Malkin scored twice for the Penguins, and Carl Hagelin, Patric Hornqvist and Bryan Rust also tallied.\nGoaltender Roberto Luongo posted 32 saves for Florida, while backup Tristan Jarry had 12 for Pittsburgh before he was replaced in the second period. Matt Murray recorded 12 saves in relief.\nDadonov one-timed a pass from Aleksander Barkov at 18:07 of the third for the game-winner.\nTrocheck finished a 2-on-1 cross-ice pass from Denis Malgin after a breakout pass from Yandle to open the scoring early in the first period. Trocheck tapped in the pass at 3:44 for his team-leading 24th goal, and sixth in his last seven games.\nThe Penguins tied it when Hagelin beat Luongo, scoring his eighth goal at 12:40 to even it at 1-1.\nFlorida regained the lead at 19:21 when Dadonov collected a loose puck along the boards, beat Penguins defenseman Brian Dumoulin into the slot and zipped his 16th goal over Jarry’s glove.\nMcGinn took a diagonal pass from Jared McCann and jammed in his eighth goal past Jarry’s right pad at 2:07 of the second.\nMacKenzie finished off a rebound from a Colton Sceviour at 8:12 for his third goal to give Florida a 4-1 advantage.\nThe Penguins then replaced Jarry with Matt Murray, who started in the club’s 6-1 win over Carolina on Friday night.\nMalkin scored his 35th goal when he chipped in a pass from Bryan Rust at 13:10.\nHornqvist had a goal overturned when it was ruled he pushed Luongo and the puck across the line late in the second.\nMalkin scored 46 seconds into the third period by roofing a shot over Luongo.\nDadonov answered 58 seconds later when he one-timed a pass from Barkov for a 5-3 lead.\nHornqvist scored a power-play goal -- his 17th -- and Rust added his 10th just 49 seconds later to tie it at 5-5, before Dadonov’s game winner three minutes later.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
