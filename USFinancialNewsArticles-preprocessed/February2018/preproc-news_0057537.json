Several Fed policymakers have advocated a review of how the Fed sets its inflation target and “that is a good thing to do and I am hopeful the committee will go ahead and do it,” Bullard said. But to change “you would have to get buy-in from the political side. You would have to get buy-in from the larger financial community.” Reporting by Howard SchneiderEditing by Chizu Nomiyama",
