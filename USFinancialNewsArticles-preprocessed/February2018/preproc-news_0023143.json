    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CNA Financial Corporation (NYSE: CNA) today announced fourth quarter 2017 net income of $223 million, or $0.82 per share, and full year 2017 net income of $899 million, or $3.30 per share. Net income in the quarter included a charge of $83 million relating to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nFourth quarter 2017 core income (formerly referred to as net operating income) was $286 million, or $1.05 per share, and full year 2017 core income was $919 million, or $3.38 per share. Net investment income, after tax, was $366 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1,462 million for the full year. Property & Casualty Operations combined ratio for the fourth quarter and full year was 94.0% and 97.1%, respectively.\nCNA Financial declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share and a special dividend of $2.00 per share, payable March 14, 2018 to stockholders of record on February 26, 2018.\nResults for the Three Months\nEnded December 31\nResults for the Year\nEnded December 31\n($ millions, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$\n223\n$\n241\n$\n899\n$\n859\nCore income\n286\n221\n919\n824\nNet income per diluted share\n$\n0.82\n$\n0.89\n$\n3.30\n$\n3.17\nCore income per diluted share\n1.05\n0.82\n3.38\n3.04\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n$\n45.15\n$\n44.25\n45.02\n44.89\n(a)\nWhat we previously referred to as \"Net operating income (loss)\" in our public disclosures, we now refer to as \"Core income (loss).\" Additionally, the related financial measures of \"Net operating income (loss) per diluted share\" and \"Net operating income (loss) return on equity\" have also been changed accordingly. The fourth quarter 2017 increase in income tax expense from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset as a result of the enacted U.S. Federal income tax rate change has been excluded from Core income. There were no other changes to the calculation of Core income and related measures. With this terminology change, we also removed \"Non-Core\" from the titles of our Life & Group and Corporate & Other segments to avoid confusion.\n\"CNA generated $919 million of core income, the highest level in almost a decade and 12% higher than 2016, despite one of the largest catastrophe loss years in the industry's history,\" said Dino E. Robusto, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CNA Financial Corporation. \"The strength of our fourth quarter and full year results combined with our heightened underwriting focus and execution provide excellent momentum going into 2018.\"\nProperty & Casualty Operations\nResults for the Three\nMonths Ended December 31\nResults for the Year Ended\nDecember 31\n($ millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet written premiums\n$\n1,601\n$\n1,525\n$\n6,534\n$\n6,442\nNWP change (% year over year)\n5\n%\n(4)\n%\n1\n%\n—\n%\nNet investment income\n$\n305\n$\n322\n$\n1,232\n$\n1,205\nCore income\n263\n217\n959\n982\nLoss ratio excluding catastrophes and development\n60.7\n%\n63.4\n%\n61.0\n%\n62.8\n%\nEffect of catastrophe impacts\n2.3\n1.8\n6.0\n2.6\nEffect of development-related items\n(4.1)\n(0.2)\n(4.4)\n(4.6)\nLoss ratio\n58.9\n%\n65.0\n%\n62.6\n%\n60.8\n%\nExpense ratio\n34.6\n%\n35.1\n%\n34.2\n%\n34.9\n%\nCombined ratio\n94.0\n%\n99.9\n%\n97.1\n%\n95.9\n%\nCombined ratio excluding catastrophes and development\n95.8\n%\n98.3\n%\n95.5\n%\n97.9\n%\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results - Property & Casualty Operations\nProperty & Casualty Operations' core income was $263 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with $217 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher favorable net prior period loss reserve development and improved current accident year underwriting results.\nThe combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development decreased 2.5 points as compared with the prior year quarter driven by 2.7 points of improvement in the loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development and a 0.5 point improvement in the expense ratio, partially offset by an increase in the policyholder dividend ratio. The expense ratio included a 0.8 point accrual of additional incentive compensation recorded in the current quarter to reflect full year corporate performance.\nThe combined ratio decreased 5.9 points as compared with the prior year quarter. Net catastrophe losses were $38 million, or 2.3 points of the loss ratio in the quarter as compared with $28 million, or 1.8 points of the loss ratio, for the prior year quarter. Favorable net prior period development improved the loss ratio by 4.1 points in the quarter as compared with a 0.2 point improvement in the prior year quarter.\nNet written premiums grew 5% in the quarter.\nFull Year 2017 Results - Property & Casualty Operations\nProperty & Casualty Operations' core income was $959 million for the full year 2017 as compared with $982 million in the prior year. This decrease was due to higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results.\nThe combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development decreased 2.4 points as compared with the prior year driven by 1.8 points of improvement in the loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development and a 0.7 point improvement in the expense ratio.\nThe combined ratio increased 1.2 points as compared with the prior year. Net catastrophe losses were $380 million, or 6.0 points of the loss ratio for the full year as compared with $165 million, or 2.6 points of the loss ratio, for the prior year. Favorable net prior period development improved the loss ratio by 4.4 points in the current year as compared with a 4.6 point improvement in the prior year.\nNet written premiums grew 1% for the full year.\nBusiness Operating Highlights\nSpecialty\nResults for the Three\nMonths Ended December 31\nResults for the Year Ended\nDecember 31\n($ millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet written premiums\n$\n671\n$\n672\n$\n2,771\n$\n2,780\nNWP change (% year over year)\n—\n%\n(5)\n%\n—\n%\n—\n%\nCore income\n$\n140\n$\n164\n$\n610\n$\n650\nLoss ratio excluding catastrophes and development\n61.9\n%\n64.0\n%\n61.6\n%\n62.9\n%\nEffect of catastrophe impacts\n0.3\n0.5\n1.8\n0.6\nEffect of development-related items\n(5.7)\n(11.0)\n(7.6)\n(10.7)\nLoss ratio\n56.5\n%\n53.5\n%\n55.8\n%\n52.8\n%\nExpense ratio\n32.9\n%\n32.4\n%\n32.0\n%\n32.0\n%\nCombined ratio\n89.6\n%\n85.6\n%\n88.0\n%\n85.0\n%\nCombined ratio excluding catastrophes and development\n95.0\n%\n96.1\n%\n93.8\n%\n95.1\n%\nCore income decreased $24 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with the prior year quarter driven by lower favorable net prior period loss reserve development. For the full year, core income decreased $40 million.\nThe combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development decreased 1.1 points as compared with the prior year quarter driven by 2.1 points of improvement in the loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development offset by a slightly higher expense ratio. For the full year, the combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development decreased 1.3 points.\nThe combined ratio increased 4.0 points as compared with the prior year quarter. Net catastrophe losses were $2 million, or 0.3 points of the loss ratio in the quarter down from $4 million, or 0.5 points of the loss ratio, for the prior year quarter. Favorable net prior period development improved the loss ratio by 5.7 points in the quarter as compared with an 11.0 point improvement of the loss ratio in the prior year quarter. For the full year, the combined ratio increased 3.0 points driven by a lower level of favorable development.\nNet written premiums were consistent with the prior year quarter and consistent with the prior full year.\nCommercial\nResults for the Three\nMonths Ended December 31\nResults for the Year Ended\nDecember 31\n($ millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet written premiums\n$\n713\n$\n669\n$\n2,882\n$\n2,841\nNWP change (% year over year)\n7\n%\n(4)\n%\n1\n%\n1\n%\nCore income\n$\n107\n$\n31\n$\n341\n$\n311\nLoss ratio excluding catastrophes and development\n59.4\n%\n64.0\n%\n60.2\n%\n62.1\n%\nEffect of catastrophe impacts\n4.4\n3.0\n9.4\n4.1\nEffect of development-related items\n(2.1)\n14.2\n(1.7)\n2.5\nLoss ratio\n61.7\n%\n81.2\n%\n67.9\n%\n68.7\n%\nExpense ratio\n34.8\n%\n36.9\n%\n35.2\n%\n36.8\n%\nCombined ratio\n97.4\n%\n118.0\n%\n103.7\n%\n105.8\n%\nCombined ratio excluding catastrophes and development\n95.1\n%\n100.8\n%\n96.0\n%\n99.2\n%\nCore income increased $76 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with the prior year quarter primarily due to significant improvement of net prior period loss reserve development and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results. For the full year, core income increased $30 million.\nThe combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development decreased 5.7 points as compared with the prior year quarter driven by 4.6 points of improvement in the loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development as well as 2.1 points of improvement in the expense ratio due in part to earned premium reductions taken in the prior year quarter, partially offset by an increase in the policyholder dividend ratio. For the full year, the combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development decreased 3.2 points.\nThe combined ratio decreased 20.6 points as compared with the prior year quarter. Net catastrophe losses were $32 million, or 4.4 points of the loss ratio in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $21 million, or 3.0 points of the loss ratio, for the prior year quarter. Favorable net prior period development improved the loss ratio by 2.1 points in the quarter as compared with a 14.2 point increase of the loss ratio in the prior year quarter. For the full year, the combined ratio decreased 2.1 points.\nNet written premiums increased 7% in the quarter, or 2% when adjusted for the unfavorable premium rate adjustment within Small Business in the fourth quarter of 2016. Growth came from higher new business within Middle Markets, positive renewal premium change and strong retention of 86%. For the full year, net written premiums grew 1%.\nInternational\nResults for the Three\nMonths Ended December 31\nResults for the Year Ended\nDecember 31\n($ millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet written premiums\n$\n217\n$\n184\n$\n881\n$\n821\nNWP change (% year over year)\n18\n%\n2\n%\n7\n%\n—\n%\nCore income\n$\n16\n$\n22\n$\n8\n$\n21\nLoss ratio excluding catastrophes and development\n61.2\n%\n59.4\n%\n61.8\n%\n64.8\n%\nEffect of catastrophe impacts\n1.5\n1.7\n7.9\n3.9\nEffect of development-related items\n(5.5)\n(12.8)\n(2.7)\n(7.7)\nLoss ratio\n57.2\n%\n48.3\n%\n67.0\n%\n61.0\n%\nExpense ratio\n39.5\n%\n37.8\n%\n37.8\n%\n38.1\n%\nCombined ratio\n96.7\n%\n86.1\n%\n104.8\n%\n99.1\n%\nCombined ratio excluding catastrophes and development\n100.7\n%\n97.2\n%\n99.6\n%\n102.9\n%\nCore income decreased $6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower favorable net prior period loss reserve development. For the full year, core income decreased $13 million.\nThe combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development increased 3.5 points as compared with the prior year quarter driven by a 1.8 point increase in the loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development and a 1.7 point increase in the expense ratio driven primarily by an accrual for incentive compensation and legal and advisory costs related to Brexit. For the full year, the combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development decreased 3.3 points.\nThe combined ratio increased 10.6 points as compared with the prior year quarter. Net catastrophe losses were $4 million, or 1.5 points of the loss ratio as compared with $3 million, or 1.7 points of the loss ratio, for the prior year quarter.

For the full year, the combined ratio increased 5.7 points.\nNet written premiums increased 18% in the quarter, or 13% excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates. This growth was driven by higher new business, retention and renewal premium change.

For the full year, core loss decreased $88 million.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income, after tax, was $366 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared with $379 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by fixed income securities, which had an after-tax return of 3.4% in the current quarter as compared with 3.5% in the prior year quarter. Limited partnerships returned 2.2% in the fourth quarter compared with 2.4% in the prior year quarter.\nNet investment income, after tax, was $1,462 million for the full year 2017 as compared with $1,427 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by limited partnerships, which returned 9.1% in 2017 as compared with 6.3% in the prior year.\nAbout the Company\nCNA is the eighth largest commercial insurer in the United States.

These ratios are calculated using financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nLoss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums.\nExpense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums.\nDividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders' dividends incurred to net earned premiums.\nCombined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios.\nRenewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes.\nRate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change.\nRetention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew.\nNew business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers.\nThe Company's investment portfolio is monitored by management through analysis of various factors including unrealized gains and losses on securities, portfolio duration and exposure to market and credit risk.\nReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures\nThis press release also contains financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP. Management utilizes these financial measures to monitor the Company's insurance operations and investment portfolio. The Company believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures follow below.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Core Income\nCore income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after-tax effects of i) net realized investment gains or losses, ii) income or loss from discontinued operations, iii) any cumulative effects of changes in accounting guidance and iv) deferred tax asset and liability remeasurement as a result of an enacted U.S. Federal tax rate change. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes net realized investment gains or losses because net realized investment gains or losses are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance, and are therefore not considered an indication of trends in insurance operations. Management monitors core income (loss) for each business segment to assess segment performance. Presentation of consolidated core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure.\nResults for the Three Months\nEnded December 31\nResults for the Year Ended\nDecember 31\n($ millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$\n223\n$\n241\n$\n899\n$\n859\nLess: Net realized investment gains\n20\n20\n63\n35\nLess: Net deferred tax asset remeasurement\n(83)\n—\n(83)\n—\nCore income\n$\n286\n$\n221\n$\n919\n$\n824\nReconciliation of Net Income per Diluted Share to Core Income per Diluted Share\nCore income (loss) per diluted share provides management and investors with a valuable measure of the Company's operating performance for the same reasons applicable to its underlying measure, core income (loss). Core income per diluted share is core income on a per diluted share basis.\nResults for the Three Months\nEnded December 31\nResults for the Year Ended\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income per diluted share\n$\n0.82\n$\n0.89\n$\n3.30\n$\n3.17\nLess: Net realized investment gains\n0.08\n0.07\n0.23\n0.13\nLess: Net deferred tax asset remeasurement\n(0.31)\n—\n(0.31)\n—\nCore income per diluted share\n$\n1.05\n$\n0.82\n$\n3.38\n$\n3.04\nReconciliation of Book Value per Share to Book Value per Share Excluding AOCI\nBook value per share excluding AOCI allows management and investors to analyze the amount of the Company's net worth primarily attributable to the Company's business operations.
