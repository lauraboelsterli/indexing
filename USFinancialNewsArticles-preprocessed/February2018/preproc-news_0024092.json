    "text": "NY attorney general sues Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein over sexual misconduct written by admin February 11, 2018 \nNEW YORK (Reuters) – New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Sunday he had filed a civil suit against The Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein, and Bob Weinstein, alleging the company’s executives and board failed to protect employees from movie producer and former CEO Harvey Weinstein. \nWeinstein, the 65-year-old co-founder of the Miramax studio, was one of Hollywood’s most influential men before more than 70 women accused him of sexual misconduct, including rape. He denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. \nThe lawsuit alleges that Weinstein sexually harassed employees and abused women for years. It says that Weinstein Company executives, including his brother and co-CEO Bob, failed to act despite repeatedly being presented with credible evidence of his sexual harassment and misconduct. \nThe Weinstein Company and a spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein were not immediately available for comment.

REUTERS/Joe Penney/File Photo \nSchneiderman is seeking an unspecified amount of restitution and damages, plus penalties, for harm to victims. \nAny sale of The Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated, Schneiderman said in a statement. \nThe studio has been in talks to sell itself to a group of investors led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, but Schneiderman’s lawsuit has put deal negotiations on hold, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe New York Times first reported in October on multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the allegations. \nSince then, similar allegations have been leveled against many powerful men in business, politics and entertainment, and the #MeToo movement has emerged of victims using social media to share their stories of harassment and abuse.
