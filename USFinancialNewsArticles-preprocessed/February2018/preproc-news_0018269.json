Actual results could differ materially from these as a result of certain factors, including, without limitation, risks related to changes in Everspin’s estimated 2017 financial guidance based on the completion of our financial statement closing procedures and the review by our independent registered public accounting firm of such financial statements, included in Everspin’s various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 13, 2017, Annual Report on Form 10K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2017, under the caption “Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Our Industry.” Subsequent events may cause these expectations to change, and Everspin disclaims any obligations to update or alter these in the future, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nEverspin Contacts:\nMichael Schoolnik Story Public Relations 415-674-3816 Michael@storypr.com\nLeanne K.
