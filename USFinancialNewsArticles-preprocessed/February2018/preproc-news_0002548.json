    "text": "February 3, 2018 / 7:22 PM / Updated an hour ago Rugby - Sexton breaks French hearts with last-second drop goal Julien Pretot 3 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - Johnny Sexton’s last-second drop goal earned Ireland a dramatic 15-13 away victory against France in their Six Nations opener as Les Bleus suffered an agonising defeat in coach Jacques Brunel’s first game in charge on Saturday. \nSexton’s 44-metre drop goal almost three minutes into injury time stunned the Stade de France as the hosts thought they would prevail after a splendid late try by wing Teddy Thomas. \nBut Sexton, who scored all his team’s points as he also slotted home four penalties, had other ideas. \n“When (Sexton) struck the drop goal I was just willing it had enough distance to go over,” said Ireland coach Joe Schmidt. \nFrance had stayed in contention thanks to Maxime Machenaud’s two penalties before Thomas’s dazzling run and Anthony Belleau’s conversion had put them ahead for the first time. \nLes Bleus, who have not won in their last seven games, lost teenage sensation Matthieu Jalibert after the flyhalf suffered a knee injury in the first half. \nBrunel, who took over from Guy Noves after a poor November series, banked on Jalibert to instil some life into the French team, but the 19-year-old limped off the field after half an hour. \nReplacement scrumhalf Antoine Dupont was also injured. \n“We have to wait for the medical exams but it seems to be serious for Antoine Dupont, and possibly for Matthieu Jalibert,” Brunel told a news conference. Rugby Union - Six Nations Championship - France vs Ireland - Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France - February 3, 2018 Ireland’s Johnny Sexton and Rory Best in action with France’s Maxime Machenaud REUTERS/Regis Duvignau \nFrance were penalised for offside early on and Sexton coolly slotted home the penalty as Ireland got off to a lively start. \nThe hosts were often pinned back to their own half with Connor Murray’s kicks proving tough to handle, but they enjoyed a good spell after 15 minutes as Jalibert showed a lot of pace. \nBut Ireland defended ferociously and never allowed Les Bleus into their 22 metres.

Related Coverage Rugby - We paid for our lack of discipline, says France captain Guirado \nThe second rower was sanctioned again for offside and Sexton converted the resulting penalty to fatten up Ireland’s advantage, only for Machenaud to reply with a penalty. \nFrance were still in contention after Sexton missed his first penalty of the night and Thomas scored the only try of an otherwise locked game. \nBelleau converted to put France ahead but missed another penalty. Ireland pushed in the closing stages and Sexton fired a fine drop goal after a long spell of possession. \nFrance travel to Scotland while Ireland host Italy next weekend.
