    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Dalton Education will serve as a Signature Sponsor of CFP Board's 2018 Registered Programs conference, demonstrating their commitment to excellence in financial planning education and support for CFP® certification.\nThe conference, which is being held February 22-23 in Arlington, Virginia, will convene the country's leading financial planning programs for in-depth sessions and discussions about best practices in delivering financial planning education, especially for NextGen audiences. Dalton will also be sponsoring a general session on providing pro bono services, focusing on how the financial planning education community can give back to the communities it serves.\n\"It is a great honor to serve as a Signature Sponsor of this conference. We look forward to working with our colleagues in financial education to continue to improve its quality, create opportunities for learning, and ultimately educate more people to become CFP® professionals. This year is particularly important as the CFP Board's diversity initiative is beginning to take off. We are committed to helping shape the new face of the financial planning profession both in terms of diversity and reaching the next generation of planners,\" said Joe Gillice of Dalton Education.\nThis will be the eighth conference that has been held since CFP Board moved from Denver to Washington, D.C. in 2007. The conference continues to evolve and expand into one of the premier events for financial planning education. Dalton will also be sponsoring the conference in 2019.\n\"We greatly appreciate Dalton Education's participation as a Signature Sponsor,\" said Mary Kay Svedberg, PhD, CFP Board's Director of Education. \"Their support is a reflection of their long-standing charge to provide high-quality education programs and desire to always raise the bar in financial planning education.\"\nABOUT CFP BOARD\nThe mission of Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. is to benefit the public by granting the CFP ® certification and upholding it as the recognized standard of excellence for competent and ethical personal financial planning.
