Positive business win trends across all customer segments have diversified our business, resulting in backlog growth of 17% year on year and reducing our top customer concentration to 13% in quarter 4 from 24% in the same quarter last year. Full year revenues grew 5.5% to $1.758 billion, and our proactive cost management has enabled us to expand our operating margin to 19.7%. As a result we have grown EPS 13% year on year to $5.39. We expect 2018 to be another robust year of revenue and earnings growth and in accordance with the new accounting standard we are updating our revenue guidance to a range of $2,520 - $2,640 million. Earnings per share guidance remains in the range of $5.89 - $6.09 representing an increase of 9.3% – 13.0%.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nThe positive business environment was reflected in the gross business wins in the fourth quarter of $718 million and cancellations in the quarter were $119 million, resulting in net business wins of $599 million and a net book to bill of 1.32.\nIn the fourth quarter net revenue grew 4.6% year on year to $455 million from $435 million in the same quarter last year. This represented 2.3% constant currency growth with revenue outside of our top customer growing 19.2% year over year. Concentration levels of ICON’s largest customer significantly reduced from 23.8% of revenue last year to 13.2% this quarter. This customer now represents 11% of ICON’s backlog down from 15% last year.\nAn efficient operational model drove income from operations in the quarter up by 6.0% to $89.7 million, or 19.7% of revenue, compared to $84.6 million or 19.5% for the same quarter last year.\nNet income in the quarter increased by 5.7% to $78.5 million on a non-GAAP basis compared with $74.3 million in the same quarter last year. This was helped by our industry leading underlying effective tax rate of 12% and global business support model that brought SG&A costs down to 18.0% of revenue.\nEarnings per share increased to $1.43 per share on a diluted non-GAAP basis, from $1.33 per share for the same quarter last year, an increase of 7.5% reflecting a strong quarter for ICON.\nWe continued our share repurchase program in the quarter buying $25 million worth of stock at an average price of $113.08 per share.\nThe Company recorded a non-recurring tax expense of $7.4 million during the quarter, principally as a result of the mandatory repatriation provisions contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the non-recurring tax expense the pro-forma tax rate was 10% for the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nFull year gross business wins were $2.6 billion and cancellations were $0.3 billion, resulting in net business wins of $2.3 billion and a net book to bill of 1.29. This led to strong backlog growth of 16.9% year on year.\nFull year revenue increased by 5.5% to $1,758 million from $1,666 million in 2016.\nIncome from operations for 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, increased by 8.2% to $346 million or 19.7% of revenue compared with $320 million or 19.2% of revenue in the previous year.\nNet income for 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, increased by 9.8% to $296 million compared with $269 million last year.\nEarnings per share for 2017, on a non-GAAP basis, increased to $5.39 per diluted share from $4.77 per diluted share last year, an increase of 13.0%.\nDay’s sales outstanding, comprising accounts receivable and unbilled revenue less payments on account, were 49 days at December 31, 2017, compared with 50 days at the end of September 2017 and 50 days at the end of December 2016.\nCash generated from operating activities for the quarter was $105.9 million. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21 million. As a result, at December 31, 2017, the company had net cash of $11.6 million, compared to net debt of $56 million at September 30, 2017 and net debt of $88 million at the end of December 2016.\nDuring the year we repurchased $133 million shares in total at an average price of $83.76.\nIn July, ICON acquired the Mapi Group, a leading health outcomes research and commercialisation company. Integration plans are underway and progressing well. This combined division has in excess of 1,400 heads, operating throughout ICON’s global network and enhances ICON’s key late stage service offerings. The additional scale and capabilities means that ICON is the world’s second largest provider of late phase services.\nAs of January 1, 2018 ICON has adopted the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606). As a result we are updating our full year 2018 revenue guidance to $2,520 -$2,640 million. Earnings per share guidance remains unchanged in the range of $5.89 - $6.09 representing an increase of 9.3% – 13.0%.\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating and net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. While non-GAAP financial measures are not superior to or a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, ICON believes certain non-GAAP information is useful to investors for historical comparison purposes.\nICON will hold its fourth quarter conference call today, February 15, 2018 at 09:00 EDT [14:00 Ireland & UK].
