    "text": "Claude Giroux and Nolan Patrick scored third-period goals as the Philadelphia Flyers rallied for a 2-1 victory over the visiting Columbus Blue Jackets on Thursday night at the Wells Fargo Center.\nShayne Gostisbehere had a pair of assists for the red-hot Flyers, who are 8-0-2 over their past 10 games. Giroux also assisted on Patrick’s tiebreaking goal.\nGoalie Petr Mrazek made his debut for the Flyers after being acquired in a trade Monday night from the Detroit Red Wings for two conditional draft picks. Alex Lyon, who picked up the win Tuesday against the Montreal Canadiens, is expected to be Mrazek’s backup while Michal Neuvirth and Brian Elliott are out injured.\nMrazek stopped 19 shots for his first win in a Philadelphia uniform.\nArtemi Panarin scored for the Blue Jackets, who couldn’t hold a one-goal lead. Sergei Bobrovsky, a former Flyers goaltender, made 18 saves in the losing effort for Columbus.\nNeither team had many scoring chances in the first period, leading to a scoreless tie.\nPanarin registered his 17th goal of the season at 12:51 of the second, giving the Blue Jackets a 1-0 lead. It was Panarin’s 200th career point in the NHL.\nColumbus dominated in the offensive zone in the second period, outshooting the Flyers 14-6.\nGiroux tied the game at 1 at 2:34 of the third with a blazing wrist shot from the top of the slot. Sean Couturier and Gostisbehere picked up the assists on Giroux’s 21st goal of the season.\nIt didn’t take long for the Flyers to take the lead. Giroux was wiped out by Brandon Dubinsky at 9:43, and Philadelphia went on the power play. Six seconds later, Patrick scored for the third consecutive game with Giroux and Gostisbehere getting the assists.\nThe Flyers’ defense stiffened in the third and didn’t allow the Blue Jackets much movement near Mrazek. Columbus only managed four shots in the third despite pulling Bobrovsky for the final minute.\nPhiladelphia’s Jakub Voracek had two chances to register an empty-net goal but couldn’t come up with a clean shot on goal.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
