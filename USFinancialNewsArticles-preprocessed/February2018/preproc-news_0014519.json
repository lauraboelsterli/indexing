    "text": "CNBC.com cdwheatley | Getty Images \nAccording to the International Longevity Centre â€” UK (ILC-UK), you should save at least 11 percent of your income in order to retire comfortably. However, research shows that most Americans fall short of this goal, with just $5,000 tucked away for retirement. \nEric Roberge, a CFP and founder of Beyond Your Hammock , tells CNBC Make It that the biggest mistake most people make when saving for retirement is not taking advantage of their employer's 401(k) match. \n\"If you have a 401(k) at work and you choose to open a Roth IRA, and your employer's willing to give you 100 percent of the first 5 percent that you put in your 401(k), you're missing out on free money,\" he says. \nTo help you find a company that'll set you on the road to a comfortable retirement, no matter your current salary, job search platform Glassdoor compiled a list of companies with strong 401(k) programs and substantial company matches.
