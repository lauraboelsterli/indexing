Photo: Ali Mohammadi/Bloomberg Volatility in Iran’s currency is disrupting trade and creating new challenges for an embattled president after antigovernment protests rocked the country.\nThe extreme swings in the Iranian rial have frustrated some investors and prompted a central-bank intervention to ward off turmoil, as economic concerns stir unrest and the nuclear pact that returned Iran to the global financial system is in jeopardy.\nThe rial hit a record low of more than 50,000 to the dollar at some exchanges in February before a government-orchestrated recovery brought it back to where it was trading before the protests , which began in late December and were focused on rising prices and a dearth of jobs.\nThe recent loss in confidence in the rial—and the flight to safer assets such as gold and the dollar—reflects the pressures that helped touch off the demonstrations.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani, in winning a second four-year term last year, promised to tackle deep economic problems by presenting a more open face to the world and rooting out corruption. Double-digit inflation and an unemployment rate of about 12% have given his hard-line opponents ammunition for political attacks.\nAt stake is whether Iran continues with policies preferred by Mr. Rouhani’s camp—including market liberalization, scaling back subsidies and an opening of Iran to trade and investment—or revert to his opponents’ ideals of economic self-reliance and suspicion of the West.\nThe central bank has moved to restore order. It said in early February it would issue foreign-currency sovereign bonds, aiming to sate appetite for stabler currency alternatives to the rial without weakening it.\nTo drive up demand for Iran’s currency, the bank temporarily raised bank deposit rates on the rial to 20% after they had been lowered to 15% in September. Authorities also arrested 90 unauthorized currency traders, accusing them of catering to speculators who undermined the rial.\nWith those moves, the currency has strengthened back to pre-protest levels after a fall of about 14%.\nIranian rial bank notes; the currency fell about 14% in recent weeks but has strengthened back to levels seen late last year. Photo: Ali Mohammadi/Bloomberg NEWS Volatility has long been a feature of Iran’s business environment, as it struggled under years of Western sanctions and dealt with sporadic upheaval from within. But the February dip was especially deep, bringing more political risk for Mr. Rouhani and his policies.\nA government crackdown suppressed large-scale demonstrations in January, but scattered labor strikes have continued. A movement has also gained steam in which women remove Islamic headscarves in public, highlighting differences between hard-liners and Mr. Rouhani, a relative moderate who has courted women’s support.\nThe potential collapse of the nuclear deal, which Mr. Rouhani championed, could heighten strains.\nPresident Donald Trump has indicated he could pull the U.S. out as early as May from the deal, an Obama-era pact between Iran and six world powers that gave Iran relief from international sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. The deal allowed Iran to reconnect to the global financial system, though with heavy limitations.\nShould the deal fall apart, “with continued strain on all sectors of the economy, Rouhani’s administration could continue to lose popular support, which could create an opening for hard-liners to intervene and assert control,” said Garbis Iradian, an economist at the Institute of International Finance.\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani, shown in Tehran on Feb. 6, has faced protests by Iranians frustrated about the economy. Photo: Ali Mohammadi/Bloomberg News Iran says Mr. Trump’s threat of a pullout is already weighing on the economy. “The U.S. has created an atmosphere of uncertainty which is a poison for the business community to work in Iran,” Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign-affairs minister, said recently.\nFor investors who have stayed in Iran, the rial’s plunge—the latest blip in a yearslong slide—is hard to swallow.\nMazdak Rafaty, a Dubai-based developer and consultant who built apartment buildings near Tehran backed by foreign investment, said the currency’s slide forced him to put sales on hold. His investors want returns in dollars and euros, he said, but a weaker rial means real-estate prices have to rise sharply to deliver them.\n“If you have investments in Iran and you’re bound to pay back your investors in foreign currencies, you’re deeply troubled,” he said.\nThere are upsides, for some. A weaker currency can be beneficial for Iranian exporters and for investors whose dollars or euros can buy more rial-based assets.\nRelated Articles\nThe Spark Behind Iran’s Unrest: Millions of Defrauded Investors (Jan. 11, 2018) Behind Iran’s Protests: A Struggling Economy Despite Sanctions Relief (Jan. 4, 2018) ‘I Have No Fear’: Iranian Women Cast Off Islamic Head Scarves in Protest (Feb. 7, 2018) But the swings breed uncertainty. “For the few firms investing in Iran now, any boon to investment caused by the devaluation is outweighed by the overall issue of volatility,” said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, the founder of Bourse & Bazaar, a business-analysis website focused on Iran.\nSome investors have faced problems in simply moving money out of the country. “Suddenly, repatriation has become a nightmare,” said Mostafa Pakzad, a Tehran-based consultant who specializes in financial transactions with the West.\nDeclines in the rial can also hurt the oil sector, the country’s most strategic industry. During the recent currency dip, the cost of importing foreign equipment was 8% higher than it was six months earlier, said Reza Padidar, chairman of the Energy Commission of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce.\nA French exporter of spare parts to the petrochemical and automotive industries said Iranian buyers had paused orders on €100,000 ($122,000) in goods since November.\n“Everything is on standby,” said the executive.\n—Aresu Eqbali in Tehran contributed to this article.\nWrite to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com",
