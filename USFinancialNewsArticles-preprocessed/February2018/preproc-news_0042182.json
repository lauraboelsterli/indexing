    "text": "MONOVISC Global Revenue Increased 21% Year-over-Year for Fourth Quarter of 2017;\nTotal Revenue Increased 10% for Full Year of 2017\nBEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Anika Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANIK), a global, integrated orthopedic medicines company specializing in therapeutics based on its proprietary hyaluronic acid (“HA”) technology , today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, along with business progress in the periods.\n“2017 was a year of significant achievement for Anika, highlighted by double-digit revenue growth, expansion of MONOVISC® and CINGAL® into new international markets, completion of the CINGAL Phase III trial enrollment ahead of schedule, and the strengthening of our executive team,” said Charles H. Sherwood, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer. “As we look to 2018, we are poised to complete the CINGAL Phase III trial and submit a New Drug Application to the FDA. Our strategic objectives are focused on global commercial expansion, pipeline advancement, and the development of a direct commercialization capability in the U.S. to accelerate our revenue and earnings growth in the years ahead and to create sustained value for our shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $29.4 million, compared to $28.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Total revenue for the full year of 2017 grew 10% to $113.4 million, compared to $103.4 million for the full year of 2016. Total revenue for the full year of 2017 included $5.0 million in milestone revenue earned in the second quarter as a result of MONOVISC achieving $100 million in U.S. end-user sales within a consecutive 12-month period ending in June 2017. Product revenue increased 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2017. MONOVISC revenue grew 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was partially offset by the decline in ORTHOVISC® revenue in the same period, following the industry shift from multiple to single injection therapies. For the full year of 2017, product revenue increased 5% and MONOVISC global revenue grew 29%, which was the primary overall revenue growth driver. International Orthobiologics revenue increased 22% for the full year of 2017, due primarily to the global expansion of MONOVISC, as well as the growth of CINGAL in international markets. Domestically, ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC continued to maintain a combined market-leading position. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $19.7 million, compared to $16.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in total operating expenses was due primarily to higher research and development investments required to advance the Company’s growing pipeline towards regulatory approvals and to expand the commercial team in anticipation of those product launches. Total operating expenses for the full year of 2017 were $67.7 million, compared to $52.8 million for the full year of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.1 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $8.1 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a one-time tax benefit of $2.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, resulting from the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. Net income for the full year of 2017 was $31.8 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, compared to $32.5 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, for the full year of 2016.\nRecent Business Highlights\nThe Company made key commercial, operational, pipeline, and financial advancements, including:\nExpanding CINGAL and MONOVISC international presence, with MONOVISC product approvals and related commercial launches in India, Australia, and Taiwan. Advancing its product pipeline with completion of patient enrollment in the CINGAL Phase III clinical study, and continued progress on enrolling patients in the FastTRACK Phase III HYALOFAST® Study for cartilage repair. Expanding Anika’s regenerative medicine portfolio with 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its injectable HA-based bone repair treatment. Expanding its strategic collaboration with the Institute for Applied Life Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to continue the development of an innovative therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and with the Institute of Integrative Biology at the University of Liverpool to collaborate on research to develop an injectable mesenchymal stem cell therapy for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Completed all planned activities related to the consolidation of the Company’s global manufacturing operations at Anika’s Bedford, Massachusetts corporate headquarters.\nFull Year 2018 Corporate Outlook\nLooking forward to 2018, the Company expects total revenue growth to be around the mid-single digit percentage range for the full year of 2018. Licensing, milestone and contract revenue is expected to be $5 million for the year. The Company also anticipates continued headway on several key initiatives including:\nCompletion of the Phase III clinical trial of CINGAL, and the submission of a New Drug Application to the FDA for CINGAL; International expansion of MONOVISC and CINGAL; Continued progress toward the development of a direct commercialization capability in the U.S.; and Expanding Anika’s regenerative medicine pipeline with a new product candidate for rotator cuff repair.\nConference Call Information\nAnika’s management will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss its financial results and business highlights tomorrow, Thursday, February 22 at 9:00 am ET.
