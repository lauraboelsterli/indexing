    "text": "Major Player in Custom Hotel and Hospitality Lighting Expands Presence in Architectural Market by Obtaining Assets and Senior Staff of Manufacturer Noted for Success in Commercial and National Accounts\nTAUNTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Royal Contract Lighting, known for its large-scale decorative fixtures for casinos, hotels, and restaurants, today announced that it has acquired the assets of Vision Quest Lighting, a custom lighting manufacturer known for its national accounts and commercial lighting products. Royal Contract Lighting will gain Vision Quest Lighting’s expertise and customer base in the specification and commercial lighting markets, and will deepen its own management team through the addition of the firm’s executives.\n“Acquiring Vision Quest Lighting’s assets and senior staff is representative of our overall strategy of portfolio growth through acquisition,” said Paul Spacek, president of Royal Contract Lighting. “It will expand the depth of our client base in a new category, while adding significantly to our product volume and bringing 20-plus years’ experience in design, engineering, and national-account sales into our team.”\n“Vision Quest Lighting has taken pride in working with our customers to achieve high-quality fixtures that were right for the project,” said Larry Lieberman, president of Vision Quest Lighting. “By joining forces with Royal Contract Lighting, we’ll be able to serve our customers even better, providing greater production throughput and offering services such as presale drawings, faster finishes samples, and more expedient Quote: s.”\nVision Quest Lighting’s assets will be absorbed into Royal Contract Lighting. Terms of the deal, which was concluded last month, were not disclosed.\nMove Increases Volume, Expand Markets\nVision Quest Lighting, based in Ronkonkoma, New York, began in 1996 as an engineering company specializing in theatrical lighting and subsequently expanded its services into architectural lighting, eventually becoming one of the United States’ largest manufacturers of custom specification lighting. Customers include major retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Limited Brands, H&M, and global real-estate holdings operator Simon Malls.\nRoyal Contract Lighting company will leverage Vision Quest Lighting’s experience in providing lighting solutions to clients in commercial, industrial, and retail environments to extend its national and international representative network, creating a new architectural division.\nLarry Lieberman will serve as vice president of sales for architectural and national accounts. Torrey Bievenour, who served as vice president of engineering with Vision Quest Lighting for 20 years, has been named director of engineering. “Between the two of them, we have gained 40 years of experience,” said Spacek, “and a new knowledge base for approaching specification projects.”\nEditors, Please Note: Head shots of executives may be found at http://bit.ly/2BE0tPi .\nAbout Royal Contract Lighting\nRoyal Contract Lighting offers sophisticated custom lighting solutions for the hospitality industry, national hotel account brands, corporate offices, high-end residential projects, and public facilities worldwide.
