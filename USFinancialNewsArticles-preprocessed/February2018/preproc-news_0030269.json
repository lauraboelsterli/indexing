    "text": "3 COMMENTS A federal judge has rejected a $550 million loan to keep Puerto Rico’s troubled electric utility in operation, threatening the island with more power outages at a time when it is trying to recover from last summer’s devastating hurricanes. \nJudge Laura Taylor Swain said Thursday at a hearing in U.S. District Court in New York that the cash-strapped power utility hadn’t looked hard enough for alternative funding before seeking court approval of a loan from the island’s central government.\nThe utility, known as Prepa, should have shown “far more robust” efforts to secure financing from a third party rather than going to the government for a loan, she said.\nPrepa, which was seeking approval to tap $550 million of a proposed $1 billion financing package, hadn’t shown that the size of the proposed loan was sufficiently tailored to the utility’s needs, the judge said, adding she would consider an unsecured $300 million deal instead.\nPrepa is in desperate need of funding to maintain restoration work on the island’s power grid and to prevent additional blackouts .\nTodd Filsinger, Prepa’s chief financial adviser, told the court Thursday that the government-run utility must have additional financing in place by next Thursday or parts of the Island would begin to go dark within a matter of days.\nA group of Prepa bondholders, who oppose the government-backed loan, have offered their own $534 million financing package which it claims wouldn’t disadvantage other lenders.\n“We don’t want to see the lights go out in Puerto Rico anymore than anyone else,” Thomas Mayer, a lawyer representing the bondholder group told the judge Thursday. “We just don’t want to see our collateral taken from us.”\nAmbulances are seen at the entrance of an electric substation after an explosion and fire was reported and caused a black out in parts of San Juan, Puerto Rico earlier this week.

Offline customers aren’t paying electric bills, eating into Prepa’s revenues while construction bills pile up.\nThe federal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances placed the central government under what amounts to bankruptcy in May and two months later voted to move Prepa under court protection as well. Governor Ricardo Rosselló said recently he wants Prepa privatized to cut costs while attracting private partners to invest in upgrading its assets.\nPrepa’s problems have been decades in the making. It earned praise for powering Puerto Rico’s industrialization efforts in the 1940s and 1950s. But the utility became more inefficient over time as generating plants, which largely rely on fossil fuels, required major upgrades that were never made or left uncompleted. Corruption scandals around fuel purchases tarnished Prepa’s reputation and sparked lawsuits and investigations.\nFederal authorities and congressional committees are investigating Prepa over its actions following Hurricane Maria. Prepa touched off a scandal by awarding a Montana startup firm a $300 million deal to rebuild the power grid without a competitive bidding process.\n—Andrew Scurria contributed to this article\nWrite to Tom Corrigan at tom.corrigan@wsj.com",
