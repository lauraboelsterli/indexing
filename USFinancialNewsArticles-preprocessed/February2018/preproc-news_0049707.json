    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cubic Corporation (NYSE:CUB) today announced its board of directors has elected president and chief executive officer, Bradley H. Feldmann as chairman of the board. Feldmann succeeds Walter C. Zable, who has served on the board of directors since 1976 and held the position of chairman for the past five years.\n\"Brad has clearly demonstrated the leadership and vision necessary to drive and achieve Cubic's growth strategy,\" said Edwin A. Guiles, lead independent director. \"We look forward to his continued ability in delivering superior value to our shareholders in his new role on the Board.\"\nSince being appointed president and CEO, Feldmann has spearheaded the company's strategic growth plan targeted at Winning the Customer, building the defense and transportation businesses and growing its offerings in the emerging Command, Control, Communications, Computers Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance market at the edge of the battlefield.\nUnder his leadership, Cubic ended fiscal year 2017 with record sales and the highest backlog in company history. This success was attributed by major contract wins in New York and Boston to deliver next-generation fare payment systems; continued support of U.S. Army's Joint Readiness Training Center in Fort Polk, Louisiana; and the full-rate production of the GATR satellite antenna system under the Transportable Tactical Command Communication (T2C2) award from the U.S. Army. Additionally, with Feldmann's guidance, Cubic took important steps to implement the rollout of a Global Enterprise Management initiative to transform the company's global IT infrastructure into a scalable and effective system.\nFeldmann became president and chief executive officer of Cubic Corporation in July 2014 and was appointed to the board of directors in May 2014. Previously, he served as Cubic's president and chief operating officer and was also the president of Cubic's Defense Systems segment for five years. Feldmann becomes Cubic's third chairman in the company's 67-year history.\nAbout Cubic Corporation\nCubic is a market-leading, technology provider of integrated solutions that increase situational understanding for transportation, defense C4ISR and training customers worldwide to decrease urban congestion and improve the militaries' effectiveness and operational readiness.
