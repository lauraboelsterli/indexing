    "text": "(Reuters) - Chipmakers Broadcom Ltd and Qualcomm Inc continued their war of words on Monday, as Singapore-based Broadcom called its U.S. semiconductor peer’s proposal to negotiate a higher offer price “engagement theater”.\nThe back-and-forth statements set the tone for a meeting on March 6 where Qualcomm shareholders will decide whether to re-elect the current board or Broadcom’s slate of six nominees.\nQualcomm shares have risen 7.1 percent, while Broadcom shares have fallen nearly 9 percent, since the latter’s first bid on Nov. 6, 2017.\nNXP Semiconductors NV, caught in the melee, has seen its shares rise 6.6 percent since Nov. 6, and over 25 percent since Oct. 2016 when it struck its own original deal to sell itself to Qualcomm.\nHere are important events that have taken place since Broadcom made its first bid to buy Qualcomm:\nFeb. 26, 2018\nQualcomm appears to warm to Broadcom’s advances by saying the sides have grown closer on regulatory issues and calling for talks on price after Broadcom’s latest $117 billion offer. Broadcom, however, labels Qualcomm’s proposals “engagement theater”.\nFeb. 21, 2018\nBroadcom cut its bid for Qualcomm by $3 to $79 per share after Qualcomm raises its offer for NXP Semiconductors.\nFeb. 20, 2018\nQualcomm deals a blow to Broadcom’s raised bid by increasing its offer for NXP Semiconductors to $127.50 per share in cash from $110 per share.\nFeb. 14, 2018\nRepresentatives of Broadcom and Qualcomm meet for the first time to discuss a potential combination; Qualcomm later calls the meeting “constructive”.\nFeb. 13, 2018\nFILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Broadcom scales back its challenge to Qualcomm’s board by cutting the number of board seats it was trying to win to six from 11, following a meeting with proxy advisory firm ISS.\nFeb. 8, 2018\nQualcomm rejects Broadcom’s revised buyout offer of $121 bln, but proposes meeting to address the bid’s “serious deficiencies in value and certainty”.\nFeb. 5, 2018\nBroadcom raises its offer for Qualcomm to $82 per share from $70 per share, calling the bid its “best and final offer”.\nThe revised offer is contingent on either Qualcomm acquiring NXP Semiconductors for $38 billion or the NXP deal being terminated.\nJan. 17, 2018\nThe Federal Trade Commission investigates whether Broadcom engaged in anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with customers, casting further doubts on regulatory approval for potential deals.\nDec. 22, 2017\nQualcomm rejects Broadcom and private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners’ 11 director nominees, setting the stage for a proxy battle.\nDec. 4 , 2017\nBroadcom makes its first formal move toward a hostile bid to take over Qualcomm by nominating 11 directors to its rival’s board.\nNov. 13, 2017\nQualcomm rejects Broadcom’s $103 billion takeover bid, saying the offer undervalued the company and would face regulatory hurdles.\nNov. 6, 2017\nBroadcom makes unsolicited $103 billion, or $70 per share, bid to acquire Qualcomm.\nCompiled by Shravanth Vijayakumar and Shashwat Awasthi in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ",
