I am happy to play a role in helping to bring this important new technology to patients within and beyond Canadian borders.\"\nMr. Charest joins the board with two new board members: Vicente Fox, Former President of Mexico (2000 – 2006), and Mr. Joseph Sowell III, Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer of Nashville, TN-based HCA Healthcare.\nAbout Ondine Biomedical Inc.\nOndine Biomedical Inc. is dedicated to the development of non-antibiotic anti-infective therapies for a broad spectrum of bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Ondine's platform technology is called Photodisinfection, a patented light activated technology that provides rapid antimicrobial efficacy without encouraging antibiotic resistance. Ondine's lead product is the MRSAid™ nasal decolonization system which is used to safely decolonize the nose of a broad spectrum of pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and fungi.
