    "text": "-Further Executes Long-Term Strategy to Own Developed Assets at Compelling Yields-\nMEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Jernigan Capital, Inc. (NYSE: JCAP) (the “Company”) announced today that it has acquired the membership interests of its developer partners in three self-storage facilities located in Fleming Island (Jacksonville MSA) Florida, Alpharetta (Atlanta MSA) Georgia and Marietta (Atlanta MSA) Georgia, respectively. All acquisitions were privately negotiated with the development partner without any marketing of the project. Following these acquisitions, the Company now has 100% ownership of four of its initial ten on-balance sheet development investments made during the first six months of the Company’s existence, demonstrating its ability to execute on its strategy of becoming a long-term owner of the self-storage development projects that it has financed during this development cycle.\nThe aggregate purchase price for the developer interests in the three properties was $8.1 million, which was funded out of existing balance sheet cash. The Company’s development loans on the three properties were converted to equity. Based on aggregate estimated stabilized NOI and the Company’s aggregate $28.9 million cash investment in the three properties, the Company estimates its weighted average cap rate on the three properties is 8.04%.\nEach of the facilities is a Generation V climate-controlled facility ideally located in an underserved, rapidly growing submarket. Each property has exceeded its initial underwritten physical lease up plan, which generally is 40%, 70% and 85% physical occupancy at 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively, following the date the facility is open for business. As of the date of acquisition, the approximate physical occupancy of the three properties (number of months facility has been open in parentheses) was:\nFleming Island (16 months) 80.0% Alpharetta (20 months) 66.4% Marietta (20 months)\n69.2% The Alpharetta and Marietta properties are branded and managed by CubeSmart. The Fleming Island property has been managed by Life Storage, but CubeSmart will brand and assume management of that facility on March 1, 2018.\n“We are delighted to have been able to acquire prior to the beginning of the spring leasing season these three fine properties, each of which has already significantly leased up in less than two years,” said John Good, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. “Each of these properties is an excellent long-term investment in a great self-storage submarket. We believe these acquisitions, along with our Ocoee acquisition last year, have charted a pathway to our building the newest, most attractive, best located and best managed self-storage portfolio in the sector, which we believe will provide solid long-term returns to our shareholders.”\nAbout Jernigan Capital, Inc.\nJernigan Capital, Inc. is a New York Stock Exchange-listed real estate investment trust (NYSE: JCAP) that provides debt and equity capital to private developers, owners, and operators of self-storage facilities.
