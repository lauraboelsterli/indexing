    "text": "BEDFORD, Mass., Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- iRobot Corp. (NASDAQ: IRBT), a leader in consumer robots, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2017.\n\"In our first full year as a solely consumer-focused business, we delivered fantastic quarterly and full-year revenue growth of 54% and 34% respectively, over Q4 and full-year 2016. Record Q4 revenue was driven by very strong sales in the United States, and in EMEA, as the overall category continued to grow at an accelerating rate. We achieved record growth while maintaining unambiguous global product and brand leadership in the robotic vacuum cleaner (RVC) category.\n\"In 2018, we expect to cross the billion-dollar revenue threshold and deliver $1.05 to $1.08 billion in revenue, which is year-over-year growth of 19% to 22%, operating income of $86 to $96 million and EPS of $2.10 to $2.35.\n\"The opportunity ahead of us is tremendous. Global household penetration of robotic vacuum cleaners remains extremely low, in the single digits. Strong economic conditions worldwide are fueling overall global growth and positive consumer sentiment. We have demonstrated that in regions where we have run marketing programs to educate prospective customers about Roomba, we have increased our market share, and our recent distributor acquisitions enable us to extend our strategic marketing programs to Japan and Europe.\n\"Further, the global RVC category grew more than 25% in 2017, and we expect category growth to continue as we and competitors invest to drive awareness. And, we have seen retailers in the United States increasingly embracing and promoting the category through national advertising programs featuring RVCs, as well as allocating increased shelf space and investing in high-visibility displays.\n\"These are the growth drivers we see for Roomba, but we believe there is also a great opportunity to drive adoption of our Braava products through campaigns targeted at our millions of Roomba customers.\n\"There is a lot to be excited about. 2017 was a critical year for iRobot as the first full year focused solely on developing and delivering products for the home. We delivered outstanding financial results for the year while successfully executing the acquisition of two major distributors in key markets and extending our control over 75% of our global revenue.\n\"In 2018, we plan to capitalize on the incremental investments we made in 2017 with the introduction of new products in the second half of the year. We expect double-digit revenue growth in all regions as we continue to evolve and extend our proven sales and marketing initiatives in overseas markets. In the U.S., we expect continued strong sales following our 40+% growth in 2017,\" said Colin Angle, chairman and chief executive officer of iRobot.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $326.9 million, compared with $212.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for the full year 2017 was $883.9 million, compared with $660.6 million for the full year 2016. Full-year 2017 and 2016 revenue included $0.3 million and $4.8 million respectively, of D&S and other revenue. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $23.1 million, compared with $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income for the full year 2017 was $72.7 million, compared with $57.6 million for the full year 2016. Quarterly earnings per share were $0.16 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share included a negative ($0.41) impact from the new tax reform law for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and a provisional repatriation toll charge, as well as a discrete tax benefit of $0.03 relating to the new 2017 stock compensation accounting standard. Full-year 2017 EPS was $1.77, compared with $1.48 for full-year 2016. Full-year 2017 earnings per share included a negative ($0.41) impact from the new tax reform law for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and a provisional repatriation toll charge, as well as a discrete tax benefit of $0.41 relating to the new 2017 stock compensation accounting standard. Fourth-quarter 2016 earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit associated with a change in accounting treatment of an equity investment and a $0.01 contribution from transition services provided to our former D&S business. Full-year 2016 earnings per share included a negative ($0.10) impact from the divestiture of the D&S business and a $0.03 contribution from the sale of an investment.\nBusiness Highlights\nIn the fourth quarter, the positive impact of our targeted marketing programs in the U.S., EMEA and Japan drove year-over-year Q4 revenue growth of 54%. Fourth-quarter consumer revenue grew 47% in the United States, 34% in Japan and more than doubled in EMEA, in each case over Q4 2016. In Q4, we launched our first ever Braava national television program in the U.S., which drove Braava family revenue growth of 65% in the U.S. over full-year 2016. We announced an agreement with Black & Decker in which Black & Decker agreed to discontinue sales of all home robotic vacuums for a certain period of time after selling through its existing inventory. This represents another win in an ongoing effort by iRobot to defend and protect its valuable intellectual property.\nFinancial Expectations\nManagement provides the following expectations with respect to the fiscal year ending December 29, 2018.\n(Dollars in millions except Earnings Per Share)\nFiscal Year 2018\nRevenue $1,050 - $1,080\nOperating Income $86 - $96\nTax Rate (before discrete items) 25 - 27%\nEarnings Per Share $2.10 - $2.35\nThree-Year Financial Targets 2018 - 2020\nRevenue Growth Approximately 20%\nGross Margin 50 – 51%\nOperating Margin Increasing to 10%\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year Conference Call\niRobot will host a conference call tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss its financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and full-year 2017, the outlook for full-year 2018 financial performance, and the company's three-year financial targets for 2018 through 2020.\nPertinent details include:\nDate: Thursday, February 8\nTime: 8:30 a.m. ET\nCall-In Number: 213-358-0894\nPasscode: 4995868\nA live, audio broadcast of the conference call also will be available at http://investor.irobot.com/events/event-details/q4-2017-irobot-corp-earnings-conference-call .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating its business, iRobot considers and uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its operating performance. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, net merger, acquisition and divestiture expense, gain on business acquisition, net intellectual property litigation expense, and restructuring expense. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance.\nThe term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Among other things, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's actual cash expenditures. Other companies may calculate similar measures differently than iRobot, limiting their usefulness as comparative tools. iRobot compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/irobot-reports-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-revenue-300595292.html\nSOURCE iRobot Corp.",
