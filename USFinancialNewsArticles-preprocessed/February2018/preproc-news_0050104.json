    "text": "Check out the companies making headlines after the bell : \nRoku stock plunged more than 20 percent after the bell. The digital streaming device maker beat Wall Street expectations for fourth quarter revenue, but issued weak revenue guidance for the coming quarter. \nRoku said sales in the first quarter will be $120 million to $130 million, falling short of the $131.7 million average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.\nLast time Roku reported earnings, shares jumped 57 percent.\nShares of Pandora Media jumped more than 10 percent in the extended session. While the music streaming company reported mixed fourth quarter financial results, it said it saw significant bumps in both subscription revenue and new subscribers. \nPandora reported $97.7 million in subscription revenue, up 63 percent year over year, and tallied 5.48 million subscribers, up 25 percent since the year-ago quarter.\nCheesecake Factory shares fell 3 percent in extended trading. The restaurant company and dessert distributor reported fourth quarter earnings and revenue in line with analyst expectations but missed on other important metrics. Same store sales, an important way to judge customer loyalty, fell by 0.9 percent year-over-year.\nShares of Jack in the Box gained 1.6 percent in extended trading. The fast food company reported first quarter financial results that beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines. \nJack in the Box reported earnings per share of $1.23 on revenue of $294.4 million, versus the $1.06 EPS on $283.3 million expected.",
