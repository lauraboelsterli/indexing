MidOcean has been a strong partner for us since their initial investment in 2011, and we look forward to their continued support going forward,” continued Bell. “I am so proud of our employees who provide service to our members day in and day out,” Bell added.\n“We are incredibly proud of our partnership with LegalShield and the Company’s success. The management team has done an excellent job of growing its membership base, introducing new products and features, and expanding the Company’s distribution channels. We are excited to partner with Stone Point and believe their experience in the financial services sector, generally, and the voluntary benefits sector, specifically, will greatly enhance the growth opportunities for the Company,” said Frank Schiff, Managing Director at MidOcean.\nFayez Muhtadie, Principal at Stone Point, added: “We are thrilled to be partnering with the LegalShield team and MidOcean. We have a long history of experience in the employee benefits sector and see significant opportunities for the Company to expand its presence across channels and geographies. We look forward to working with Jeff and his talented management team to support the Company in its continued growth.”\nKramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP served as legal advisor to Stone Point.
