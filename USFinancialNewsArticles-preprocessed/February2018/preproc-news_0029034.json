    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” \"Black Panther\" is well on its way to a record-making weekend at the North American box office.\nThe Walt Disney Co. estimates Friday that the superhero movie earned $25.2 million from its Thursday preview screenings. It's the second biggest for a Marvel Studios film behind \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" which earned $27.6 million in previews, and the best for the month of February.\nPreview screenings typically begin with 7pm Thursday showings.\n\"Black Panther\" is now pacing to earn somewhere between $172 and $198 million across the four-day holiday weekend. It will far surpass the previous February record held by \"Deadpool\" which took in $152.2 million in 2016.\nInternationally, the film has grossed $47 million in its first three days with strong showings in the U.K. and Korea.",
