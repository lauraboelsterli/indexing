This new demand in the first fiscal quarter was also due in part to a short term increase in market share as three of our competitors' operations in Nevada were temporarily suspended. The dramatic increase in sales, combined with an improvement in our gross margin, drove increased net cash flows and a turn to positive EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong, with no debt and we expect things to continue to improve in a more stable fashion as the industry matures. We are still extremely bullish on our growth potential, despite becoming the fourth lab in the state to be sanctioned. Our positive cash flows from operating activities and solid balance sheet helped us utilize the eight days in January in which our license was suspended to augment our quality management staffing and formalize ISO 17025 lab practices, which will help us better manage our continued growth.\"\nThe table below shows the interim results and key metrics:\nKey Performance Metrics\nQuarterly Data\nQ1\nQ1\n2018\n2017\nRevenues (Thousands)\n$ 1,119\n$ 410\nLab Revenue Growth (%YOY)\n173.0%\n301.2%\nGross Profit Margins (%)\n66.3%\n50.2%\nQuick Ratio (%)\n461.3%\n142.8%\nAdjusted EBITDA Return on Assets (%)\n18.6%\n-6.1%\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before (i) other income (expense), (ii) interest income, (iii) interest expense, (iv) bad debts, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) impairment of development costs, (vii) non-cash expenses relating to share based payments recognized under ASC Topic 718, (viii) gain on early extinguishment of debt, and (ix) equity in losses of unconsolidated entity. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors regarding our current financial performance; however, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measurements. Specifically, we believe Adjusted EBITDA results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain income and expenses that our management believes are not indicative of our core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.
