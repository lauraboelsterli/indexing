When combined with approximately $102 million of authority remaining under the existing program, this represents a total of $400 million of current share repurchase authority effective today.\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors has approved an increase in its quarterly cash dividend to seventeen cents per share of common stock. This quarterly cash dividend declared today represents a 13.3% increase from the previously declared quarterly dividend of fifteen cents per share of common stock per quarter. The quarterly cash dividend announced today is payable on March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2018. While the Company intends to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of the Company's financial performance.\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements\nThe statements in this press release that are not historical facts are .
