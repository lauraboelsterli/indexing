    "text": "FOSTER CITY, Calif., Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Qualys, Inc . (NASDAQ: QLYS), a pioneer and leading provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions, has appointed Bill Solms, a veteran of both commercial and government sector cloud technology sales, as Vice President and General Manager, Federal Division, to help drive government IT initiatives for Qualys, including strategy, solutions development, marketing and sales.\n\"As the public sector increasingly adopts cloud technologies and federal agencies continue embarking on their digital transformation efforts, security must be delivered at a scale that current enterprise point solutions fail to address, and are too expensive to deploy and manage,\" said Bill Solms, Vice President and General Manager, Federal Division, Qualys. \"The FedRAMP-certified Qualys Cloud Platform helps agencies gain the necessary visibility and immediacy to maintain complete control of their complex networks, and secure their digital transformations. I am very excited to join Qualys to help lead its efforts and expansion in the federal space.\"\n\"We are now extremely well positioned to address the needs of the federal market. This is simply because with our FedRAMP-certified Cloud Platform and integrated suite of security and compliance solutions, we can provide government agencies with a comprehensive cloud-based approach to secure global IT assets and build security into their digital transformation,\" said Philippe Courtot, chairman and CEO, Qualys, Inc. \"We welcome Bill, who has developed a unique expertise in the federal sector, to our federal division to help agencies streamline their security and compliance initiatives as they transition to the cloud.\"\nIn a career that spans more than 30 years, Bill has combined distinguished military service and government-focused security roles in the private sector. He has run publicly traded companies, overseen acquisitions, and directed operations in the government sector. Prior to Qualys, he was president, CEO and co-founder of WildRock Security Group and before that was CEO of Wave Systems Corp., a publicly traded cybersecurity company. Prior to Wave Systems, he served as the Director of the US Federal Sales team for Oracle On Demand. Solms also served as a sales executive at Microsoft, focused on customers in the top level of the Defense Department.\nHis distinguished military career began as a paratrooper and Apache helicopter pilot and culminated as a strategic planner for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Highlights include both command and key staff positions in multiple military organizations. He is a combat veteran and a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.\nThe Qualys Cloud Platform\nThe Qualys Cloud Platform is the revolutionary unified architecture that powers more than 10 Qualys security and compliance Cloud Apps, and offers customers a streamlined solution for avoiding the cost and complexities of managing multiple security vendors.
