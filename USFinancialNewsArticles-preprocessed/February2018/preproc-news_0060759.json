(Nasdaq: NOVT) (the \"Company\"), a trusted technology partner to medical and advanced technology equipment manufacturers, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nGAAP\nRevenue\n$\n146.9\n$\n98.9\n$\n521.3\n$\n384.8\nOperating Income from Continuing Operations\n$\n19.1\n$\n11.3\n$\n57.2\n$\n32.6\nNet Income Attributable to Novanta Inc.\n$\n8.9\n$\n7.8\n$\n60.1\n$\n22.0\nDiluted EPS from Continuing Operations\n$\n(0.00)\n$\n0.22\n$\n1.13\n$\n0.63\nNon-GAAP*\nAdjusted Operating Income from Continuing Operations\n$\n25.8\n$\n16.6\n$\n90.4\n$\n55.8\nAdjusted Diluted EPS\n$\n0.44\n$\n0.35\n$\n1.60\n$\n1.09\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n30.0\n$\n19.4\n$\n105.7\n$\n68.0\n*Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, as well as definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the reasons for their use, are presented below.\n\"2017 was a defining year for Novanta with strong execution and financial results,\" said Matthijs Glastra, Chief Executive Officer of Novanta Inc. \"We executed well on our strategic priorities and 2020 Strategic Direction. We accelerated organic revenue growth to 8% versus 2016 and made three acquisitions, namely, World of Medicine, Laser Quantum, and ThingMagic. These acquisitions have expanded our positions in growing medical markets and technologies, and are performing ahead of our expectations. Our performance in 2017 gives us confidence to reach our 2020 strategic goals. I am proud of our team of dedicated employees and the culture we have created, and I continue to feel excited about our future.\"\nFourth Quarter\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Novanta generated GAAP revenue of $146.9 million, an increase of $48.0 million, or 48.6%, versus the fourth quarter of 2016. The net effect of the Company's acquisition activities resulted in an increase in revenue of $39.1 million, or 39.5%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted our revenue by $0.8 million, or 0.8%, during the fourth quarter of 2017. Our Organic Revenue Growth, which excludes the net impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rates, increased 8.3%, versus the fourth quarter of 2016 (see \"Organic Revenue Growth\" in the non-GAAP reconciliation below).\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $19.1 million, compared to $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net income attributable to Novanta Inc. was $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $7.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share (\"EPS\") from continuing operations was $(0.00) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.22 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company increased the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Laser Quantum by $8.9 million to reflect the estimated redemption value as of December 31, 2017. This nontaxable adjustment was recognized in retained earnings instead of net income, but resulted in a net ($0.25) reduction in EPS under U.S. GAAP accounting rules. In addition, the Company's GAAP net income and EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 were negatively impacted by a $2.8 million tax provision recorded to reflect the estimated income tax effect as a result of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, primarily from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate that became effective as of January 1, 2018. Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.35 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with 34.8 million weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA was $30.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $19.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $22.1 million, compared to $13.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year\nFor the full year 2017, Novanta generated GAAP revenue of $521.3 million, an increase of $136.5 million, or 35.5%, versus the full year 2016. The net effect of the Company's acquisitions in 2017 resulted in an increase in revenue of $105.8 million, or 27.5%. Foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted our revenue by $1.9 million, or 0.5%, in 2017. Our Organic Revenue Growth, which excludes the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rates, increased 8.5%, versus full year 2016 (see \"Organic Revenue Growth\" in the non-GAAP reconciliation below).\nFor the full year 2017, GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $57.2 million, compared to $32.6 million in 2016. GAAP net income attributable to Novanta Inc. was $60.1 million for the full year 2017, compared to $22.0 million in 2016. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.13 for the full year 2017, compared to $0.63 in 2016.\nFor the full year 2017, the Company increased the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Laser Quantum by $20.2 million to reflect the estimated redemption value as of December 31, 2017. This nontaxable adjustment was recognized in retained earnings instead of net income attributable to Novanta Inc., but resulted in a net ($0.57) reduction in EPS under U.S. GAAP accounting rules. Adjusted Diluted EPS was $1.60 for the full year 2017, compared to $1.09 in 2016. The Company ended the full year 2017 with 35.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA was $105.7 million for the full year 2017, compared to $68.0 million in 2016.\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations for the full year 2017 was $63.4 million, compared to $47.8 million in 2016. The Company finished 2017 with approximately $237.8 million of Gross Debt, and $137.7 million of Net Debt, as defined in the non-GAAP reconciliation below.\nFinancial Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $585 million to $600 million. The Company expects Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.96, including the impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax law changes, and Adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $117 million to $122 million. The Company's Adjusted Diluted EPS and EBITDA guidance assumes no significant foreign exchange gains or losses.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $138 million to $142 million. This represents reported growth in the range of 27% to 30%, and organic growth in the range of 7.5% to 8.5% year over year. The Company expects Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.43, including the impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax law changes, and Adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $25 million to $27 million. The Company's Adjusted Diluted EPS and EBITDA guidance assumes no significant foreign exchange gains or losses.\nNovanta provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide earnings guidance on a GAAP basis, with the exception of GAAP revenue guidance. A reconciliation of the Company's forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not provided because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments that could be made for noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustments; significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits); divestiture related expenses; acquisition-related expenses; impact of purchase price allocations for recently completed acquisitions; gains and losses from sale of real estate assets; costs related to product line closures; future changes in the fair value of contingent considerations; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; future restructuring expenses; foreign exchange gains/(losses) on proceeds from divestitures; benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits; and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which, based on past experience, could be material. For additional information regarding Novanta's non-GAAP financial measures, see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call on Wednesday, February 28, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results. To access the call, please dial (877) 870-4263 prior to the scheduled conference call time. The conference ID number is 10113487. Alternatively, the conference call can be accessed online via a live webcast on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.novanta.com .\nA playback of this conference call will be available beginning 12:00 p.m. ET, Wednesday, February 28, 2018. The playback phone number is (877) 344-7529 and the code number is 10113487. The playback will remain available until 11:00 p.m. ET, Wednesday, March 21, 2018.\nA replay of the audio webcast will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of the call on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.novanta.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Operating Income from Continuing Operations and Operating Margin, Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes, Adjusted Income Tax Provision (Benefit) and Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Net Debt.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and supplementary information to investors regarding the operating performance of the Company. It is management's belief that these non-GAAP financial measures would be particularly useful to investors because of the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company's day-to-day business in accordance with the execution of the Company's strategy. This strategy includes streamlining the Company's existing operations through site and functional consolidations, strategic divestitures and product line closures, expanding the Company's business through significant internal investments, and broadening the Company's product and service offerings through acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions. The financial impact of certain elements of these activities, particularly acquisitions, divestitures, and site and functional restructurings, is often large relative to the Company's overall financial performance and can adversely affect the comparability of its operating results and investors' ability to analyze the business from period to period.\nThe Company's Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Revenue Growth are used by management to evaluate operating performance, communicate financial results to the Board of Directors, benchmark results against historical performance and the performance of peers, and evaluate investment opportunities including acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Revenue Growth are used to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. The Company also uses Adjusted Diluted EPS as a measurement for performance shares issued to certain executives. Accordingly, the Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and insight into management's method of analysis.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company's reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables accompanying this press release.\nSafe Harbor and Forward-Looking Information\nCertain statements in this release are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Measures\nOrganic Revenue Growth\nWe define the term \"organic revenue\" as revenue excluding the impact from business acquisitions, divestitures, product line discontinuations, and the effect of foreign currency translation. We use the related term \"organic revenue growth\" to refer to the financial performance metric of comparing current period organic revenue with the reported revenue of the corresponding period in the prior year. We believe that this non-GAAP measure, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allows us and our investors to better measure our performance and evaluate long-term performance trends. Organic revenue growth also facilitates easier comparisons of our performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to our peers. We exclude the effect of foreign currency translation from these measures because foreign currency translation is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because these activities can vary dramatically between reporting periods and between us and our peers, which we believe makes comparisons of long-term performance trends difficult for management and investors. Beginning in 2017, Organic Revenue Growth is also used as a performance metric to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees.\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin\nThe calculation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is displayed in the tables above. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory and deferred revenue fair value adjustments from business acquisitions because: (1) the amounts are non-cash; (2) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (3) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the components of operating costs. In addition, the Company excluded prior year inventory related charges associated with a product line closure as these costs occurred outside the Company's day-to-day business for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nAdjusted Operating Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Operating Margin\nThe calculation of Adjusted Operating Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Operating Margin is displayed in the tables above. Adjusted Operating Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Operating Margin exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory and deferred revenue fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions because: (1) the amounts are non-cash; (2) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (3) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the components of operating costs. The Company also excluded prior year CEO transition costs related to CEO succession, prior year inventory related charges associated with a product line closure, and restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs due to the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company's day-to-day business for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nAdjusted Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes\nThe calculation of Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes is displayed in the tables above. The calculation of Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory and deferred revenue fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, prior year CEO transition costs related to CEO succession, prior year inventory related charges associated with a product line closure, and restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs for the reasons described for Adjusted Operating Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Operating Margin above.\nNon-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate\nThe Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate are calculated based on the Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes by jurisdiction and the applicable tax rates currently in effect for the respective jurisdictions. In addition, the Company excluded significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on our effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above.\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax\nThe calculation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., net of tax, is displayed in the tables above. Because pre-tax income is included in determining net income attributable to Novanta Inc., net of tax, the calculation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., net of tax, also excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory and deferred revenue fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, prior year CEO transition costs related to CEO succession, prior year inventory related charges associated with a product line closure, and restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs for the reasons described for Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes. In addition, the Company excluded significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on our effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS\nThe calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS is displayed in the tables above. Because Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., net of tax, is used in the diluted EPS calculation, the calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory and deferred revenue fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, prior year CEO transition costs related to CEO succession, prior year inventory related charges associated with a product line closure, restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs, significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on our effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments for the reasons described above for Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., net of tax. In addition, the Company excluded the adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interest to estimated redemption value as (1) the adjustment is unusual; (2) the amount is noncash; (3) the amount does not represent a measure of earnings and is excluded from the determination of net income attributable to Novanta Inc.; and (4) the Company believes it may not be indicative of future adjustments and that investors may benefit from an understanding of the Company's operating results without giving effect to this adjustment.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as the consolidated net income before deducting interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash share-based compensation, restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, prior year CEO transition costs, prior year inventory related charges associated with a product line closure, and other non-operating income (expense) items, including foreign exchange gains (losses) and earnings from an equity-method investment for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nAdjusted EBITDA includes 100% of the results of our consolidated subsidiaries and therefore does not exclude the Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Revenue.\nIn evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as, or similar to, some of the adjustments in this presentation.\nNet Debt\nThe Company defines Net Debt as its total debt as reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the period plus unamortized deferred financing costs and less its cash and cash equivalents. Management uses Net Debt to monitor the Company's outstanding debt obligations that could not be satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand.\n* * * *\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/novanta-announces-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-300605760.html\nSOURCE Novanta Inc.",
