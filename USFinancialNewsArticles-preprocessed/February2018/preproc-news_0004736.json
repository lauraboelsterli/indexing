    "text": "Solid Fourth Quarter Performance, within the Company’s Most Recent Expectations\nNEENAH, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bemis Company, Inc. (NYSE:BMS) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. Refer to the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures detailed in the attached schedule, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, and net debt, and discussion of items impacting comparability in this press release.\nSUMMARY OF THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2017\nQ4 Q4 YTD ($ in millions except per share amounts) 2017 2016 % change 2017 2016 % change Earnings Per Share $ (0.44 ) $ 0.64 (168.8 )% $ 1.02 $ 2.48 (58.9 )% Adjusted Earnings Per Share $ 0.63 $ 0.67 (6.0 )% $ 2.39 $ 2.69 (11.2 )% Cash from Operations $ 79.5 $ 89.0 (10.7 )% $ 379.0 $ 437.4 (13.4 )% Refer to the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures detailed in the attached schedule, including adjusted earnings per share, referenced in this release, which denotes that fourth quarter 2017 GAAP EPS was driven primarily by the Goodwill impairment charge in Latin America.\n2018 GUIDANCE SUMMARY\nManagement set guidance for the full year 2018:\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.75 to $2.90, which includes a $.31 benefit related to U.S. tax reform at the midpoint of the range. Capital expenditures expected between $150 and $160 million. Cash flow from operations expected to be in the range of $420 to $450 million, which includes approximately $50 million of restructuring and related cash costs.\n“We made progress during the second half of 2017, as reflected in adjusted operating profit that was up nearly $35 million compared to the first half of the year. This increase reflects operational improvements and the early benefits of Agility, which is our plan to fix, strengthen, and grow our business,” said William F. Austen, Bemis Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are focused on executing our plan to create a more agile, streamlined, and efficient business.”\n2017 LAUNCH OF “AGILITY”\nDuring 2017, the Company launched an improvement plan called “Agility” to fix, strengthen, and grow its business.\nAs part of this three-pronged approach, the fix aspect involves the restructuring and cost savings plan announced in June and increased in September to target pre-tax annual savings of $65 million. As anticipated, $4.1 million of this benefit was realized in 2017; the Company anticipates approximately $35 million of benefit in 2018, with the remainder of the plan benefit in 2019. Estimated total pre-tax costs to implement the plan are $110 to $125 million. Of that total, pre-tax cash expense is estimated between $75 and $85 million. The announced plan includes optimizing manufacturing capacity, consolidating office space, and reducing SG&A cost structure and other costs.\nThe strengthen and grow aspects of Agility create the foundation for the Company’s long-term success by simplifying its product portfolio and organizational structure, rebalancing R&D efforts to focus on manufacturing improvements, and deliberately pursuing targeted areas of growth in its North American business. The Company’s actions during 2018 related to these work streams will lay the foundation for future growth.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nNew Reportable Segment Structure\nEffective with reporting for the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company realigned its segment reporting to transition from two reportable segments to three reportable segments as follows: U.S. Packaging, Latin America Packaging, and Rest of World Packaging. The U.S. Packaging business segment is unchanged. The Company will now report Latin America Packaging and Rest of World Packaging business segments, which had previously been aggregated and named Global Packaging.\nThe Latin America Packaging segment includes all food and non-food packaging-related manufacturing operations located in Latin America. The Rest of World Packaging business segment includes all food and non-food packaging-related manufacturing operations located in Europe and Asia-Pacific, as well as medical device and pharmaceutical packaging manufacturing operations in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.\nHistorical detail of the new reportable segments is provided in the supplemental schedules on the Company’s investor website and in the attached schedules in this press release.\nU.S. Packaging\nU.S. Packaging net sales of $643.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 represented an increase of 1.8 percent compared to the same period of 2016. Unit volumes were relatively flat compared to the prior fourth quarter. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by sales price increases partially offset by mix of products sold.\nU.S. Packaging net sales of $2,626.0 million for the full year 2017 represented an increase of 0.2 percent compared to the same period of 2016. Compared to the prior year, unit volumes were up nearly 1 percent.\nU.S. Packaging operating profit decreased to $89.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, or 13.9 percent of net sales, compared to $94.0 million, or 14.9 percent of net sales, in 2016.\nU.S. Packaging operating profit decreased to $352.5 million for the full year 2017, or 13.4 percent of net sales, compared to $400.0 million, or 15.3 percent of net sales, in 2016. Compared to the prior year, lower profits were driven by mix of products sold, previously-negotiated contractual selling price reductions on select products, and inefficiencies related to an ERP system implementation at one of the Company's manufacturing facilities during the second quarter.\nLatin America Packaging\nLatin America Packaging net sales of $178.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 represented a decrease of 0.6 percent compared to the same period of 2016. Currency translation decreased net sales by 0.5 percent. Organic sales were approximately flat reflecting flat unit volumes and increased selling prices that were offset by unfavorable sales mix driven by the economic environment in Brazil.\nLatin America Packaging net sales of $711.4 million for the full year of 2017 represented an increase of 1.2 percent compared to the full year of 2016. Currency translation increased net sales by 4.0 percent. Organic sales decline of 2.8 percent reflects decreased unit volumes of approximately 4 percent and unfavorable sales mix driven by the challenging economic environment in Brazil, partially offset by increased selling prices.\nLatin America Packaging operating profit for the fourth quarter was $6.2 million, compared to $15.2 million for the same period in 2016. Latin America Packaging operating profit for the full year was $30.0 million, compared to $50.0 million for the same period in 2016. Compared to the prior year, lower profits in Latin America Packaging were driven primarily by the impacts of the challenging economic environment in Brazil, including lower unit volumes and unfavorable mix of products sold.\nRest of World Packaging\nRest of World Packaging net sales of $181.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 represented an increase of 3.1 percent compared to the same period of 2016. Currency translation increased net sales by 4.1 percent. The acquisition of Evadix increased net sales by 0.5 percent. Organic sales decline of 1.5 percent reflects unfavorable mix of products sold, partially offset by increased unit volumes of approximately 8 percent and increased selling prices.\nRest of World Packaging net sales of $708.8 million for the full year 2017 represented an increase of 4.2 percent compared to the full year of 2016. Currency translation decreased net sales by 1.7 percent. The acquisitions of Steripack and Evadix increased net sales by 3.7 percent. Organic sales growth of 2.2 percent reflects increased unit volumes of approximately 6 percent and increased selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable mix of products sold.\nRest of World Packaging operating profit for the fourth quarter was $15.4 million, compared to $18.2 million for the same period in 2016. Rest of World Packaging operating profit for the full year 2017 was $61.1 million, compared to $64.0 million for the same period in 2016. Compared to the prior year, lower profits in Rest of World Packaging were driven primarily by rising raw material input prices in Europe and mix of products sold.\nSIGNIFICANT ITEMS IMPACTING THE COMPARABILITY OF FOURTH QUARTER U.S. GAAP RESULTS\nWhile the following items impact the Company’s fourth quarter U.S. GAAP results, they do not impact the Company's operational segment results, compliance with debt covenants, or cash flows.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s guidance for goodwill, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $196.6 million pretax related to the Latin America Packaging segment. This impairment is a result of the impact on profits from the decline in the economic environment in Brazil during 2017 and the related forecasted slower economic recovery.\nPension Settlement Charge\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of $10.1 million pretax. The Company initiated a program during the third quarter of 2017 in which it offered terminated vested participants in the U.S. qualified retirement plans the opportunity to receive their benefits early as a lump sum. This charge does not impact the Company's operations, compliance with debt covenants, or cash flows.\nImpact of U.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was signed by the President of the United States and became enacted law. As a result of this legislation, the Company recorded a $67.2 million non-cash tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017. This net benefit was driven primarily by the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities under TCJA, partially offset by the one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings.\nCASH FLOW AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nCash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $379.0 million, compared to $437.4 million in the prior year. Cash flow from operations included cash used for restructuring and related activities of $24.5 million in 2017 and $8.2 million in 2016. The decline in 2017 cash flow from operations was driven primarily by profit levels in 2017, partially offset by working capital improvements made during 2017.\nTotal company net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.7 times at December 31, 2017.\nCapital expenditures totaled $188.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, reflecting planned investment to support productivity improvements in the U.S. Packaging segment and growth initiatives throughout the Company’s business.\nFor the full year 2017, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares for $103.8 million. At December 31, 2017, the remaining Board authorization for the repurchase of Bemis common stock was 18.2 million shares.\nOUTLOOK\nManagement expects adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.90 for the full year 2018, which includes a $.31 per share benefit related to U.S. tax reform at the midpoint of the range.\n“Our adjusted earnings guidance reflects a double-digit increase over last year, driven in part by U.S. tax reform and in part by the decisive actions we have taken to improve our cost structure through the fix portion of our Agility plan,” said William F. Austen, Bemis Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “The changes we are making through the strength & grow aspects of our Agility plan lay an even stronger foundation for long-term growth.”\nAusten continued, “In our U.S. business, we have initiated what we call “agile lane”, which is a pilot that aligns our people, processes, and assets to excel at short-run business. This effort deliberately focuses on the pockets of growth that are available in the U.S. today.”\nAusten further commented, “In our Latin American business, we continue to focus on what we can control through fixed and variable cost reductions, and we anticipate profit improvement from this in 2018. The impact of the economic environment in Brazil has stabilized, and our business is well-positioned to prosper when the economy turns in the future. In our Rest of World business, we anticipate that net growth will continue in 2018 and that margins will expand, particularly driven by growth in our healthcare business.”\nAusten concluded, “During 2018, we are taking action to build on Bemis Company’s strong foundation to create value for our shareholders over the long-term. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet, to returning free cash flow to our shareholders, and to deliberately pursuing pockets of growth that will deliver long-term health and success for Bemis Company.”\nManagement expects full year 2018 cash from operations to be in the range of $420 to $450 million. This guidance includes approximately $50 million of restructuring and related cash costs. Cash from operations improvement in 2018 as compared to the prior year is driven by planned profit improvements as well as planned inventory reductions.\nManagement expects capital expenditures for 2018 between $150 and $160 million.\nManagement expects an effective income tax rate for 2018 of approximately 24 percent, which incorporates the benefit of recent U.S. tax reform.\nPRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION\nThis press release refers to non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted diluted earnings per share, organic sales growth or decline, adjusted EBITDA, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted return on invested capital. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These measures exclude the impact of certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses on sales of significant property and divestitures, certain litigation matters, and certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction expenses, due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog and changes in the fair value of deferred acquisition payments. This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP measures to evaluate operating performance and believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. All historical non-GAAP information is reconciled with reported GAAP results. Forward looking non-GAAP measures contained in our 2018 outlook are reconciled to GAAP measures as practically as possible. However, we are not providing forward looking guidance for full year 2018 U.S. GAAP guidance or a reconciliation of full year 2018 adjusted EPS to U.S. GAAP EPS because we are unable to predict with reasonably certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets, certain other gains or losses and the income tax effects of these items and/or other income tax-related events. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP EPS for the guidance period.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis release contains certain estimates, predictions, and other “forward-looking statements” (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

(2) The Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Latin America Packaging segment. This impairment is a result of the impact on profits from the decline in the economic environment in Brazil during 2017 and the related forecasted slower economic recovery. The impairment charge recognized by the Company was $196.6 million pre-tax and $145.5 million, net of taxes. (3) The Company initiated a program during the third quarter of 2017 in which it offered terminated vested participants in the U.S. qualified retirement plans the opportunity to receive their benefits early as a lump sum. The Company recognized a $10.1 million pre-tax pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. This charge was $6.8 million, net of taxes. (4) On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA\") was signed by the President of the United States and became enacted law. The Company recognized a $67.2 million non-cash tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017. This benefit is due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities from the change in the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent netted against the increase to taxes from the one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings. (5) In 2017, other costs are comprised of acquisition costs and hurricane-related expenses incurred at the Puerto Rico facility. In 2016, other costs are comprised primarily of acquisition-related costs associated with the Emplal Participações S. A. and SteriPack acquisitions and were recorded both in operating income and interest expense (reflecting fees to extinguish portions of the Emplal seller's debt). Other costs also include a gain on sale of land and building related to the sale of a plant in Latin America.
