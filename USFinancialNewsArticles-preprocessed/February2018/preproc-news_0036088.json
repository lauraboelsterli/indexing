We are very optimistic for 2018. Bookings are looking good and cost is on track,” he told a news conference.\nThe company’s shares were down 6.4 percent at 0828 GMT. It was the worst performing stock on an Oslo bourse up 1.10 percent.\nThe full-year net loss came in at 299 million crowns, down from a profit of 1.14 billion in 2016. In three months, the firm’s cash liquidity reduced by 27 percent to 4.04 billion crowns.\nA profit for the coming year would be better than most analysts have expected, with participants in the Reuters poll on average forecasting a net loss of 690 million crowns for 2018.\nNorwegian Air maintained expectations for 40 percent capacity growth in 2018.\nThe airline has embarked on an ambitious expansion plan, buying more than 200 new fuel-efficient jets yet investors worry its drive to put more passengers on more planes is pushing up costs quickly without producing higher returns.\nNorwegian’s fate rests on the still unproven strategy of adapting the success of low-cost short-haul travel to long-haul routes, as well as making a parallel bet on leasing out jets to rival carriers pay off.\nAfter launching its London-to-Buenos Aires flight this week, Norwegian said on Tuesday it plans to introduce more routes to South America, as well as adding more destinations in the United States and Asia in coming years.\nWhile Norwegian expects to add 25 aircraft to its fleet in 2018, it has also initiated a process to sell older planes and thus reduce its capital expenditure commitments.\nThe company’s gross capex for 2018 is now seen at $1.9 billion, down from $2.1 billion seen in October. In 2019, the company plans gross capex of $2.6 billion, but the net numbers will be lower as older aircraft are sold, the company added.
