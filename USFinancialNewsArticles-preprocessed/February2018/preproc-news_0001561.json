The market is a lot more jittery and is dissecting every piece of economic data more closely.”\nCurrently the market has priced in three rate hikes for 2018.\nA report showed weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fell, pointing to a tight labor market and strong economy.\nHowever, nonfarm productivity fell 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, which was the first drop since the first quarter of 2016, while unit labor costs rose 2.0 percent in the final three months of 2017. Higher labor costs could signal faster inflation than is currently anticipated.\nAnother report showed U.S. factory activity slowed in January amid a fall in new orders.\nAt 10:44 a.m. ET (1544 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 50.26 points, or 0.19 percent, at 26,099.13, the S&P 500 was down 2.77 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,821.04.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was up 7.84 points, or 0.11 percent, at 7,419.32.\nEight of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, with the materials index’s 1.21 percent fall leading the decliners.\nStrong fourth-quarter reports from S&P 500 companies so far have pushed up analysts’ profit growth estimate to 13.7 percent, from 12 percent at the start of the month.\nHowever, expectations from earnings have gone up and companies that don’t do well are being punished more harshly, Zipper said.\nUPS dropped 6.6 percent after the world’s largest package delivery company reported a fourth-quarter net profit that was hurt by additional costs.\nCigna, Alibaba, DowDuPont were all lower after reporting quarterly results.\nPayPal fell 7.2 percent after former parent eBay said it planned to move to a new primary payment processor.\nFacebook rose 3.5 percent after the company forecast rising ad sales, despite a dip in usage on the social media network.\nIndustry heavyweights Apple, Alphabet and Amazon are due to report results after the bell.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,636 to 1,138. On the Nasdaq, 1,565 issues fell and 1,153 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 19 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 45 new highs and 44 new lows.
