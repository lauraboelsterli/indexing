    "text": "Feb 5 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Broadcom Ltd on Monday raised its offer to buy Qualcomm Inc by 24 percent to more than $121 billion, sweetening the bid and putting more pressure on its rival to come to the table for negotiations.\nThe new offer values the company at $82 per share - a premium of 24 percent over Qualcomm’s close on Friday.\nQualcomm in November rejected Broadcom’s $70 per share cash-and-stock bid that valued the company at $103 billion.\n ",
