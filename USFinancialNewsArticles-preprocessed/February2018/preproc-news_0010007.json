    "text": "LEAWOOD, Kan., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (“Euronet” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:EEFT), a leading electronic payments provider, reports fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nEuronet reports the following consolidated results for the fourth quarter 2017 compared with the same period of 2016:\nRevenues of $604.6 million, a 16% increase from $519.8 million (10% increase on a constant currency (1) basis). Operating income of $41.1 million, a 29% decrease from $58.1 million (35% decrease on a constant currency basis). Adjusted operating income (2) of $73.6 million, a 27% increase from $58.1 million (20% increase on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA (3) of $102.9 million, a 24% increase from $83.3 million (16% increase on a constant currency basis). Net loss attributable to Euronet of $22.9 million or $0.44 diluted loss per share, compared with net income of $28.9 million or $0.54 diluted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share (4) of $1.13, a 14% increase from $0.99. Transactions of 937 million, a 6% increase from 881 million.\nEuronet reports the following consolidated results for the full year 2017 compared with the same period of 2016:\nRevenues of $2,252.4 million, a 15% increase from $1,958.6 million (13% increase on a constant currency (1) basis). Operating income of $266.0 million, a 6% increase from $249.8 million (3% increase on a constant currency basis). Adjusted operating income (2) of $304.6 million, a 22% increase from $249.8 million (19% increase on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA (3) of $415.2 million, a 20% increase from $345.2 million (18% increase on a constant currency basis). Net income attributable to Euronet of $156.9 million or $2.85 diluted earnings per share, compared with net income of $174.4 million or $3.23 diluted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share (4) of $4.58, a 14% increase from $4.02. Transactions of 3,631 million, an 11% increase from 3,261 million.\n\"I am pleased we continued to deliver strong double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter,\" stated Michael J. Brown, Euronet's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"The 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share was led by sustained growth in the EFT segment from continued investments in our ATM networks. epay also delivered a strong fourth quarter with double-digit operating income growth from the seasonally higher sales of non-mobile products, and Money Transfer delivered solid revenue growth, despite price reductions given upon extension of the Walmart agreement.\"\n\"For the full year we delivered Adjusted EPS of $4.58, a 14% year-over-year increase, and the fifth consecutive year we have delivered strong double-digit growth in Adjusted EPS,\" continued Mr. Brown. \"This consistently strong earnings growth is the result of continued focus by each of our segments to add more product across more devices.\"\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. passed tax reform legislation which has significantly impacted the Company's income taxes for 2017. The new law required the Company to recognize its affiliates' historic deferred foreign earnings as a deemed repatriation, subjecting the earnings to U.S. tax. The Company anticipates a preliminary charge of $41.6 million which represents the current and deferred tax impact in 2017. The current tax amount is $28.1 million which is payable over 8 years and fully utilized our pre-tax U.S. net operating loss of approximately $134 million. This non-recurring charge of $41.6 million has been excluded from Adjusted EPS in order to more clearly depict the operating results of the business.\nIn the fourth quarter 2017, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment testing and recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $31.8 million related to the Company's epay businesses in the Middle East, North America and the United Kingdom. In order to provide a more transparent comparison of operating results, adjusted operating income has been provided to exclude the impact of these impairments from the fourth quarter and full year results. Full year adjusted operating income also excludes the $2.3 million impairment charge recorded in the second quarter 2017 related to the Company's decision to close its Pure Commerce office in South Korea.\nSee the reconciliation of non-GAAP items in the attached financial schedules.\nSegment and Other Results\nThe EFT Processing Segment reports the following results for the fourth quarter 2017 compared with the same period or date in 2016:\nRevenues of $146.5 million, a 33% increase from $110.0 million (24% increase on a constant currency basis). Operating income of $25.8 million, a 55% increase from $16.6 million (45% increase on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA of $41.6 million, a 47% increase from $28.3 million (37% increase on a constant currency basis). Transactions of 627 million, a 22% increase from 515 million. Operated 37,133 ATMs as of December 31, 2017, a 9% increase from 33,973.\nThe EFT Processing Segment reports the following results for the full year 2017 compared with the same period or date in 2016:\nRevenues of $634.6 million, a 37% increase from $464.3 million (33% increase on a constant currency basis). Operating income of $162.9 million, a 39% increase from $117.2 million (34% increase on a constant currency basis). Adjusted operating income of $165.2 million, a 41% increase from $117.2 million (36% increase on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA of $220.8 million, a 40% increase from $157.3 million (36% increase on a constant currency basis). Transactions of 2,352 million, a 25% increase from 1,885 million.\nFourth quarter constant currency revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA growth was largely the result of a 9% year-over-year increase in active ATMs, a 22% increase in transactions and the return of the ATM cash supply in India to pre-demonetization levels. The increases in ATMs and transactions were primarily from growth in Europe and India - including an increase in the number of value added transactions on both ATMs and point-of-sale terminals. Similar to the fourth quarter 2016, the EFT Segment added more than 1,000 high-value ATMs during the quarter - deployed primarily throughout Europe - which positions the EFT segment for a continuation of strong revenue growth, but also results in higher operating costs in the seasonally weaker first quarter.\nFor the full year, ATM growth reflects the addition of approximately 3,300 high-value ATMs in Europe and India as well as the addition of approximately 900 ATMs under our low-margin agreements in India, less approximately 1,000 more winterized ATMs than the prior year.\nFull year revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA growth was the result of ATM and transaction expansion, together with the easing of the cash constraints stemming from the 2016 de-monetization in India.\nThe epay Segment reports the following results for the fourth quarter 2017 compared with the same period or date in 2016:\nRevenues of $221.5 million, a 13% increase from $195.9 million (5% increase on a constant currency basis). Operating loss of $6.3 million, compared with operating income of $21.6 million. Adjusted operating income of $25.5 million, an 18% increase from $21.6 million (10% increase on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA of $27.5 million, a 14% increase from $24.2 million (5% increase on a constant currency basis). Transactions of 285 million, a 17% decrease from 344 million. Point-of-sale (\"POS\") terminals of approximately 707,000 as of December 31, 2017, a 7% increase from approximately 661,000. Retailer locations of approximately 323,000 as of December 31, 2017, a 6% increase from approximately 305,000.\nThe epay Segment reports the following results for the full year 2017 compared with the same period or date in 2016:\nRevenues of $734.0 million, a 6% increase from $693.9 million (4% increase on a constant currency basis). Operating income of $38.1 million, a 44% decrease from $68.2 million (46% decrease on a constant currency basis). Adjusted operating income of $69.9 million, a 2% increase from $68.2 million (no change on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA of $79.6 million, a 1% increase from $79.2 million (2% decrease on a constant currency basis). Transactions of 1,186 million, an 8% decrease from 1,294 million.\nepay fourth quarter constant currency revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily the result of increased sales of non-mobile products, partially offset by certain mobile transaction declines. The 17% decline in transactions was largely the result of the loss of a high-volume, low-margin customer in the Middle East.\nFor the full year, epay constant currency revenue growth resulted from increased sales of non-mobile products, partially offset by certain mobile transaction declines. Full year adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA changes largely reflect increases in certain advertising and promotion expenses.\nThe Money Transfer Segment reports the following results for the fourth quarter 2017 compared with the same period or date in 2016:\nRevenues of $237.6 million, an 11% increase from $214.3 million (8% increase on a constant currency basis). Operating income of $29.2 million, a 1% increase from $28.9 million (2% decrease on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA of $36.8 million, a 2% increase from $36.2 million (1% decrease on a constant currency basis). Total transactions of 24.8 million, a 14% increase from 21.8 million. Network locations of approximately 343,000 as of December 31, 2017, an 8% increase from approximately 317,000.\nThe Money Transfer Segment reports the following results for the full year 2017 compared with the same period or date in 2016:\nRevenues of $886.7 million, an 11% increase from $802.0 million (10% increase on a constant currency basis). Operating income of $104.5 million, a 3% increase from $101.5 million (2% increase on a constant currency basis). Adjusted EBITDA of $134.1 million, a 3% increase from $130.7 million (2% increase on a constant currency basis). Total transactions of 92.2 million, a 12% increase from 82.3 million.\nFourth quarter constant currency revenue growth was driven by growth across most sectors of the Ria business together with continued contributions from the conversion of the XE international payments business to the HiFX platform. Operating income and adjusted EBITDA were adversely impacted by the price reduction included in the April 2017 extension of the Walmart agreement and from certain investments, principally in India, to further expand the Ria network. Excluding these items, constant currency operating income would have grown at approximately 7%.\nFourth quarter money transfers grew 14% and non-transfer transactions, such as currency exchange and check cashing, grew 12%, resulting in total transaction growth of 14%.\nFull year constant currency revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by growth across most segments of Ria's business as well as the conversion of XE to the HiFX platform, partially offset by the price reduction included in the Walmart renewal and increased advertising expenses - primarily from the launch of our enhanced payout network in India. Excluding the Walmart renewal and the increased advertising expenses, operating income and adjusted EBITDA would have grown in-line with revenue growth.\nCorporate and Other reports $7.6 million of expense for the fourth quarter 2017 compared with $9.0 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Excluding costs related to the proposed MoneyGram transaction, adjusted operating expense would have been $6.9 million for the fourth quarter 2017 compared with $9.0 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Decreased corporate expense is largely due to reduced short-term incentive compensation expense.\nFor the full year, Corporate and other reports $39.5 million of expense compared with $37.1 million for the full year 2016. Excluding costs related to the proposed MoneyGram transaction, adjusted operating expense would have been $35.0 million for the full year 2017 compared with $37.1 million for the full year 2016.\nBalance Sheet and Financial Position\nUnrestricted cash on hand was $819.1 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $1,062.2 million as of September 30, 2017. The decrease in cash is due to repayments on the revolver and the short-term ATM facility as well as settlement timing in the business, partially offset by cash generated from operations.\nTotal indebtedness was $460.5 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $744.0 million as of September 30, 2017. Debt decreased as a result of repayments on the revolver and the short-term ATM cash facility due to lower seasonal ATM cash requirements.\nGuidance\nThe Company currently expects adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter 2018, assuming foreign currency exchange rates and the Company's share price remain stable through the end of the quarter, to be approximately $0.73. This guidance includes an impact of approximately $0.10 per share associated with certain minimum tax on foreign earnings resulting from the new tax reform legislation passed in December 2017, combined with a seasonal mix of profits generated in higher tax rate jurisdictions, additional discounts agreed for the extension of an important outsourcing customer and the additional costs related to seasonally activated ATMs.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company presents non-GAAP financial measures, such as constant currency financial measures, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. These measures should be used in addition to, and not a substitute for, revenues, net income, operating income and earnings per share computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's performance and overall results of operations. These non-GAAP measures are also an integral part of the Company's internal reporting and performance assessment for executives and senior management. The non-GAAP measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The attached schedules provide a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation of its forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for GAAP and the related GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, including adjustments that would be necessary for currency exchange rate fluctuations and other charges reflected in the Company's reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.\n(1) Constant currency financial measures are computed as if foreign currency exchange rates did not change from the prior period. This information is provided to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the Company's results when compared to the prior period.\n(2) Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income excluding expenses related to the potential MoneyGram acquisition and impairment charges.\n(3) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, expenses related to the potential MoneyGram acquisition, impairment charges and other non-operating or non-recurring items that are considered expenses or income under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA represents a performance measure and is not intended to represent a liquidity measure.\n(4) Adjusted earnings per share is defined as diluted U.S. GAAP earnings per share excluding, to the extent incurred in the period, the tax-effected impacts of: a) foreign currency exchange gains or losses, b) goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, c) gains or losses from the early retirement of debt, d) share-based compensation, e) acquired intangible asset amortization, f) expenses related to the potential MoneyGram acquisition, g) non-cash interest expense, h) non-cash income tax expense, i) the impact of the tax reform legislation passed in 2017, and j) other non-operating or non-recurring items. Adjusted earnings per share represents a performance measure and is not intended to represent a liquidity measure.\nConference Call and Slide Presentation\nEuronet Worldwide will host an analyst conference call on February 7, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results.
