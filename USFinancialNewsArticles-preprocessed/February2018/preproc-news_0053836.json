(Nasdaq:MELI) ( http://www.mercadolibre.com ), the largest online commerce ecosystem in Latin America, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017.\nPedro Arnt, Chief Financial Officer of MercadoLibre, Inc., commented, “Some of the main structural factors that underpin ecommerce and fintech in Latin America are beginning to take shape through the growth of the installed base of smartphones, increasing consumer familiarity and affinity with buying and transacting online, greater number of broadband users, rising demand for online financial services, and growing interest on behalf of traditional retailers and brands to find technology partners to support them in developing their digital strategies. All of the aforementioned structural factors will be the catalysts that will continue to fuel the growth of Mercado Libre in the region for many years to come.”\nFull Year 2017 Operational & Financial Highlights\nMercadoLibre sold 270.1 million items during 2017, a year-over-year increase of 49.1%, resulting in Gross Merchandise Volume of $11.7 billion. MercadoPago ended 2017 with 231.4 million Total Payment Transactions for the year, an increase of 66.8%, resulting in a full-year Total Payment Volume of $13.7 billion. MercadoEnvíos shipped 150.7 million items during 2017, a 74.2% increase as compared to 2016. Consolidated Net Revenues for 2017 were $1,398.1 million, a 65.6% year-over-year increase in USD. Full-year net income was $13.8 million, or $0.31 per share. Effective December 1, 2017, the Company determined that it no longer has accounting control of its subsidiaries in Venezuela as a result of the country’s recent selective default determination, restrictive exchange controls and other operating restrictions, all of which have significantly hindered the Company’s ability to make key financial decisions. As a result, the Company has decided to deconsolidate its Venezuelan operations as of December 1, 2017. The Company will no longer include the results of its Venezuelan subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements. However, Mercado Libre will remain fully committed to serving its Venezuelan users and will continue to operate in Venezuela after the aforementioned deconsolidation.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Business Highlights\nGross Merchandise Volume was $3,617.7 million, reflecting a 62.8% year-over-year increase in USD and a 132.4% increase on an FX neutral basis. Items sold during the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to 81.2 million, a 57.5% year-over-year increase. Successful items per unique buyer grew to 4.6 from 3.9 last year, a 17.1% year-over-year increase. We continue to grow the number of listings in our platform, ending the year with over 114.2 million listings, a 56.0% year-over-year increase. MercadoPago ended the year with an extraordinary fourth quarter, processing $4,342.8 million in payments, a 77.5% year-over-year increase. Total Payment Transactions through MercadoPago grew to 73.2 million, a 72.2% year-over-year increase. Penetration of MercadoPago in countries beyond Brazil, Mexico and Argentina continues to increase. On platform penetration in Colombia and Chile rose to 81.8% and 75.0% versus 60.3%and 41.5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Mobile engagement continues to grow as we move from a desktop centric model to a multi-device ecosystem, already representing 50% of our GMV during the fourth quarter of 2017. Successful execution of commercial initiatives, automated onboarding of small merchants, strong seasonal campaigns and outstanding results in our mobile payments initiatives resulted in off platform payment volume growth on an FX neutral basis of 127.9% year-over-year. As compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, we multiplied the number of mobile point-of-sale devices sold in Brazil by nearly 13 times, while in Argentina we have grown sales of devices by a factor of 20. Items shipped through MercadoEnvíos increased 86.9%, to 48.3 million items delivered in the fourth quarter. The service continues to gain adoption across the board; MercadoEnvíos arranged shipping for 75.5% of items sold on our platform in Brazil, 74.8% in Mexico, 60.5% in Colombia, 46.7% in Chile and 31.0% in Argentina. Free shipping penetration continues to gain traction as well, as over 70% of shipped GMV is already being done with free shipping. We are making meaningful advances in taking our classifieds business to a transactional model, with our down payment pilot launch in Brazil and Argentina.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nNet revenues for the fourth quarter were $437.0 million, a year-over-year increase of 70.5% in USD and 99.6% on an FX neutral basis. Marketplace revenues grew 71.2% in USD, and 116.1% on an FX neutral basis, while non-marketplace revenues grew 69.5% in USD and 76.4% on an FX neutral basis. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $203.4 million. Gross profit margin was 46.5%, compared to 63.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Most of the margin compression is explained by increases in costs associated with our free shipping & loyalty programs. We incurred a $85.8 million loss as a result of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations. Total operating expenses increased to $268.0 million, up 173.3% year-over-year on an as reported basis. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 61.3% versus 38.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Income from operations was negative $64.6 million, down 199.9% year-over-year on an as reported basis. Interest income contracted 13.4% year-over-year, ending the quarter with $8.9 million, due to lower interest rates in Brazil and Argentina. The company incurred $6.8 million dollars in financial expenses, mainly as a consequence of interest payments on its Convertible Bond issued in June of 2014. Foreign currency exchange saw a $2.1 million dollar loss due to local currency devaluations. Net income before taxes was negative $64.7 million, down 195.6% year-over-year on an as reported basis. Income tax expense was $3.0 million during the fourth quarter. Net loss as reported for the fourth quarter was $67.7 million dollars, resulting in basic net loss per common share of $1.53. Net cash provided by operating activities was $26.6 million. Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was $72.9 million dollars for the three months ended December 31st (*). Excluding Venezuela, revenues would have been $421.0 million, a 71.1% year-over-year increase. Total operating expenses would have been $178.2 million, or 42.3% of net revenues versus 38.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income would have been $8.8 million dollars, a margin of 2.0%, and earnings per share of 20 cents, vs 19.7% and $1.10 a year ago respectively.\n(*)Three month period ended December 31 st is calculated by taking the difference between twelve months ended December 31 st and nine months ended September 30 th\nFourth Quarter 2017 Corporate Highlights\nDuring the fiscal 2017, the Company approved total cash dividends for a total amount of $26,496 thousand or $0.600 per share, all of which had been paid as of year-end, except for the one approved in October 2017, consisting of $6,624 thousand (or $0.150 per share, which was paid on January 12, 2018) to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2017. After reviewing our capital allocation process the Board of Directors has concluded that the Company has multiple investment opportunities that should generate greater returns to shareholders through investing capital into the business than issuing a dividend. Consequently, the decision has been made to suspend the payment of dividend to shareholders as of the first quarter of 2018, as it will free up capital for investment in multiple projects in our various platforms.\nThe following table summarizes certain key performance metrics for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThree months ended December 31, (in MM) 2017 2016 %YoY %YoY Local\nCurrency Total confirmed registered users at the end of period 211.9 174.2 21.7 % New confirmed registered users during the period 10.7 7.9 36.2 % Gross merchandise volume $ 3,618 $ 2,222 62.8 % 132.4 % Number of successful items sold 81.2 51.6 57.5 % Number of successful items shipped 48.3 25.9 86.9 % Total payment volume $ 4,343 $ 2,447 77.5 % 94.5 % Total volume of payments on marketplace $ 3,007 $ 1,760 70.9 % Tota payments transactions 73.2 42.5 72.2 % Unique Buyers 17.7 13.2 34.5 % Unique Sellers 4.6 3.9 16.8 % Table of Year-over-Year Local Currency Revenue Growth Rates by Quarter\nYoY Growth rates Consolidated Net Revenues Q4'16 Q1'17 Q2'17 Q3'17 Q4'17 Brazil 64 % 66 % 60 % 71 % 79 % Argentina 60 % 58 % 44 % 51 % 62 % Mexico 29 % 55 % 80 % 82 % 124 % Venezuela 199 % 291 % 353 % 571 % 650 % Others 42 % 36 % 34 % 55 % 59 % Total 68 % 79 % 65 % 79 % 100 % Table of Year-over-Year USD Revenue Growth Rates by Quarter\nYoY Growth rates Consolidated Net Revenues Q4'16 Q1'17 Q2'17 Q3'17 Q4'17 Brazil 92 % 106 % 75 % 75 % 82 % Argentina 4 % 48 % 30 % 30 % 42 % Mexico 8 % 40 % 76 % 91 % 136 % Venezuela -10 % 19 % 90 % 42 % 49 % Others 46 % 47 % 39 % 57 % 62 % Total 42 % 74 % 59 % 61 % 70 % Conference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio webcast on February 22, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables included in our annual report.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance. Specifically, we believe that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.\nThe FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2016 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2017, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.\nThe following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree-months Periods Ended\nDecember 31, (*) As reported FX Neutral Measures (In millions, except percentages) 2017 2016 Percentage\nChange 2017 2016 Percentage\nChange Net revenues $ 437.0 $ 256.3 70.5 % $ 511.6 $ 256.3 99.6 % Cost of net revenues (233.6 ) (93.5 ) 149.7 % (245.7 ) (93.5 ) 162.7 % Gross profit 203.4 162.7 25.0 % 265.9 162.7 63.4 % Operating expenses (182.2 ) (98.1 ) 85.8 % (198.1 ) (98.1 ) 102.0 % Loss on Desconsolidation of Venezuelan Subsidiaries (85.8 ) — 100.0 % (85.8 ) — 100.0 % Total operating expenses (268.0 ) (98.1 ) 173.3 % (283.9 ) (98.1 ) 189.5 % Income from operations (64.6 ) 64.7 -199.9 % (18.0 ) 64.7 -127.8 % (*) The table above may not total due to rounding,\nCONTACT:\nMercadoLibre, Inc,\nInvestor Relations\ninvestor@mercadolibre.com\nhttp://investor.mercadolibre.com\nSource:MercadoLibre, Inc.",
