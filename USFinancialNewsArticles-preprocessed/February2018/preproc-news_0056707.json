    "text": "2017 marks the 13 th consecutive year of at least 20% year-over-year constant currency revenue growth >25% pro forma organic growth for the year in tick-borne disease and other revenue Balance sheet strengthened by December patent infringement settlement, which included a cash receipt of $27.5 million Reduced royalty burden resulted in substantial gross margin improvement\nOXFORD, United Kingdom and MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oxford Immunotec Global PLC (Nasdaq:OXFD), a global, high-growth diagnostics company, today announced fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\n“While the year contained many ups and downs, in aggregate I am pleased with the substantial progress made throughout the Company in 2017” said Dr. Peter Wrighton-Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Immunotec. “2017 highlights included stronger-than-expected performance in Asia, a marked acceleration in Europe & ROW revenue growth, outperformance of our clinical tick-borne disease business, and the successful culmination of several strategically important multi-year initiatives on intellectual property, royalties and reimbursement.”\nBy revenue type, total revenues were, in millions:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Full Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Percent\nChange\n2017 2016 Percent\nChange Product $ 9.7 $ 9.3 5% $ 40.5 $ 36.4 11% Service 15.3 14.4 6% 62.6 49.6 26% Total Revenue $ 25.0 $ 23.7 6 % $ 103.1 $ 86.1 20 % By indication, total revenues were, in millions:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Full Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Percent\nChange 2017 2016 Percent\nChange Tuberculosis $ 21.0 $ 20.4 3% $ 85.3 $ 78.6 9% Tick-Borne Disease and Other 4.0 3.3 24% 17.8 7.4 139% Total Revenue $ 25.0 $ 23.7 6 % $ 103.1 $ 86.1 20 % By geography, total revenues were, in millions:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Full Year Ended December 31, Percent Change Percent Change 2017 2016 As\nReported Constant\nCurrency (1) 2017 2016 As\nReported Constant\nCurrency (1) United States $ 15.6 $ 14.7 6% 6% $ 64.1 $ 49.5 30% 30% Europe & ROW 2.2 1.7 27% 21% 8.1 7.0 16% 17% Asia 7.2 7.3 -1% 2% 30.9 29.6 4% 6% Total Revenue $ 25.0 $ 23.7 6 % 6 % $ 103.1 $ 86.1 20 % 20 % (1) Changes in revenue include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use the non-GAAP financial measure \"constant currency basis\" in our filings to show changes in our revenue without giving effect to period-to-period currency fluctuations. We consider the use of a period over period revenue comparison on a constant currency basis to be helpful to investors, as it provides a revenue growth measure free of positive or negative volatility due to currency fluctuations.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $25.0 million, representing 6% growth over the fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $23.7 million. Tuberculosis revenue for the fourth quarter of $21.0 million increased 3% over the prior year period.\n2017 fourth quarter product revenue was $9.7 million, representing a 5% increase from product revenue of $9.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by strong growth in tuberculosis kit sales in Europe & ROW. Service revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $15.3 million, up 6% from 2016 fourth quarter revenue of $14.4 million. The increase in service revenue was primarily driven by strong growth in our clinical tick-borne disease business, as well as tuberculosis volume increases in the United States and United Kingdom.\nUnited States revenue was $15.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing 6% growth over revenue of $14.7 million in the prior year period. The increase was due to growth in our tuberculosis and tick-borne disease businesses.\nEurope & ROW revenue was $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 27% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. On a constant currency basis, Europe & ROW increased 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to tuberculosis growth in the UK and continental European markets.\nAsia revenue was $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 1% decrease compared to 2016 fourth quarter revenue of $7.3 million. On a constant currency basis, Asia grew 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $14.5 million, an increase of $1.9 million over gross profit of $12.5 million in the same period of 2016. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 57.7%, an increase of 490 basis points from gross margin of 52.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of lower royalty expenses and favorable product mix.\nOperating expenses were $28.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $8.4 million compared to $19.7 million in the same period last year. The increase in operating expenses was largely due to the inclusion of a one-time non-cash impairment charge of $7.2 million to write-off certain intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the 2016 acquisition of Immunetics, as well as expenses related to our BLA submissions and patent litigation.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.8 million, or $0.33 per share on a diluted basis, compared to a net loss $4.9 million, or $0.22 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted net loss per share was based on 26,828,912 and 22,412,691 weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $14.4 million compared to $(6.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $(4.0) million for the fourth quarter compared to $(5.2) million in the same period in 2016. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the full year 2017 was $103.1 million, representing 20% growth over the full year 2016 revenue of $86.1 million.\n2017 full year product revenue was $40.5 million representing an 11% increase from product revenue of $36.4 million in the full year 2016. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by growth in TB volumes in Asia and Europe & ROW, as well as sales of tick-borne disease kits. Service revenue for the full year 2017 was $62.6 million, up 26% from $49.6 million in the full year 2016. The increase in service revenue was primarily driven by revenues from our tick-borne disease business, as well as tuberculosis volume increases in the United States and United Kingdom.\nUnited States revenue was $64.1 million in the full year 2017 representing 30% growth compared to full year 2016 revenue of $49.5 million. The increase in United States revenue was primarily due to revenues from our tick-borne disease business.\nEurope & ROW revenue was $8.1 million in the full year 2017 representing a 16% increase compared to full year 2016 revenue of $7.0 million. On a constant currency basis, Europe & ROW grew 17% versus the full year 2016. Asia revenue was $30.9 million in the full year 2017 representing 4% growth over full year 2016 revenue of $29.6 million. On a constant currency basis, Asia grew 6% versus the full year 2016. The increase was driven by continued growth in China and higher sales in South Korea.\nGross profit for the full year 2017 was $56.3 million, an increase of $9.7 million over gross profit of $46.6 million in the full year 2016. Gross margin was 54.7%, an increase of 60 basis points from a gross margin of 54.1% in the full year 2016. The full year gross margin performance reflects lower royalty expenses and an underlying improvement in tuberculosis cost of revenues. These margin benefits were partially offset by higher volumes in our tick-borne disease business, which carries lower gross margins, as well as some early infrastructure investments necessary to meet future growth.\nOperating expenses were $109.9 million in the full year 2016, an increase of $37.4 million compared to $72.6 million in the full year 2016. The increase in operating expenses was due to the inclusion of a full year of operating costs from both Imugen and Immunetics, expenses related to our BLA submissions and patent litigation, the inclusion of a charge related to the SSI settlement, and the inclusion of non-cash impairment charges of $18.3 million to write-off certain intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the 2016 acquisitions of Imugen and Immunetics.\nNet loss for the full year 2017 was $32.9 million, or $1.38 per share, compared to a loss of $22.3 million, or $1.00 per share for the full year 2016. Net loss per share was based on 23,757,902 and 22,353,713 weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the full years 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEBITDA for the full year 2017 was $(23.9) million compared to $(22.2) million for the full year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $(20.0) million for the full year 2017 compared to $(18.5) million for the full year 2016. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.\nCash and cash equivalents were $90.3 million as of December 31, 2017. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $59.1 million as of December 31, 2016.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor full year 2018, the Company expects revenue of between $112 and $118 million, representing 9% - 15% year-over-year growth as reported.\nConference Call\nOxford Immunotec will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to review fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.

Our presentation of these measures is not made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our computation of these measures may vary from others in the industry. Our use of these measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nThe above table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated.\nOxford Immunotec Global PLC\nCondensed consolidated balance sheets\n(unaudited)\nDecember 31, (in thousands, except share and per share data) 2017\n2016\nAssets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 90,332 $ 59,110 Accounts receivable, net 16,981 13,265 Inventory, net 10,142 7,437 Prepaid expenses and other assets 3,027 2,390 Total current assets 120,482 82,202 Restricted cash, non-current 200 200 Property and equipment, net 9,067 7,793 In-process research and development — 16,170 Goodwill 3,967 3,822 Other intangible assets, net 7,849 11,017 Deferred tax asset 2,486 2,630 Other assets 185 178 Total assets $ 144,236 $ 124,012 Liabilities and shareholders’ equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 6,842 $ 3,201 Accrued liabilities 11,134 14,282 Settlement liability 4,342 — Contingent purchase price consideration — 882 Deferred income 36 41 Current portion of loans payable 91 84 Total current liabilities 22,445 18,490 Long-term portion of loans payable 29,904 29,601 Settlement liability 3,894 — Contingent purchase price consideration — 2,593 Other liabilities 364 364 Total liabilities 56,607 51,048 Shareholders’ equity: Ordinary shares, £0.006705 nominal value; 36,183,293 shares authorized at December 31,\n2017 and December 31, 2016, and 25,661,634 and 22,635,431 shares issued and\noutstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively 269 243 Additional paid-in capital 294,613 249,128 Accumulated deficit (201,541 ) (168,656 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (5,712 ) (7,751 ) Total shareholders’ equity 87,629 72,964 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 144,236 $ 124,012\nSource:Oxford Immunotec Global PLC",
