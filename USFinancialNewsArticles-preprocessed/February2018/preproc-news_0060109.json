    "text": "SHANGHAI, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nHIGHLIGHTS\nAchieved record adjusted profit of $46 million, a 22% increase compared to 2016. Announced the Board of Directors' recommendation to pay a final dividend for year 2017 of roughly $14 million, or $0.04 per share. Gross and adjusted profit margins up 270 basis points and 460 basis points, respectively, compared to prior year. Generated operating cash flow of $35 million and free cash flow of $11 million. Installed a record 120 new theatre systems in 2017 and signed agreements for an additional 95 systems. Reported Chinese New Year box office of ¥170 million over seven-day holiday period, a 74% increase compared to the prior year's holiday.\nIMAX China Holding, Inc. (\"IMAX China\") (HKG: 1970) today reported full-year 2017 Greater China revenue of $126.5 million and gross profit of $77.4 million, or 61.2% of revenues. Adjusted profit for the year came in at a record $45.9 million, up 22% from the prior year, driven by the installation of eight additional sales-type theatres versus 2016 and a 19% reduction in SG&A, excluding stock-based compensation, primarily as a result of the Company's cost-reduction initiatives. For adjustments to profit for the year and a full detail of financial results, please refer to the corporate filing posted with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, or to the earnings results posted on the Investor Relations section of the IMAX China web site ( http://www.imax.cn/investor ).\n\"Last year, we implemented initiatives aimed at refining our programming strategy to focus on capturing more local language box office, reducing costs and facilitating more operating leverage throughout our business. Record installations in 2017, combined with early positive results from our revenue and cost-savings initiatives, resulted in adjusted profit growth of 22%, to an all-time high of $46 million,\" stated Richard L. Gelfond, Chairman of IMAX China. \"As a result of our continued free cash flow generation, strong balance sheet and confidence in the Company's long-term growth prospects, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors recommended the payment of a final dividend in the amount of $0.04 per share, equivalent to HK$0.31 per share, or roughly $14 million for the 2017 year. We think this decision is a key component to creating long-term value for shareholders. Overall, we believe our asset-light approach to the cinema business, continued signings and installation momentum, and refined programming strategy strategically position IMAX China for the years ahead.\"\nIMAX China Dividend\nIMAX China today announced that its Board of Directors recommended the payment of a final cash dividend of $14 million or $0.04 per share.
