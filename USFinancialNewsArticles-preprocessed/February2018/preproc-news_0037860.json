Such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to several factors, risks and uncertainties, the impact or occurrence of which could cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in the forward-looking statements. These important factors, risks and uncertainties include:\nthe markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate; we operate in highly competitive markets with competitors who may have greater resources than we possess; we depend heavily on government contracts that may not be fully funded or may be terminated, and the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales and increase our costs; we make estimates in accounting for long-term contracts, and changes in these estimates may have significant impacts on our earnings; we enter into fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns; we may not realize the full amounts reflected in our backlog as revenue, which could adversely affect our future revenue and growth prospects; if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted; contracting on government programs is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment; the loss of The Boeing Company as a customer or a significant reduction in sales to The Boeing Company could adversely impact our operating results; our new product research and development efforts may not be successful which could reduce our sales and earnings; our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete; our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, intrusions or new software implementations; our indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility; significant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements; a write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth; our sales and earnings may be affected if we cannot identify, acquire or integrate strategic acquisitions, or if we engage in divesting activities; our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments; unforeseen exposure to additional income tax liabilities may affect our operating results; government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the United States and otherwise adversely affect our business; the failure or misuse of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages; future terror attacks, war, natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control could negatively impact our business; our operations are subject to environmental laws, and complying with those laws may cause us to incur significant costs; and we are involved in various legal proceedings, the outcome of which may be unfavorable to us.\nThese factors are not exhaustive. New factors, risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time that may affect the forward-looking statements made herein. Given these factors, risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as predictive of future results. We disclaim any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made in this report.\nContact: Ann Marie Luhr\n716-687-4225\nSource: Moog Inc",
