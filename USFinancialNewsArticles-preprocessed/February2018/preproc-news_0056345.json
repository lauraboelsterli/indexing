    "text": "LONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Primark owner Associated British Foods on Monday forecast first-half profit in line with the same period last year, held back by a previously flagged reduction in sugar revenues.\nThe group, which also owns major grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses, said lower finance expenses and a lower effective tax rate would lead to progress in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the first half to March 3.\nFor the full 2017-18 year, AB Food’s outlook was unchanged with “progress” expected in both adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS.\nThe group said Primark’s first-half total sales were expected to be up 7 percent at constant currency rates, with like-for-like sales down 1 percent but up 1 percent in the second quarter.
