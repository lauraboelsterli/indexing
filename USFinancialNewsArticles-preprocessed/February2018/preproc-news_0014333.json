    "text": "EDINBURGH, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Engineering outsourcer Babcock on Tuesday cut its revenue forecast for the 2018 full year to 5.3 billion to 5.4 billion pounds ($7.55 billion), citing a tough British business environment, ​but it kept its underlying profit outlook.\nBabcock said group margin was expected to be higher than previously forecast, due partly to efficiency improvements, helping to offset the drag on revenue coming from delays in new orders.\n$1 = 0.7154 pounds Reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; editing by Kate Holton\n ",
