    "text": "PETAH TIKVA, Israel, Feb. 13, Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (NASDAQ: GILT) (TASE: GILT), a worldwide leader in satellite networking technology, solutions and services, today reported its results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nKey Financial Highlights:\nRevenues for Q4 2017 totaled $82.7 million. Full year 2017 revenues of $282.8 million compare with $279.6 million in 2016. Continued strong profitability: Q4 2017 GAAP operating income was $5.6 million and non-GAAP operating income was $7.0 million. Full year 2017 GAAP operating income climbed substantially to $10.9 million from $0.8 million in 2016. Non-GAAP operating income for 2017 reached $18.5 million compared to $11.7 million in 2016, an increase of 58.6%. Q4 2017 GAAP net income was $3.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Q4 2017 non-GAAP net income was $4.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. Full year 2017 GAAP net income increased to $6.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, from a loss of $5.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in 2016. Non-GAAP net income for 2017 more than doubled to $14.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, from $5.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in 2016. Q4 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $9.0 million, or 10.8% of revenues. Full Year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA increased 36.2% to $26.2 million or 9.3% of revenues, from $19.2 million, or 6.9% of revenues in 2016. Management objectives for 2018: revenue range between $285 million to $305 million, GAAP operating income of between $17 million and $21 million, and Adjusted EBITDA between $30 million and $34 million.\nYona Ovadia, CEO of Gilat, commented:\n\"I am very pleased to report that we had a good fourth quarter which concluded a year of significant progress for Gilat, including substantial growth in our full-year profitability as we topped our upwardly revised management objectives for 2017. Our Adjusted EBITDA reached $26.2 million, above our adjusted objective of $24 million to $26 million, which was itself modified upwards mid-year from a range of $20 million to $24 million, and represents an increase of more than 36% from 2016's $19.2 million. Further, for the first time in seven years, we achieved full-year GAAP net income, which totaled $6.8 million, hence delivering on our commitment to GAAP profitability.\n\"Over the past year we have made substantial progress in executing our strategy, focusing on building a mix of quality and profitable revenues through our strategic growth engines of Mobile Cellular Backhaul and Mobility In-Flight Connectivity (IFC), combined with our efforts to reduce costs.\n\"We secured several LTE cellular backhauling deals, mainly in North America, and established a strong presence in the IFC market as exemplified by our partnership with Gogo with over 2,000 aircraft according to their backlog. These achievements coupled with our financial performance in 2017, are indicative of the progress we have made on both fronts, and of the solid and healthy foundation on which Gilat stands today, with a growing portion of recurring services.\nMr. Ovadia concluded: \"Looking at 2018, we are focused on improving our profitability while growing the top line. We will continue to develop and expand our growth engines of Mobile Cellular Backhaul and Mobility IFC as we see growing reception to our services and solutions. We plan to expand our offering in these areas, and we still see room to improve the efficiency of our operations. Therefore, our management objectives for 2018 are growth in our top line to a range of $285 million to $305 million, and Adjusted EBITDA between $30 million and $34 million, which represents growth of 15% to 30% from 2017's $26.2 million.\"\nKey Recent Announcements:\nNBN Co and Speedcast Select Gilat for Business and Enterprise Satellite Service in Australia; Valued at Tens of Millions of Dollars KDDI Selects Gilat's Satellite Based LTE Cellular Backhaul Solution for Nationwide LTE Network in Japan\nConference Call and Webcast Details:\nGilat management will host a conference call today, Tuesday, February 13, to discuss the fourth quarter and full year results.

To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company presents Non-GAAP presentations of net income, operating income, Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share. The adjustments to the Company's GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results, trends and performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA (operating income before depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock option expenses, costs related to acquisition transactions, restructuring cost, goodwill impairment, impairment of long lived assets, trade secrets litigation expenses and tax expenses under amnesty program) is presented to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods and evaluate the Company's financial and operating results on a consistent basis from period to period. The Company also believes this measure, when viewed in combination with the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides useful information to investors to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. Adjusted EBITDA, however, should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income for the period and may not be indicative of the historic operating results of the Company; nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures for other companies. Reconciliation between the Company's Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the attached summary financial statements.\nThis news release also contains a forward-looking estimate of Adjusted EBITDA projected to be generated by Gilat in 2018. A forward-looking estimate of net income and reconciliations of the forward-looking estimates of Adjusted EBITDA to net income are not provided because the items necessary to estimate net income are not estimable at this time. Non-GAAP presentations of net income, operating income, Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any of the consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as an indication of Gilat's operating performance or liquidity.\nAbout Gilat\nGilat Satellite Networks Ltd.
