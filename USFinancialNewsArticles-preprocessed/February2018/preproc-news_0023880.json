    "text": " 36 PM / Updated 30 minutes ago Neymar on target as PSG extend Ligue 1 lead Julien Pretot 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Paris St Germain were made to wait as Neymar struck in the second half to earn a 1-0 win at Toulouse on Saturday that extended the Ligue 1 leaders’ advantage to 12 points. \nThe Brazil forward struck in the 68th minute to put PSG on 65 points from 25 games with arch-rivals and second-placed AS Monaco on 53 after Stevan Jovetic inspired them to a 4-0 win at Angers. \nOlympique de Marseille are third on 52 after a 2-2 draw at St Etienne on Friday. \nToulouse, who are 15th on 26 points and only one point above safety, held firm in the first half thanks to a spirited performance by keeper Alban Lafont. Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - Toulouse vs Paris St Germain - Stadium Municipal de Toulouse, Toulouse, France - February 10, 2018 Paris Saint-Germain’s Neymar in action Toulouse's Yannick Cahuzac REUTERS/Regis Duvignau \nBut like most of PSG’s opponents this season, they eventually cracked even if coach Unai Emery had rested top striker Edinson Cavani ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League last-16 clash at Real Madrid. \nNeymar collected Angel Di Maria’s cross and found the back of the net as his curled shot was slightly deflected by Toulouse captain Issa Diop. Slideshow (3 Images) \nHe came close to doubling the tally 10 minutes later but his right-foot effort crashed on to the post. \nNeymar hit the woodwork again in the 80th when his shot struck Lafont’s crossbar as PSG finished strongly. \nIn Angers, Monaco cantered to a routine win with a Ludovic Butelle own goal and two strikes by Jovetic. Defender Andrea Raggi completed the rout 19 minutes from time. Reporting by Julien Pretot,  ",
