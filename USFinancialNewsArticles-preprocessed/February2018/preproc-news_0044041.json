    "text": "Topline data expected in March 2018 from first of three ongoing Phase 2 trials evaluating the myelopreservation benefits of trilaciclib\nManagement to host webcast and conference call today at 4:30 p.m. EST\nRESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- G1 Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:GTHX), a clinical-stage oncology company, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, and provided an update on its corporate activities and product pipeline.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operational Highlight\nCompleted enrollment in Phase 2 trial of trilaciclib in combination with Tecentriq® and chemotherapy: G1 is conducting this placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 trial under a non-exclusive agreement with Genentech to evaluate trilaciclib in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor Tecentriq and chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. The trial was fully enrolled two quarters ahead of schedule.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operational Highlights\nEntered into clinical trial collaboration with AstraZeneca in NSCLC: G1 entered into a non-exclusive clinical trial collaboration with AstraZeneca to evaluate its epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor Tagrisso® in combination with G1T38 for the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). G1 filed and has an open Investigational New Drug (IND) application to support this Phase 1b/2 trial.\nFiled an IND for oral SERD G1T48: G1 filed an IND to support a Phase 1/2a trial of its oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), G1T48, in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative (ER+, HER2-) breast cancer. The IND opened in the first quarter of 2018.\nPreclinical trilaciclib data published: G1 data was published in the Cancer Discovery article, “CDK4/6 Inhibition Augments Anti-Tumor Immunity by Enhancing T Cell Activation.”\nStrengthened corporate leadership: Barclay (Buck) Phillips joined G1 as Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Corporate Development. Mr. Phillips brings more than 25 years of capital markets, financial strategy and business development experience in the life sciences.\nAdded to Nasdaq Biotechnology Index: G1 was added to the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (Nasdaq: NBI) as part of the NBI’s annual review of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market that meet eligibility criteria.\nAnticipated Upcoming Milestones\nAnnounce topline data from the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2a trial of chemotherapy with or without trilaciclib in first-line SCLC in March 2018. The trial is the first of three ongoing Phase 2 trials evaluating the myelopreservation benefits of trilaciclib for patients undergoing chemotherapy.\nInitiate a Phase 1b/2 trial of G1T38 in combination with Tagrisso for the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in the first quarter of 2018.\nPresent preliminary data from the Phase 1b trial of G1T38 plus Faslodex® in ER+, HER2- breast cancer patients in the second quarter of 2018.\nComplete patient enrollment in the Phase 2a trial of trilaciclib in second-/third-line SCLC and the Phase 2 trial of trilaciclib in triple-negative breast cancer in the second quarter of 2018. Preliminary data from these trials, which are evaluating the myelopreservation benefits of trilaciclib for patients undergoing chemotherapy, are expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nInitiate a Phase 1/2a trial of G1T48 in ER+, HER2- breast cancer patients in the second quarter of 2018.\n“G1 has made significant progress over the last five months, filing and opening two INDs, expanding our clinical collaborations with the signing of the Tagrisso deal with AstraZeneca and beating the estimate for completion of patient enrollment by two quarters for our Phase 2 trial of trilaciclib in combination with Tecentriq,” said Mark Velleca, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of G1 Therapeutics. “Our recent accomplishments and ongoing clinical programs will drive several significant data readouts throughout 2018, beginning next month with the announcement of topline myelopreservation data from the Phase 2a trial of trilaciclib in first-line small cell lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.”\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nCash Position : Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $103.8 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $118.4 million as of September 30, 2017, and $47.3 million as of December 31, 2016.\nOperating Expenses : Operating expenses were $17.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $10.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.
