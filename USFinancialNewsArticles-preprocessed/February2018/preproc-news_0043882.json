    "text": "WAUKEGAN, Ill., Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northern States Financial Corporation (OTC PINK:NSFC) (the “Company”), holding company for NorStates Bank (the “Bank”), an FDIC insured financial institution, today reported a fourth quarter 2017 loss of $6.3 million (a loss of $0.07 per share). The Company had a net loss of $6.4 million for the year 2017 compared to net income of $2.1 million for the year 2016. The loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects the year-end 2017 adjustment to the Company’s Deferred Tax Asset (“DTA”) due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which resulted in a reduction in the DTA by $6.9 million. The reduction reflects the estimated amount of DTA that would not be recaptured with the new federal corporate income tax rate being reduced from 34% to 21%. Income tax increased to $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of the adjustment to the DTA. Future income taxes are expected to be reduced significantly due to the change in the federal corporate income tax rate.\nAside from the one-time DTA adjustment and its effect on income tax expense in the fourth quarter, the other major impact to 2017 earnings was the $3.1 million expense for the write-down of other real estate owned in the second quarter. While both of these one-time events negatively impacted 2017 earnings, core earnings (income before taxes and single non-recurring expense events) continued to increase each quarter in 2017.\nA positive effect to earnings was the increase to total loans by over 6% at year-end 2017 compared to year-end 2016. The Company’s loan to deposit ratio stands at 77% at year-end 2017. Loan yields increased from 4.40% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 4.52% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Average loan balances increased from $283.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $310.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Total earning assets yields increased from 3.21% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 3.55% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Average noninterest-earning assets decreased from $53.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $44.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTotal deposits increased a modest 2% at year-end 2017 compared to year-end 2016; however non-interest bearing deposits increased 15% between these two dates. Total core deposits (deposits less time and public deposits) increased 6% from year-end 2017 compared to year-end 2016. Cost of funds increased to 0.17% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 0.14% in the fourth quarter of 2016. At the Bank level, the cost of funds was 0.11% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCredit quality was negatively affected by the need to classify two substantial legacy credits in the fourth quarter of 2017. The non-performing loans increased approximately $9.0 million to $17.8 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $8.8 million at December 31, 2016. The Company was able to use unallocated reserves from the allowance for loan and lease losses to cover potential loss exposure. Other real estate owned decreased $8.2 million, or 80%, to $2.0 million at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.\n“While we were disappointed with some legacy credit issues in the fourth quarter, we were encouraged with our continued increase in demand deposits, solid loan growth and core earnings,” stated Scott Yelvington, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “We intend to continue our focus on improving credit and increasing earnings in 2018.”\nAbout Northern States Financial Corporation\nNorthern States Financial Corporation is the holding company for NorStates Bank, a full-service commercial bank with eight branches in Lake County, Illinois.
