    "text": "HAMBURG, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The A321LR, a long-range version of Airbus’s largest and newest single-aisle jet, made its maiden flight on Wednesday as the European planemaker looks to maintain its grip on a part of the market where it has been aggressively outselling rival Boeing.\nThe reconfigured version of the 185-230-seat A321neo is capable of carrying up to 240 people. It took off from Airbus’ Hamburg factory in northern Germany shortly after 11 a.m., witnesses said.\nAirbus says the jet is the world’s longest-range single-aisle aircraft, capable of flying up to 4,000 nautical miles when configured with 206 seats including lie-flat beds.
