Aker ASA, Roekke’s main listed investment vehicle, owns 50 percent of Aker Energy, while TRG, his privately held holding company, owns the remaining 50 percent. In 2017, another company in the Aker group, Aker BP , bought the Norwegian assets of Hess in a $2 billion transaction. Reporting by Terje Solsvik, editing by Louise Heavens",
