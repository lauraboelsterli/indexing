When it lifts off, the rocket, which is more powerful than any other rocket in the world and is capable of carrying 141,000 pounds of cargo on each trip, will be carrying a red Tesla Roadster. \nSpaceX’s Falcon Heavy has been in development for years and was slated for its initial launch in 2013. After a series of delays and technological challenges, however, it was delayed to 2018. While it’s possible that the launch could go well, Musk himself has acknowledged that there’s a good chance its first launch will be a failure. He’s also expressed concern that it could cause the launch pad to burn up. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nRegardless, people around the world are anxiously anticipating the Falcon Heavy’s launch .
