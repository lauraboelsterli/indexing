    "text": "WARREN, Mich., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Logistics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ULH), a leading asset-light provider of customized transportation and logistics solutions, announced today that its Board of Directors has approved an increase in the Company's annual cash dividend policy from $0.28 per share to $0.42 per share beginning in 2018. The first quarterly installment of $0.105 per share is expected to be declared after the conclusion of the first quarter of 2018. After taking into account the regular quarterly dividends made during the year, the Board of Directors also intends to evaluate declaration of an annual special dividend payable in the first quarter of each year in an effort to return up to 40% of Universal's net income from the previous fiscal year, beginning in the first quarter of 2019.\nUniversal's Board of Directors will also continue to review the dividend policy as part of our commitment to maximizing shareholder value, taking into consideration overall financial performance and market conditions. Declaration of future cash dividends is subject to final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, any legal or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.\nAbout Universal\nUniversal Logistics Holdings, Inc. is a leading asset-light provider of customized transportation and logistics solutions throughout the United States, and in Mexico, Canada and Colombia.
