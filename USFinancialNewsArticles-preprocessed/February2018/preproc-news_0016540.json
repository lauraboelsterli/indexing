    "text": "PEACHTREE CORNERS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:FLT), a leading global provider of commercial payment solutions, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“Our Q4 revenues and profits finished above our expectations, and our sales, retention, and same store customer trends were very strong. For fiscal year 2017, revenues and adjusted net income per diluted share grew 23%; while we re-positioned the company for faster growth, with the Cambridge acquisition and the Nextraq divestiture,” said Ron Clarke, chairman and chief executive officer, FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. “For 2018, we expect each of our four primary product categories – fuel, toll, lodging, corporate payments – to continue to drive our Company’s growth as we focus relentlessly on execution in order to win new clients, open up new geographies, and provide improved value over a broader range of spend categories.”\nFinancial Results for Fourth Quarter of 2017:\nGAAP Results\nTotal revenues increased 18.5% to $610.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $515.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income increased 196.3% to $282.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $95.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in the fourth quarter is the favorable estimated impact of adoption of the Tax Reform Act of $127.5 million. Also, included in the fourth quarter of 2016 were non-cash impairment charges related to the Company’s minority investment in Masternaut of approximately $36 million. Net income per diluted share increased 204.6% to $3.05 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.00 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP Results 1\nAdjusted revenues 1 (revenues, net less merchant commissions) increased 18.4% to $579.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $489.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income 1 increased 24.1% to $224.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $180.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income per diluted share 1 increased 27.6% to $2.42 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.90 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFinancial Results for Fiscal-Year 2017:\nGAAP Results\nTotal revenues increased 22.8% to $2,249.5 million in 2017 compared to $1,831.5 million in 2016. GAAP net income increased 63.6% to $740.2 million in 2017 compared to $452.4 million in 2016. Included in 2017 is the favorable estimated impact of adoption of the Tax Reform Act of $127.5 million and a gain on the sale of Nextraq of $109.2 million. GAAP net income per diluted share increased 66.5% to $7.91 in 2017 compared to $4.75 per diluted share in 2016.\nNon-GAAP Results 1\nAdjusted revenues 1 (revenues, net less merchant commissions) increased 23.7% to 2,136.4 million in 2017 compared to $1,727.2 million in 2016. Adjusted net income 1 increased 21.2% to $798.9 million in 2017 compared to $659.2 million in 2016. Adjusted net income per diluted share 1 increased 23.3% to $8.54 in 2017 compared to $6.92 in 2016.\nFiscal-Year 2018 Outlook:\n“2018 is setting up well with a number of tailwinds that we expect will help drive profits in the year. First, the macro is expected to continue to be favorable to revenue by approximately $40 million, organic growth is expected to be in the 8% to 10% range on a normalized basis, and the new tax act will drive our overall tax rate down by an estimated 5%. As a result, we are guiding adjusted net income per diluted share to $10.20 at the midpoint which represents approximately a 20% growth from prior year,” said Eric Dey, chief financial officer FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.\nFor 2018, FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. financial guidance is as follows:\nTotal revenues between $2,490 million and $2,550 million; Adjusted Revenues to be between $2,370 million and $2,430 million; GAAP net income between $690 million and $720 million; GAAP net income per diluted share between $7.40 and $7.70; Adjusted net income 1 between $935 million and $965 million; and Adjusted net income per diluted share 1 between $10.05 and $10.35.\nFLEETCOR’s guidance assumptions for 2018 are as follows:\nWeighted fuel prices equal to $2.57 per gallon average in the U.S. for those businesses sensitive to the movement in the retail price of fuel. Market spreads equal to the 2017 average. Foreign exchange rates equal to the seven-day average as of January 22, 2018. Interest expense of $125 million, which assumes two additional twenty-five basis point increases in 2018. Fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 93.3 million shares. A tax rate of 22 to 24%. No impact for ASC 606, as we are still completing our analysis. No impact related to acquisitions or material new partnership agreements not already disclosed.\nFiscal First Quarter of 2018 Outlook:\nFor those of you that are looking for guidance for the first quarter, the business has some seasonality and typically the first quarter is the lowest in terms of both revenue and profit. First quarter seasonality is impacted by weather, holidays in the U.S., and lower business levels in Brazil, due to summer break and the Carnival celebration that occurs in the first quarter.\nWith that said, the Company is expecting first quarter adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $2.30 and $2.40 1 . Additionally, volumes should build throughout the year, and new asset initiatives are also expected to gain momentum throughout the year resulting in higher revenue and earnings per share in the second through fourth quarters.\n1 Reconciliations of GAAP results to non-GAAP results are provided in Exhibit 1 attached. Additional supplemental data is provided in Exhibit 2-3 and 5, and segment information is provided in Exhibit 4. A reconciliation of GAAP guidance to non-GAAP guidance is provided in Exhibit 6.

Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about FLEETCOR's beliefs, expectations and future performance, are . Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"seek,\" \"project,\" \"expect,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could\" or \"should,\" the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Examples of in this press release include statements relating to macro- economic conditions, expected organic growth rates, impact of the new tax act, and estimated impact of these conditions on our operations and financial results, expected timing of acquisitions and dispositions, revenue and earnings guidance and assumptions underlying financial guidance. These are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual those contained in any forward-looking statement, such as fuel price and spread volatility; the impact of foreign exchange rates on operations, revenue and income; the effects of general economic conditions on fueling patterns and the commercial activity of fleets; changes in credit risk of customers and associated losses; the actions of regulators relating to payment cards or resulting from investigations; failure to maintain or renew key business relationships; failure to maintain competitive offerings; failure to maintain or renew sources of financing; failure to complete, or delays in completing, anticipated new customer arrangements or acquisitions and the failure to successfully integrate or otherwise achieve anticipated benefits from such customer arrangements or acquired businesses; failure to successfully expand business internationally, risks related to litigation, as well as the other risks and uncertainties identified under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in FLEETCOR's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2017, and quarterly reports on form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30 and September 30, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 8, 2017 and November 9, 2017, respectively. FLEETCOR believes these are reasonable; however, are not a guarantee of performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. The included in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and FLEETCOR does not undertake, and specifically disclaims, any obligation to update any such statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of such statements to reflect future events or developments.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted revenue is calculated as revenues less merchant commissions. Adjusted net income is calculated as net income, adjusted to eliminate (a) non-cash stock based compensation expense related to share based compensation awards, (b) amortization of deferred financing costs, discounts and intangible assets, amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables, and our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment, (c) a non-recurring net gain at our equity method investment, (d) impairment of our equity method investment, (e) net gain on disposition of business, (f) loss on early extinguishment of debt and, (g) other non-recurring items, including the impact of the Tax Reform Act. The Company uses adjusted revenue as a basis to evaluate the Company’s revenues, net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs. The commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate. The Company believes this is a more effective way to evaluate the Company’s revenue performance. We calculate adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted revenues and adjusted net income are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to revenues, net income or cash flow from operations, as determined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance. We also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets, their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired; therefore, we have excluded amortization expense from our adjusted net income. We also believe one-time non-recurring gains, losses, and impairment charges do not necessarily reflect how our investments and business are performing. Reconciliations of GAAP results to non-GAAP results are provided in the attached exhibit 1. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP product revenue organic growth calculation is provided in the attached exhibit 5. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP guidance is provided in the attached exhibit 6.\nManagement uses adjusted revenues and adjusted net income:\nas measurements of operating performance because they assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis; for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; and to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies.\nWe believe adjusted revenues, adjusted net income, and adjusted net income per diluted share are key measures used by the Company and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry. By providing these non-GAAP financial measures, together with reconciliations, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing strategic initiatives.\nAbout FLEETCOR\nFLEETCOR Technologies (NYSE: FLT) is a leading global provider of commercial payment solutions.
