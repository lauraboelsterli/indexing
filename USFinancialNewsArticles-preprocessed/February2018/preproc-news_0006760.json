    "text": "Tech Guide North Korea may be behind Japanese cryptocurrency heist, South Korea spy agency reportedly warns South Korea's national spy agency told a parliamentary committee it was possible North Korean hackers broke into a cryptocurrency exchange in Japan to steal $520 million worth of digital coins, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Published 20 Hours Ago Updated 19 Hours Ago Reuters \nSouth Korea's national spy agency told a parliamentary committee it was possible North Korean hackers broke into a cryptocurrency exchange in Japan to steal $520 million worth of digital coins, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. \n\"It's a possibility that North Korea be behind the theft,\" the person, who had knowledge of Intelligence Committee proceedings, told Reuters. \nThe person, who declined to be named due to sensitivity of the issue, added the virtual coin market remains a likely target for North Korean hackers due to its sheer size and light regulation but that there was no hard evidence that North Koreans were behind the theft. \nJapan's cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck was raided on Friday to fix flaws in its computer networks well before hackers stole $530 million of digital money in January.
