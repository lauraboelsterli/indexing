We will continue to pursue retail drugstore growth in Hangzhou as we continue to build strong relationships with our customers, suppliers, and other business partners in one of the highest income urban centers in China.

The increase was primarily due to the increased number of stores, more choices of commodity at lower prices through frequent price negotiation with suppliers, brand-name health product sales campaign in cooperation with brand name suppliers, and value-added customer services such as chronic disease monitoring.\nRevenue from the online pharmacy segment decreased by $0.04 million, or 1.2%, to $3.40 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $3.44 million for the same period of last year. The decrease was mainly caused by a decline in our sales via e-commerce platforms. The decline in sales was due to the suspension of OTC drug sales on e-commerce platforms in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 by the CFDA. The Company is adding more non-medical health products such as nutritional supplements into our sales menu to counteract the decline in sales of OTC drug category via e-commerce platforms.\nRevenue from the wholesale segment increased by $2.08 million, or 68.1%, to $5.13 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $3.05 million for the same period of last year.

This compared to gross margins for retail drugstores, online pharmacy and wholesale of 25.7%, 10.4%, and 6.5%, respectively, for the same period of last year.\nOperating income (loss)\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $1.45 million, or 40.6%, to $5.02 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $3.57 million for the same period of last year, primarily due to commissions payable to wholesale contractors, rent and expenditures for new retail stores, and the reclassification of certain staff salaries to selling and marketing expenses in the wholesale business.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.29 million, or 88.6%, to $2.74 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $1.45 million for the same period of last year.
