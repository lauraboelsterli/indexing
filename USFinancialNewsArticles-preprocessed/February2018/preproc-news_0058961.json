    "text": "SAN CLEMENTE, Calif., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CareTrust REIT, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE) reported today operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, as well as other recent events.\nDuring the quarter, CareTrust REIT:\nPosted net income of $0.03, normalized FFO of $0.31, an increase of 11% over Q4 2016, and normalized FAD of $0.32, an increase of 10% over Q4 2016, all per diluted weighted-average common share;\nInvested approximately $153 million (inclusive of transaction costs) at a blended initial cash yield of 9%, acquiring 11 skilled nursing facilities and three assisted living and memory care facilities, and providing one mortgage financing;\nFinished the year with a debt-to-normalized EBITDA ratio of 4.6x and a debt-to-enterprise value of 31%, each as of quarter-end; and\nMet its normalized FFO guidance of $1.16 per diluted weighted-average common share for the year.\nRecord Year\nGreg Stapley, CareTrust REIT’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, noted that 2017 was a record year for the Company. “We were able to complete a record $308 million in new acquisitions in 2017, and have already added to that tally since year end,” he said. He also noted that the Company increased its dividend again, while keeping the dividend well-covered and preserving capital for growth, with one of the most conservative payout ratios in the peer group. He also alluded to robust demand for both the Company’s debt and equity, with $174 million in new equity sold through CareTrust REIT’s at-the-market program, and a new $300 million, 8-year bond issue during the year. “With these tools, we were able to strengthen our balance sheet and finish the year with our debt-to-normalized EBITDA ratio of 4.6x and plenty of liquidity, setting us up for a solid start to 2018,” he added.\nFinancial Results for Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2017\nChief Financial Officer Bill Wagner reported that for the fourth quarter, CareTrust REIT generated net income of $2.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted weighted-average common share, normalized FFO of $23.6 million, or $0.31 per diluted weighted-average common share, and normalized FAD of $24.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted weighted-average common share. He noted that net income for the quarter was reduced by a $10.4 million reserve taken by the Company with respect to certain accounts receivable related to one tenant. “We are pleased to be delivering a quarter-over-quarter increase in normalized FFO per share of 11%,” said Mr. Wagner.\nFor the full year 2017, Mr. Wagner reported that CareTrust REIT generated net income of $25.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted weighted-average common share, normalized FFO of $84.6 million or $1.16 per diluted weighted-average common share, and normalized FAD of $88.8 million or $1.22 per diluted weighted-average common share.\nLiquidity\nDiscussing CareTrust REIT’s investments and current liquidity, Mr. Wagner reported that the $153 million in new investments in the quarter were funded with a combination of cash on hand and approximately $135 million in draws on the Company’s $400 million unsecured revolver. He noted that the revolving credit facility includes a $250 million “accordion” feature that can be exercised by the Company at its option to increase liquidity, and as of today, $185 million is drawn on the line.\nHe also reported that there had been no activity in the quarter on the Company’s at-the-market equity program but, he added, “Our ATM program remains a significant instrument in the Company’s capital-raising repertoire, with up to $236 million remaining in authorization at present.” Mr. Wagner further reported that CareTrust REIT’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.6x and its debt-to-enterprise value was 31%, each at quarter-end, which is well within management’s target leverage range. He also noted that CareTrust REIT continues to have no property-level debt and, taking into account existing extension rights, no debt maturing before 2020.\n2018 Guidance Revised Upward\nMr. Wagner provided CareTrust REIT's 2018 earnings guidance, projecting on a per-diluted weighted-average common share basis, net income of approximately $0.67 to $0.69, normalized FFO of approximately $1.25 to $1.27, and normalized FAD of approximately $1.31 to $1.33. He noted that the updated 2018 guidance is based on a per-diluted weighted-average common share count of 75.9 million shares and assumes no new acquisitions beyond those made to date, no new debt incurrences or new equity issuances, and 2.0% CPI-based rent escalators under CareTrust REIT's long-term net leases.\nDividend Declared\nDuring the quarter, CareTrust REIT declared a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per common share. “On an annualized basis, our quarterly dividend represents a payout ratio of approximately 59.7% based on the fourth quarter 2017 normalized FFO, and 57.8% on normalized FAD,” said Mr. Wagner. “At this level, our dividend remains among the best-protected of all our industry peers, while simultaneously providing additional growth capital for reinvestment and a solid overall return to our shareholders,” he added.\nPristine Transition and Reserve\nUpdating recent news regarding changes to its ongoing landlord-tenant relationship with affiliates of Pristine Senior Living, LLC, Mr. Stapley reported that the planned transition of seven Ohio facilities from Pristine to affiliates of Trillium Healthcare LLC, another CareTrust REIT tenant, had been successfully completed on December 1, 2017. “We are pleased to report a smooth transition, and improved operating results in Trillium’s first month of operations,” said Mr. Stapley. The transition was effectuated under a November 2, 2017 amendment to Pristine’s master lease which reduced Pristine’s rent and allowed Pristine to continue operating nine CareTrust REIT facilities.\nWhile the lease amendment was expected to afford Pristine an opportunity to focus on a smaller set of better-performing operations and meet its ongoing lease obligations, Pristine has continued to report cash shortfalls that have prevented it from doing so. Although Pristine has paid $4.4 million of the $4.9 million in base rent due since the lease amendment was executed in November, Pristine has not made $2.3 million of additional payments required under the Lease. Mr. Stapley reported that, accordingly, on February 27, 2018 Pristine and CareTrust REIT entered into a Lease Termination Agreement under which Pristine and its affiliates will surrender its remaining CareTrust REIT facilities to operators selected by CareTrust REIT, in transactions similar to those effected in December 2017.\nUnder the Agreement, Pristine will continue to operate the facilities and pay the scheduled base rent until the transitions occur. Mr. Wagner noted that, as a result of the agreement, the Company will recognize Pristine’s rental revenues on a cash basis, and reserve approximately $10.4 million of incurred and anticipated obligations of Pristine. He noted that the reserve consists of $6.3 million in property tax reimbursements and advances of 2016 and 2017 franchise permit fees made in 2017, $3.3 million of 2017 property tax reimbursements and franchise permit fees due in 2018, and $0.8 million of unpaid base rent from September 2017.\nUpon Pristine’s performance of the terms of the agreement, CareTrust REIT will terminate the Lease and Pristine’s future obligations thereunder. Mr. Stapley further noted that CareTrust REIT has a security interest in Pristine’s outstanding accounts receivable, which it shares with Pristine’s working capital lender pursuant to an intercreditor agreement, and which secure Pristine’s ongoing obligations under the Lease.\nConference Call\nA conference call will be held on Wednesday, February 28, 2018, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Pacific Time), during which CareTrust REIT’s management will discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results, recent developments and other matters.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NET INCOME TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (shares in thousands) (unaudited) 2018 Guidance Low High Net income $ 0.67 $ 0.69 Real estate related depreciation and amortization 0.58 0.58 Funds from Operations (FFO) 1.25 1.27 Normalized FFO $ 1.25 $ 1.27 Net income $ 0.67 $ 0.69 Real estate related depreciation and amortization 0.58 0.58 Amortization of deferred financing fees 0.03 0.03 Amortization of stock-based compensation 0.05 0.05 Straight-line rental income (0.02 ) (0.02 ) Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) 1.31 1.33 Normalized FAD $ 1.31 $ 1.33 Weighted average shares outstanding: Diluted 75,916 75,916\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA represents net income before interest expense (including amortization of deferred financing costs), amortization of stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization. Normalized EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of core operating performance, such as real estate impairment charges, expensed acquisition costs, certain deferred preferred return, losses on the extinguishment of debt, reserve for advances and deferred rent and gains or losses from dispositions of real estate or other real estate. EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating performance. EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund future cash requirements, including the Company’s ability to fund capital expenditures or make payments on its indebtedness. Further, the Company’s computation of EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA reported by other REITs.\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), and Funds Available for Distribution (“FAD”) are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP.\nFFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from dispositions of real estate or other real estate, real estate depreciation and amortization and real estate impairment charges, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company computes FFO in accordance with NAREIT’s definition.\nFAD is defined as FFO excluding non-cash income and expenses, such as amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of deferred financing costs and the effects of straight-line rent. The Company considers FAD to be a useful supplemental measure to evaluate the Company’s operating results excluding these income and expense items to help investors, analysts and other interested parties compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other companies on a more consistent basis.\nIn addition, the Company reports normalized FFO and normalized FAD, which adjust FFO and FAD for certain revenue and expense items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its ongoing operating results, such as written-off deferred financing fees, expensed acquisition costs, certain preferred returns, the effect of the senior unsecured notes payable redemption and other unanticipated charges. By excluding these items, investors, analysts and our management can compare normalized FFO and normalized FAD between periods more consistently.\nWhile FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD are relevant and widely-used measures of operating performance among REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating performance. FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund future cash requirements.\nFurther, the Company’s computation of FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD may not be comparable to FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define FAD differently than the Company does.\nThe Company believes that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company also believes that the use of EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA, FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. The Company considers EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA useful in understanding the Company’s operating results independent of its capital structure, indebtedness and non-recurring charges, thereby allowing for a more meaningful comparison of operating performance between periods and against other REITs. The Company considers FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, impairment charges and real estate depreciation and amortization, and, for FAD and normalized FAD, by excluding non-cash income and expenses such as amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of deferred financing costs, and the effects of straight-line rent, FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD can help investors compare the Company’s operating performance between periods and to other REITs.\nSource:CareTrust REIT, Inc.",
