    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) (\"Qualcomm\") today announced that Qualcomm River Holdings B.V., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm, has reached an agreement with NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI) to increase to $127.50 per share its previously announced cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of NXP. The amended agreement, which was approved by the Qualcomm and NXP Boards of Directors, also lowers the minimum tender condition from 80% of NXP's outstanding shares to 70%.\nQualcomm also announced that Qualcomm River Holdings B.V. has entered into binding agreements with nine NXP stockholders who collectively own more than 28% of NXP's outstanding shares (excluding additional economic interests through derivatives) to tender their shares at $127.50 per share. These stockholders include funds affiliated with Elliott Advisors (UK) Limited and Soroban Capital Partners LP.\nThe revised price reflects enhanced current value drivers for NXP, including:\nNXP's recent performance , including calendar 2017 results that exceeded Qualcomm's transaction model on revenue, gross margin and EBIT. NXP's non-GAAP operating income (excluding Standard Products) increased 20% from calendar 2016 to 2017. Strong market dynamics and positive outlook for key segments. NXP's Auto business has increased revenues by 11% year over year. Qualcomm has also significantly improved its own capabilities in key industry segments such as Auto ($3 billion revenue pipeline), IoT ($1 billion in FY17 sales) and Networking, further enhancing the value proposition of the combined company to its customers and stockholders. High confidence in annualized cost synergies of at least $500 million resulting from insights gathered during the integration planning process.\nSteve Mollenkopf, Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm Incorporated, said, \"Qualcomm's leading SoC capabilities and technology roadmap, coupled with NXP's differentiated position in Automotive, Security and IoT, offers a compelling value proposition. We remain highly confident in our fiscal 2019 Non-GAAP EPS target of $6.75-$7.50, which includes $1.50 per share accretion from the acquisition of NXP. With only one regulatory approval remaining, we are working hard to complete this transaction expeditiously. Our integration planning is on track and we expect to realize the full benefits of this transaction for our customers, employees and stockholders.\"\nTom Horton, Presiding Director of the Qualcomm Board of Directors, said, \"The acquisition of NXP will enable us to accelerate our growth strategy. The Board unanimously believes this is an attractive acquisition at this price for Qualcomm stockholders based on NXP's recent strong financial performance, the growth in key strategic areas such as Auto and IoT and our high confidence in management's ability to execute upon the synergy opportunities.\"\nDr. Paul E. Jacobs, Chairman of the Board of Qualcomm, said, \"NXP is a highly strategic and attractive acquisition for Qualcomm that enhances the value of our leading 5G technologies. We also believe the revised agreement provides certainty for both Qualcomm and NXP stockholders.\"\nTransaction Details\nUnder the terms of the revised agreement, the currently pending tender offer of Qualcomm River Holdings B.V. to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of NXP will be amended as described above and the expiration time for the offer will be extended to the end of day, one minute after 11:59 p.m. New York City time, on March 5, 2018.\nQualcomm intends to fund the additional consideration with cash on hand and new debt. The amended tender offer is not subject to any financing condition. The offer is conditioned on at least 70% of the outstanding ordinary shares of NXP being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer (including any extensions). The updated offer will be described in more detail in an amendment to the Schedule TO filed by Qualcomm River Holdings B.V. and an amendment to the solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 to be filed by NXP.\nQualcomm's acquisition of NXP has received antitrust clearance from eight of the nine required government regulatory bodies around the world. The transaction remains contingent on clearance from the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) in China. Qualcomm is optimistic it will receive MOFCOM clearance in the near term.\nA presentation regarding today's announcement can be found here .\nAbout Qualcomm\nQualcomm invents breakthrough technologies that transform how the world connects and communicates.

Qualcomm is not obligated to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates.\nNOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, \"Non- GAAP\" is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP results are presented herein.\nThe Company uses Non-GAAP financial information: (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against competitors. Non-GAAP measurements used by the Company include revenues, cost of revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, other income or expenses, operating income, interest expense, net investment and other income, income or earnings before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share. The Company is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP information. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors uses certain Non-GAAP financial measures in establishing portions of the performance-based incentive compensation programs for our executive officers. The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to its use of such information in financial and operational decision-making. This Non-GAAP financial information is also used by institutional investors and analysts in evaluating the Company's business and assessing trends and future expectations.\nNon-GAAP information used by management excludes its QSI segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items.\nQSI is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments in the foreseeable future, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation expense primarily relates to restricted stock units. Management believes that excluding non-cash share-based compensation from the Non-GAAP financial information allows management and investors to make additional comparisons of the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses over time and with respect to other companies. Certain other items are excluded because management views such items as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses, as follows: Acquisition-related items include amortization of certain intangible assets, recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and the related tax effects of these items, as well as any effects from restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. Additionally, the Company excludes expenses related to the termination of contracts that limit the use of the acquired intellectual property, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and costs related to temporary debt facilities and letters of credit executed prior to the close of an acquisition. Starting with acquisitions in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company excludes recognition of the step-up of property, plant and equipment from the net book value based on the original cost basis to fair value. Such charges related to acquisitions that were completed prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 continue to be allocated to the segments, and such amounts are not material. The Company excludes certain other items that management views as unrelated to the Company's ongoing business, such as major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, goodwill and indefinite- and long-lived asset impairments and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. Certain tax items that are unrelated to the fiscal year in which they are recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after tax earnings.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nQualcomm Fiscal 2019 Estimated Earnings Per Share (EPS)\nFiscal 2019\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$4.47 - $5.22\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to QSI\n$0.02\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to share-based compensation\n($0.73)\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to other items (1)\n($1.57)\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS\n$6.75 - $7.50\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to income from customers involved in licensing disputes\n$1.50 - $2.25\nNon-GAAP EPS, before impact of expected licensing resolution\n$5.25\nFiscal 2019 Accretion from NXP\nFiscal 2019\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$0.08\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to QSI\nN/A\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to share-based compensation\n($0.16)\nLess: Diluted EPS attributable to other items (1)\n($1.26)\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS\n$1.50\nFiscal 2019 estimated EPS and EPS accretion assume close of the pending NXP acquisition. Estimated amortization of intangible assets included in other items was based on a preliminary purchase price and are subject to change when the formal valuation and other studies are finalized. The differences that will occur between the preliminary estimates and the final purchase accounting could be material.\n(1) Other items excluded from Non-GAAP consist primarily of acquisition-related items.\nSums may not equal totals due to rounding\nQualcomm Contacts:\nPete Lancia, Corporate Communications\nPhone: 1-858-845-5959\nEmail: corpcomm@qualcomm.com\nJohn Sinnott, Investor Relations\nPhone: 1-858-658-5431\nEmail: ir@qualcomm.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qualcomm-enters-into-amended-definitive-agreement-with-nxp-300601053.html\nSOURCE Qualcomm Incorporated",
