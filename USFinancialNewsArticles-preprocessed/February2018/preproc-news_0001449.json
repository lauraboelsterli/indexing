    "text": "DUNMORE, Pa., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fidelity D & D Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:FDBC) and its banking subsidiary Fidelity Deposit and Discount Bank, announced net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $8.7 million, or $2.33 diluted earnings per share, compared to $7.7 million, or $2.09 diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $1.0 million, or 13%, improvement resulted from $2.7 million higher net interest income combined with $0.4 million more non-interest income and a $1.5 million reduction in the provision for income taxes, partially offset by $3.2 million higher operating expenses and a $0.4 million increase in the provision for loan losses. The Company experienced $80.5 million, or 6%, growth in average interest-earning assets funded by $47.3 million growth in average deposits, $35.4 million growth in average borrowings and $4.5 million growth in average shareholders’ equity. Return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 1.03% and 10.34%, respectively, for 2017 and 1.02% and 9.64%, respectively, for 2016.\n“The fourth quarter wraps up another year of record performance for the Company,” stated Daniel J. Santaniello, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The Fidelity Bankers continue to deliver quality and consistent results producing long term shareholder value, as evidenced by the significant increase in the Company’s market capitalization. In 2017, loans, deposits, non-interest income and capital show strong growth. For the fourth consecutive year, our annual return of capital to our shareholders was greater than the prior year. I am very proud of the strong commitment shown by the Fidelity Bankers as they focus on helping our clients achieve financial success.”\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net income increased $0.3 million, or 15%, to $2.3 million from $2.0 million for the same 2016 quarter. The Company’s quarterly and annual earnings were positively impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) which was signed into law in December 2017. The Tax Act lowered the Company’s federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, from the previous rate of 34%. Fourth quarter and annual 2017 net income includes a reduction in income tax expense related to an adjustment to lower the carrying value of the net deferred tax liability by $1.1 million to reflect the change in tax rate. For the fourth quarter of 2017, there was a decrease of $1.6 million in the provision for income taxes due to this $1.1 million net deferred tax liability adjustment and $0.5 million from lower taxable income compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company experienced growth of $0.6 million in net interest income. These additions to earnings were partially offset by $1.5 million higher operating expenses, $0.3 million less non-interest income and $0.1 million increase in the provision for loan losses. Earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.61 and $0.55 for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. ROA and ROE were 1.07% and 10.61%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1.06% and 9.92%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company utilized a few tax strategies at the end of 2017 in response to the passage of the Tax Act’s realized benefits that increased non-interest expenses and decreased non-interest income. These strategies included donating $0.5 million to Fidelity D & D Charitable Foundation, providing $0.2 million in one-time year-end bonuses to certain employees, selling securities at a $0.1 million loss and the $0.3 million early payoff of the lease of former branch property and abandonment of leasehold improvements. An additional tax strategy benefit included charging-off $0.6 million in loans with specifically identified bad debt losses.\nOn August 15, 2017, the Company declared a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend on its common stock outstanding to shareholders of record as of September 18, 2017 and distributed on September 28, 2017. All share and per share information included in this earnings release for all periods has been retroactively adjusted to reflect this stock split.\nFourth Quarter Operating Results Overview\nNet interest income was $7.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a $0.6 million, or 10%, increase over the $6.4 million earned for the fourth quarter of 2016. The net interest income growth resulted from an $84.5 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets and a one basis point higher yield earned thereon which increased interest income by $0.9 million for 2017. Average quarterly balances of $268.9 million in floating loans benefited from 75 basis points in short-term rate increases by the Federal Reserve since the fourth quarter of 2016, and mitigated the effect of lower yields earned on indirect consumer loans which experienced the most growth in the loan portfolio. The investment portfolio benefited from the Company investing in $23.6 million more, on average, mortgage backed securities which caused the yield on investment securities to increase by eight basis points. Partially offsetting the increase in interest income, interest expense increased $0.3 million as the average balance of interest-bearing deposits and average borrowings increased $57.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. The rate paid on these higher balances of interest bearing liabilities increased 12 basis points which resulted in lower fully tax-equivalent interest rate spread of 3.50% and margin of 3.65%.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $0.1 million to $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in the provision was primarily due to an increase in the number of loans and trending risks associated with certain macroeconomic and other business factors. These factors include a trend of decreasing fair market values in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre urban real estate markets and the various potential regulatory and other impacts associated with the Company's growing asset size.\nTotal other income was $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The $0.3 million, or 14%, decrease in other income was primarily due to $0.2 million lower gains on loan sales, a $0.2 million loss on the abandonment of leasehold improvements, a $0.1 million loss realized on the sale of securities and $0.1 million less fee income on loans. These decreases were partially offset by $0.1 million higher trust fees, $0.1 million higher earnings on bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) and a $0.1 million increase in interchange fees.\nOther expenses increased $1.5 million, or 27%, for the fourth quarter of 2017 to $7.0 million from $5.5 million for the same 2016 quarter. The increase was primarily due to $0.6 million higher salaries and benefits expenses due to $0.2 million in year-end bonuses paid and $0.1 million in additional incentive compensation accruals, $0.2 million in salary increases and $0.1 million in expenses related to a post-retirement benefit plan implemented during the first quarter of 2017. Items that contributed to the increase in other expenses were $0.4 million more advertising and marketing expenses resulting from the donation to the foundation, $0.1 million in premises and equipment from early termination of a leased property, $0.1 million higher professional fees incurred and $0.1 million in additional data processing and communication costs.\nThe provision for income taxes decreased $1.6 million from $0.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 to a credit of $0.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.1 million deferred tax adjustment made in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the Tax Act. The Company also had lower taxable income from tax strategies deployed in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nConsolidated Year-To-Date Operating Results Overview\nNet interest income was $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $2.7 million, or 11%, improvement was the result of earnings from a higher average balance of interest-earning assets which offset higher interest expense on larger average borrowings and interest-bearing deposits. The loan portfolio caused the largest impact producing $2.6 million more in interest income from $62.0 million in higher average loan balances. The investment portfolio also contributed $1.2 million in additional fully-taxable equivalent earnings from a $27.0 million larger average balance of twenty-two basis point higher-yielding securities. On the liability side, $66.5 million in additional interest-bearing liabilities resulted in $0.9 million higher interest expense. A rising short-term interest rate environment caused the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities to increase faster than the yields earned on interest earning assets. As a result, net interest spread was 3.56% for 2017, or three basis points lower than the 3.59% recorded for 2016. The Company’s net interest margin decreased by two basis points to 3.70% for 2017 from 3.72% for 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for loan losses was $1.4 million compared to $1.0 million for the same 2016 period. The $0.4 million increase in the provision was due to loan growth and certain macroeconomic and other business factors. These factors included the impact of rising interest rates on commercial real estate values; higher default rates and decreasing fair market values of Scranton/Wilkes-Barre urban residential real estate; and various potential regulatory and other impacts associated with the Company’s growing asset size.\nTotal other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.4 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 5%, from $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other income was comprised of the following: $0.3 million in trust income, $0.2 million earnings on BOLI, $0.2 million in interchange fees, $0.1 million deposit service charges, $0.1 million fees and other revenue. These increases were partially offset by an additional $0.2 million in losses on the sale of securities, $0.2 million in losses on the abandonment of premises and equipment, $0.1 million less service charges on loans and $0.1 million less gains from loan sales. The increase in trust income was primarily the result of the planned assumption of the trust accounts of another bank and the higher earnings from bank-owned life insurance were due to the purchase of additional BOLI, both occurring earlier this year. Interchange fees increased $0.1 million from customer debit card transactions and $0.1 million from added merchant customers. Deposit service charges increased as customer overdraft charges for 2017 outpaced 2016.\nOther expenses increased to $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.2 million from $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The largest driver of this increase was a $1.5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense due primarily to $0.6 million increased salaries with eight more full-time equivalent employees, $0.4 million in additional incentive compensation and $0.4 million in expenses from the post-retirement benefit plan. Further expenses that contributed to the increase in other expenses were: $0.3 million increase in premises and equipment expense, $0.6 million more advertising and marketing expense, $0.3 million in additional professional services expenses, a $0.3 million increase in data processing expense and $0.1 million increase in automated transaction processing expense. These increases were partially offset by a $0.1 million lower FDIC assessment and $0.1 million less PA shares tax expense.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet & Asset Quality Overview\nThe Company’s total assets increased approximately $70.7 million, or 9%, to $863.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $792.9 million at December 31, 2016. This asset growth resulted primarily from $40.0 million net growth in the loan portfolio, a $27.3 million increase in securities and an additional $8.6 million of bank owned life insurance. Asset growth was mostly funded by $26.7 million increase in deposits, with additional funding provided by $21.2 million in FHLB advances, $14.3 million in additional short-term borrowings and $6.8 million higher shareholders' equity. The Company continued to focus on increasing assets using its relationship management strategy to grow loans and deposits and achieve profitable returns.\nTotal non-performing assets were $6.3 million, or 0.73% of total assets, at December 31, 2017 compared to $10.5 million, or 1.33% of total assets, at December 31, 2016. This $4.2 million decrease in non-performing assets was due to improving asset quality and the payoff of one commercial real estate loan on non-accrual status during the third quarter of 2017. The improving asset quality during 2017 supported a decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans which fell to 1.44% at December 31, 2017 compared to 1.57% at December 31, 2016. Despite the improving asset quality, net charge-offs to average total loans increased to 0.26% at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.21% at December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company charged-off $0.6 million to reduce the balance of certain impaired loans down to the fair market value of their underlying collateral.\nShareholders’ equity increased $6.8 million, or 8%, to $87.4 million at December 31, 2017 from $80.6 million at December 31, 2016 due principally from $8.7 million in net income and a $0.1 million, after tax, improvement in net unrealized gains from the investment portfolio. An additional $1.2 million was recorded from issuance of common stock under the Company’s stock plans and stock based compensation expense from these plans, partially offset by $3.3 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders. The Company remains well capitalized and is positioned for continued growth with total shareholders’ equity at 10.12% of total assets at December 31, 2017. Book value per share was $23.40 at December 31, 2017 compared to $21.91 at December 31, 2016.\nFidelity D & D Bancorp, Inc. has built a strong history as trusted financial advisors to the customers served by The Fidelity Deposit and Discount Bank, and is proud to be an active member of the community of Northeastern Pennsylvania.
