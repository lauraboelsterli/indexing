Spurs moved to within two points of the pair on 48. \nPep Guardiola’s all-conquering City took their tally of goals in all competitions this season to 100 when the outstanding De Bruyne, who had provided a superb first-half assist for Fernandinho to shoot home, scored their second. \nFrenchman Laporte, signed from Athletic Bilbao for a City club record of 57 million pounds on Tuesday, slotted into their defence comfortably. \nHis debut left Guardiola enthusing: “Yesterday he made the first training session but today we saw how good he is. He made an amazing, amazing performance.” \nThe match of the night at Wembley, though, played in front of a record crowd for a Premier League game of 81,978, proved a disappointing one for Jose Mourinho as his own major signing Alexis Sanchez failed to shine after United had conceded a “ridiculous” early goal. \nEriksen cashed in with a neat finish after Spurs had launched a long ball straight from kickoff that was flicked on by Harry Kane and Dele Alli.   Manchester City vs West Bromwich Albion - Etihad Stadium, Manchester,   Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte gestures Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff THIRD FASTEST \nTimed at just under 11 seconds, it equalled the third fastest goal scored in the Premier League era after the 10-second efforts netted by former Spurs favourite Ledley King and Newcastle United’s Alan Shearer. \nWhen Phil Jones, who was bullied by Kane for the first goal, hammered the ball clumsily into his own net when trying to clear from Kieran Trippier’s cross midway through the first half, Mourinho conceded that the own goal “mentally killed us”. Slideshow (3 Images) \n“After 10 seconds, we made a ridiculous mistake,” Mourinho told reporters. “My players have watched the Tottenham kickoff many, many times. It was a really, really bad goal.” \nAntonio Conte suffered one of his worst Premier League defeats at Chelsea after three second-half goals in the space of 16 minutes from Callum Wilson, Junior Stanislas and Nathan Ake earned Eddie Howe his best top-flight win with the Cherries. \n“We have to accept it’s a bad result and understand that we have to fight this season,” Conte told the BBC. \nWest Brom’s defeat left them rooted at the foot of the table while Southampton also remain in the bottom three despite largely dominating while coming from behind to earn a 1-1 draw at home to fellow strugglers Brighton & Hove Albion. \nBrighton are just a point above the relegation zone alongside Newcastle, who have now not won a home league match in eight attempts after goalkeeper Karl Darlow’s 85th-minute own goal earned Burnley a 1-1 draw at St James’ Park. \nStoke City’s goalless draw with Watford also left them alongside Newcastle and Brighton, just four points ahead of West Brom. \nPerformance of the night came from Everton new boy Theo Walcott, who scored his first two goals since signing from Arsenal in the 2-1 victory over Leicester City.
