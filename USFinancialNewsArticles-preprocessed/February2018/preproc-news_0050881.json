    "text": "* Dollar steadies against other leading currencies\n* U.S. oil production has surged past 10 million bpd\n* Ongoing OPEC-led output cuts provide some support (Updates prices)\nSINGAPORE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, weighed down by a rebound in the U.S. dollar from three-year lows hit last week and by an expected rise in U.S. crude production.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.19 a barrel at 0755 GMT, down 60 cents, or 1 percent, from their last settlement.\nBrent crude futures fell 48 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last close to $64.77 per barrel.\nWang Tao, Reuters technical commodity analyst, said Brent could fall into a range of $63.92 to $64.41 per barrel, as suggested by its wave pattern and a projection analysis.\nTraders said the declines were driven by a recovery in the dollar, which potentially hits fuel demand as it makes greenback-denominated oil imports more expensive for countries using other currencies.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose for a second day on Wednesday, moving further away from the three-year lows reached last week.\n\"The U.S. dollar continues to find firmer footing,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore.\nAlso pressuring prices is surging U.S. production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, now the world's second-largest oil stream at more than 10 million barrels per day (bpd), only slightly behind Russia and ahead of top exporter Saudi Arabia.\n\"Bulging U.S. production will weigh on prices,\" said Singapore-based Phillip Futures in a note on Wednesday.\nThe next set of weekly U.S. oil production data is due to be published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Thursday after a one-day delay because of the President's Day holiday on Monday.\nThat data will also include U.S. inventory figures that are expected to show crude oil stockpiles rose 1.3 million barrels in the week to Feb. 16, according to a Reuters poll. Oil product stockpiles, including gasoline and distillate fuels, are all expected to decline.\nDespite the rising U.S. output, overall oil markets remain well supported due to healthy demand growth and supply restraint by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that started last year to draw down excess global inventories.\n\"A roughly balanced market is anticipated in calendar year 2018, with the risks around that view tilted towards surplus,\" mining and energy giant BHP said in its economic and commodity outlook for the year, published this week.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Tom Hogue)",
