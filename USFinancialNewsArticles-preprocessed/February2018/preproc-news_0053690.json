    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering a hike in the gasoline tax, but no decision has been made, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Friday.\n“We haven’t had an increase in the gas tax in a long time. It’s one of the things that we’re looking at,” Mnuchin said in response to a question about a possible 25 cent hike in the tax. He added officials “haven’t made any decision.”\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by\n ",
