For definitions and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, please refer to Exhibit II at the end of this press release.\nCEO Statement\nPaul Wogan, Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"GasLog posted another strong quarter, achieving record quarterly and annual results for revenues and EBITDA due to improved earnings from our spot fleet and a strong uptime performance from our ships on charter, including our 2016 newbuild deliveries. We recently took delivery of the GasLog Houston, our first on the water vessel with LP-2S propulsion, and immediately placed her on a short-term charter with a major LNG producer.\nThe 2017-2018 winter saw a significant increase in demand for LNG. In particular, China's demand exceeded expectations as a result of cold weather and changes in energy and environmental policy. This strong demand from Asia pulled in LNG supply from multiple sources including the U.S., resulting in a significant tightening in the LNG shipping market which led to spot rates reaching multi-year highs. While we may see a seasonal moderation in spot rates as we exit the Northern Hemisphere winter, GasLog remains well positioned to benefit from the anticipated longer term market recovery through our five vessels currently trading in the spot market through the Cool Pool Limited (the \"Cool Pool\") and the GasLog Houston prior to the start of her long-term charter to Shell at the end of 2018.\nWe are also encouraged by signs of continued LNG demand growth which will likely support development of new liquefaction capacity in the U.S. and elsewhere. For example, subsidiaries of Cheniere Energy Inc. (\"Cheniere\") have recently announced contracts to supply Trafigura and China National Petroleum Corporation (\"CNPC\"). Combined with the progress made by other projects globally, we have increasing confidence that new projects will take final investment decisions (\"FID\") in the next 12-18 months, many of which will require incremental shipping capacity.\nWe continue to grow our fleet through the order of a newbuild LNG carrier from Samsung. The vessel is currently unchartered but is expected to deliver into a stronger LNG shipping market in the third quarter of 2019. The Alexandroupolis Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (\"FSRU\") project continues to move forward, with the Operation and Maintenance agreement nearing finalization, and negotiations with DEPA and Bulgarian Energy Holding (\"BEH\") regarding equity participation progressing well. FID is expected in late 2018.\"\nLNG Market Update and Outlook\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 witnessed the start-up of Chevron's Wheatstone LNG project in Australia, Novatek's Yamal Train 1 in Russia, and Dominion's Cove Point project in the United States, building on the momentum in the expansion of global liquefaction capacity seen throughout 2017. In total, over 30 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\") of new nameplate capacity came online in 2017, an increase of 11% over 2016. Looking ahead, Ichthys, Wheatstone Train 2, Cameroon LNG, Elba Island, Prelude and Yamal Train 2 are expected to begin production this year adding a further approximately 25 mtpa of nameplate capacity, a projected increase of 9% over 2017.\nFurther out, the long-term outlook for the LNG market remains positive as witnessed by Cheniere's recent sale and purchase agreements with Trafigura under which it agreed to supply 1 mtpa of LNG over 15 years beginning in 2019 and with CNPC under which it agreed to supply 1.2 mtpa of LNG for up to 25 years commencing in 2018. Tohoku Electric has contracted to purchase 0.2 mtpa from Area 1 in Mozambique. While only one FID was made last year (ENI's 3.4 mtpa Coral FLNG), various sources project a shortfall of LNG by between 2021 and 2023, implying the need for additional project sanctions over the next 1-3 years.\nDemand for LNG in 2017 was stronger than expected, growing an estimated 12% over 2016. More specifically, Chinese demand grew by 44% year-on-year, overtaking South Korea as the world's second largest consumer of LNG as the country seeks to introduce more natural gas into its energy mix. Elsewhere in Asia, demand from Japan remained steady while South Korea and Taiwan grew 10% and 14%, respectively. Strong seasonal demand from Asia drove spot LNG prices to over $11/million British thermal units (\"mmbtu\") in early 2018 widening the west-east arbitrage window for sending Atlantic Basin LNG into Asia, expanding tonne miles and driving incremental demand for LNG shipping capacity.\nIn the LNG shipping spot market, tri-fuel diesel electric (\"TFDE\") headline rates, as reported by Clarksons, rose through the end of the fourth quarter, reaching a peak of $82,000 per day in late December, an increase of 82% from the same time in 2016. While headline rates have fallen in recent weeks to approximately $73,000 per day, this improvement in rates, combined with only ten newbuild orders last year, gives us confidence in the sustainability of the current market recovery. While we expect there to be seasonality in both LNG prices and LNG shipping spot rates during 2018, the longer-term outlook for LNG shipping day rates remains positive.\nIt may take time before the strength in the spot market observed this winter translates into the multi-year charter market as we are in the early stages of the recovery. However, we are observing increasing levels of tendering activity for charters ranging from multi-month to multi-year. In addition, some off-takers for LNG projects scheduled to begin production over the next two years have yet to secure their shipping requirements. We expect a number of vessels for these projects to be sourced from vessels currently operating in the short-term market, but also expect the coming increase in LNG supply to require additional LNG carriers beyond those currently on the water and in the orderbook.\nDelivery of the GasLog Houston\nOn January 8, 2018, GasLog took delivery of the GasLog Houston, a LNG carrier of 174,000 cbm with LP-2S propulsion constructed by Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (\"Hyundai\"). The vessel is currently on a short-term charter to a major LNG producer and thereafter will trade in the short-term market until the commencement of its multi-year charter party with a subsidiary of Shell, from the end of 2018 until April 2028.\nGasLog Partners' Issuance of Series B Preference Units\nOn January 17, 2018, GasLog Partners completed a public offering of 4,600,000 8.200% Series B Preference Units (including 600,000 units issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Series B Preference Units), liquidation preference $25.00 per unit, at a price to the public of $25.00 per preference unit. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses were $111.0 million. The Series B Preference Units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"GLOP PR B\". The initial distribution on the Series B Preference Units will be payable on March 15, 2018.\nAdditional Vessel\nOn January 12, 2018, GasLog entered into a shipbuilding contract with Samsung for the construction of a 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2213) that is scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter of 2020. This vessel will now be the vessel to be chartered to Pioneer Shipping Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrica plc (\"Centrica\") for an initial period of approximately seven years, as previously announced on October 20, 2016. The 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex Plus LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2212) as referenced in the highlights and to be delivered in the third quarter of 2019 is currently without charter.\nDrop-down of the Solaris to GasLog Partners\nOn September 19, 2017, GasLog entered into a share purchase agreement for the drop-down to GasLog Partners of 100% of the ownership interest in GAS-eight Ltd., the entity that owns the Solaris, for an aggregate purchase price of $185.9 million, which includes outstanding debt of $116.5 million and $1.0 million for the positive net working capital balance transferred with the entity. The acquisition closed on October 20, 2017.\nGasLog Partners' At-the-market Common Equity Offering Programme (the \"ATM Programme\")\nOn May 16, 2017, GasLog Partners commenced an ATM Programme under which the Partnership may, from time to time, raise equity through the issuance and sale of new common units having an aggregate offering value of up to $100.0 million in accordance with the terms of an equity distribution agreement entered into on the same date. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC have agreed to act as sales agents. On November 3, 2017, the size of the ATM Programme was increased to $144.0 million and UBS Securities LLC was included as a sales agent. During the fourth quarter of 2017, GasLog Partners issued and received payment for 385,520 common units at a weighted average price of $23.31 per common unit for total gross proceeds of $9.0 million and net proceeds of $8.5 million, after broker commissions of $0.1 million and other expenses of $0.4 million.\nSince the commencement of the ATM Programme through December 31, 2017, GasLog Partners has issued and received payment for a total of 2,737,405 common units, with cumulative gross proceeds of $62.9 million, at a weighted average price of $22.97 per unit, representing a discount of 0.5% to the volume weighted average trading price of GasLog Partners' common units on the days on which new common units were issued. Cumulative net proceeds have been $61.2 million.\nFinancing Transactions\nOn January 5, 2018, GasLog, through GasLog Partners, prepaid $29.8 million of the junior tranche of the Five Vessel Refinancing, which would have been due in April 2018.\nDividend Declaration\nOn November 16, 2017, the board of directors declared a dividend on the Series A Preference Shares of $0.546875 per share, or $2.5 million in the aggregate, payable on January 2, 2018 to holders of record as of December 29, 2017. GasLog paid the declared dividend to the transfer agent on December 29, 2017.\nOn February 15, 2018, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per common share payable on March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 5, 2018.\nFinancial Summary\nIn thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share data\nFor the three months ended For the year ended December 31, 2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 Revenues 126,481 135,772 466,059 525,229 EBITDA (1) 84,756 89,655 301,023 355,902 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 85,406 89,666 302,386 356,048 Profit 46,426 29,685 28,051 84,209 Adjusted Profit (1) 18,853 21,438 57,495 78,724 Profit/(loss) attributable to the owners of GasLog 31,322 8,934 (21,486 ) 15,506 EPS, basic 0.36 0.08 (0.39 ) 0.07 Adjusted EPS (1) 0.02 (0.02 ) (0.03 ) (0.00 ) (1) Adjusted Profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for GasLog's financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. For definitions and reconciliations of these measurements to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, please refer to Exhibit II at the end of this press release.\nThere were 2,050 and 8,317 operating days for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively (2,078 and 7,439 operating days for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The decrease in operating days in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted mainly from the increased off-hire days due to a scheduled dry-docking and repairs partially offset by an increase from the delivery of the GasLog Gibraltar on October 31, 2016. The year-on-year increase in operating days resulted mainly from the deliveries of the GasLog Greece, the GasLog Glasgow, the GasLog Geneva and the GasLog Gibraltar on March 29, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and October 31, 2016, respectively, combined with fewer off-hire days due to scheduled dry-dockings and repairs.\nRevenues were $135.8 million and $525.2 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively ($126.5 million and $466.1 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was mainly attributable to the increased revenues from vessels operating in the spot market, while the year-on-year increase in revenues was mainly driven by the full operation of the GasLog Greece, the GasLog Glasgow, the GasLog Geneva and the GasLog Gibraltar and increased revenues from vessels operating in the spot market.\nVessel operating and supervision costs were $35.6 million and $122.5 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively ($29.4 million and $112.6 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The increase in vessel operating and supervision costs for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017 was mainly driven by the increase in ownership days due to the full operation of the 2016 deliveries and an increase in crew wages and technical maintenance expenses.\nVoyage expenses and commissions were $1.3 million and $8.2 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively ($2.5 million and $15.2 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The decrease resulted mainly from the movement in net allocation of the Cool Pool results.\nDepreciation was $34.6 million and $137.2 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively ($33.9 million and $123.0 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The increase resulted from the increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $9.6 million and $39.9 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively ($10.3 million and $38.6 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The decrease in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was mainly attributable to the decrease of foreign exchange losses, while the year-on-year increase was mainly driven by an increase in employee costs and share-based compensation expense, partially offset by the decrease of foreign exchange losses.\nFinancial costs were $34.9 million and $139.2 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively ($30.6 million and $137.3 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The increase in financial costs in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was mainly attributable to the increased average debt outstanding as a result of the U.S. bond offering completed in March 2017 and the increased weighted average interest rate. The year-on-year increase in financial costs was mainly driven by the increased average debt outstanding as a result of the debt drawdowns for the new vessels delivered in 2016 the U.S. bond offering and the increased weighted average interest rate, partially offset by the write-off of $18.2 million of unamortized loan issuance costs associated with re-financing which occurred during 2016. An analysis of financial costs is set forth below:\n( All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars )\nFor the three months ended For the year ended December 31, 2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 Financial costs Amortization and write-off of deferred loan and bond issuance costs and premium 2,895 3,063 35,141 12,398 Interest expense on loans and realized loss on cash flow hedges 21,474 21,132 76,495 85,813 Interest expense on bonds and realized loss on cross-currency swaps 3,033 7,588 11,723 27,085 Finance lease charge 2,795 2,708 9,367 10,875 Loss arising on bond repurchase at a premium - - 2,120 1,459 Other financial costs 363 379 2,470 1,551 Total 30,560 34,870 137,316 139,181 Gain on swaps was $8.6 million and $2.0 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively (a gain of $26.0 million and a loss of $13.4 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The decrease in gain on swaps in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was mainly attributable to a decrease of $19.7 million in gain from mark-to-market valuation of our derivative financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss, partially offset by a decrease of $2.4 million in realized loss on derivative financial instruments held for trading. The year-on-year increase in gain on swaps was mainly driven by the decrease of $19.1 million in recycled loss that was reclassified from equity to the statement of profit or loss relating to the cumulative loss from the period that the hedges of the interest rate swaps terminated in July 2016 were effective and the decrease of $4.3 million in realized loss on derivative financial instruments held for trading, partially offset by the decrease of $8.0 million in gain from mark-to-market valuation of our derivative financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss. An analysis of (gain)/loss on swaps is set forth below:\n( All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars )\nFor the three months ended For the year ended December 31, 2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 (Gain)/loss on swaps Realized loss/(gain) on interest rate swaps held for trading 2,258 (139 ) 8,435 4,112 Unrealized gain on interest rate swaps held for trading (28,223 ) (8,536 ) (18,530 ) (10,570 ) Recycled loss of cash flow hedges reclassified to profit or loss - - 23,514 4,368 Ineffective portion on cash flow hedges - 65 - 65 Total (25,965 ) (8,610 ) 13,419 (2,025 ) Profit was $29.7 million and $84.2 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively ($46.4 million and $28.1 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The decrease in profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was mainly attributable to the decrease in gain on swaps and the increase in financial costs, partially offset by the increase in profit from operations due to the factors mentioned above. The year-on-year increase was mainly driven by the increase in profit from operations due to the factors mentioned above and the increase in gain on swaps.\nAdjusted Profit (1) was $21.4 million and $78.7 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively ($18.9 million and $57.5 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively), adjusted for the effects of the non-cash gain/loss on swaps, the write-off and accelerated amortization of unamortized loan/bond fees and premium, as well as the net foreign exchange losses.\nProfit attributable to the owners of GasLog was $8.9 million and $15.5 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively (profit of $31.3 million and loss of $21.5 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The decrease in profit attributable to the owners of GasLog in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted mainly from the respective movement in profit mentioned above and the increased amount allocated to third parties as a result of GasLog Partners' equity offerings in January and May 2017, its ATM Programme initiated in May 2017 and the drop-down of four vessels. The year-on-year increase in profit attributable to the owners of GasLog for the year resulted mainly from the respective movement in profit mentioned above, partially offset by the increased amount allocated to third parties as a result of GasLog Partners' equity offerings in August 2016, January 2017 and May 2017, and its ATM Programme initiated in May 2017, and the associated drop-down of four vessels.\nEBITDA (1) was $89.7 million and $355.9 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively ($84.8 million and $301.0 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The increases in EBITDA were driven by the increases in revenues and the decreases in voyage expenses, partially offset by the increases in vessel operating expenses and the movements in the general administrative expenses as discussed above.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) was $89.7 million and $356.0 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively ($85.4 million and $302.4 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively).\nEarnings per share was $0.08 and $0.07 for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively (earnings of $0.36 and a loss of $0.39 per share for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively).\nAdjusted Loss per share (1) was $0.02 and $0.00 per share for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively (earnings of $0.02 and a loss of $0.03 per share for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively).\n(1) Adjusted Profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for GasLog's financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. For definitions and reconciliations of these measurements to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, please refer to Exhibit II at the end of this press release.\nContracted Charter Revenues\nGasLog's contracted charter revenues are estimated to increase from $486.0 million for the fiscal year 2017 to $498.3 million for the fiscal year 2019, based on contracts in effect as of December 31, 2017, without including any extension options. As of December 31, 2017, the total future firm contracted revenue stood at $3.1 billion (1) , including the twelve vessels owned by GasLog Partners, but excluding the vessels operating in the spot market.\n(1) Contracted revenue calculations assume: (a) 365 revenue days per annum, with 30 off-hire days when the ship undergoes scheduled dry-docking; (b) all LNG carriers on order are delivered on schedule; and (c) no exercise of any option to extend the terms of charters.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, GasLog had $384.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $189.9 million was held in time deposits and the remaining balance in current accounts.\nAs of December 31, 2017, GasLog had an aggregate of $2.5 billion of indebtedness outstanding under its credit facilities and bond agreements, of which $179.4 million was repayable within one year, and a $213.4 million finance lease liability related to the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise, of which $6.3 million was repayable within one year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there was undrawn available capacity of $100.0 million under the revolving credit facility of the Legacy Facility Refinancing entered into on July 19, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, GasLog's total commitments for capital expenditures are related to four LNG carriers on order and the GasLog Houston which was delivered in 2018, which have a gross aggregate contract price of approximately $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2017, the total remaining balance of the contract prices of the aforementioned newbuildings was $882.6 million which GasLog expects to be funded with the $664.0 million undrawn capacity under the financing agreement entered into on October 16, 2015, as well as cash balances, cash from operations, cash from future equity offerings in relation to drop-downs to the Partnership, if any, and borrowings under new and existing debt agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2017, GasLog's current assets totaled $417.1 million while current liabilities totaled $294.9 million, resulting in a positive working capital position of $122.2 million.\nGasLog has hedged 53.9% of its expected floating interest rate exposure on its outstanding debt (excluding the finance lease liability) as of December 31, 2017.\nOur Fleet\nOwned Fleet\nThe following table presents information about our wholly owned vessels and their associated time charters as of February 16, 2018:\nCargo Year Capacity Charter Optional Vessel Name Built (cbm) Charterer Propulsion Expiration (1) Period (2) 1 GasLog Savannah 2010 155,000 Spot Market (3) TFDE - - 2 GasLog Singapore 2010 155,000 Spot Market (3) TFDE - - 3 GasLog Skagen (5) 2013 155,000 Shell TFDE August 2019 (4) - 4 GasLog Chelsea 2010 153,600 Spot Market (3) TFDE - - 5 GasLog Saratoga 2014 155,000 Spot Market (3) TFDE - - 6 Methane Lydon Volney 2006 145,000 Shell Steam October 2020 2023-2025 7 Methane Becki Anne 2010 170,000 Shell TFDE March 2024 2027-2029 8 GasLog Salem (5) 2015 155,000 Spot Market (3) TFDE - - 9 GasLog Glasgow 2016 174,000 Shell TFDE June 2026 2031 10 GasLog Gibraltar 2016 174,000 Shell TFDE October 2023 2028-2031 11 GasLog Houston 2018 174,000 Shell LP-2S April 2028 2031-2034 The following table presents information about GasLog Partners' fleet and their associated time charters as of February 16, 2018:\nCargo Year Capacity Charter Optional Vessel Name Built (cbm) Charterer Propulsion Expiration (1) Period (2) 1 GasLog Shanghai 2013 155,000 Shell TFDE May 2018 - 2 GasLog Santiago 2013 155,000 Shell TFDE July 2018 - 3 GasLog Sydney 2013 155,000 Shell TFDE September 2018 - 4 GasLog Seattle 2013 155,000 Shell TFDE December 2020 2025-2030 5 Solaris 2014 155,000 Shell TFDE June 2021 2026-2031 6 GasLog Greece 2016 174,000 Shell TFDE March 2026 2031 7 GasLog Geneva 2016 174,000 Shell TFDE September 2023 2028-2031 8 Methane Rita Andrea 2006 145,000 Shell Steam April 2020 2023-2025 9 Methane Jane Elizabeth 2006 145,000 Shell Steam October 2019 - 10 Methane Shirley Elisabeth 2007 145,000 Shell Steam June 2020 2023-2025 11 Methane Alison Victoria 2007 145,000 Shell Steam December 2019 - 12 Methane Heather Sally 2007 145,000 Shell Steam December 2020 2023-2025 Bareboat Vessel\nCargo Year Capacity Charter Optional Vessel Name Built (cbm) Charterer Propulsion Expiration (1) Period (2) 1 Methane Julia Louise 2010 170,000 Shell TFDE March 2026 2029-2031\n(1) Indicates the expiration of the initial term.
