    "text": "VIRGINIA CITY, Nev., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Comstock Mining Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE American:LODE) , a Nevada-based, gold and silver mining company, announced today the election of Leo M. Drozdoff, 52, to its Board of Directors and the retirement of Robert A. Reseigh, after 9 years of service, from its Board of Directors. Mr. Reseigh will remain involved with the Company as a member of a newly established Mining Advisory Committee, to assist in all aspects of technical mining and mine development, along with Mr. Drozdoff and Mr. Dan Kappes.\nCorrado De Gasperis, Executive Chairman of the Board said, “Bob was instrumental in almost every aspect of building the Company, its asset base and management team. He is one of the most genuine, direct, transparent, hardest working and caring directors that I have ever worked with and I was truly saddened when he indicated he was ready for retirement. I was equally thrilled when he agreed to stay on in an advisory role, working with us on technical matters, as we grow our assets and resources into a bigger, more meaningful company.”\nThe Company also welcomes Mr. Drozdoff to the Board with an extensive resume in Nevada’s mining industry, including but not limited to engineering, legislation, environmental regulation, economic development and historical preservation. He most recently served as the Director of the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources from 2010 to 2016, and was a Cabinet member reporting to two Nevada Governors, including our current Governor, the Hon. Brian Sandoval, where Mr. Drozdoff oversaw 900 state employees responsible for Mining, Environmental Protection, Water Resources, Forestry, State Parks, State Lands and the State of Nevada’s Historic Preservation Office. Mr. Drozdoff also served as lead Administrator of Nevada’s Division of Environmental Protection for over six years, and prior to that appointment, as Bureau Chief over both Mining and Water Control, two of the most critical Nevada mining regulatory bureaus. He also chaired the Nevada Public Employee Benefits Program Board, overseeing the benefits of over 30,000 public employees, retirees and their families.\nMr. De Gasperis added, “We are honored to welcome Leo Drozdoff to the Comstock team. His knowledge of Nevada mining from almost every perspective, engineering, environmental, historical preservation, legislative and permitting is second to none, and will be especially valuable to us as we embark on developing and commercializing new technologies into the industry.”\nAbout Comstock Mining Inc.\nComstock Mining Inc. is a Nevada-based, gold and silver mining company with extensive, contiguous property in the Comstock District and is an emerging leader in sustainable, responsible mining. The Company began acquiring properties in the Comstock District in 2003. Since then, the Company has consolidated a significant portion of the Comstock District, amassed the single largest known repository of historical and current geological data on the Comstock region, secured permits, built an infrastructure and completed its first phase of production. The Company continues evaluating and acquiring properties inside and outside the district expanding its footprint and exploring all of our existing and prospective opportunities for further exploration, development and mining. The near term goal of our business plan is to maximize intrinsic stockholder value realized, per share, by continuing to acquire mineralized and potentially mineralized properties, exploring, developing and validating qualified resources and reserves (proven and probable) that enable the commercial development of our operations through extended, long-lived mine plans that are economically feasible and socially responsible.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release and any related calls or discussions may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about Comstock.
