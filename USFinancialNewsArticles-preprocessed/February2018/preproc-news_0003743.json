    "text": "SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) â€” Chevron Corp. on Friday reported fourth-quarter earnings of $3.11 billion.\nThe San Ramon, California-based company said it had profit of $1.64 per share. Earnings, adjusted for pretax gains, came to 73 cents per share.\nThe results did not meet Wall Street expectations, but Chevron does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. The average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.27 per share.\nThe oil company posted revenue of $37.62 billion in the period, which topped Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $37.55 billion.\nFor the year, the company reported net income of $9.2 billion, or $4.85 per share, swinging to a profit in the period. Revenue was reported as $141.72 billion.\nIn morning trading, Chevron shares fell 2.3 percent, or $2.85, to $122.72.
