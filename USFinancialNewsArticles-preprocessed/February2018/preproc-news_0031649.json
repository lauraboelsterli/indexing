    "text": "NATICK, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ: CGNX) announced today that the company’s Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to $150 million of Cognex common stock in open market transactions, subject to market conditions and other relevant factors. This new authorization will commence after Cognex completes an existing $100 million repurchase program, of which approximately $45 million remains available.\nThe repurchase program is intended to help reduce share dilution associated with the company’s equity incentive plans, which the company strongly believes are instrumental in its ability to recruit, motivate and retain the highest caliber employees.\nAbout Cognex Corporation\nCognex Corporation designs, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of image-based products, all of which use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that give them the human-like ability to make decisions on what they see. Cognex products include machine vision systems, machine vision sensors and barcode readers that are used in factories and distribution centers around the world where they eliminate production and shipping errors.\nCognex is the world's leader in the machine vision industry, having shipped more than 1.5 million vision-based products, representing over $5 billion in cumulative revenue, since the company's founding in 1981. Headquartered in Natick, Massachusetts, USA, Cognex has offices and distributors located throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia.
