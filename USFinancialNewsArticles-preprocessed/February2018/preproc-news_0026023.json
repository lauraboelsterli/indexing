    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Russian who offered stolen National Security Agency cyberweapons and compromising information on President Donald Trump bilked U.S. spies out of $100,000 last year, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing U.S. and European security officials.\nThe money was delivered to a Berlin hotel room in September and was intended as the first installment of a $1 million reward, according to U.S. officials, the Russian and communications reviewed by the Times, the newspaper reported.\nCIA spokesman Dean Boyd denied the story on Saturday, saying,” “The fictional story that CIA was bilked out of $100,000 is patently false.”\nThe theft of the secret hacking tools was very damaging to the NSA, which was trying to determine exactly what was missing, the Times said.\nSeveral U.S. intelligence officials told the newspaper they said they did not want the Trump information from the Russian, who was suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence and Eastern European cybercriminals.\nHe claimed it would link the president and his associates to Russia, the Times said, citing the officials. But instead of providing the hacking tools, the Russian produced unverified and possibly fabricated material involving Trump and others, including bank records, emails and purported Russian intelligence data, the paper cited the officials as saying.\nThe U.S. intelligence officials halted the deal out of concern it could entangle them in a Russian operation to create discord inside the U.S. government and potential fallout in Washington from the perception that they were trying to buy compromising material on Trump, the Times reported.\nThe Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment on the negotiations with the Russian seller, the Times said.\nThe NSA, which produced the bulk of the hacking tools that the Americans sought to recover, said only that “all N.S.A. employees have a lifetime obligation to protect classified information,” the Times reported.\nNSA officials were not available out of regular business hours for comment.\n Jonathan Landay; Reporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Leslie Adler and Bill Trott\n ",
