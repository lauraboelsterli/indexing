Waste Services. V.I.P. Waste Services offers both doorstep collection and recycling amenities to multifamily communities.\nThe mission, values, and culture of Valet Living are very similar to that of V.I.P. Waste Services.

The strategic acquisition further increases Valet Living's presence in the Midwest market and extends its mission to enhance property value by setting the standard in residential services nationwide.\n\"A defining aspect of this company is its set of core values: respect, integrity, accountability, servanthood, and excellence,\" said Shawn Handrahan, President and CEO of Valet Living. \"We are looking forward to bringing the V.I.P.
