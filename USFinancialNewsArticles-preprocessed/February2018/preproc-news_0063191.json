In addition, the fourth quarter of 2017 marked 13 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth and ten consecutive quarters of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. We added 36 new venues to the Boingo network in 2017 and signed 43 Tier 1 carrier agreements. We have 84 DAS venues yet to be deployed, which is more than two times the amount of our 38 DAS venues that are live today. We were also pleased to have made additional traction with carrier offload by rolling out offload services to the majority of our domestic military bases and airport venue locations in 2017.”\nMr. Hagan continued, “Looking ahead, in addition to our key priorities of DAS, military and carrier offload, we are very focused on venue based, small cell deployments. We believe there is a massive addressable market and we expect small cells to deliver growth for many years to come.”\nBusiness Outlook\nBoingo Wireless is initiating guidance for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018 and for the full year ending December 31, 2018, as follows:\nFirst Quarter 2018\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $50.0 million to $54.0 million. Net loss attributable to common stockholders is expected to be in the range of $(8.0) million to $(5.0) million, or a net loss of $0.20 to $0.12 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $14.0 million to $17.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined below and is reconciled to net loss attributable to common stockholders, the most comparable measure under GAAP, in the schedule entitled “Reconciliation of Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA – Guidance.”\nFull Year 2018\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $227.0 million to $234.0 million. Net loss attributable to common stockholders is expected to be in the range of $(20.0) million to $(15.0) million, or a net loss of $(0.48) to $(0.36) per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $77.0 million to $82.0 million.\nConference Call Information\nMembers of Boingo Wireless’ management will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET (1:30 p.m. PT), today, February 27, 2018. To participate in the conference call, investors from the U.S. and Canada should dial (877) 407-9716 and enter the passcode: 13675029 ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time. International callers should dial +1 (201) 493-6779 and enter the same passcode. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at http://investors.boingo.com . In addition, a supplement reflecting the Company’s key business metrics will be made available in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website. The supplement and webcast will be archived online upon completion of the conference call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Boingo Wireless’ financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Boingo Wireless provides Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental measures of its performance.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to common stockholders plus depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, income tax (benefit) expense, interest and other expense, net, non-controlling interests, and excludes charges or gains that are nonrecurring, infrequent, or unusual. Boingo Wireless believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating its operating performance. Boingo's management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and other operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of the Company's performance for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies and to communicate with its board of directors concerning its financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative financial measure to net loss attributable to common stockholders, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 excludes settlement expense related to a claim from one of the Company's venue partners and Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 excludes charges related to the Company's contested proxy election for the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders because they represent non-recurring charges and are not indicative of the underlying performance of the Company's business operations.\nThe Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. Boingo Wireless believes that free cash flow provides investors with additional useful information to measure operating liquidity because it reflects the amount of cash generated by the Company's operations after the purchases of property and equipment that can be used for strategic opportunities. Free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Boingo Wireless\nBoingo Wireless, Inc.

A DAS node is a single communications endpoint, typically an antenna, which transmits or receives radio frequency signals wirelessly. This measure is an indicator of the reach of the Company’s DAS network. This metric represents the number of DAS nodes under contract but not yet active as of the end of the period. This metric represents the number of paying customers who are on a month-to-month subscription plan at a given period end. This metric shows how often individuals connect to the Company’s global Wi-Fi network in a given period. The connects include retail and wholesale customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where Boingo is a paid service provider or receives revenue sponsorship or promotion fees. The Company counts each connect as a single connect regardless of how many times that individual accesses the network at a given venue during their 24 hour period. This measure is an indicator of paid activity throughout Boingo’s network.\nCONTACTS:\nPRESS:\nLauren de la Fuente\nVice President, Marketing and Communications\nldelafuente@boingo.com\n(310) 405-8517\nINVESTORS:\nKimberly Orlando and Ariel Papermaster\nADDO Investor Relations\ninvestors@boingo.com\n(310) 829-5400\nSource:Boingo Wireless, Inc.",
