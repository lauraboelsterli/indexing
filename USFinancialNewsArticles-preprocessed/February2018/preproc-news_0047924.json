    "text": "February 22, 2018 / 10:41 AM / Updated 31 minutes ago Women in Barclays investment bank earn half as much on average as men Reuters Staff 2 Min Read LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Barclays pays women in its international division on average half of what men earn, the British bank revealed on Thursday, underscoring how major financial firms still have far fewer female employees in senior roles. The mean gender pay gap in Barclays International, which houses the bankâ€™s investment banking unit, is 48 percent, Barclays said, meaning the average hourly wage for a woman is just under half that of a man. Barclays joins a handful of major financial institutions that have disclosed gender pay gaps. The British government last year said it will require all companies with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay data by April 2018. At Barclays, the difference is largely the result of the proportion of women working in more junior roles, rather than a breach of pay equality rules that require people working at the same rank to be paid the same regardless of gender, it said. The bank reported a gender pay gap in its other main unit, Barclays UK, of 26 percent. Others organisations to have made such disclosures include U.S. investment banks like Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and also the Bank of England. Lloyds Banking Group said on Tuesday it would publish its pay gap before the April deadline. Reporting by Lawrence White and Emma Rumney; editing by Alexander Smith",
