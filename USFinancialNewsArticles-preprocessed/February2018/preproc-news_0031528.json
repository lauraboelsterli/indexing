President Donald Trump is set to unveil a program today that aims to transform the way the nation’s infrastructure is funded and developed, but the WSJ’s Rebecca Ballhaus and Ted Mann report the initiative faces an uncertain road in Congress over finding the money to pay for it. Mr. Trump will propose spending $200 billion in federal funds over 10 years, most of which will come in the form of grants that encourage states and cities to raise their own funds for improving infrastructure. The plan will also expand the size and scope of existing federal loan programs for building rails, airports, highways and water systems. There’s no agreement on where the initial new funding comes from, however, and the recent two-year spending deal that Congress agreed to may complicate things. Analysts say that could relieve pressure on lawmakers to produce a big infrastructure initiative this year, even as shipping groups try to keep the pressure on.\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN 3.48% may be facing its most difficult and expensive delivery yet. The online behemoth faces a steep uphill climb in reaching the scale of FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. as it begins to roll out a “Shipping with Amazon” operation that seems to set Amazon on a path to creating another U.S. national package shipping giant. The WSJ’s Laura Stevens, Jennifer Smith and Paul Ziobro report it would require tens of billions of dollars in investment, including thousands of trucks, hundreds of planes and far more sorting centers to deliver packages for other retailers and consumers at a national scale. Amazon generated around 1.2 billion shipments last year domestically, but most of those were delivered by the U.S. Postal Service, UPS and FedEx. The company isn’t talking about how it plans to execute its ambitious logistics plan. Amazon could start buying equipment, of course, or it could seek to accelerate its delivery push by buying a company already in the business.\nMaersk Line wants to get more digital and more profitable. The container-shipping unit of A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S wants to raise freight rates and cut its operating costs, the WSJ’s Costas Paris and Dominic Chopping write, after reporting sharp swings in earnings at operations during what it termed “an eventful year.” The shipping line had a $48 million profit for the last quarter, a big swing from a $146 million loss the year before but also a step back from earnings earlier in the year. The world’s biggest container shipping line saw growth in freight prices slow late in the year. The volatile pricing environment has Maersk looking to tighten control of its costs, and turn more aggressively toward the digital world as it seeks to become a bigger player in end-to-end supply chains. The company is hinting at more acquisitions, and its interest in technology suggests its interest in expansion may not be limited to adding vessels on the water.\nTRANSPORTATION Photo: Bloomberg News The big winners in rising U.S. shipping prices may be the freight middlemen. Financial results from third-party brokers that connect shippers to trucking fleets show revenues and profits turning sharply upward, the WSJ’s Erica E. Phillips reports, as growing economic demand and tight capacity sends companies rushing to find shipping space. C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc., Echo Global Logistics and XPO Logistics Inc. are among companies reporting strong growth in brokerage business, a turnabout for some of the freight operators after lackluster business in a stagnant U.S. economy. They’re benefiting from the resurgent shipping demand that has squeezed capacity across domestic distribution channels and has left shippers willing to pay more to find ways to keep their goods moving. The scarce truck space appears to be driving recent gains in intermodal rail volume, likely a factor in a 33% boost in fourth-quarter operating profit at Hub Group Inc. and a strong rise in the intermodal specialist’s gross margins.\nThe turnaround in raw materials prices is bringing pain to U.S. factories. Rising costs for the basic building blocks of industry production—including steel, aluminum, copper and resin—have manufacturing companies weighing whether they can pass higher prices along the supply chain or accept lower profit margins. The WSJ’s Andrew Tangel, Harriet Torry and Heather Haddon report the rising commodity prices come as companies also face pressure to raise wages, adding to production expenses. Companies including Caterpillar Inc. and Ford Motor Corp. have said rising material costs are having an impact on their business. Food companies are contending with escalating costs for staples, and distributor Sysco Corp., saw overall food inflation of more than 3% during its most recent quarter. The rising commodity costs should help long-foundering bulk carriers. Analysts Alphabulk says orders for bulk ships are starting to rise, but the order book for the vessels remains at its lowest level relative to the fleet since the early 2000s.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ In the 1980s the freight cost of moving a container across the ocean was $4,000. Now it’s $2,000, but there is still the same paper trail of documents as it was 100 years ago. ’\n—Soren Skou, A.P.
