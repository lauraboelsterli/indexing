    "text": "February 11, 2018 / 2:51 AM / Updated 5 minutes ago Olympics - Snowboarding: Gerard wins first U.S. gold of Games Jack Tarrant 1 Min Read \nPYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - American Redmond Gerard claimed the United States’ first gold medal of the Pyeongchang Winter Games on Sunday with his victory in the snowboarding slopestyle competition. \nGerard scored a run of 87.16 to hold off Canadians Max Parrot and Mark McMorris, who finished second and third. \nThe 17-year-old Gerard, the youngest in the competition, landed a perfect backside triple cork 1440 on his final run and despite Parrot landing the same trick on the final run of the day the judges favoured the American. \nEvery boarder had three cracks at the course, with each athlete’s result calculated as the best score of the three as assessed by the nine judges. \nIt was a disappointing day for Norway, who had three riders in the competition. Sochi Games silver medallist Staale Sandbech was fourth, with teenage sensation Marcus Kleveland a disappointing sixth. Reporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
