(NASDAQ:FOSL) (the “Company” or “Fossil Group”) today reported its financial results and fiscal year ended December 30, 2017. Fourth quarter and fiscal year results include net sales near the high-end of the Company's previously provided guidance. Reported diluted earnings per share include the impacts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) that was signed into law in December 2017. These impacts along with tax valuation allowances recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were not contemplated in the Company's guidance provided on November 7, 2017. Diluted earnings per share, excluding these tax related charges, were in line with guidance.\nThe Company reported net income (loss) of fiscal 2017 of $(79.9) million compared to $49.7 million of fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings (loss) per share were $(1.65), including tax charges of $2.20 per diluted share due to the impacts from the Tax Act combined with a valuation allowance and a restructuring charge of $0.09 per diluted share, as compared to $1.03 of fiscal 2016. Currencies, including both the translation impact on operating earnings and the impact of foreign currency hedging contracts, favorably affected the year-over-year earnings (loss) per share comparison by $0.09.\nFor fiscal year 2017, the Company reported net income (loss) of $(478.2) million compared to $78.9 million for fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings (loss) per share were $(9.87), compared to $1.63 for fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings (loss) per share for fiscal 2017 of $(9.87) included non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $7.07 per diluted share, tax charges resulting from the Tax Act and valuation allowance of $2.20 per diluted share and a restructuring charge of $0.65 per diluted share. Currencies, including both the translation impact on operating earnings and the impact of foreign currency hedging contracts, unfavorably affected the year-over-year earnings (loss) per share comparison by $(0.01).\nKosta Kartsotis, Fossil Group, Chairman and CEO commented: “In fiscal 2017, Fossil Group, embarked on a set of strategic initiatives aimed at accelerating the evolution of the business to position the Company for long term profitable growth. While sales and earnings were challenged as expected, we generated progress toward our objectives that include: driving growth in wearables across our portfolio of powerful brands, leveraging our scale to lower supply chain costs, increasing our digital capabilities, and continuing the transformation of our business through New World Fossil. To this end, fiscal 2017 saw us nearly double wearables to over $300 million, representing 14% of total watch sales. This success drove an increase in Fossil watch sales for the second half of the year with positive comps in our direct business during the important holiday quarter. With wearable launches ahead of holiday, we significantly improved the trajectory for Michael Kors watches and drove a double digit increase in fourth quarter Armani watch sales. Overall, we introduced a number of new hybrid and display smartwatches across 14 brands and believe the continuation of this effort, combined with the innovation we are introducing across our traditional styles, has us poised for stabilization and growth over time. Also, positioning us well is the work we did across the supply chain. By year end, wearable product costs were aligned with our margin goal, setting the stage to increase gross margin in 2018. On the digital front, we greatly increased our reach, helping to drive a 31% increase in e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter, and our New World Fossil initiative led to $95 million reduction in expenses for the year placing us right on track to achieve our $200 million profit improvement goal. I am proud of our team as their combined efforts, focus and passion led to significant accomplishments toward each of our objectives, giving us a stronger platform from which to continue our progress in fiscal 2018.\"\n\"In the year ahead, we expect to be a smaller yet more profitable company that is on a solid path for the future,\" Mr. Kartsotis, continued. “Our priorities are focused on delivering innovative wearable and traditional watch styles while improving performance in the handbag and jewelry categories and driving increases in digital sales. While we continue to expect North America to be challenging given the dynamics of the retail and consumer environment in the region, with our commitment to drive out costs through our New World Fossil initiative and with improved sourcing costs, we expect to deliver more profit to the bottom line. The credit agreement completed last month increases the financial flexibility we have to continue to invest in support of our growth and achieve our ultimate goal of creating greater value for all Fossil stakeholders.”\nOperating Results\nCompared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar increased the Company’s fiscal 2017 reported net sales by $29.9 million and operating income by $11.0 million. During fiscal 2017, the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar increased the Company’s reported net sales by $23.3 million and had a relatively neutral impact on operating income. The discussion of the Company’s net sales is presented on a GAAP basis and in constant dollars and reflects regional performance based on sales in all channels within the geographic location.\nThe following tables provide a summary of net sales performance, on both a reported and constant currency basis, of fiscal 2017 and fiscal year 2017 compared to the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 2016 Growth (Decline) Amounts as\nReported Amounts as\nReported Dollars as\nReported\n(1) Constant\nCurrency\nDollars (2) Percentage\nas\nReported\n(1) Percentage\nConstant\nCurrency\n(2) Americas $ 442 $ 483 $ (41 ) $ (44 ) (8 )% (9 )% Europe 337 333 4 (20 ) 1 (6 ) Asia 142 143 (1 ) (4 ) (1 ) (3 ) Total net sales $ 921 $ 959 $ (38 ) $ (68 ) (4 )% (7 )% Watches $ 728 $ 749 $ (21 ) $ (44 ) (3 )% (6 )% Leathers 108 115 (7 ) (10 ) (6 ) (9 ) Jewelry 72 80 (8 ) (12 ) (10 ) (14 ) Other 13 15 (2 ) (2 ) (13 ) (15 ) Total net sales $ 921 $ 959 $ (38 ) $ (68 ) (4 )% (7 )%\nFiscal Year 2017 2016 Growth (Decline) Amounts as\nReported Amounts as\nReported Dollars as\nReported\n(1) Constant\nCurrency\nDollars (2) Percentage\nas\nReported\n(1) Percentage\nConstant\nCurrency\n(2) Americas $ 1,316 $ 1,525 $ (209 ) $ (211 ) (14 )% (14 )% Europe 974 1,002 (28 ) (46 ) (3 ) (5 ) Asia 498 515 (17 ) (20 ) (3 ) (4 ) Total net sales $ 2,788 $ 3,042 $ (254 ) $ (277 ) (8 )% (9 )% Watches $ 2,199 $ 2,330 $ (131 ) $ (149 ) (6 )% (6 )% Leathers 325 394 (69 ) (71 ) (18 ) (18 ) Jewelry 212 251 (39 ) (42 ) (16 ) (17 ) Other 52 67 (15 ) (15 ) (22 ) (23 ) Total net sales $ 2,788 $ 3,042 $ (254 ) $ (277 ) (8 )% (9 )% (1) Reported GAAP amounts include impacts from currency.\n(2) Eliminates the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal 2017 to give investors a better understanding of the underlying trends within the business. See constant currency financial information at the end of this release for more information.\nFourth quarter fiscal 2017 worldwide net sales decreased $38.4 million or 4% and $68.3 million in constant currency (a 7% decline) compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Watches declined across all geographies, with growth in connected watches more than offset by a decline in traditional watches on a constant currency basis. Leathers and jewelry also declined across all geographies on a constant currency basis as compared to last fiscal year. Geographically, sales declines in the U.S. drove the decrease in the Americas. In Europe, on a constant currency basis, sales across the Eurozone were down modestly, while sales in distributor markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East declined significantly. In Asia, sales increases in China and India were more than offset by declines in most other countries with the greatest decrease in Japan. For fiscal 2017, worldwide net sales decreased $254.2 million or 8% and $277.5 million in constant currency (a 9% decline) compared to fiscal 2016.\nGlobal retail comps of fiscal 2017 increased 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, with positive comps in the watch category partially offset by negative comps in the leathers and jewelry categories. Positive comps in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by a decline in Asia. For fiscal 2017, global retail comps decreased 6% compared to fiscal 2016, with declines across all regions.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, gross margin decreased 230 basis points to 48.7%. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by the impact of connected products, due to both the increase in sales mix of connected products, which carry lower overall margins, as well as additional product valuation reserves totaling $18 million. These declines were partially offset by benefits generated by the Company's New World Fossil (\"NWF\") margin improvement initiatives. Gross margins were also favorably impacted by currency movements, mainly from a stronger Euro, and a shift in sales mix toward higher margin international sales and higher margin channels such as e-commerce. Additionally, lower markdown rates within the wholesale channel and an improved trend for direct channel margins, which declined much less than in prior quarters due to more targeted promotions, favorably impacted gross margins in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2017, gross margins decreased 320 basis points to 48.7%, primarily due to the impact of connected products, including an increase in product valuation reserves of approximately $40 million to support liquidation pricing, and lower retail margins driven by increased promotional activity in outlets and the e-commerce channel.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company’s operating expenses were $396.8 million, including $6.4 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to store closings, as compared to $13.3 million of restructuring costs in the prior fiscal year fourth quarter. Expenses were lower compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as a result of lower store expenses given the significant number of stores closed since the end of fiscal 2016, as well as corporate and regional overhead cost reductions. Marketing was also lower in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter due to reduced fixture spend and investments in lower cost digital campaigns compared to more expensive television advertising executed during the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter. For fiscal 2017, operating expenses were $1,783.1 million, including $407.1 million in non-cash intangible asset impairment charges and $48.2 million of restructuring costs associated with realigning and optimizing the organizational structure as well as costs associated with store closures.\nOperating income of fiscal 2017 decreased to $51.3 million, driven by lower sales and gross margin. For fiscal 2017, operating income (loss) decreased to $(424.2) million, driven by non-cash intangible asset impairment charges and higher restructuring charges combined with lower sales and gross margin.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, interest expense increased $3.6 million to $11.1 million and other income decreased $5.4 million to $2.2 million primarily due to net foreign currency contract losses compared to net gains in the prior fiscal year fourth quarter. During fiscal 2017, interest expense increased $16.3 million to $43.2 million and other income decreased $0.3 million to $13.7 million.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation that significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, under the Tax Act. The newly enacted federal income tax law contains significant changes in the taxation of foreign income earned by U.S. shareholders, specifically adding new rules related to low-taxed foreign earnings and allowing an exemption on foreign dividends paid after 2017. In anticipation of the tax exemption on foreign dividends, the law imposes a one-time repatriation tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been previously taxed in the U.S. Foreign earnings held in cash or liquid assets are taxed at 15.5% while earnings that have been reinvested are taxed at 8%.\nIncome tax expenses were $120.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and included impacts from the Tax Act as well as charges related to valuation allowances established on the Company’s deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company’s effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 267.5% compared to 23.4% of fiscal 2016 and (2.8)% for fiscal 2017, which also included the effect of non-deductible intangible asset impairment charges recognized during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to 25.1% for fiscal 2016. The impacts from the tax reform and the valuation allowances resulted in combined charges of $106.7 million or $2.20 per share, and were not contemplated in our guidance range provided on November 7, 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recognized a charge of $86.4 million related to the one-time repatriation tax that was partially offset by the release of $52.8 million in deferred tax liabilities for foreign earnings not indefinitely reinvested resulting in a net charge of $33.6 million. After applying foreign tax credit carry forwards and the current year net operating tax loss, the actual cash repatriation tax liability is $15.7 million payable over 8 years. Due to the reduction in the statutory U.S. tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Act, the Company recorded a charge of $28.9 million reflecting the revaluation of its deferred tax assets. The Company also recorded expense of $44.2 million for valuation allowances against U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter. Given recent operating losses, the Company has reserved against all of the deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain international subsidiaries. The Company is pursuing an aggressive series of actions to drive efficiencies throughout the organization, stream-line operations, and enhance margins with a focus on the customer and ultimately drive significant improvements to profitability. As we generate taxable income in the future, these deferred tax assets could be realized over time.\nAccounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in interpreting and applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company has made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements for fiscal 2017. As the Company collects and prepares necessary data, and interprets any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act will be completed in 2018.\nThe Company is also reviewing its income tax projections for future periods in light of the changes imposed by the new tax legislation, particularly the GILTI provisions that target low-taxed foreign intangible earnings. Because of the complexity of these new GILTI provisions, the Company is continuing to evaluate this provision. The Company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of the GILTI provision of the Tax Act and has not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in its financial projections. Therefore, the Company has provided a range of fiscal 2018 income tax expense estimates excluding any impacts from GILTI.\nOther Developments\nOn January 29, 2018, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Second A&R Credit Agreement\"). The Second A&R Credit Agreement provides for (i) revolving credit loans in the amount of $325 million, subject to a borrowing base, with an up to $45.0 million subfacility for letters of credit, and (ii) a term loan made to the Company in the amount of $425 million. The Second A&R Credit Agreement expires and is due and payable on December 31, 2020.\nGuidance\nOver the next several years, Fossil Group will continue to transform the Company’s business model to address changes in consumer behaviors and their purchases of traditional watches and connected devices, as well as jewelry and leathers. During the Company’s ongoing transformation project, it believes certain operating metrics are the most appropriate performance measures. These metrics include net sales, gross margin, operating expenses, operating margin, interest expense and Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe Company is providing guidance on a GAAP basis. For comparison purposes, the Company has also provided additional information which quantifies the estimated impact on its operating expenses and operating income for non-operational items impacting operating results for fiscal 2018 and Q1 of fiscal 2018.\nGAAP Guidance\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company expects the following:\nNet sales in the range of (14)% to (6)% Gross margin in the range of 51% to 53% Operating expenses as a percent of net sales, including restructuring charges, ranging from 49% to 51% Operating margin in the range of 0% to 4% Other income/(expense) of approximately $(10) million based on prevailing currency rates Interest expense of approximately $50 million Income (loss) before income taxes in the range of $(60) million to $40 million\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company expects the following:\nNet sales in the range of (12)% to (6)% Gross margin in the range of 50% to 52% Operating expenses as a percent of net sales, including restructuring charges, ranging from 58% to 61% Operating margin in the range of (11)% to (6)% Other income/(expense) of approximately $(2) million based on prevailing currency rates Interest expense of approximately $12 million Income (loss) before income taxes in the range of $(70) million to $(45) million\nAdjusted EBITDA is non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, guidance or financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as the sum of income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, amortization and depreciation and other non-cash charges (such as impairment), stock-based compensation expenses, and restructuring charges minus interest income. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors about the Company's operating performance on a constant currency basis for the periods presented without the impact of certain items. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its operating performance period-over-period. The Company expects the following non-operational items to impact results during fiscal 2018:\nNon-operational and Non-GAAP Items\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company expects the following:\nRestructuring charges of approximately $50 million Adjusted EBITDA of $150 million to $200 million\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company expects the following:\nRestructuring charges of approximately $20 million Adjusted EBITDA of $(15) million to $10 million\nBelow is a reconciliation of forward-looking GAAP Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes to Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2017 and 2018 guidance based on the mid-point of the Company's guidance range:\nGuidance ($ in millions): Fiscal Year\n2017 Fiscal Year\n2018 First\nQuarter\nFiscal 2018 Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ (454 ) $ (13 ) $ (55 ) Plus: Interest Expense 43 50 12 Amortization and Depreciation 81 70 16 Impairment Expense 411 — — Other Non-cash Charges 46 — — Stock-based Compensation 31 26 6 Restructuring Expense 48 50 20 Less: Interest Income 5 3 1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 201 $ 180 $ (2 ) Note that due to relatively low levels of Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes in the near term, as well as the combined impact of the modified territorial tax program under the Tax Act and deferred tax asset valuation reserve accounting, the Company’s effective tax rate is expected to have unusual variations and occasionally an inverse relationship to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes.\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements contained herein that are not historical facts, including multi-year profit improvement estimates, the success of our connected accessories, future financial guidance as well as estimated impacts from the Tax Act, foreign currency translation, amortization expense, foreign tax credits, non-cash impairments and restructuring charges, constitute “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

The Company presents constant currency information to provide investors with a basis to evaluate how its underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The constant currency financial information presented herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNet Sales Net Sales For the 13 Weeks Ended For the 52 Weeks Ended December 30, 2017 December 30, 2017 ($ in millions) As\nReported Impact of\nForeign\nCurrency\nExchange\nRates Constant\nCurrency As\nReported Impact of\nForeign\nCurrency\nExchange\nRates Constant\nCurrency Segment: Americas $ 441.7 $ 2.6 $ 439.1 $ 1,316.2 $ 2.0 1,314.2 Europe 336.6 24.2 312.4 974.2 18.8 955.4 Asia 142.5 3.1 139.4 497.8 2.5 495.3 Total net sales $ 920.8 $ 29.9 $ 890.9 $ 2,788.2 $ 23.3 $ 2,764.9 Product Categories: Watches $ 727.9 $ 22.9 $ 705.0 $ 2,199.0 $ 18.3 $ 2,180.7 Leathers 107.6 3.1 104.5 325.5 2.4 323.1 Jewelry 71.8 3.6 68.2 211.7 2.4 209.3 Other 13.5 0.3 13.2 52.0 0.2 51.8 Total net sales $ 920.8 $ 29.9 $ 890.9 $ 2,788.2 $ 23.3 $ 2,764.9 Items Impacting Comparison of Fiscal 2017 Operations to Fiscal 2016 Operations\nThe following table quantifies the estimated impact on the Company's operating income (loss), net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share related to non-operating charges for non-cash intangible asset impairments, unfavorable impacts from the Tax Act and valuation allowance and restructuring charges for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Numbers may not add due to rounding.\nThe Company believes that the fiscal 2016 and 2017 operating income (loss), net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share measures are useful to investors in comparing the Company's projected financial performance year-over-year without the impact of intangible asset impairment and tax charges related to the Tax Act and valuation allowance in 2017 and restructuring charges in both fiscal 2016 and 2017. The Company uses the fiscal 2016 and 2017 non-GAAP operating income (loss), net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share measures to evaluate its operating performance year-over-year. The non-GAAP financial measures presented herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, guidance or financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The tables below are in millions of dollars, except for per share information.\nFiscal Year 2017 Fiscal Year 2016 Reported Intangible\nImpairment Tax Act\nand\nValuation\nAllowance Restructuring\nCharges Adjusted\n(Non-GAAP) Reported Restructuring\nCharges Adjusted\n(Non-\nGAAP) Net Sales $ 2,788 $ — $ — $ — $ 2,788 $ 3,042 $ — $ 3,042 Operating Income (loss) (424 ) 407 — 48 31 127 28 155 Net Income (478 ) 343 107 31 3 79 18 97 EPS (Diluted) $ (9.87 ) $ 7.07 $ 2.20 $ 0.65 $ 0.05 $ 1.63 $ 0.37 $ 2.00\nFourth Fiscal Quarter 2017 Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2016 Reported Tax Act\nand\nValuation\nAllowance Restructuring\nCharges Adjusted (Non-\nGAAP) Reported Restructuring\nCharges Adjusted (Non\n-GAAP) Net Sales $ 921 $ — $ — $ 921 $ 959 $ — $ 959 Operating Income (loss) 51 — 6 57 66 13 79 Net Income (80 ) 107 4 31 50 9 59 EPS (Diluted) $ (1.65 ) $ 2.20 $ 0.09 $ 0.64 $ 1.03 $ 0.18 $ 1.21\nSource:Fossil Group, Inc.",
