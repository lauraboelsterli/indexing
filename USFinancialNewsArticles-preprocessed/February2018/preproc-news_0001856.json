    "text": "(Reuters) - Trucking firm Schneider National Inc’s ( SNDR.N ) quarterly profit and revenue topped analysts’ forecasts, boosted by higher prices and robust freight demand in a strengthening U.S. economy.\nThe company, which operates one of the largest for-hire trucking fleets in North America, also forecast yearly adjusted earnings of $1.32 to $1.44 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $1.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe Green Bay, Wisconsin-based company’s profit rose year-over-year to $283.9 million from $47.8 million, gaining from a tax-related benefit of $193.7 million.\nAdjusted for one-time items, earnings were 33 cents per share, edging past analysts’ expectations of 32 cents.\nSchneider said revenue rose 11.3 percent to $1.19 billion. Analysts had expected $1.15 billion.\nReporting by Sanjana Shivdas and Eric Johnson; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ",
