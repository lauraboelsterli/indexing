    "text": "February 1, 2018 / 9:45 AM / in 23 minutes Groningen output of 19.5-21 bcm would guarantee supply this winter -grid Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nAMSTERDAM, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Gasunie, operator of the Dutch gas grid, on Thursday advised the government that production at the Groningen onshore natural gas field could be limited to 19.5-21 billion cubic metres (bcm) this winter while still guaranteeing supply, lower than the 21.6 bcm currently approved. \nGasunieâ€™s analysis calls for allowing gas production to fluctuate depending on temperatures, which seismic experts say would worsen earthquakes it causes. If production levels are allowed to fluctuate, Gasunie said, a cold winter would require production of as much as 27 bcm and a mild one as little as 14 bcm.
