    "text": "Bradley Beal scored 24 points and Otto Porter Jr. added 23 as the Washington Wizards defeated the visiting Philadelphia 76ers 109-94 on Sunday night.\nWashington’s victory ended a seven-game Philadelphia winning streak, which was the longest active run in the Eastern Conference.\nThe home team won each of the clubs’ four meetings this season. This was the eighth straight victory for the Wizards over the Sixers in Washington.\nThe Wizards improved to 9-3 since John Wall has been out due to left knee surgery. He is off crutches and should be sidelined at least three more weeks.\nWashington again moved the ball very well without Wall. The Wizards finished with 35 assists on 43 baskets, though they committed 19 turnovers.\nKelly Oubre Jr. (19 points) and Marcin Gortat (13 points and 10 rebounds) both pitched in for Washington.\nJoel Embiid led the Sixers with 25 points and 10 rebounds. Ben Simmons added 16 points for Philadelphia.\nThe game stayed close early with the Wizards taking a 30-28 lead after the first quarter. In the second quarter, Washington began pulling away thanks to Beal, Porter and Oubre.\nThe Wizards scored 17 of the half’s final 21 points. Porter closed things out with a long 3-pointer as time expired, giving Washington a 67-48 lead at the break.\nPorter and Oubre both finished with 16 points in the first half while Beal scored 12. Washington made nine 3-pointers in the first half as the Wizards amassed 22 assists on 27 baskets.\nThe Wizards remained in command in the second half as the Sixers tried to rally but never got closer than eight points.\nMultiple media reports Sunday indicated that forward Ersan Ilyasova was finishing his buyout with the Atlanta Hawks and then Would complete a deal with the 76ers. He played part of last season with Philadelphia.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
