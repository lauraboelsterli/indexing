    "text": "(Adds Gundlach quotes on Treasuries)\nNEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of Doubleline Capital, said on Wednesday that the \"low rate-low volatility\" market environment went on for so long that now \"the unwind will be turbulent and not over in a couple of days.\"\nGundlach, who is known as the Wall Street bond king, told Reuters that bitcoin was the \"lead horse\" of risk assets and its recent plunge has had a cascading effect on other risk assets.\nGundlach had correctly predicted that if the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield went above 2.63 percent, U.S. stock investors would be spooked.\n\"Clearly, the market gets shaky when the 10-year hits 2.85 percent,\" Gundlach said. \"Just look at this week, and today. Makes one consider what could be coming if 10s push over 3 and 30s (30-year Treasury bond) over 3.22 percent.\"\nThe 10-year yield is currently trading around 2.83 percent. Gundlach said it is \"hard to love bonds at even a 3 percent\" yield. \"Rising interest rates are a problem and the U.S. is in debt and there is massive bond supply,\" Gundlach said.\nLos Angeles-based DoubleLine oversees $118 billion in assets under management, as of December 2017.
