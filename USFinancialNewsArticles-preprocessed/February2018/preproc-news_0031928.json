    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nInvuity, Inc. (NASDAQ:IVTY), a leading medical technology company focused on minimal access surgery, today announces financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nQ4 and full year 2017 Highlights\nFourth quarter 2017 revenue grew 20% to $11.2 million compared to revenue of $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 revenue grew 22% to $39.6 million compared to revenue of $32.5 million in 2016. Disposable revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 grew 30% to $9.5 million compared to $7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Disposable revenue in the full year 2017 grew 32% to $32.3 million compared to revenue of $24.5 million in 2016. PhotonBlade® revenue, which is a component of disposable revenue, was $1.3 million in the fourth quarter.\n“We saw a strong debut of PhotonBlade in its first full quarter of launch, which combined with the growth of our other disposable products, resulted in 30% growth in disposable revenue. In addition, I am pleased to report that we made our first commercial sales of the Adapt Waveguide™ in the quarter. The Adapt is a flexible waveguide that can be used in conjunction with a variety of specialized retractors, increasing the number of procedures available to us and broadening our appeal in key surgical specialties, particularly gynecology,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Philip Sawyer. “We believe we are well positioned for strong growth in 2018.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenue was $11.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 20% from revenue of $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 driven by strong market acceptance of PhotonBlade and continued growth of the company’s other disposable products. For the 2017 full year, revenue was $39.6 million, an increase of 22% over revenue of $32.5 million in 2016.\nDisposable revenue was $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 30% from revenue of $7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the 2017 full year, revenue was $32.3 million, a 32% increase over revenue of $24.5 million in 2016. Disposable revenue comes from the sale of our single use devices; waveguides that are attached to our retractors, illuminated aspirators – both Yankauer and Frazier designs – and most recently the addition of PhotonBlade. These revenues are driven by per procedure adoption and represent the primary driver of our growth.\nGross margin for the fourth quarter was 66.7%. This is in line with the expectations we set on our last conference call when we discussed the impact that meaningful PhotonBlade sales and ongoing limited sales of PhotonVue® would have on gross margin. Gross margin was 74.3% for the same period in 2016. For the 2017 full year, gross margin was 70.5% in 2017, compared to 72.8% in 2016.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were $14.1 million and $63.1 million, respectively compared to $16.0 million and $62.3 million in the prior year periods.\nThe net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.4 million, or $0.43 loss per share, compared to a net loss of $9.6 million, or $0.56 loss per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The net loss for full-year 2017 was $39.9 million, or $2.34 loss per share, compared to $40.6 million, or $2.73 loss per share, for 2016.\nThe Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, included total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $21.0 million.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor fiscal 2018 Invuity expects revenue to exceed $46 million. The Company expects disposable revenue to grow in excess of 25% in 2018.\nConference Call\nInvuity's management will discuss the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter ended and full year ended December 31, 2017, and provide a general business update during a conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time / 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, February 13, 2018.
