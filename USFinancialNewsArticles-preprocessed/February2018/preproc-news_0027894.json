    "text": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sherritt International Corporation :\nNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES\nSherritt International Corporation (“Sherritt” or the “Corporation”) (TSX: S), a world leader in the mining and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts are in Canadian currency unless noted.\nCEO COMMENTARY\n“Sherritt ended 2017 with a significantly strengthened balance sheet and a much improved outlook as a result of a number of key developments over the past year,” said David Pathe, President and CEO of Sherritt International. “Most notably, we completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture, achieved our nickel and cobalt production as well as our unit cost targets at the Moa Joint Venture, and benefitted from higher realized prices for each of the primary commodities that we produce.”\nMr. Pathe added, “We have sustained this momentum since the start of 2018 with our first equity financing in more than a decade, and are currently conducting a modified Dutch auction tender process to reduce our debt even further. With the strong outlook for Class 1 nickel and cobalt given electric vehicle market trends and the maturities on our outstanding debentures not due until the fourth quarter of 2021, we are particularly encouraged by our prospects in 2018 and beyond.”\nQ4 HIGHLIGHTS\nSherritt and its partners successfully completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture. Following the restructuring, Sherritt eliminated $1.4 billion in debt from its balance sheet, retained a 12% ownership interest in Ambatovy and continues to serve as operator. Net direct cash cost (NDCC) (1) at the Moa Joint Venture (“Moa JV”) was US$1.80 per pound of finished nickel sold, the lowest total since the third quarter of 2004. The decline was primarily driven by higher cobalt prices and the US$0.50 per pound cost savings achieved with the commissioning of the third acid plant at Moa in the fourth quarter of 2016. Sherritt’s share of finished nickel production at the Moa JV was 4,134 tonnes, up 9% from Q4 2016, while its share of finished cobalt was 465 tonnes, up 22% from Q4 2016. Production increased on a year-over-year basis despite the negative impact heavy rains had on lowering mixed sulphide production in November and December 2017. Received $19.9 million from the Moa JV as repayment on its working capital facility and US$7.5 million in Cuban energy payments. Adjusted EBITDA was $49.6 million, up 33% from Q4 2016. Including a gain of $629.0 million related to the Ambatovy restructuring, earnings were $537.8 million, or $1.80 per share outstanding, up from a net loss of $106.7 million, or $0.36 per share outstanding, in Q4 2016.\n2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nSherritt ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $203.0 million after reflecting payments related to the Ambatovy JV restructuring, interest payments related to outstanding debentures and the $35.0 million repayment of a syndicated revolving-term loan. Sherritt’s share of finished nickel and finished cobalt production at the Moa JV were 15,762 tonnes and 1,801 tonnes, respectively. The production totals were in line with guidance for the year. NDCC at the Moa Joint Venture was US$2.35 per pound of finished nickel, below the US$2.80 - $3.30 per pound guidance that the Company provided for the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $149.8 million, up from $40.0 million in 2016. Including the gain related to the Ambatovy JV restructuring, net earnings were $293.8 million, or $0.99 per share outstanding, up from a net loss of $378.9 million, or $1.29 per share outstanding, in 2016. Sherritt’s efforts to strengthen its balance sheet were reflected in a number of improved financial ratios at year end. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA reduced from 48.9 at the end 2016 to 4.4 at December 31, 2017 while total debt to shareholders’ equity improved from 2.1 at the end of 2016 to 0.8 at December 31, 2017. (2)\nHIGHLIGHTS SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END\nClosed a unit offering financing transaction that generated gross proceeds of $132.0 million. Net proceeds will be used to reduce Sherritt’s outstanding indebtedness, for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth initiatives. Launched a modified Dutch Auction tender offer to repurchase up to $75.0 million of outstanding unsecured debentures. The tender offering is expected to close on February 16, 2017. Executed a three-year extension of the Puerto Escondido/Yumuri production sharing contract to 2021. Although facilities at the Ambatovy Joint Venture in Madagascar were impacted by Tropical Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm, all personnel were unhurt and safely accounted for. Damage to equipment and the acid production facilities resulted in a temporary halt in production. Repairs have since been completed and partial production has resumed. A ramp up in production is expected through the end of Q2 2018.\n(1) For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this press release.\n(2) Net debt is defined as debt due within one year plus the book value of long-term debt, less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as shown in Sherritt’s consolidated statement of financial position. Total debt is defined as debt due within one year plus the book value of long-term debt plus the non-recourse debt.\nQ4 AND 2017 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS For the three months ended For the years ended 2017 2016 2017 2016 $ millions, except per share amount December 31\nDecember 31\nChange\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\nChange Revenue 54.8\n70.5\n(22%)\n$ 267.3\n$ 262.3\n2% Combined Revenue (1) 223.8\n240.3\n(7%)\n917.5\n820.2\n12% Net earnings (loss) for the period 537.8\n(106.7)\n604% 293.8\n(378.9)\n178% Adjusted EBITDA (1) 49.6\n37.4\n33% 149.8\n40.0\n275% Cash provided (used) by continuing operations (33.9)\n(22.6)\n(50%)\n(9.6)\n1.6\n(700%)\nCombined free cash flow (1) (41.2)\n(45.5)\n9% (62.1)\n(111.9)\n45% Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share 1.85 (0.37)\n600% 1.04 (1.3)\n180% (1) For additional information, see the Non-GAAP measures section of this release. $ millions, except as otherwise noted, as at December 31\n2017\n2016\nChange Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments 203.0\n308.6\n(34%)\nNon-recourse loans and borrowings - 1,367.5\n(100%)\nOther loans and borrowings 824.1\n860.7\n(4%)\nIn Q4 2017, Sherritt generated negative cash flow from operations of $33.9 million. The consolidated total included $32.5 million in positive cash flow contributions from the Moa JV and Fort Site and $5.4 million in positive cash flow contributions from the Power division. Total transaction costs of $11.3 million related to the restructuring of the Ambatovy JV contributed negatively to the consolidated total.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at year end were $203.0 million, down from $290.3 million at September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by payments related to the restructuring of the Ambatovy JV, lower Cuban energy payments received and the repayment of $8.0 million in Q4 on the Company’s syndicated revolving-term loan and partly offset by a $19.9 million repayment from the Moa JV on its working capital facility to Sherritt.\nDuring Q4, US$7.5 million of Cuban energy payments were received compared to US$32.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. Total Cuban overdue receivables were US$132.6 million at December 31, 2017 compared to US$100.5 million at September 30, 2017. The increase in overdue receivables was attributable to a number of factors, including the impact of Hurricane Irma and resulting recovery costs on Cuba’s economy. Sherritt has experienced variability in its Cuban receivables over the years but has not incurred any losses related to any Cuban receivables.\nAdjusted earnings (loss) from continuing operations (1)\n2017 2016 For the three months ended December 31 $ millions $/share $ millions $/share Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations 552.9 1.85 (109.6) (0.37) Adjusting items, net of tax: Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss 24.1 0.08 25.7 0.09 Gain on Ambatovy restructuring (629.0) (2.11) - - Other 1.8 0.01 2.6 0.01 Adjusted net earnings (loss) from continuing operations (50.2) (0.17) (81.3) (0.28) 2017 2016 For the year ended December 31 $ millions $/share $ millions $/share Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations 308.9 1.04 (381.8) (1.30) Adjusting items, net of tax: Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss 7.7 0.03 (35.9) (0.12) Gain on Ambatovy restructuring (629.0) (2.12) - - Other (4.7) (0.02) (10.2) (0.03) Adjusted net earnings (loss) from continuing operations (317.1) (1.07) (427.9) (1.46) (1) For additional information, see the Non-GAAP measures section of this release.\nExcluding the gain from the restructuring of the Ambatovy JV, Sherritt incurred an adjusted net loss from operations of $50.2 million, or $0.17 per share outstanding, in Q4 2017. These compare to an adjusted net loss of $81.3 million, or $0.28 per share, for the same period of 2016.\nSherritt’s adjusted net loss for the 12-month period of 2017 was $317.1 million or $1.07 per share outstanding. These compare to an adjusted net loss of $427.9 million, or $1.46 per share outstanding, for 2016.\nREVIEW OF OPERATIONS\nMETALS\n$ millions except as otherwise noted, for the three months ended December 31 2017 2016 Moa JV & Ambatovy Moa JV and Ambatovy Fort Site (1) JV (2) Total Fort Site (1) JV (2) (50%) (12%) Other (3) (50%) (40%) Other (3) Total Change FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Revenue $ 122.9 $ 58.1 $ 3.0 $ 184.0 $ 92.5 $ 88.2 $ 14.9 $ 195.6 (6%) Earnings (loss) from operations 19.9 (7.7) - 12.2 (7.6) (15.0) 0.2 (22.4) 154% Adjusted EBITDA (4) 32.1 18.1 - 50.2 5.6 24.4 0.2 30.2 66% Cash provided (used) by operations 32.5 (3.4) (0.5) 28.6 (6.1) (0.8) 3.3 (3.6) 894% Free cash flow (4) 24.9 (20.7) (0.5) 3.7 (9.8) (10.6) 3.3 (17.1) 122% PRODUCTION VOLUMES (tonnes) Mixed Sulphides 4,090 3,329 - 7,419 3,674 6,036 - 9,710 (24%) Finished Nickel 4,134 3,111 - 7,245 3,782 5,111 - 8,893 (19%) Finished Cobalt 465 245 - 710 382 404 - 786 (10%) Fertilizer 61,923 10,011 - 71,934 61,460 16,650 - 78,110 (8%) NICKEL RECOVERY (%) 79% 84% 85% 87% SALES VOLUMES (tonnes) Finished Nickel 4,129 2,602 - 6,731 3,975 4,935 - 8,910 (24%) Finished Cobalt 480 225 - 705 487 360 - 847 (17%) Fertilizer 51,141 8,114 - 59,255 45,698 15,485 - 61,183 (3%) AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE (CAD/US) 1.271 1.334 (5%) AVERAGE REFERENCE PRICES (US$ per pound) Nickel $ 5.25 $ 4.90 7% Cobalt 31.60 13.51 134% AVERAGE-REALIZED PRICES (4) Nickel ($ per pound) $ 6.72 $ 6.56 $ - $ 6.66 $ 6.39 $ 6.50 $ - $ 6.45 3% Cobalt ($ per pound) 38.78 39.03 - 38.86 16.85 18.73 - 17.68 120% Fertilizer ($ per tonne) 348 173 - 324 326 160 - 284 14% UNIT OPERATING COSTS (4) (US$ per pound) Nickel - net direct cash cost $ 1.80 $ 3.27 - 2.37 $ 3.80 $ 3.10 - 3.41 (31%) SPENDING ON CAPITAL Sustaining $ 7.7 $ 10.0 $ - $ 17.7 $ 4.7 $ 19.0 $ - $ 23.7 (25%) Expansion - - - - (2.1) - - (2.1) 100% $ 7.7 $ 10.0 $ - $ 17.7 $ 2.6 $ 19.0 $ - $ 21.6 (15%) (1) Includes results for certain 100% owned assets at Fort Saskatchewan plant.\n(2) Sherritt’s share for Ambatovy Joint Venture reflects its interest at 40% to December 10, 2017 and 12% thereafter.\n(3) Includes results for Sherritt’s marketing organizations for certain Ambatovy and Moa Joint Venture sales.\n(4) For additional information, see the Non-GAAP measures section of this release.\n$ millions, except as otherwise noted, for the years ended December 31 2017 2016 Moa JV and Ambatovy Moa JV and Ambatovy Fort Site (1) JV (2) Fort Site (1) JV (2) (50%) (12%) Other (3) Total (50%) (40%) Other (3) Total Change FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Revenue $ 417.0 $ 279.2 $ 43.1 $ 739.3 $ 339.3 $ 264.8 $ 48.0 $ 652.1 13% Earnings (loss) from operations 31.3 (109.5) 0.9 (77.3) (28.4) (150.9) 0.8 (178.5) 57% Adjusted EBITDA (4) 80.5 26.0 0.9 107.4 19.6 (7.0) 0.8 13.4 701% Cash provided (used) by operations 58.3 (26.7) 3.0 34.6 (2.7) (34.6) 3.1 (34.2) 201% Free cash flow (4) 37.4 (55.6) 3.0 (15.2) (33.9) (55.9) 3.1 (86.7) 82% PRODUCTION VOLUMES (tonnes) Mixed Sulphides 17,297 14,836 - 32,133 16,923 18,271 - 35,194 (9%) Finished Nickel 15,762 13,618 - 29,380 16,464 16,842 - 33,306 (12%) Finished Cobalt 1,801 1,173 - 2,974 1,847 1,309 - 3,156 (6%) Fertilizer 243,682 43,118 - 286,800 256,812 53,908 - 310,720 (8%) NICKEL RECOVERY (%) 85% 85% 87% 86% SALES VOLUMES (tonnes) Finished Nickel 15,679 13,694 - 29,373 16,402 16,844 - 33,246 (12%) Finished Cobalt 1,783 1,220 - 3,003 1,846 1,281 - 3,127 (4%) Fertilizer 178,491 42,016 - 220,507 167,525 52,482 - 220,007 - AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE (CAD/USD) 1.299 1.325 (2%) AVERAGE REFERENCE PRICES (US$ per pound) Nickel $ 4.72 $ 4.36 8% Cobalt 26.53 11.77 125% AVERAGE-REALIZED PRICES (4) Nickel ($ per pound) $ 6.14 $ 6.05 $ - $ 6.10 $ 5.63 $ 5.66 $ - $ 5.65 8% Cobalt ($ per pound) 32.98 33.35 - 33.13 14.82 16.08 - 15.33 116% Fertilizer ($ per tonne) 361 168 - 325 377 164 - 326 - UNIT OPERATING COSTS (US$ per pound) (4) Nickel - net direct cash cost $ 2.35 $ 3.83 $ - $ 3.04 $ 3.42 $ 4.27 $ - $ 3.85 (21%) SPENDING ON CAPITAL Sustaining $ 20.9 $ 44.2 $ - $ 65.1 $ 22.6 $ 33.1 $ - $ 55.7 17% Expansion - - - - 10.3 - - 10.3 (100%) $ 20.9 $ 44.2 $ - $ 65.1 $ 32.9 $ 33.1 $ - $ 66.0 (25%) (1) Includes results for certain 100% owned assets at Fort Saskatchewan plant.\n(2) Sherritt’s share for Ambatovy Joint Venture reflects its interest at 40% to December 10, 2017 and 12% thereafter.\n(3) Includes results for Sherritt’s marketing organizations for certain Ambatovy and Moa Joint Venture sales.\n(4) For additional information, see the Non-GAAP measures section of this release.\nMETAL MARKETS\nNickel\nNickel prices rallied in the second half of 2017 after experiencing considerable volatility in the first six months of the year. The average nickel reference price in the fourth quarter was US$5.25 per pound, up 7% from US$4.90 for Q4 2016. The average nickel reference price for the 12-months of 2017 was US$4.72 per pound, up 8% from US$4.36 per pound for 2016.\nThe year-over-year price improvements were largely driven by the growing understanding of the important role that Class 1 nickel will play in the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) market. Class 1 nickel, along with cobalt, are key elements needed to manufacture EV batteries. Demand for Class 1 nickel and cobalt are expected to grow significantly beginning in 2019 when China expects to begin production quotas requiring that 10% of all vehicles manufactured be electric.\nDuring Q4, the nickel price was supported by news that nickel pig iron (NPI) producers in China were asked to reduce production to alleviate pollution with China’s largest NPI-only producer ordered to halve production from November 2017 to March 2018. Actual and anticipated reductions from existing nickel producers also continued to help underpin the nickel price, with nickel supply expected to be in a deficit for 2018 and 2019.\nNickel reference price improvements in the second half were also driven by the decline in inventories. Combined LME and SHFE nickel inventories at year-end declined to 410,828 tonnes (from 464,696 tonnes at the beginning of the year). Any further decline in visible inventories could give momentum to nickel price increases in the future.\nCobalt\nCobalt prices strengthened considerably in 2017. The average reference price in the fourth quarter was US$31.60 per pound for 2017, up 134% from Q4 2016. The average reference cobalt price for the 12-month period of 2017 was US$26.53, up 125% from US$11.77 per pound for 2016.\nThe price increase is primarily linked to the growing strong demand emanating from the EV battery market. The double-digit price growth experienced over the past year was also driven by geopolitical and supply risk concerns given that the Democratic Republic of Congo is currently the world’s largest source of cobalt.\nAs cobalt prices have a limited impact on overall battery pack costs, high prices are not expected to cause supply-chain disruptions or delay EV market growth. As a result, the risk of cobalt substitution in EV battery production in the near term is relatively low given cobalt’s unique energy transference properties. While battery manufacturers continue to explore alternatives to cobalt, the likely beneficiary of any substitution is expected to be Class 1 nickel.\nCobalt supply deficits are expected to continue over the next few years. In addition to demand from industrial end users, speculative investors are also driving up cobalt prices by stockpiling inventory, further exacerbating supply deficit concerns.\nMoa Joint Venture (50% interest) and Fort Site (100%)\nThe Moa JV produced 4,134 tonnes of finished nickel in Q4 2017, up from 3,782 tonnes produced in Q4 2016, despite mixed sulphides production being negatively impacted by abnormally heavy rainfalls in November and December 2017. Finished nickel production on a 12-month basis was 15,679 tonnes in 2017, in line with expectations for the year.\nQ4 2017 revenue for the Moa JV and the Fort Site totaled $123.0 million, up 32% from $92.5 million last year. The growth was driven by higher production and higher realized prices for nickel, cobalt and fertilizer. Nickel sales represented 50% of total Q4 2017 revenue while cobalt sales represented 33%. Fertilizer sales in Q4 2017 were up 19% from last year, reflecting stronger demand and higher realized prices.\nMining, processing and refining (MPR) costs for Q4 2017 were US$4.89 per pound, down from US$4.93 per pound for Q4 2016. The decline was largely due to higher production volumes in Q4 2017. MPR costs on the full-year basis were US$4.80 per pound for 2017, up from US$4.63 per pound for 2016. The US$0.17 increase per pound in 2017 was attributable to higher energy costs, although partly offset by cost savings of approximately US$0.50 per pound achieved with the commissioning of the third acid plant at Moa in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDespite higher energy and sulphur input costs, Moa’s NDCC of US$1.80/lb of finished nickel in Q4 2017 was the lowest experienced since Q3 2004. The cobalt credit of US$3.54/lb reflects Moa’s high cobalt to nickel production ratio as well as the 125% growth in cobalt prices since Q4 2016. NDCC improvement also benefited from the commissioning of a third sulphuric acid plant at Moa in 2016 that generated approximate savings of US$0.50/lb. NDCC on a 12-month basis was $2.35/lb, down from $3.42/lb for 2016. NDCC for 2017 was significantly lower than expectations for the year, due largely to higher cobalt by-product credits.\nCash provided by operations in Q4 2017 totaled $32.5 million, up from a loss in Q4 2016 when Hurricane Matthew and the subsequent collapse of bridge infrastructure negatively impacted production. Cash flow from operations in Q4 2017 was also positively impacted higher realized nickel and cobalt prices..\nMoa’s sustaining capital spending in Q4 2017 was $7.7 million, up from $4.7 million in Q4 last year. The increase was attributable to the timing of expenditures.\nAmbatovy Joint Venture (12% interest effective December 11, 2017)\nAlong with its partners, Sherritt completed the restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture on December 11, 2017. The restructuring led to Sherritt’s ownership interest being reduced to 12% in exchange for the elimination of $1.4 billion of debt. Sherritt’s financial and operational results at Ambatovy are presented on a 40% basis to December 10, 2017 and on a 12% basis effective December 11, 2017. Sherritt will continue to serve as operator of Ambatovy at least through 2024, however, as a result of the reduction in its ownership interest, Sherritt’s ability to direct local decision-making at Ambatovy has diminished.\nFinished nickel production at Ambatovy in Q4 2017 was 3,111 tonnes, down from 5,111 tonnes for the comparable period of 2016, which represented Ambatovy’s highest ever production total. The year-over-year decline was due to a number of developments that impacted plant reliability. Most notably, the failure of an economizer in one of the acid plants reduced production capacity to approximately 50% during November and December of 2017.\nFinished nickel production on a 12-month basis for 2017 was 13,618 tonnes, down from 16,842 tonnes for 2016. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to equipment failures that reduced the reliability of Ambatovy’s acid plant and pressure acid leach circuit. Maintenance activities and replacement of equipment completed in 2017 are expected to improve plant reliability and production stability over time.\nFinished cobalt production in Q4 2017 was 245 tonnes, down from 404 tonnes for the same period of 2016. The decrease was tied to plant reliability issues previously cited that lowered production. Cobalt production for 2017 was 1,173 tonnes, down from 1,309 tonnes for 2016.\nMPR costs for Q4 2017 were US$5.76 per pound, up from US$3.97 per pound in Q4 2016. MPR costs on a full-year basis were US$6.01 per pound in 2017, up from US$4.89 per pound in 2016. The year-over-year increases were largely due to higher input costs as well as lower production volumes in 2017.\nNDCC for finished nickel at Ambatovy in Q4 2017 was $3.26/lb, up from the $3.10/lb for Q4 2016. The increase was due to lower production, higher maintenance costs, higher energy and sulphur input costs offset by higher cobalt by-product credits. NDCC on a 12-month basis $3.83/lb for 2017, down from $4.27/lb for 2016. Ambatovy’s NDCC for 2017 places it slightly above the 50 th percentile of industry average cost.\nSubsequent to year end, facilities at the Ambatovy Joint Venture were impacted by Tropical Cyclone Ava, a Category 2 hurricane equivalent storm. Damage to equipment and the acid production facilities resulted in a temporary halt in production. Repairs have since been completed and partial production has resumed. A ramp up in production is expected through the end of Q2 2018.\nOIL AND GAS\nFor the three months ended For the years ended 2017 2016 2017 2016 $ millions, except as otherwise noted December 31 December 31 Change December 31 December 31 Change FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Revenue $ 27.7 $ 30.6 (9%) $ 127.0 $ 108.6 17% Earnings (loss) from operations 7.9 2.8 182% 33.6 (16.3) 306% Adjusted EBITDA (1) 10.5 11.6 (9%) 61.9 35.6 74% Cash provided by operations (2.3) 11.4 (120%) 30.8 76.4 (60%) Free cash flow (1) (9.9) 3.3 (400%) 8.9 50.4 (82%) PRODUCTION AND SALES (bopd) Gross working-interest (GWI) - Cuba 10,378 14,470 (28%) 13,479 15,452 (13%) Total net working-interest (NWI) 6,101 8,163 (25%) 7,856 9,483 (17%) AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE (CAD/USD) 1.271 1.334 (5%) 1.299 1.325 (2%) AVERAGE REFERENCE PRICE (US$ per barrel) West Texas Intermediate (WTI) $ 55.19 $ 49.21 12% $ 50.78 $ 43.37 17% Gulf Coast Fuel Oil No. 6 52.81 41.12 28% 47.02 32.13 46% Brent 61.77 48.53 27% 54.18 43.31 25% AVERAGE-REALIZED PRICE (1) (NWI) Cuba ($ per barrel) $ 48.82 $ 39.75 23% $ 43.81 $ 29.93 46% UNIT OPERATING COSTS (1) (GWI) Cuba ($ per barrel) $ 12.24 $ 10.95 12% $ 9.78 $ 9.75 - SPENDING ON CAPITAL (2) Development, facilities and other $ (1.4) $ 0.4 (450%) $ (1.7) $ 8.9 (119%) Exploration 8.6 7.8 10% 21.1 17.0 24% $ 7.2 $ 8.2 (12%) $ 19.4 $ 25.9 (25%) (1) For additional information, see the Non-GAAP measures section of this release.\n(2) Spending on capital includes accruals.\nGross working-interest oil production in Q4 2017 in Cuba was 10,378 barrels of oil per day (bopd), down from 14,470 bopd for the comparable period of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the expiration of the Varadero West Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in November 2017 and natural reservoir declines. Gross working-interest oil production on a 12-month basis for 2017 was 13,479 bopd, in line with guidance for the year.\nRevenue in Q4 2017 was $27.7 million, down 9% from $30.6 million for last year. The decline was due to lowered production, partially offset by an increase in realized prices of 23% to $48.82 per barrel in Cuba, though partially offset by the negative impact of a stronger Canadian dollar. Revenue on a full-year basis was $127.0 million, up 17%. The increase was driven largely by higher realized prices.\nTotal net working interest production for Q4 2017 was 6,101 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from 8,163 barrels in the same period of 2016. The decline was due to lower cost-recovery spending, the impact of the expiration of the Varadero West PSC already cited and the impact of higher oil prices in the current year period.\nUnit operating costs in Q4 2017 in Cuba were $12.24 per barrel, up 12% from $10.95 in Q4 2016, driven largely by reduced production. On a full-year basis, unit costs in Cuba were $9.78 in line with 2017 guidance.\nCapital spending in Q4 2017 totaled $7.2 million and was largely focused on Block 10 drilling activities. Drilling of the second development well began in August and was temporarily suspended in December 2017. Drilling results for the second well on Block 10 are expected in Q3 of 2018.\nPOWER For the three months ended For the years ended 2017 2016 2017 2016 $ millions (33 ⅓% basis), except as otherwise noted December 31 December 31 Change December 31 December 31 Change FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Revenue $ 12.0 $ 13.7 (12%) $ 51.2 $ 58.6 (13%) Earnings (loss) from operations (0.6) (1.3) 54% 5.2 (5.3) 198% Adjusted EBITDA (1) 5.5 7.4 (26%) 30.1 29.5 2% Cash provided by operations 5.4 (3.3) 264% 44.5 8.0 456% Free cash flow (1) 5.3 (3.7) 243% 43.0 7.0 514% PRODUCTION AND SALES Electricity (GWh) 201 224 (10%) 848 894 (5%) AVERAGE-REALIZED PRICE (1) Electricity ($/MWh) $ 54.01 $ 56.24 (4%) $ 55.15 $ 56.10 (2%) UNIT OPERATING COSTS (1) ($/MWh) Base 20.66 22.39 (8%) 16.48 17.70 (7%) Non-base (2) 2.77 2.34 18% 2.81 5.24 (46%) 23.43 24.73 (5%) 19.29 22.94 (16%) NET CAPACITY FACTOR (%) 62 66 (6%) 67 70 (4%) SPENDING ON CAPITAL AND SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS (3) Sustaining $ 0.1 $ 0.4 (75%) $ 1.5 $ 1.0 50% Service concession arrangements - 0.1 (100%) - 4.6 (100%) $ 0.1 $ 0.5 (80%) $ 1.5 $ 5.6 (73%) (1) For additional information see the Non-GAAP measures section of this release.\n(2) Costs incurred at the Boca de Jaruco and Puerto Escondido facilities that otherwise would have been capitalized if these facilities were not accounted for as service concession arrangements.\n(3) Spending on capital includes accruals.\nPower production in Q4 2017 was 201 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of electricity, down 10% from 224 GWh for the comparable period of 2016. The decline was largely due to reduced gas supply. Power production on a 12-month basis was 848 GWh for 2017, down from 894 GWh for 2016.\nAverage realized prices in Q4 2017 declined to $54.01 per Megawatt hour (“MWh’) of electricity from $56.24 per MWh in Q4 2016. The decline was due to the appreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. currency.\nRevenue in Q4 2017 totaled $12.0 million, down 15% from $13.7 million for Q4 2016. The decrease is attributable to lower production and lower realized prices. Revenue on a full-year basis was $51.2 million, down from $58.6 million for 2016.\nCash flow from operations in Q4 2017 grew by 264% to $5.3 million due to changes in working capital in the quarter.\nUnit operating cost in Q4 2017 was $23.43 per MWh of electricity, down 5% from $24.73 per MWh for Q4 2016. The decrease was due principally to reduced maintenance activities at the Boca and Puerto Escondido facilities this year.\nTotal capital spending in Q4 2017 was $0.1 million, down from $0.4 million for the comparable period of last year. For the full year, the decline in capital spending was primarily due to the absence of service concession spending this year.\n2017 REVIEW OF STRATEGIC PRIORITIES\nThe table below lists Sherritt’s Strategic Priorities in 2017, and summarizes how the Corporation performed against those priorities in 2017.\nStrategic Priorities 2017 Actions Status PRESERVE LIQUIDITY AND BUILD BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH\nFinalize long-term Ambatovy equity and funding structure Restructuring of the Ambatovy Joint Venture was completed on December 11, 2017 and resulted in the elimination of $1.4 billion of debt and reduction of Sherritt’s ownership interest to 12% from 40%. Optimize working capital and receivables collection Management continues to take action to expedite Cuban energy receipts. Outstanding receivables at year end were US$132.6 million. The year-over-year growth was due to Cuba’s reduced liquidity, including the impact of Hurricane Irma and resulting recovery costs had on the country’s economy. Operate Metals and Power businesses to be free cash flow neutral or better The Oil and Gas and Power divisions generated positive free cash flow in 2017. The Moa JV generated sufficient operating cash flow to repay $31.7 million on its working capital facility. OPTIMIZE OPPORTUNITIES IN CUBAN ENERGY BUSINESS\nDetermine future capital allocation based on results from first two wells drilled on Block 10 The results from the first well have provided constructive data to optimize the drilling of the second well, again targeting the Lower Veloz formation. Drilling on the second well at Block 10 has been temporarily suspended to determine the best option to reach the target reservoir. Drilling results from the second well are expected in Q3 2018. UPHOLD GLOBAL OPERATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN FINISHED NICKEL LATERITE PRODUCTION\nFurther reduce NDCC at Moa and Ambatovy towards the goal of achieving or remaining in the lowest quartile of global nickel cash costs Q4 NDCC of US$1.80/lb at the Moa JV is the lowest since Q3 2004. Moa’s NDCC ranked it within the lowest cost quartile for the third consecutive quarter. Ambatovy’s NDCC of US$3.83/lb for 2017 marked an improvement from last year, but was below expectations due to lower production and higher maintenance costs. Increase Ambatovy production and predictability over 2016 Ambatovy production in 2017 experienced a number of unanticipated challenges and resulted in several unplanned maintenance activities. Initiatives, such as replacing certain equipment, are being implemented to improve asset reliability. Achieve peer leading performance in environmental, health, safety and sustainability In 2017, Sherritt joined the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) and began implementing MAC’s Towards Sustainable Mining program, an internationally recognized sustainability standard. In safety, Sherritt met its recordable incident frequency target, but exceeded its injury frequency target for the year. No significant environmental or community-related incidents were recorded in 2017. The company received five distinct honours for leadership in sustainability management and reporting during the year. 2018 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES\nThe table below lists Sherritt’s Strategic Priorities for 2018. As we execute on our 2018 Strategic Priorities, protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities will continue to be our top priority.
