    "text": "GLEN ALLEN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dynex Capital, Inc. (NYSE:DX) reported its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results today. As previously announced, the Company's quarterly conference call to discuss these results is today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time and may be accessed using conference ID 7279346 via telephone in the U.S. at 1-866-393-4306 (internationally at 1-734-385-2616 or by live webcast which includes a slide presentation, the link for which is provided under “Investor Center” on the Company's website ( www.dynexcapital.com ).\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nComprehensive income to common shareholders of $0.08 per common share and net income to common shareholders of $0.36 per common share Core net operating income to common shareholders, a non-GAAP measure, of $0.20 per common share Dividend declared of $0.18 per common share Book value per common share of $7.34 at December 31, 2017 compared to $7.46 at September 30, 2017 and $7.18 at December 31, 2016 Continued rotation into 30-year fixed-rate Agency RMBS Leverage including TBA dollar roll positions of 6.4x shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2017\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nComprehensive income to common shareholders of $0.93 per common share and net income to common shareholders of $0.46 per common share Core net operating income to common shareholders of $0.73 per common share Dividends declared of $0.72 per share Economic return on book value per common share of 12.3%\nManagement's Remarks\nByron Boston, President and CEO commented, “We had a very strong year for our shareholders as we posted a total economic return of 12.3% on common equity. We earned $0.93 in comprehensive income in 2017 and closed the year with a solid $0.20 in core earnings per share for the fourth quarter as we benefited from the favorable CMBS/RMBS mix in our portfolio and the capital reallocation and hedging decisions we made earlier in the year.”\nMr. Boston continued, “As we enter 2018, markets are bearish on interest rate sensitive stocks given current Federal Reserve monetary policy, an improving global economy, and higher interest rates. As has been the case over the last several years, we believe that markets will continue to experience intermittent periods of volatility in 2018. Longer-term, our view today is that a rise in interest rates may be limited by macroeconomic headwinds, such as the historically high and rapidly increasing amount of global debt. We also believe the Federal Reserve will raise the Federal Funds rate in an orderly and well telegraphed manner, which should improve our ability to manage our net interest spread. Regulatory reform may also evolve in 2018, potentially providing new investment opportunities.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Summary\nComprehensive income to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.5 million versus $13.6 million for the third quarter. Net income to common shareholders was $19.1 million for the fourth quarter compared to $7.5 million for the prior quarter. Net income to common shareholders in the fourth quarter benefited from:\nan increase in net interest income primarily from a larger investment portfolio; an increase in gain on derivative instruments, net from higher interest rates; and a decrease in losses realized on investment sales.\nComprehensive income benefited from these items as well but declined from the third quarter of 2017 due to a net decline in the fair value of our available for sale investments of $(14.5) million. Core net operating income to common shareholders, a non-GAAP measure reconciled in the supplement to this release, benefited from an increase in adjusted net interest income primarily related to a larger investment portfolio, prepayment compensation received on CMBS and CMBS IO, and lower net periodic interest costs from interest rate swaps.\nBook Value and Economic Return\nBook value per common share decreased $(0.12) to $7.34 at December 31, 2017 from September 30, 2017 primarily due to higher rates during the quarter. For the year, book value per common share increased $0.16 primarily because of tightening credit spreads on MBS which more than offset the impact of higher interest rates. Economic return on book value was 0.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 12.3% for the full year 2017, including declared dividends of 10.1% and an increase in book value per common share of 2.2%. Economic return on book value is calculated by dividing (i) the sum of dividends declared per common share and the change in book value per common share by (ii) beginning book value per common share for the respective period.\nSummary of Investments and Related Financing\nThe Company continued to increase its investment in 30-year fixed-rate Agency RMBS during the fourth quarter, including both specified pools and net long positions in TBA securities (\"dollar roll positions\"). The Company purchased approximately $517.8 million of fixed-rate Agency RMBS including dollar roll positions during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $148.3 million in U.S. Treasuries, which grew our investment portfolio to over $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. The Company also sold $215.5 million in Agency CMBS that were nearing their maturities, had lower coupons, or had higher liquidity risk.\nThe following table provides details of our investment portfolio and dollar roll positions as of December 31, 2017:\nDecember 31, 2017 Type of Investment: Par Amortized\nCost/Implied\nCost Basis\nFair\nValue/Implied\nMarket Value\n($ in thousands) 30-year fixed-rate RMBS: 3.0% coupon $ 244,374 $ 246,155 $ 244,818 4.0% coupon 623,293 657,114 653,860 4.0% coupon TBA dollar roll positions (1) (2) (3) 795,000 829,425 830,908 Total 30-year fixed-rate 1,662,667 1,732,694 1,729,586 Adjustable-rate RMBS: 3.1% coupon (4) 278,886 289,305 285,583 Agency CMBS 1,123,967 1,134,409\n1,124,351 CMBS IO (5) n/a 683,833 692,522 Other non-Agency MBS 27,571 23,536 25,855 U.S. Treasuries 148,400 148,267 146,530 Total AFS portfolio and TBA dollar roll positions $ 3,241,491 $ 4,012,044 $ 4,004,427 (1) Par, implied cost basis, and implied market value of TBA dollar roll positions represents amounts for the underlying Agency MBS as if settled.\n(2) The net carrying value of TBA dollar roll positions, which is the difference between their implied market value and implied cost basis, was $1.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and is included on the consolidated balance sheet within “derivative assets”.\n(3) Excludes net short positions of TBA contracts used as hedges of interest rate risk exposure from fixed-rate Agency RMBS.\n(4) Represents the weighted average coupon based on amortized cost.\n(5) Includes both Agency and non-Agency IO securities.\nThe average effective yield on investments increased 12 basis points to 3.07% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior quarter primarily from the shift in the portfolio to fixed-rate Agency RMBS which earned a higher yield than the hybrid Agency ARMs that were sold during the year. The Company's cost of funds increased 5 basis points to 1.53% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of the increase in short-term interest rates. Adjusted costs of funds, a non-GAAP measure, decreased 7 basis points to 1.59% for the fourth quarter of 2017 from 1.66% for the prior quarter because the floating rate received on our pay-fixed receive-floating interest rate swaps increased for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter offsetting the impact from higher short-term interest rates.\nThe Company's net interest spread on its investments increased 7 basis points to 1.54% for the fourth quarter of 2017 from 1.47% for the third quarter of 2017, and adjusted net interest spread including drop income from TBA dollar roll positions was 1.52%, an increase of 8 basis points from the prior quarter.\nHedging Summary\nThe Company primarily uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on its earnings and book value. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the average net notional balance of current pay-fixed interest rate swaps outstanding was $3.0 billion at a weighted average net pay-fixed rate of 1.42%, which was relatively consistent with the average amounts outstanding during the prior quarter. As of December 31, 2017, the Company held interest rate swaps with a net notional balance of $5.7 billion and a weighted average remaining maturity of 3.1 years, which included approximately $2.5 billion of forward starting interest rate swaps. The following table provides details of the Company's interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2017:\nDecember 31, 2017 By Amount Expiring By Amount Effective Net Notional Weighted\nAverage Rate\nWeighted\nAverage\nNotional\nWeighted\nAverage Rate\n($ in thousands) 2018 $ 2,410,000 1.32% $ 2,277,699 1.71% 2019 160,000 1.37% 2,199,027 1.95% 2020 550,000 1.74% 1,840,451 2.13% 2021 200,000 1.93% 1,890,479 2.20% 2022 1,210,000 2.00% 1,838,795 2.35% 2023 — —% 1,145,000 2.52% 2024 100,000 2.17% 1,071,503 2.54% 2025 375,000 2.83% 813,973 2.47% 2026 450,000 2.31% 585,616 2.43% 2027 100,000 2.35% 140,822 2.69% 2028 and thereafter 120,000 2.76% 44,948 2.72% The Company will also periodically use Eurodollar futures and short positions in TBA securities to hedge interest rate risk exposure. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into $2.0 billion in Eurodollar futures with various maturities in 2018 as additional hedges of its exposure to increasing short-term interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, the Company also held a TBA short position with a notional of $150.0 million and a fair value of $(0.3) million to partially hedge the impact of interest rate risk on the fair value of its fixed-rate Agency RMBS.\nCompany Description\nDynex Capital, Inc. is an internally managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, which invests in mortgage assets on a leveraged basis. The Company invests in Agency and non-Agency RMBS, CMBS, and CMBS IO. Additional information about Dynex Capital, Inc. is available at www.dynexcapital.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the Company's operating results presented in accordance with GAAP, this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures including core net operating income to common shareholders (including per common share), adjusted interest expense, adjusted net interest income and the related metrics adjusted cost of funds and adjusted net interest spread. Because these measures are used in the Company's internal analysis of financial and operating performance, management believes that they provide greater transparency to our investors of management's view of our economic performance. Management also believes the presentation of these measures, when analyzed in conjunction with the Company's GAAP operating results, allows investors to more effectively evaluate and compare the performance of the Company to that of its peers, although the Company's presentation of its non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. Schedules reconciling core net operating income to common shareholders, adjusted interest expense, and adjusted net interest income to GAAP financial measures are provided as a supplement to this release.\nManagement views core net operating income to common shareholders as an estimate of the Company's financial performance excluding changes in fair value of its investments and derivatives. In addition to the non-GAAP reconciliation set forth in the supplement to this release, which derives core net operating income to common shareholders from GAAP net income to common shareholders as the nearest GAAP equivalent measure, core net operating income to common shareholders can also be determined by adjusting net interest income to include interest rate swap periodic interest costs, drop income on TBA dollar roll positions, general and administrative expenses, and preferred dividends. Management includes drop income, which is included in \"gain (loss) on derivatives instruments, net\" on the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income, in core net operating income and in adjusted net interest income because TBA dollar roll positions are viewed by management as economically equivalent to holding and financing Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements. Management also includes periodic interest costs from its interest rate swaps, which are also included in \"gain (loss) on derivatives instruments, net\", in adjusted net interest expense, and in adjusted net interest income because interest rate swaps are used by the Company to economically hedge the impact of changing interest rates on its borrowing costs from repurchase agreements, and including periodic interest costs from interest rate swaps is a helpful indicator of the Company’s total cost of financing in addition to GAAP interest expense. However, these non-GAAP measures do not provide a full perspective on our results of operations, and therefore, their usefulness is limited. For example, these non-GAAP measures do not include gains or losses from available-for-sale investments, changes in fair value of and costs of terminating interest rate swaps, as well as realized and unrealized gains or losses from any instrument used by management to economically hedge the impact of changing interest rates on its portfolio and book value per common share, such as Eurodollar futures and TBA short positions. As a result, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP results as reported on its consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
