World number 47 Khachanov was impeccable on serve, saving the meagre three break points Berdych had throughout the duel. The 21-year-old has now beaten former world number four Berdych in both their meetings having also prevailed at last yearâ€™s French Open. Pouille reached his second final of the season after a 6-3 7-6(6) defeat of Belarusian qualifier Ilya Ivashka. (Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Christian Radnedge)",
