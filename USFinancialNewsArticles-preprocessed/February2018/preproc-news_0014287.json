    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ION Geophysical Corporation (NYSE: IO) today reported revenues of $57.9 million in the fourth quarter 2017, a 64% increase compared to revenues of $35.4 million one year ago. ION's net loss was $1.4 million, or $(0.12) per share, compared to a net loss of $6.5 million, or $(0.55) per share in the fourth quarter 2016. Excluding special items in both periods, the Company reported an Adjusted net income of $4.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to an Adjusted net loss of $11.6 million, or $(0.99) per share in the fourth quarter 2016. A reconciliation of special items to the financial results can be found in the tables of this press release.\nThe Company reported an Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2017 of $23.8 million, compared to $6.6 million one year ago. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the closest comparable GAAP numbers can be found in the tables of this press release. The Company's Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2017 excludes an expense of $6.1 million related to the accelerated vesting and cash exercise of stock appreciation right awards. This accelerated vesting and cash exercise ultimately saved approximately $7 million of additional cash and expense that would have been incurred in the first quarter 2018.\nNet cash flows from operations were $18.0 million during the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $(1.7) million in the fourth quarter 2016. Total net cash flows, including investing and financing activities, were $11.8 million, compared to $(9.9) million in the fourth quarter 2016.\nBrian Hanson, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"I am pleased with our performance not only in the fourth quarter, but also for every quarter throughout 2017. Although the market recovery has been slow for many, our efforts over the last two years to focus on select segments where capital is flowing, along with our asset light strategy, has paid off. As a niche business in the larger E&P market, we surgically targeted select geographic areas and production optimization opportunities less dependent on cycle recovery and where our differentiated technologies delivered significant value.\n\"In our E&P Technology and Services group, we continued to benefit from our investment in multi-client data, generating solid growth in new venture revenues throughout the year. We had tremendous success with our 3D reimaging programs, expanding our 3D data library from 8,000 sq km to over 165,000 sq km in just two years. In addition, after two years of very little new venture activity, we launched five new programs in 2017, and already secured underwriting for new programs in 2018. Our data library is exceptionally well positioned for upcoming license round activity and 2018 is looking even better with more diverse interest in programs across the globe.\n\"In our E&P Operations Optimization segment, we maintained our core seismic software and equipment businesses while pursuing additional opportunities for our technology in adjacent markets. For example, we made significant headway in both executing deployments and developing the shrink-wrapped version of Marlin, our operations optimization platform. In 2017, Marlin deployments more than doubled with 39 new deployments across 19 projects, vastly improving the situational awareness, safety and efficiency for a wide array of offshore operational challenges. In addition, we offset some of the decline in seismic equipment revenues by selling existing technology to new customers in scientific, military and academic industries. We are particularly proud of the development effort to eliminate time-consuming calibrations for military diving platforms by incorporating our highly differentiated compass from our positioning solution. This is an example of some exciting investments we are making to broaden and diversify our customer base by modifying existing ION technology for adjacent markets outside of seismic.\n\"We expect 2018 will be a better year for ION, and as usual, believe the back half of the year will be stronger than the first half. With almost $68 million in liquidity, we have sufficient capital to retire our third lien indentures of $28.5 million, which mature May 15, 2018. Overall, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of a more normal 2018, and I look forward to speaking to you in more detail about our 2017 results and 2018 outlook on our earnings call.\"\nFor the full year 2017, the Company reported revenues of $197.6 million, compared to $172.8 million in 2016. Excluding Ocean Bottom Seismic Services revenues from 2016, revenues increased 45% from last year. ION's net loss was $30.2 million, or $(2.55) per share, compared to a net loss of $65.1 million, or $(5.71) per share in 2016. Excluding special items in both periods, the Company's Adjusted net loss was $19.1 million, or $(1.61) per share, compared to an Adjusted net loss of $66.1 million, or $(5.80) per share in 2016.\nFull year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $64.5 million, compared to $10.5 million in 2016. Net cash flows from operations were $28.0 million, compared to $1.6 million in 2016. Total net cash flows, including investing and financing activities, were $(0.6) million, compared to $(32.3) million in 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had total liquidity of $67.6 million, consisting of $52.1 million of cash on hand and $15.5 million of undrawn borrowing base available under its revolving credit facility. The borrowing base under this maximum $40.0 million credit facility was $25.5 million, and there was $10.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility at December 31, 2017. The Company experienced a significant increase in its accounts and unbilled receivables during the second half of 2017 due to the significant revenue increase, however, a majority of those increases were part of the Company's foreign operations, which are not included in the borrowing base calculation.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017\nThe Company's segment revenues for the fourth quarter were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nE&P Technology & Services\n$\n48,003\n$\n25,216\n90\n%\nE&P Operations Optimization\n9,899\n10,153\n(3)\n%\nOcean Bottom Seismic Services\n窶能n窶能n窶能nTotal\n$\n57,902\n$\n35,369\n64\n%\nWithin the E&P Technology & Services segment, new venture revenues were $30.3 million, a 174% increase from the fourth quarter 2016; data library revenues were $14.7 million, an 85% increase; and Imaging Services revenues were $3.0 million, a 52% decrease. A majority of the increase in new venture revenues originated from the Company's 3D multi-client reimaging programs offshore Mexico and Brazil, as well as revenues from new 2D multi-client programs that were recently launched. The increase in data library sales spanned the breadth of the Company's diverse global portfolio without concentration in a particular geographical region. The decrease in Imaging Services revenues is a result of the Company's strategic shift toward higher return multi-client programs. The imaging work on multi-client programs is reflected as part of new venture or data library revenues depending on the program status, whereas revenues from proprietary imaging programs are reflected as part of Imaging Services. The Imaging Services group is fully utilized, with a large portion of the Company's capacity dedicated to multi-client programs.\nWithin the E&P Operations Optimization segment, Optimization Software & Services revenues were $4.2 million, a 4% increase from the fourth quarter 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign currencies, Optimization Software & Services revenues were down 4% in local currency (British pound sterling). Devices revenues were $5.7 million, a 7% decrease from the fourth quarter 2016. Devices continues to be impacted by reduced seismic contractor activity, resulting in further declines in new system sales as well as repair and replacement revenues.\nThe Ocean Bottom Seismic (OBS) Services segment contributed no revenues during the fourth quarter.\nConsolidated gross margin was 41%, compared to 24% in the fourth quarter 2016. Gross margin in the E&P Technology & Services increased to 43%, up from 20% one year ago. This increase was the result of the overall increase in revenues, along with the mix in revenues associated with the Company's higher margin 3D reimaging programs. E&P Operations Optimization gross margin was 50%, consistent with the fourth quarter 2016.\nConsolidated operating expenses, as adjusted, were $18.8 million, up from $16.7 million in the fourth quarter 2016. This increase in operating expense was primarily due to an increase in selling expenses directly related to the increase in revenues. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 9%, compared to (24)% in the prior year quarter. Similar to gross margin, the increase in operating margin was related to the increase and mix of revenues, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses.\nFULL YEAR 2017\nThe Company's segment revenues for the full year were as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nE&P Technology & Services\n$\n157,249\n$\n92,889\n69\n%\nE&P Operations Optimization\n40,305\n43,502\n(7)\n%\nOcean Bottom Seismic Services\n窶能n36,417\nn/a\nTotal\n$\n197,554\n$\n172,808\n14\n%\nWithin the E&P Technology & Services segment, new venture revenues were $100.8 million, a 268% increase from 2016; data library revenues were $40.0 million, a slight improvement; and Imaging Services revenues were $16.4 million, a 36% decrease. The changes in new venture and Imaging Services revenues are consistent with the changes as described in the fourth quarter section above. While data library revenues finished the year significantly stronger than the fourth quarter 2016, the full year revenues were relatively flat.\nWithin the E&P Operations Optimization segment, Optimization Software & Services revenues were $16.7 million, a slight decrease from 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign currencies, Optimization Software & Services revenues were up 4% in local currency (British pound sterling). Devices revenues were $23.6 million, a 12% decrease from 2016.\nThe OBS Services segment contributed no revenues during 2017.\nConsolidated gross margin was 38%, compared to 21% in 2016. Gross margin in E&P Technology & Services improved to 41%, up from 5% in 2016. This increase was the result of the increase in revenues associated with the Company's higher margin 3D reimaging programs. E&P Operations Optimization gross margin was 50%, consistent with 2016. The overall increase in consolidated gross margin was partially offset by the decline in gross margin in OBS Services.\nConsolidated operating expenses, as adjusted, were $78.2 million, a slight decrease from 2016. Operating margin, as adjusted, was (1)%, compared to (24)% in 2016, the result of the increase in revenues and mix.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call for Thursday, February 8, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time that will include a slide presentation to be posted in the Investor Relations section of the ION website by 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss\n(Non-GAAP Measure)\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThe term Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other credits or charges including, without limitation, changes in the loss contingency reserve related to legal proceedings, a loss on extinguishment of debt and recovery of previously reserved amounts due from the INOVA joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income (loss) or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company has included Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because its management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Additionally, due to the unusual nature associated with terminating certain stock appreciation awards in the fourth quarter 2017, the Company is presenting Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of stock appreciation awards, to assist in the comparability to its prior year results.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet loss\n$\n(1,341)\n$\n(6,342)\n$\n(29,377)\n$\n(64,727)\nInterest expense, net\n4,045\n4,442\n16,709\n18,485\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(3,646)\n(1,444)\n24\n4,421\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n18,554\n15,125\n65,998\n55,310\nAccrual (reduction) of loss contingency related to legal proceedings\n窶能n(1,168)\n5,000\n(1,168)\nLoss on bond exchange\n窶能n窶能n窶能n2,182\nRecovery of INOVA bad debts\n窶能n(3,983)\n窶能n(3,983)\nFair value impact of stock appreciation awards\n6,141\n窶能n6,141\n窶能nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n23,753\n$\n6,630\n$\n64,495\n$\n10,520\nION GEOPHYSICAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Special Items to Net Income (Loss) per Share\n(Non-GAAP Measure)\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThe financial results are reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide users of this financial information, additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. One such non-GAAP financial measure is income (loss) from operations or net income (loss) excluding certain charges or amounts. This adjusted income (loss) amount is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or other income data prepared in accordance with GAAP.
