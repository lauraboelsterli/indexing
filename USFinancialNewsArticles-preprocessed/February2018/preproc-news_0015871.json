Combined Company year-over-year change in net revenues is presented giving effect to the completion of the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business (the \"Merger\"), as if the Merger had occurred as of July 1, 2015. Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Summary\nNet revenues of $2,637.6 million increased 14.8% as reported compared to the prior year and increased 10.3% at constant currency Excluding the positive contributions from the acquisitions of Younique, Burberry and two months of ghd, organic net revenues increased 2.8% on a constant currency basis Reported operating income of $174.4 million increased from a loss of $(12.7) million Adjusted operating income of $347.5 million increased 12.8% from $308.0 million Reported net income of $109.2 million increased from $46.8 million, and adjusted net income of $237.2 million increased from $223.3 million Reported earnings per diluted share of $0.15 increased from $0.06 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.32 increased from $0.30 Net cash provided by operating activities was $316.7 million compared to $678.4 million in the prior year\nFirst Six Months Fiscal 2018 Summary\nNet revenues of $4,875.9 million increased 44.4% as reported compared to the prior year net revenues, and increased 7.6% for the combined company at constant currency Excluding the positive contribution from the acquisitions of Younique, Burberry and five months of ghd, organic net revenues were flat on a constant currency basis Reported operating income of $203.1 million increased from $33.7 million Adjusted operating income of $542.6 million increased from $474.4 million Reported net income of $89.5 million increased from $46.8 million, and adjusted net income of $313.5 million increased from $301.6 million Reported earnings per diluted share of $0.12 increased from $0.09, while adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.42 declined from $0.55 Net cash provided by operating activities was $307.8 million compared to $663.4 million in the prior year\nCommenting on Coty's performance, Camillo Pane, Coty CEO said:\n\"Q2 was a very strong quarter marked by Coty’s return to organic top line growth. We delivered excellent growth in Luxury, an acceleration in positive momentum in Professional Beauty and a significant improvement in Consumer Beauty. Our recent acquisitions continue to have strong performance. Across each of our three businesses we continue to see improving results with our strong performance in Q2 directly linked to our growth strategy. Recent innovations are working well, e-commerce is performing ahead of the market and we are working to implement better in-store execution.\n\"Fiscal 2018 continues to be a year of stabilization and this is what our results have shown so far. While I am pleased with our performance, there is still much work to be done before we achieve the consistency that we seek as we still need to relaunch many brands, deliver our synergies and continue with our integration of the P&G Beauty business.\n\"Based on the much improved results to date, we have refined our revenue growth objectives for the remainder of the fiscal year. While revenue recovery will not be a straight line, we now aim to deliver positive but modest net revenue growth for the second half of the year. For margin, we continue to aim for a healthy improvement in the second half of the year versus the prior year, with most of the impact coming in Q4, as we continue to deliver on our merger synergies.\n\"I remain confident that the real progress we have seen year-to-date, coupled with our commitment to our growth strategy, will continue to move Coty gradually onto the path of full recovery.\"\nBasis of Presentation\nTo supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented in this release using the non-GAAP financial measures described in this section. The term “combined company” describes net revenues of Coty Inc. and the P&G Beauty Business giving effect to the Merger for purposes of the six months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016, as if it had occurred on July 1, 2015. Combined company period-over-period and combined company constant currency period-over-period do not include any adjustments related to potential profit improvements, potential cost savings or adjustments to fully conform to the accounting policies of Coty. \"Constant currency” describes net revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange translations. The term “adjusted” primarily excludes the impact of restructuring and business realignment costs, amortization, costs related to acquisition activities, and certain interest expense and other (income) expense items to the extent applicable. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional discussion of these measures as well as the definition of free cash flow.\nNet revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to three months ended December 31, 2016, are reported by segment and geographic region and are presented on a reported (GAAP) and a constant currency basis. Net revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to six months ended December 31, 2016, are reported by segment and geographic region and are presented on a reported (GAAP), combined company and combined company constant currency basis. Certain percentages may not agree to the tables due to rounding. Operating income is reported by segment. All changes in margin percentage are described in basis points rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.\nOperating income, net income, operating income margin, gross margin, effective tax rate, and earnings per diluted share (EPS (diluted)) are presented on a reported (GAAP) basis and an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Adjusted EPS (diluted) is a performance measure and should not be construed as a measure of liquidity. Net revenues on a constant currency basis, net revenues on a combined company basis, net revenues on a combined company constant currency basis, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EPS (diluted) and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for additional discussion of these measures. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the tables and footnotes at the end of this release.\nTo the extent that Coty provides guidance, it does so only on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, integration and acquisition-related expenses, amortization expenses, adjustments to inventory, and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Summary Operating Review\nNet revenues of $2,637.6 million increased 14.8% as reported compared to the prior year and increased 10.3% on a constant currency basis. The 10.3% constant currency net revenue growth reflected a 7.5% contribution from Younique, Burberry and two months of ghd, and a 2.8% increase in the underlying business, driven by strong growth in Luxury, sustained momentum in Professional Beauty and partially offset by a modest decline in Consumer Beauty.\nGross margin of 61.1% was flat as compared to the prior year, while adjusted gross margin declined to 61.6% from 63.6%, primarily attributable to positive momentum in our emerging market Consumer Beauty business as well as favorable items following the P&G Beauty acquisition in the prior year.\nReported operating income increased to $174.4 million from a loss of $(12.7) million, primarily due to higher reported net revenues and lower acquisition costs.\nAdjusted operating income increased 12.8% to $347.5 million from $308.0 million driven by improved net revenues and tight cost controls.\nReported effective tax rate was (7.1)% compared to 174.4%. The current period rate reflects a $41.8 million positive impact from a foreign tax settlement.\nAdjusted effective tax rate was 10.3% compared to 8.8%. The current period rate reflects a $41.8 million positive impact from a foreign tax settlement.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax system by, amongst other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing the territorial tax system and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation tax on un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company has performed a preliminary analysis and estimates the overall impact on our recurring tax rate to be neutral from both a cash and financial statement perspective for Fiscal 2018. The Company expects to fully offset the cash and financial statement impacts of the one-time deemed repatriation tax with tax attributes (e.g. net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits, etc.).\nReported net income increased to $109.2 million from $46.8 million, driven by higher operating income, partially offset by a lower tax benefit.\nAdjusted net income of $237.2 million increased from $223.3 million, reflecting higher adjusted operating income.\nCash Flows\nNet cash from operating activities in the quarter was $316.7 million, compared to $678.4 million in the prior year, largely due to a one time benefit associated with the ramp up of accounts payable and accrued expenses following the close of the acquisition of the P&G Beauty business. Positive free cash flow of $195.9 million in the quarter compared to $567.0 million in the prior year primarily reflects lower cash from operations. On December 14, 2017, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share for a total of $93.7 million. Cash and cash equivalents of $400.1 million decreased by $135.3 million compared to June 30, 2017.\nTotal debt of $7,517.8 million increased by $302.2 million while net debt of $7,117.7 million increased by $437.5 million from the balance on June 30, 2017.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Review by Segment\nThree Months Ended December 31, Net Revenues Change Reported Operating\nIncome\nAdjusted Operating\nIncome\n(in millions) 2017 2016 Reported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\n2017 Change 2017 Change Luxury $ 951.2 $ 835.0 14% 9% $ 85.1 28%\n$ 125.4 29%\nConsumer Beauty 1,138.6 1,001.7 14% 10% 99.3 58%\n131.9 19%\nProfessional 547.8 460.0 19% 14% 73.5 (12%) 90.2 (10%) Corporate — — N/A\nN/A\n(83.5) 63%\n— N/A\nTotal $ 2,637.6 $ 2,296.7 15% 10% $ 174.4 >100%\n$ 347.5 13%\nLuxury\nReported net revenues of $951.2 million increased 13.9% compared to the prior year and 9.1% on a constant currency basis. The increase in constant currency reflects 8.1% growth in the underlying business driven by the on-going success of the debut Tiffany & Co. and Gucci Bloom fragrance launches as well as growth in Chloe, and a 1.0% contribution from Burberry. Adjusted operating income of $125.4 million increased 28.6% from $97.5 million in the prior year.\nConsumer Beauty\nNet revenues of $1,138.6 million increased 13.7% compared to the prior year and 9.8% on a constant currency basis. The increase in constant currency reflects an 11.1% contribution from Younique and a modest (1.3)% decline in the underlying business. The modest decline in our underlying net revenues was driven by certain U.S.-focused brands and largely offset by strong growth in Wella Retail, Max Factor and Monange. Adjusted operating income increased 19.4% to $131.9 million from $110.5 million in the prior year.\nProfessional\nNet revenues of $547.8 million increased 19.1% compared to the prior year and 13.6% on a constant currency basis. The increase in constant currency reflects a 11.6% contribution from ghd and 2.0% growth in the underlying business driven by strength in OPI globally. Adjusted operating income declined 9.8% to $90.2 million from $100.0 million in the prior year.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Review by Geographic Region\nThree Months Ended December 31, Net Revenues Change (in millions) 2017\n2016\nReported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\nNorth America $ 743.5 $ 700.5 6% 6% Europe 1,289.1 1,134.1 14% 6% ALMEA 605.0 462.1 31% 29% Total $ 2,637.6 $ 2,296.7 15% 10% North America\nReported net revenues increased 6.1% compared to the prior year and increased 5.6% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the contribution from Younique and the on-going success of Tiffany & Co. and Gucci Bloom, partially offset by declines in the U.S. Consumer Beauty division.\nEurope\nReported net revenues increased 13.7% compared to the prior year and increased 5.7% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by the contribution from ghd, the on-going success of Tiffany & Co. and Gucci Bloom as well as mass fragrances and retail hair across the region.\nALMEA\nReported net revenues increased 30.9% compared to the prior year and increased 28.8% on a constant currency basis reflecting strong growth in all three divisions. Performance reflects strength in retail hair in Brazil and Max Factor in China, the on-going success of Tiffany & Co. and Gucci Bloom and the initial restage of OPI gel.\nNoteworthy Company Developments\nOther noteworthy company developments include:\nOn February 8, 2018, Coty announced a dividend of $0.125 per share, payable March 15, 2018 to holders of record on February 28, 2018.\nConference Call\nCoty Inc. will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. (ET) today, February 8, 2018 to discuss its results.

and other factors described elsewhere in this document and from time to time in documents that we file with the SEC.\nWhen used herein, the term “includes” and “including” means, unless the context otherwise indicates, “including without limitation”. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company’s business and financial results is included under the heading “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 and other periodic reports the Company has filed and may file with the SEC from time to time.\nAll forward-looking statements made in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statements to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise.\nComparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how the underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations (“constant currency”). Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period, with the current period’s results calculated at the prior-year period’s rates. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company discloses the following constant currency financial measures: net revenues, combined company net revenues, gross profit and adjusted operating income.\nThe Company presents period-over-period comparisons of net revenues on a constant currency basis, on a combined company, combined company constant currency, and combined company constant currency excluding the impact of acquisitions other than the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business (\"combined company organic (LFL)\") basis. The Company believes that combined company period-over-period and combined company constant currency period-over-period better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's net revenues performance from period to period, as the total business and individual divisions are being managed on a combined company basis. In the periods described in this release, combined company period-over-period and combined company constant currency period-over-period give effect to the completion of the Merger for purposes of the six months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016, as if it has been completed on July 1, 2015. Combined company growth and combined company constant currency growth do not include any adjustments related to potential profit improvements, potential cost savings or adjustments to fully conform to the accounting policies of Coty. For a reconciliation of combined company period-over-period, combined company constant currency period-over-period, and combined company organic (LFL) period-over-period, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Revenues to Combined Company and Like-For-Like Net Revenues”. For a reconciliation of the Company's combined company period-over-period, combined company constant currency period-over-period and combined company organic (LFL) by segment and geographic region, see the tables entitled “Net Revenues and Adjusted Operating Income by Segment” and “Net Revenues by Geographic Regions.\"\nThe Company presents operating income, operating income margin, gross profit, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin, net revenues and EPS (diluted) on a non-GAAP basis and specifies that these measures are non-GAAP by using the term “adjusted”. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to analyze and compare operating performance from period to period. In calculating adjusted operating income, operating income margin, gross profit, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin and EPS (diluted), the Company excludes the following items:\nCosts related to acquisition activities: The Company excludes acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions. Restructuring and other business realignment costs: The Company excludes costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the above referenced expenses from the non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to evaluate the Company’s ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Amortization expense: The Company excludes the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Although the Company excludes amortization of intangible assets from the non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Interest and other (income) expense: The Company excludes foreign currency impacts associated with acquisition-related and debt financing related forward contracts as the nature and amount of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of such transactions. Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant non-controlling interest percentage. Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments are based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred.\nThe Company has provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to gross profit, adjusted EPS (diluted) to EPS (diluted), and adjusted net revenues to net revenues, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported to Adjusted Results for the Consolidated Statements of Operations.” For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income and adjusted operating income margin to operating income margin, see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income” and \"Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income by Segment.\" For a reconciliation of adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted cash tax rate to effective tax rate, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates to Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Effective Tax Rates and Cash Tax Rates.” For a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income margin to net income, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Income to Adjusted Net Income.”\nThe Company also presents free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow is useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures, after making necessary capital investments in property and equipment to support the Company's ongoing business operations, and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow.”\nThese non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n- Tables Follow -\nCOTY INC. & SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSix Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net revenues $ 2,637.6 $ 2,296.7 $ 4,875.9 $ 3,376.9 Cost of sales 1,025.0 892.3 1,899.3 1,337.1 as % of Net revenues 38.9 % 38.9 % 39.0 % 39.6 % Gross profit 1,612.6 1,404.4 2,976.6 2,039.8 Gross margin 61.1 % 61.1 % 61.0 % 60.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,319.9 1,170.2 2,511.7 1,649.1 as % of Net revenues 50.0 % 51.0 % 51.5 % 48.8 % Amortization expense 89.6 95.2 167.8 116.4 Restructuring costs 21.7 15.8 32.9 23.2 Acquisition-related costs 7.0 135.9 61.1 217.4 Operating income (loss) 174.4 (12.7 ) 203.1 33.7 as % of Net revenues 6.6 % (0.6 %) 4.2 % 1.0 % Interest expense, net 60.3 57.9 126.7 98.3 Other expense (income), net 3.4 (0.6 ) 7.1 0.7 Income (loss) before income taxes 110.7 (70.0 ) 69.3 (65.3 ) as % of Net revenues 4.2 % (3.0 %) 1.4 % (1.9 %) Benefit for income taxes (7.9 ) (122.1 ) (33.2 ) (127.2 ) Net income 118.6 52.1 102.5 61.9 as % of Net revenues 4.5 % 2.3 % 2.1 % 1.8 % Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests (1.9 ) 2.5 (4.1 ) 10.7 Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests 11.3 2.8 17.1 4.4 Net income attributable to Coty Inc. $ 109.2 $ 46.8 $ 89.5 $ 46.8 as % of Net revenues 4.1 % 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.4 % Net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share: Basic $ 0.15 $ 0.06 $ 0.12 $ 0.09 Diluted $ 0.15 $ 0.06 $ 0.12 $ 0.09 Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic 749.6 746.6 749.1 539.8 Diluted 752.7 752.4 752.5 545.8 Cash dividend declared per common share $ 0.125 $ 0.125 $ 0.250 $ 0.400 COTY INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULES INCLUDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nRECONCILIATION OF REPORTED TO ADJUSTED RESULTS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nThese supplemental schedules provide adjusted Non-GAAP financial information and a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the Non-GAAP financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
