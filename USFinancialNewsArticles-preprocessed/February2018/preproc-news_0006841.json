(NYSE:PBH) today reported financial results for its third quarter and nine-months ended December 31, 2017.\n“We were pleased with our third quarter performance, which reflected continued strong consumption trends and the expected return to average shipment times versus second quarter. Although we continue to see headwinds related to a challenging retailer environment, our long-term growth strategy remains unchanged. We continue to focus on growing categories, which enables us to win share with the consumer and positions us well for the future,” said Ron Lombardi, Chief Executive Officer of Prestige Brands.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Ended December 31, 2017\nReported revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 24.8% to $270.6 million, compared to $216.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Revenues for the quarter were driven by continued solid consumption levels across the Company’s core brands and $54.1 million from the recently acquired brands from the Fleet acquisition, which were partially offset by the divestitures of certain non-core brands during fiscal 2017.\nGross profit margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 54.6%, compared to 57.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The gross profit margin year-over-year change was attributable to higher freight and warehousing costs during the quarter as well as product mix from the addition of the high growth Fleet portfolio.\nAdvertising & promotion expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $35.8 million, or 13.2% of sales, compared to $30.7 million, or 14.2% of sales, in the prior year. Higher advertising and promotion dollar growth was attributable to ongoing investments behind the Company’s long-term brand building strategy.\nReported net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $314.8 million versus the prior year comparable quarter’s net income of $31.6 million. Diluted earnings per share of $5.88 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $0.59 per share in the prior year comparable period. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $37.3 million, an increase of 14.5% from the prior year period’s adjusted net income of $32.6 million. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share were $0.70 per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $0.61 per share in the prior year comparable period.\nAdjustments to net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 include income tax adjustments related to the domestic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a tax adjustment associated with an acquisition. Adjustments to net income in the third quarter of both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 include certain integration, transition, legal and various other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures and the related income tax effects of the adjustments.\nNine Months Ended December 31, 2017\nReported revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased 22.4% to $785.2 million compared to $641.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were driven by continued strong consumption levels across the Company’s legacy brands and $160.7 million of incremental revenue from the Fleet acquisition, which was partially offset by the divestitures of certain non-core brands during fiscal 2017.\nReported gross profit margin in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was 55.4% (with adjusted gross margin of 55.9% excluding adjustments related to the Fleet transition and integration) compared to 57.7% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The gross profit margin year-over-year change was primarily due to the addition of the high growth Fleet portfolio and the higher distribution costs realized in third quarter 2018.\nAdvertising & promotion expense for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $112.0 million, or 14.3% of sales, compared to $86.9 million, or 13.6% of sales, in the prior year. Increased investments in advertising and promotion expense as a percentage of sales was attributable to the Company’s long-term brand building strategy.\nReported net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 totaled $379.3 million, versus the prior year comparable period net income of $58.3 million. Diluted earnings per share were $7.08 for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.09 per share in the prior year comparable period. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $105.3 million, an increase over the prior year period’s adjusted net income of $97.8 million. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share were $1.97 per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.83 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.\nAdjustments to net income in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 include income tax adjustments related to the domestic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a tax adjustment associated with an acquisition. Adjustments to net income in the first nine months of both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 include integration, transition, legal and various other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures and the related income tax effects of the adjustments. Adjustments to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 also include accelerated amortization of debt origination costs in addition to the non-cash costs related to divestiture of certain non-core brands.\nFree Cash Flow and Balance Sheet\nThe Company's net cash provided by operating activities for the third fiscal quarter of 2018 increased to $47.1 million from $40.1 million during the same period a year earlier due to continued strong cash conversion in the legacy business and incremental cash flow related to the Fleet acquisition, partially offset by the loss of cash flow from divested brands.\nFor the first nine months of fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities increased 10.3% to $155.7 million, while non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow increased 4.1% to $156.2 million compared to the prior year's period.\nThe Company's net debt position as of December 31, 2017 was $2.0 billion, reflecting debt repayments of $145.0 million fiscal year to date. At December 31, 2017, the Company's covenant-defined leverage ratio was 5.4x.\nSegment Review\nNorth American OTC Healthcare: Segment revenues totaled $225.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, 27.3% higher than the prior year comparable quarter's revenues of $177.3 million. The third quarter fiscal 2018 increase was driven by revenues from the acquisition of Fleet as well as consumption growth in the company’s core OTC brands, partially offset by divestitures of non-core OTC brands.\nFor the first nine months of the current fiscal year, reported revenues for the North American OTC segment were $656.8 million, an increase of 25.9% compared to $521.8 million in the prior year comparable period.\nInternational OTC Healthcare: Segment fiscal third quarter 2018 revenues totaled $25.7 million, 39.3% higher than the $18.5 million reported in the prior year comparable period. Third quarter revenues included incremental revenues from the Fleet acquisition, as well as growth of the company’s legacy OTC brand portfolio.\nFor the first nine months of the current fiscal year, reported revenues for the International OTC Healthcare segment were $67.6 million, an increase of 27.3% over the prior year comparable period’s revenues of $53.1 million. Revenues for the International OTC Healthcare segment were impacted by favorable consumption levels as well as revenues from the Fleet acquisition.\nHousehold Cleaning: Segment revenues totaled $19.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with third quarter fiscal 2017 revenues of $21.0 million, a decrease of 8.7%.\nFor the first nine months of the current fiscal year, reported revenues for the Household Cleaning segment were $60.8 million, a decrease of 8.6% over the prior year comparable nine month period’s revenues of $66.5 million.\nCommentary and Outlook for Fiscal 2018\nRon Lombardi, CEO, stated, “Our solid overall performance in the third quarter reflects positive consumption in line with our long-term objective and speaks to the effectiveness of our brand-building efforts and portfolio evolution. Furthermore, we are encouraged by recent tax reform, which we expect to boost our already strong cash flow profile and further enhance our ability to build M&A capacity and invest behind long-term brand building.”\n“The strength of our portfolio positions us well for long-term growth, but in the near-term we continue to see retailer inventory reduction headwinds partially offsetting our strong consumption trends, which we expect to continue in Q4. In addition, we expect increased freight and warehousing expenses experienced in Q3 to persist into Q4. As a result, we now expect to be at the low end of our key fiscal 2018 outlook metrics. Despite these challenges, we remain well positioned for long-term top- and bottom-line growth driven by our three-pillar strategy and diversified portfolio of leading OTC brands,” Mr. Lombardi concluded.\nFiscal 2018 Full-Year Outlook Revenue Growth 18% Adjusted E.P.S.* $2.58 Adjusted Free Cash Flow* $205 million or more Tax Reform\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law in December 2017, which represents significant U.S. federal tax reform legislation that includes a permanent reduction to the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. The permanent reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate resulted in a one-time gain related to the value of the Company’s deferred tax liabilities in the third quarter of 2018, resulting in a net $278 million gain. For the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company expects an immaterial impact to its tax rate. Going forward, based on preliminary analysis, the Company expects the impact of the legislation to result in a reduction of its effective tax rate beginning in fiscal 2019 to approximately 26% and a cash tax savings of approximately $10-15 million in fiscal 2019 versus the prior year. The Company expects to provide a finalized fiscal year 2019 estimated tax rate outlook when it reports its fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results in May 2018.\nFiscal Q3 Conference Call, Accompanying Slide Presentation and Replay\nThe Company will host a conference call to review its third quarter results today, February 1, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

The frequency and the amount of such revenues vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we disclose certain Non-GAAP financial measures (\"NGFMs\"), including, but not limited to, Non-GAAP Organic Revenues, Non-GAAP Organic Revenue Growth Percentage, Non-GAAP Proforma Revenues , Non-GAAP Proforma Revenue Growth Percentage, Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage, Non-GAAP Adjusted Advertising and Promotion Expense, Non-GAAP Adjusted Advertising and Promotion Expense Percentage, Non-GAAP Adjusted General and Administrative Expense, Non-GAAP Adjusted General and Administrative Expense Percentage, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP EBITDA Margin, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income, Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS, Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow, Non-GAAP Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Net Debt. We use these NGFMs internally, along with GAAP information, in evaluating our operating performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe that the presentation of these NGFMs provides investors with greater transparency, and provides a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures, because the supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations provides additional ways to view our operation when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliations below. In addition, we believe that the presentation of each of these NGFMs is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results in assessing shareholder value, and we use these NGFMs internally to evaluate the performance of our personnel and also to evaluate our operating performance and compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nThese NGFMs are not in accordance with GAAP, should not be considered as a measure of profitability or liquidity, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled NGFMs reported by other companies. These NGFMs have limitations and they should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to their most closely related GAAP measures reconciled below. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend investors review the GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the reconciliations below, we believe these NGFMs provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than GAAP measures alone.\nNGFMs Defined\nWe define our NGFMs presented herein as follows:\n• Non-GAAP Organic Revenues : GAAP Total Revenues excluding revenues associated with products acquired or divested in the periods presented.\n• Non-GAAP Organic Revenue Growth Percentage : Calculated as the change in Non-GAAP Organic Revenues from prior year divided by prior year Non-GAAP Organic Revenues.\n• Non-GAAP Proforma Revenues : Non-GAAP Organic Revenues plus revenues associated with acquisitions.\n• Non-GAAP Proforma Revenue Growth Percentage : Calculated as the change in Non-GAAP Proforma Revenues from prior year divided by prior year Non-GAAP Proforma Revenues.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin : GAAP Gross Profit minus certain integration, transition and other acquisition related costs.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage : Calculated as Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin divided by GAAP Total Revenues.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted Advertising and Promotion Expense : GAAP Advertising and Promotion expenses minus certain integration, transition and other acquisition related costs.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted Advertising and Promotion Expense Percentage : Calculated as Non-GAAP Adjusted Advertising and Promotion expense divided by GAAP Total Revenues.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted General and Administrative Expense : GAAP General and Administrative expenses minus certain integration, transition and other acquisition related costs and divestiture costs and tax adjustment associated with acquisitions.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted General and Administrative Expense Percentage : Calculated as Non-GAAP Adjusted General and Administrative expense divided by GAAP Total Revenues.\n• Non-GAAP EBITDA : GAAP Net Income (Loss) less interest expense (income), income taxes provision (benefit), and depreciation and amortization.\n• Non-GAAP EBITDA Margin : Calculated as Non-GAAP EBITDA divided by GAAP Total Revenues.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA : Non-GAAP EBITDA less certain integration, transition and other acquisition related costs, divestiture costs, and tax adjustment associated with acquisitions and (gain) loss on divestitures.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Margin : Calculated as Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA divided by GAAP Total Revenues.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income : GAAP Net Income (Loss) before certain integration, transition and other acquisition related costs, divestiture costs, tax adjustment associated with acquisitions, (gain) loss on divestitures, accelerated amortization of debt origination costs due to sale of assets, applicable tax impact associated with these items and normalized tax rate adjustment.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS : Calculated as Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income, divided by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period.\n• Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow : GAAP Net cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for capital expenditures.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted Free Cash Flow : Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow plus cash payments made for integration, transition, and other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures and additional income tax payments associated with divestitures.\n• Net Debt : Calculated as total principal amount of debt outstanding ($2,077,000 at December 31, 2017) less cash and cash equivalents ($45,376 at December 31, 2017).
