    "text": "WAYNE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Genex Services (“Genex”), a leading provider of cost containment services to the workers’ compensation, disability and auto industries, announced today that funds managed by private equity firm Stone Point Capital LLC (”Stone Point”) have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a majority interest in Genex from funds advised by Apax Partners, a global private equity firm.

Genex offers a broad continuum of services including utilization management, case management, bill review, independent medical examinations, Medicare Set-Asides, and Social Security Disability Insurance representation.\n“This transaction renews a successful partnership between Genex and Stone Point. Stone Point had previously acquired the company in 2007 before selling to the Apax Funds in 2014. Both Apax Partners and Stone Point have been strong business partners of Genex and supported the expansion of its service capabilities both organically and through acquisitions,” said Peter Madeja, Genex’s President and Chief Executive Officer.\n“We are excited to partner with Stone Point,” said Madeja. “Genex is a well-established leader in workers’ compensation, auto, and disability management solutions. Our partnership with Apax Partners allowed us to significantly expand our portfolio of solution offerings across the continuum of managed care. We believe that Stone Point’s commitment to continue to grow and enhance Genex’s capabilities will further enrich the value proposition we offer to customers through the depth and breadth of resources we bring to the market.”\nAndrew Cavanna, Partner at Apax Partners, added: “We would like to thank Peter and the rest of the management team for being excellent partners over the past four years and for successfully growing Genex’s business and capabilities. We wish the team every success for the future.”\n“We are thrilled to be partnering with Peter and the Genex team again to further their continued expansion within the markets they serve,” added Chuck Davis, CEO of Stone Point. “We have a strong relationship with Peter and his talented management team, which has been developed over more than ten years, and we now look forward to the opportunity to support Genex as the company continues to build upon its long history of success.”\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey served as the exclusive strategic and financial advisor to Genex.
