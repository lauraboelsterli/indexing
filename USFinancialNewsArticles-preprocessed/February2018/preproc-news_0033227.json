    "text": "fraud@\n* Federal investigators searching for jeweler\n* Modi has yet to respond to fraud allegations\n* His firm Firestar Diamond says has no involvement\n* Movie stars now swathed in Mumbai-based Modi's jewels (Adds statement from Priyanka Chopra spokesperson)\nMUMBAI/NEW DELHI Feb 15 (Reuters) - Nirav Modi's name is a stamp of corporate India's growing global prestige. On Hollywood red carpets, his diamonds have sparkled on the necklines and dangled from the earlobes of actors and models like Kate Winslet, Dakota Johnson and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.\nBack in India, billboards above the traffic jams of New Delhi bear the image of Priyanka Chopra, a Bollywood star and former Miss World who is fast becoming a household name in the United States, also adorned with Modi's jewels.\nBut on Thursday, officials at the nation's federal investigative agency announced it was looking for Modi as law enforcement officials fanned out to raid his jewelry stores and other businesses in Mumbai and New Delhi.\nCentral Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials told reporters the agency had on Feb. 4 issued a lookout circular in the country for Modi, who they say had left four weeks earlier.\nModi, who has a net worth of some $1.8 billion according to Forbes magazine rankings, has not yet responded to the allegations and could not be reached for comment.\nHis flagship company, Firestar Diamond, has said it had no involvement in the case.\nThe setback in Modi's climb to fame and fortune was abrupt, even by the rough-and-tumble standards of one of the world's fastest growing major economies.\nDuring an interview with Reuters in November, the famously soft-spoken Modi discussed his love for art, poetry and paintings. He also spoke of his wife and three children with whom he lives in central Mumbai.\nAsked how he planned to raise funds to add new stores, he seemed unconcerned.\n\"All options are open,\" he said, sitting in his cavernous Mumbai office. \"We could use internal accruals. We can take loans from banks or we could do an initial public offering.\"\nBut last month, India's second-largest state-run lender filed a criminal complaint with the CBI that accused Modi and others of defrauding the bank and causing it a loss of 2.8 billion rupees ($43.8 million).\nThen on Thursday, the same bank, Punjab National Bank , publicly alleged that Modi was involved with a much larger fraud case: $1.77 billion from a single branch stretching back to 2011.\n\"HAUT DIAMANTAIRE\"\nThe news was a shock for the circles in which Modi moved.\nAs recently as last month, he was at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Indian media carried a group photograph with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the foreground and Nirav Modi, who is no relation, grinning between rows of Indian business leaders behind him.\n\"Top industrialists invited him home to display his collections,\" said a Mumbai investment banker at a U.S.-based firm who has worked directly with Modi's company. \"There was a personal touch in everything he sold. Nirav Modi is a brand.\"\nA senior member at Bharat Diamond Bourse, a Mumbai-based industry body with more than 13,000 members, sketched a similar profile of Modi.\n\"In one of the industry meetings in 2013 he said that when people wear a Cartier ring they don't say it's a diamond ring, they say it's Cartier,\" said the member, who did not want to be named. \"He always wanted people to say they are 'wearing Nirav Modi'.\"\nModi grew up in Antwerp, Belgium, in a diamond-dealing family. In 1990, at the age of 19, he moved to Mumbai, according to the November interview.\nNine years later, Modi started his own company, Firestar Diamond Ltd., selling loose stones. He employed fewer than a dozen people at the time. By last year, the number was more than 2,000.\nHe said he came to realize the margins were better in retail.\nFirestar Group, the parent company Modi controls as a majority shareholder, saw its revenue grow over three years from 103 billion rupees (about $1.6 billion at current rates) to some 147 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) by the 2016-17 fiscal year, according to figures previously provided by the company.\nIn 2010, Modi launched an eponymous jewelry business branded NIRAV MODI, in capitals, with the tagline \"Haut Diamantaire.\" New boutiques in Las Vegas and Hawaii have since been added to a stable that stretches from New York to London to Beijing.\nHe became a man whose diamond necklaces were sold, with his name attached, by Sotheby's. \"Pure feminine elegance,\" says a Hong Kong auction catalog note of one 85.33 carat diamond necklace.\nThe auction house posted an online slideshow of jewelry-on-stars at the 2017 Oscars and highlighted supermodel Karlie Kloss having \"a major Nirav Modi moment with her diamond 'Mughal' choker.\"\nBut the celebrity links could be starting to break.\nA spokesperson for Chopra, the film star, said in a statement: \"She is currently seeking legal opinion with respect to terminating her contract with the brand in light of allegations of financial fraud against Nirav Modi.\" (Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav, Rupam Jain and Tom Lasseter; Additional reporting by Aditya Kalra and Krishna N.
