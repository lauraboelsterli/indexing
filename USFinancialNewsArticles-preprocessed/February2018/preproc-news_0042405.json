    "text": "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - The high winds which wreaked havoc on the Alpine skiing schedule at Pyeongchang Olympics earlier this week returned on Saturday to delay the womenâ€™s super-G race.\nOrganizers said high winds at the top of the gondola that transports skiers to the top of the Jeongseon piste had forced a delay of one-hour with the race now scheduled to get underway at noon local time (0300 GMT).\nThree of the first four races in the Alpine program were postponed after winds gusting up to 72 kilometers per hour closed the gondolas and made conditions unsafe for skiers from Sunday to Wednesday.\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ",
