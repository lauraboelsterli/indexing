(NYSE:KAMN) today reported financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nTable 1. Summary of Financial Results (unaudited) In thousands except per share amounts For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change Net sales: Distribution $ 263,000 $ 257,218 $ 5,782 Aerospace 210,916 175,844 35,072 Net sales $ 473,916 $ 433,062 $ 40,854 Operating income: Distribution $ 11,485 $ 5,711 $ 5,774 % of sales 4.4 % 2.2 % 2.2 % Aerospace 45,153 33,631 11,522 % of sales 21.4 % 19.1 % 2.3 % Net gain (loss) on sale of assets 39 (1 ) 40 Corporate expense (14,400 ) (12,677 ) (1,723 ) Operating income $ 42,277 $ 26,664 $ 15,613 Adjusted EBITDA*: Net earnings $ 13,797 $ 15,127 $ (1,330 ) Adjustments 40,155 23,316 16,839 Adjusted EBITDA* $ 53,952 $ 38,443 $ 15,509 % of sales 11.4 % 8.9 % 2.5 % Earnings per share: Diluted earnings per share $ 0.49 $ 0.53 $ (0.04 ) Adjustments 0.37 0.03 0.34 Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share* $ 0.86 $ 0.56 $ 0.30 Neal J. Keating, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Performance for the fourth quarter and full year demonstrates the strong execution on our key Aerospace programs and the ability to drive operating profit growth at Distribution. Net earnings for the quarter were lower than the prior year, primarily due to a $9.7 million charge resulting from tax reform and $1.1 million of pre-tax restructuring and severance costs; however, Adjusted EBITDA* increased 40.3% to $54.0 million, 11.4% of Net Sales.\nDistribution sales in the fourth quarter were up 2.2%, or 0.6% on a sales per sales day* basis, with operating margins up 220 basis points, to 4.4%. For the year, sales declined 2.3% to $1.081 billion; however, operating profit increased 25.4% to $52.5 million. Sales per Sales Day* turned positive in November, a trend which has continued into 2018, where year-to-date Sales per Sales Day* are up more than 5.0% through February. Additionally, we have been successful in securing a number of national accounts, the largest of which was signed in the first quarter of 2018. We have begun the process of transitioning these accounts and expect the contribution to our top line performance to increase as we move through the year. These trends give us confidence in our ability to achieve our outlook as we enter 2018.\nAerospace performance in the quarter was highlighted by a continued sequential sales increase for our specialty bearings products, as well as the delivery of more than 13,000 joint programmable fuzes, leading to almost 36,000 fuze deliveries in the year. Our Aerospace team delivered operating margin performance of 21.4%, or 21.5% adjusted*, an increase of 230 bps over the fourth quarter of 2016.\nEntering 2018, prospects for both segments remain strong. At Distribution, the team is working to drive sales growth across the platforms, while maintaining the improvements we have made in operating profit performance. At Aerospace, growth for our specialty bearings products will continue into 2018 and we have recently received initial orders for the Combat Rescue Helicopter, a continuation of our long standing relationship with Sikorsky. In addition, we have secured more than $425 million in JPF orders, led by the $324 million DCS award announced in January, creating record backlog for this program. We anticipate additional orders from the USG on Option 14, and look forward to the opportunity to continue our relationship with the USG under Options 15 and 16. The opportunities for this program remain strong and we are encouraged by its longer term prospects.”\nChief Financial Officer, Robert D. Starr, commented, \"The sequential improvements we anticipated in 2017 continued into the fourth quarter, where we delivered diluted earnings per share of $0.49, or $0.86 adjusted. Earnings for the quarter were driven by a 9.9% increase in gross profit to $148.8 million, resulting in a record gross margin of 31.4%. The passage of the tax reform in late 2017 required us to revalue our deferred tax positions resulting in a reduction to our net deferred tax asset position of approximately $9.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. While we incurred a charge in 2017, we anticipate future benefits from tax reform due to the reduction in our corporate tax rate, which for 2018 is anticipated to be in the range of 25.5% to 26.5%, inclusive of state and local taxes.\nMoving to our outlook for 2018, we expect Aerospace sales to be up 4.0% to 8.0%, with operating margins in the range of 15.5% to 16.0%, or 16.2% to 16.7% when adjusted* for restructuring and transition costs. Operating margin performance is expected to be lower in 2018 due in part to the mix of JPF deliveries and the shift of restructuring costs out of 2017 into 2018. At Distribution, we expect sales growth of 2.0% to 6.0%, with operating margins in the range of 5.1% to 5.4%.\nPreviously we have discussed the actions we took to freeze our pension plan, and, over time, these actions have resulted in lower pension expense. For 2018, we anticipate a net benefit of $6.6 million associated with our pension plan compared to a net pension expense of $1.0 million in 2017. Prior to 2018, this benefit would have been included in the calculation of operating income; however, due to the adoption of a new accounting standard, we are required to reclassify a portion of this benefit below operating income. As a result, $4.9 million of pension expense will be included in calculation of operating income, while an $11.5 million pension benefit will be reclassified below operating income. It is important to note that had the treatment of this benefit been consistent with the prior year presentation, we would have expected our outlook for Aerospace and Distribution operating margins to increase by 90 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively.\nIn addition, with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018, we have evaluated the anticipated impact on our outlook for the year. Based on our analysis, the adoption of the new standard will shift the timing of recognition of revenue for certain programs from the point of delivery to a cost-to-cost basis; while other programs will change from cost-to-cost recognition to the point of delivery. The most significant program level changes resulting from the adoption are associated with our K-MAX® Commercial Helicopter program, Joint Programmable Fuze USG program and UH-60 and AH-1Z structures programs. In 2018, the net impact of the new revenue standard for Aerospace is a sales increase in the range of $15.0 million to $25.0 million and an operating income increase in the range of $7.0 million to $9.0 million.\nDespite the changes in timing for the recognition of revenue, the new standard does not change the timing of cash receipts or payments. In 2017 we generated cash flows from operations of $79.9 million, leading to Free Cash Flow* for the year of $52.3 million. During the fourth quarter a number of deliveries occurred later than we had previously anticipated, shifting cash receipts into 2018. With the shift of these cash receipts, the receipt of advances on our JPF DCS contract, and improved performance in the underlying business, we anticipate cash flows from operations of $185.0 million to $210.0 million, or Free Cash Flow* of $150.0 million to $175.0 million for 2018.\"\n2018 Outlook\nOur 2018 outlook is as follows:\nDistribution: Sales of $1,100.0 million to $1,150.0 million Operating margins of 5.1% to 5.4% Depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $15.0 million Aerospace: Sales of $750.0 million to $780.0 million Operating margins of 15.5% to 16.0%, or 16.2% to 16.7% when adjusted* for approximately $5.5 million in anticipated restructuring and transition costs Depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $24.0 million Interest expense of approximately $20.0 million Corporate expenses of approximately $59.0 million Net periodic pension benefit of approximately $11.5 million Estimated annualized tax rate in the range of approximately 25.5% to 26.5% Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $43.0 million Capital expenditures of approximately $35.0 million Cash flows from operations in the range of $185.0 million to $210.0 million; Free Cash Flow* in the range of $150.0 million to $175.0 million Weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 28.0 million\nPlease see the MD&A section of the Company's Form 10-K filed Commission concurrently with the issuance of this release for greater detail on our results and various company programs.\nA conference call has been scheduled for tomorrow, February 28, 2018, at 8:30 AM ET.

The Company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Other companies may define the measures differently. We define the Non-GAAP measures used in this report and other disclosures as follows:\nOrganic Sales - Organic Sales is defined as \"Net Sales\" less sales derived from acquisitions completed during the preceding twelve months. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, which can obscure underlying trends. We also believe that presenting Organic Sales separately for our segments provides management and investors with useful information about the trends impacting our segments and enables a more direct comparison to other businesses and companies in similar industries. Management recognizes that the term \"Organic Sales\" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. No other adjustments were made during the three-month and twelve-month fiscal periods ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016. The following table illustrates the calculation of Organic Sales using the GAAP measure, \"Net Sales\".\nTable 4. Organic Sales (in thousands) (unaudited) For the Three Months Ended For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Distribution Net sales $ 263,000 $ 257,218 $ 1,080,965 $ 1,106,322 Acquisition Sales — 490 — 5,171 Organic Sales $ 263,000 $ 256,728 $ 1,080,965 $ 1,101,151 Aerospace Net sales $ 210,916 $ 175,844 $ 724,944 $ 702,054 Acquisition Sales — 10,065 — 63,483 Organic Sales $ 210,916 $ 165,779 $ 724,944 $ 638,571 Consolidated Net sales $ 473,916 $ 433,062 $ 1,805,909 $ 1,808,376 Acquisition Sales — 10,555 — 68,654 Organic Sales $ 473,916 $ 422,507 $ 1,805,909 $ 1,739,722 Organic Sales per Sales Day - Organic Sales per Sales Day is defined as GAAP \"Net sales of the Distribution segment\" less sales derived from acquisitions completed during the preceding twelve months divided by the number of Sales Days in a given period. Sales days (\"Sales Days\") are the days that the Distribution segment's branch locations were open for business and exclude weekends and holidays. Management believes Organic Sales per Sales Day provides an important perspective on how net sales may be impacted by the number of days the segment is open for business and provides a basis for comparing periods in which the number of Sales Days differs.\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of Organic Sales per Sales Day using “Net sales: Distribution” from the “Segment and Geographic Information” footnote in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in the Company's Form 10-K filed Commission on February 27, 2018. Sales from acquisitions are classified as organic beginning with the thirteenth month following the acquisition. Prior period information is adjusted to reflect acquisition sales for that period as organic sales when calculating the change in Organic Sales per Sales Day.\nTable 5. Distribution - Organic Sales Per Sales Day (in thousands, except days) (unaudited) For the Three Months Ended For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Current period Net sales $ 263,000 $ 257,218 $ 1,080,965 $ 1,106,322 Acquisition sales — 490 — 5,171 Organic sales 263,000 256,728 1,080,965 1,101,151 Sales days 62 61 252 253 Organic Sales per Sales Day for the current period a $ 4,242 $ 4,209 $ 4,290 $ 4,352 Prior period Net sales from the prior year $ 257,218 $ 265,706 $ 1,106,322 $ 1,177,539 Sales days from the prior year 61 60 253 253 Sales per sales day from the prior year b $ 4,217 $ 4,428 $ 4,373 $ 4,654 % change (a-b)÷b 0.6 % (4.9 )% (1.9 )% (6.5 )% Table 6.

Management believes this modification to the definition of Adjusted EBITDA will provide greater consistency with the other Non-GAAP measures used by the Company, specifically, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share. As modified, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest, taxes, other expense (income), net, depreciation and amortization and certain items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company's segments or corporate function for the period presented. Adjusted EBITDA differs from net earnings, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, in that it excludes interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, other expense (income), net and certain items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company's segments or corporate function for the period presented. We have made numerous investments in our business, such as acquisitions and capital expenditures, including facility improvements, new machinery and equipment, improvements to our information technology infrastructure and new ERP systems, which we have adjusted for in Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA also does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect funds available for distributions, reinvestments or other discretionary uses. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional perspective on the operating results of the organization and its earnings capacity and helps improve the comparability of our results between periods because it provides a view of our operations that excludes items that management believes are not reflective of operating performance, such as items traditionally removed from net earnings in the calculation of EBITDA as well as Other expense (income), net and certain items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company's segments or corporate function for the period presented. Adjusted EBITDA is not presented as an alternative measure of operating performance, as determined in accordance with GAAP. No other adjustments were made during the year ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to our revised definition. The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA using GAAP measures:\nTable 7. Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) (unaudited) For the Three Months Ended For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Adjusted EBITDA Consolidated Results Sales $ 473,916 $ 433,062 $ 1,805,909 $ 1,808,376 Net earnings $ 13,797 $ 15,127 $ 49,826 $ 58,854 Interest expense, net $ 5,035 $ 3,787 $ 20,581 $ 15,747 Income tax expense 23,518 7,521 44,552 30,850 Other expense (income), net (73 ) 229 (784 ) 472 Depreciation and amortization 10,552 10,810 42,471 43,393 Other Adjustments: Acquisition transaction and integration costs — 295 — 5,145 Senior executive separation costs 768 — 2,882 — CAS 413 pension closeout — 333 — 333 Restructuring and severance costs 355 341 2,855 1,032 Adjustments $ 40,155 $ 23,316 $ 112,557 $ 96,972 Adjusted EBITDA $ 53,952 $ 38,443 $ 162,383 $ 155,826 Adjusted EBITDA margin 11.4 % 8.9 % 9.0 % 8.6 % Free Cash Flow - Free Cash Flow is defined as GAAP “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” in a period less “Expenditures for property, plant & equipment” in the same period. Management believes Free Cash Flow provides an important perspective on our ability to generate cash from our business operations and, as such, that it is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free Cash Flow should not be viewed as representing the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures such as dividends to shareholders or acquisitions, as it may exclude certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt and other contractual obligations. Management uses Free Cash Flow internally to assess overall liquidity. The following table illustrates the calculation of Free Cash Flow using “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” and “Expenditures for property, plant & equipment”, GAAP measures from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this release.\nTable 8. Free Cash Flow (in thousands) (unaudited) For the Twelve Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended For the Three Months Ended December 31,\n2017 September 29,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ 79,885 $ 43,834 $ 36,051 Expenditures for property, plant & equipment (27,631 ) (19,874 ) (7,757 ) Free Cash Flow $ 52,254 $ 23,960 $ 28,294 Table 9.

Debt is defined as GAAP “Current portion of long-term debt” plus “Long-term debt, excluding current portion”. Capitalization is defined as Debt plus GAAP “Total shareholders' equity” and \"Temporary equity\". Management believes that Debt to Capitalization Ratio is a measurement of financial leverage and provides an insight into the financial structure of the Company and its financial strength. The following table illustrates the calculation of Debt to Capitalization Ratio using GAAP measures from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this release.\nTable 10.

These items are included in the reconciliation below. Management uses Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess its performance relative to its competitors. We believe that this information is useful for investors and financial institutions seeking to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance.\nThe following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share using “Net earnings” and “Diluted earnings per share” from the “Consolidated Statements of Operations” included in the Company's Form 10-K filed Commission on February 27, 2018.\nTable 11.

Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income, less items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company's segments or corporate function for the period presented. These items are included in the reconciliation below. Management uses Adjusted Net Sales and Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze underlying trends in our segments and corporate function and to assess their performance relative to their competitors.
