    "text": "February 22, 2018 / 9:23 PM / Updated 41 minutes ago HP Inc quarterly results beat estimates on higher PC sales Reuters Staff 2 Min Read HP Inc ( HPQ.N ), which houses the hardware business of former Hewlett-Packard Co, reported a better-than-expected revenue and profit in the first quarter as the company sold more personal computers and printers. Shares of the company rose 8 percent to $23.11 after the bell on Thursday. HP Inc’s personal systems business, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the company’s total revenue, rose nearly 15 percent to $9.44 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $8.50 billion. Despite a shrinking PC market in the United States, the company continued to pick up market share, after toppling Lenovo Group Ltd ( 0992.HK ) last year from the top position globally, according to research firm Gartner Inc ( IT.N ). Net earnings rose to $1.94 billion, or $1.16 per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31, from $611 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier, benefiting from a one-time tax gain of $1.03 billion. Revenue rose 14.5 percent to $14.52 billion. Excluding items, the Palo Alto, California-based company earned 48 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 42 cents per share and revenue of $13.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Reporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur",
