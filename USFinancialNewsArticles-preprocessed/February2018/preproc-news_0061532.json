The company is well positioned for the future and I look forward to continuing to contribute to the future success of the company as a member of the Board of Directors.”\nMr. Zell continued, “The company has always focused on successfully developing future leaders capable of driving the ongoing growth and success of our business. Bill Galvin brings many years of increasing responsibilities and successful leadership to his new role at Anixter. The Board of Directors has confidence that, under Bill Galvin’s leadership, the company can continue its consistent track record of driving strong growth and shareholder returns.”\n“I am honored to have the opportunity to lead the company and further build on its past successes,” commented Galvin. “Our priorities as a company will continue to center around building on execution of our strategic initiatives, expanding the markets we serve, and effective capital allocation.
