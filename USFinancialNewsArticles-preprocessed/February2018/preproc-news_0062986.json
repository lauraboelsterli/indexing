    "text": "HONG KONG, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX) is still maintaining an \"active\" and \"good conversation\" with Saudi Aramco about its planned massive share sale, the head of HKEX said on Wednesday.\nAt a news conference after announcing its results, Charles Li, however, said HKEX doesn't have visibility about Saudi Aramco's listing plan.\nThe Saudi government says Aramco is worth $2 trillion and aims to list on one or more foreign stock exchanges in addition to Riyadh.\nIn an interview with Reuters in November, Li had said a Hong Kong listing by Aramco would help the oil giant secure huge Chinese demand for its planned $100 bln share sale.
