    "text": "ISTANBUL, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Here are news, reports and events that may affect Turkish financial markets on Friday.\nThe lira stood at 3.7883 against the U.S. dollar at 0509 GMT, easing from Wednesday’s close of 3.7810.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year bond was at 11.94 percent in spot trade on Thursday and rose to 11.95 percent in Friday-dated trade.\nThe main BIST 100 share index rose 0.45 percent to 116,840.94 points on Thursday.\nGLOBAL MARKETS Asian shares rebounded on Friday as comments from a Federal Reserve official eased worries about faster rate rises in the United States, while the safe-haven yen held on to its gains amid heightened volatility across markets. Financial markets have fluctuated wildly this month as investors fretted about how fast the Fed might raise rates in the wake of data showing a pick up in U.S. inflation.\nERDOGAN President Tayyip Erdogan will make a speech at a meeting of provincial heads of his ruling AK Party (0800 GMT).\nDUTCH PARLIAMENT RULING The Dutch parliament on Thursday passed a motion recognising as genocide the massacre of as many as 1.5 million Armenians in 1915, although the government said it would not become official policy of the Netherlands. Turkey’s foreign ministry strongly condemned the Dutch parliament’s approval of the motion.\nCARREFOURSA The retailer will hold a news conference regarding its 2017 performance (0700 GMT).\nFor other related news, double click on:\nTurkish politics TR-POL\nTurkish equities TR-E\nTurkish money TR-M\nTurkish debt TR-D\nTurkish hot stocks TR-HOT\nForex news\nAll emerging market news\nAll Turkish news\nFor real-time Quote: s, double click on:\nIstanbul National-100 stock index, interbank lira trading, lira bond trading 0 ($1 = 3.7595 liras) (Writing by Daren Butler)\n ",
