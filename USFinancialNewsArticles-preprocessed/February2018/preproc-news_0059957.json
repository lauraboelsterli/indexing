    "text": "Published: Feb 28, 2018 2:52 a.m. ET Share \nNSA chief says intrusions aren’t expected to stop Bloomberg News Admiral Mike Rogers, director of the U.S. National Security Agency. \nBy Nancy A. Youssef \nWASHINGTON — The head of the National Security Agency told lawmakers Tuesday that he hadn’t been formally asked by President Donald Trump to take steps to disrupt Russian election hacking activity at its source. \nAdm. Mike Rogers was asked by Sen. Jack Reed (D., R.I.) during testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing whether he had been directed by the president, through the secretary of defense, to strike “the origin of these attacks.” \n“No, I have not,” Rogers replied. Elaborating, he said that while he has directed his agency to begin “some specific work” that he wouldn’t specify in an unclassified setting, the agency hasn’t pursued other work to counter Russian meddling. \nThe exchange before the Senate committee indicated that while the U.S. has taken defensive steps against Russia for its suspected hacking activity, it wasn’t conducting offensive measures, such as attacking the networks behind the intrusions in U.S. elections. Rogers and other intelligence officials say they don’t expect the intrusions to stop.",
