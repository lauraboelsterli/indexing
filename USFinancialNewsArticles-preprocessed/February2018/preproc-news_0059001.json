    "text": "BOSTON, Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively \"LMHC\" or the \"Company\") reported net income attributable to LMHC of $205 million and $17 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $62 million and a decrease of $989 million versus the same periods in 2016, respectively. Including zero and $2 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interest, consolidated net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $205 million and $19 million, respectively.\n\"Net written premium grew 8.8% in the quarter, with net income at $205 million, up $62 million from last year. Profitability increased, despite higher catastrophe losses and a Tax Cuts and Jobs Act related charge, due to improved investment results,\" said David H. Long, Liberty Mutual Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"For the year, we reported net income of $17 million, versus $1 billion in 2016, driven by record catastrophes, adverse development on commercial automobile, and the charge associated by the change in the tax law. While the results in 2017 did not meet expectations, we are encouraged by signs of market firming across each of our businesses.\"\n\"Subsequent to year-end, we announced the sale of Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston to Lincoln Financial and a realignment of our core business. These actions will allow the organization to focus on property and casualty insurance, and to take full advantage of our scale, products, and capabilities globally.\"\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nNet written premium (\"NWP\") for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $8.861 billion, an increase of $716 million or 8.8% over the same period in 2016.

Catastrophe losses, where applicable, include the impact of accelerated earned catastrophe premiums and earned reinstatement premiums. Net incurred losses attributable to prior years is defined as incurred losses attributable to prior years (including prior year losses related to catastrophes and prior year catastrophe reinstatement premium) including earned premium attributable to prior years. Re-estimation of the current accident year loss reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The combined ratio, expressed as a percentage, is a measure of underwriting profitability. This measure should only be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, underwriting income and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company's competitors. The combined ratio is computed as the sum of the following property and casualty ratios: the ratio of claims and claim adjustment expense less managed care income to earned premium; the ratio of insurance operating costs plus amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs less third-party administration income and fee income (primarily related to the Company's involuntary market servicing carrier operations) and installment charges to earned premium; and the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium. Provisions for uncollectible premium and reinsurance are not included in the combined ratio unless related to an asbestos and environmental commutation and certain other run off. Restructuring and Ironshore acquisition and integration costs are not included in the combined ratio.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/liberty-mutual-insurance-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300604524.html\nSOURCE Liberty Mutual Insurance",
