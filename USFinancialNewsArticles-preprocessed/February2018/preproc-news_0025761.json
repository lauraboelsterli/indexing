    "text": "8 COMMENTS At Gangneung Ice Arena in Gangneung, South Korea, the U.S. fell short of gold in the figure skating team event and took home bronze. On the final day, strong performances from Adam Rippon, brother-sister duo Maia and Alex Shibutani, and women’s free skater Mirai Nagasu were enough to stave off a competitive Italian team.\nWith her skate, Ms. Nagasu became the first American woman to land a triple axel in the Olympics. Mr. Rippon’s routine dazzled an international audience. And the Shib Sibs’ dance made it clear they’ll contend for medals on their own. \nWatch more Olympics videos here But we can’t show you those precise highlights. NBC paid over $1 billion for the rights to broadcast this and all other Olympic events at the Winter Games in South Korea. The Wall Street Journal paid far less than that to bring you this exclusive look at highlights from the figure skating competition—portrayed by puppets.\nWe’re very serious about this. \nSign up to receive our Olympics Briefing.
