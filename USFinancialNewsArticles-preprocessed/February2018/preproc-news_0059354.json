    "text": "(Reuters) - Chipmaker Microchip Technology ( MCHP.O ) is in talks to buy Microsemi Corp ( MSCC.O ), the largest U.S. commercial supplier of military and aerospace semiconductor equipment, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\nThe potential deal will value Microsemi at mid-$60s per share and a deal could be struck as early as this week, the source told Reuters.\nMicrosemi has a market capitalization of $7.55 billion, based on the stock’s Monday close.\nThe company was exploring its options, including a possible sale, after it received a takeover approach, Reuters reported last month.\nThe deal, if finalized, comes amid a new wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry.\nBroadcom Ltd ( AVGO.O ) on Monday had called a proposal by U.S. semiconductor peer Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) for a new meeting to negotiate an increase to Broadcom’s $117 billion acquisition offer “engagement theater” aimed at dodging a takeover battle.\nArizona-based Microchip purchased fellow chipmaker Atmel in January 2016 for $3.42 billion in cash and stock.\nMicrochip and Microsemi did not respond to request for comments outside regular business hours.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier Microchip is nearing a deal to buy Microsemi.\nReporting by Mekhla Raina in Bengaluru and Liana Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ",
