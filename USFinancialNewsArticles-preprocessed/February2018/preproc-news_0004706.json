    "text": "(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) fourth-quarter profit fell short of Wall Street forecasts as Google’s parent company invested heavily on self-driving cars, smartphones and home devices, while its core internet advertising business remained strong. \nShares of the company fell 2.7 percent to $1,137 in after-hours trading on Thursday. \nAlphabet posted a net loss of $3.02 billion or $4.35 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a profit of $5.33 billion or $7.56 per share a year earlier. \nResults included a one-time, $9.9-billion charge related to new U.S. tax laws. \nExcluding one-time items, the company reported earnings of $9.70 per share but missed analysts’ average estimate of $9.98 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nAlphabet’s total spending jumped nearly 27 percent to $24.66 billion. \nTotal revenue rose 24 percent year-over-year to $32.32 billion, led by soaring sales of pricey online ads, an industry dominated by Alphabet and social media giant Facebook. \nGoogle sells ad space on YouTube, its search engine and a variety of third-party platforms for anyone to display ads that lead users to watch video, install an app or visit a website. \nLed by such ads, Google’s advertising revenue rose 21.6 percent to $27.23 billion in the fourth quarter. \nAlphabet on Thursday also named John Hennessy as chair of its board. \nReporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ",
