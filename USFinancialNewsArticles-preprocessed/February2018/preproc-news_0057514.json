    "text": "DETROIT, Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MRM//McCann, a leading global customer relationship agency, today announced that it has promoted Subu Desaraju to Executive Vice President, Director of Performance Analytics, for its North American operations. For MRM//McCann, which this week was named Ad Age's 2018 Business-to-Business Agency of the Year, this new regional role and capability represents an overall expansion of its data-based performance analytics practice.\nDesaraju, who will lead all strategy, function, talent and delivery for the agency's Performance Analytics practice across Canada and the U.S., previously had held a similar position at MRM//McCann Detroit. As part of its expanded analytics practice, the agency has also promoted Maria DePanfilis to Senior Vice President, Director of Performance Analytics for MRM//McCann New York and Princeton offices, where she will be responsible for operations, structure and delivery.\n\"Over the past year, we have made great strides in advancing our analytics practice through investment in strategic tools, practices, markets — and people,\" said Kate MacNevin, Global President and Chief Operating Officer, MRM//McCann. \"The increasing volume, variety and velocity of data is creating a deluge of information that is not inherently actionable. With Subu at the helm and Maria's expanded role, we will further enable brands to go beyond business intelligence and develop cognitive methods that deliver meaningful intelligence for our valued clients.\"\nMRM//McCann's global strengthening of its overall digital capabilities was recognized early in 2017 when the consulting firm Gartner Inc. elevated the agency to the \"Leader\" category in its \"Magic Quadrant for Global Digital Marketing Agencies\" report, citing the agency's ability \"to transform client businesses around the customer and deliver measurable business impact as a result.\"\nA seasoned digital marketing leader with more than 20 years of industry experience, Desaraju holds an MBA from the New York University Stern School of Business and a Master's/B.E. in Computer and Information Science from New Jersey Institute of Technology. He's worked at the intersection of business strategy, marketing analytics and technology throughout his career. Prior to joining MRM//McCann in 2015 to run their performance marketing and analytics practice in Detroit, he held leadership positions at Digitas, GTB and Marsh & McLennan Co.\nDePanfilis is an accomplished marketing executive and analytics subject matter expert with a proven track record of thought leadership and innovation. She holds a B.A. in Psychology from Loyola University Maryland and a Master's of Science in Applied Statistics from Columbia University. Before coming to MRM//McCann two years ago to lead the New York team, she ran analytics practices for Rosetta and Havas Life and owned her own life coaching business.\nAbout MRM//McCann\nMRM//McCann, named Ad Age's 2018 Business-to-Business Agency of the Year, is a leading customer relationship agency that helps brands grow meaningful relationships with people.
