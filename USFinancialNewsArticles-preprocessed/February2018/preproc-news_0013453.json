    "text": "(Reuters) - Tapestry Inc ( TPR.N ) reported quarterly results that surpassed expectations and raised its profit outlook for the full year, driven by strong demand for its Coach handbags, sending its soaring to their highest in nearly four years.\nThe results were underpinned by Tapestry’s success in transforming itself into a multi-brand company and a move to pull inventory from stores and cut back on flash sales to retain brand exclusivity.\nWhile sales of Coach handbags have rebounded, the company is following the same strategy to stanch a decline in sales at Kate Spade, a brand it acquired last year.\nCoach same-store sales rose 3 percent in the latest quarter, compared with analysts’ estimate of 1.83 percent.\nKate Spade’s comparable store sales fell 7 percent but the drop was smaller than the 8.84 percent expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n“Tapestry wants to take Kate Spade through the same process used to rebuild Coach,” Neil Saunders, managing director of Globaldata Retail wrote in a note, noting that the brand had become overly reliant on excessive promotions to drive results.\nTapestry said it would continue to significantly restrict surprise and promotional sales and that it would no longer use flash sales widely.\nTapestry’s Coach brand provides a stable platform to drive sales and margins of the company’s newer brands, William Blair analyst Dylan Carden said in a note.\nFor 2018, the company said it now expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.52 to $2.60, compared with its previous forecast of $2.35-$2.40.\nOverall revenue rose to $1.79 billion in the second quarter ended Dec. 30, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.77 billion.\nThe company recorded a one-time charge of $194 million in the latest quarter related to the new tax law that resulted in a decline in net income to $63.2 million from $199.7 million a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Tapestry earned $1.07 per share, beating the average estimate of 89 cents for the quarter.\nGross profit margin fell to 66 percent from 68.58 percent a year earlier.\nReporting by Nivedita Balu and Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ",
