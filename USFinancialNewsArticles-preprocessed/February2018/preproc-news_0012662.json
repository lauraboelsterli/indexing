(NYSE:VSH), one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components, today announced its results for the year and fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2,603.5 million, compared to $2,323.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $20.3 million, or $(0.14) per share, reflecting charges related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $48.8 million, or $0.32 per share.\nRevenues for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $674.5 million, compared to $570.8 million for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $(177.7) million, or $(1.23) per share, compared to $(48.7) million, or $(0.33) per share for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nAs summarized on the attached reconciliation schedule, all periods presented include items affecting comparability, the most significant of which is a $235 million charge related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, which exclude these items net of tax and the unusual tax items, were $0.37 and $1.43 for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and $0.18 and $0.85 for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nCommenting on the results for the year 2017, Dr. Gerald Paul, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “2017 was a very successful year for Vishay. Throughout the year Vishay experienced a very high level of demand of virtually all market segments. Driven by increased volume Vishay demonstrated the leverage of its business model. Vishay continues to increase the manufacturing capacities of its key product lines, mainly by pulling forward certain programs of its 5-year Growth Plan. We are excited about the opportunities that accelerated market growth offers Vishay, especially in automotive and industrial applications.”\nDr. Paul continued, commenting on the results for the fourth quarter 2017, “The fourth quarter represented a continuation of the trends of the year. Stretched lead times led to a further increase of an already unusually high backlog. Both OEM and distribution customers remain very confident across the board.”\nCommenting on the outlook Dr. Paul stated, “For the first quarter based on Vishay’s capacity constraints, we guide for revenues of $665 to $705 million and gross margins of 26.5% to 27.5% at the exchange rates for the fourth quarter.”\nAs permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, the tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is considered “provisional,” based on reasonable estimates, and these provisional amounts may be refined during the defined measurement period, as additional analysis is completed.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company will adopt several new accounting standards, including ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and related guidance; ASU 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities;” and ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” The impact of these new accounting standards on income before taxes is not expected to be material; however, the changes will impact individual line items, and could thus slightly impact gross margin and operating margin calculations. More detailed discussion of the impact of these new accounting standards will be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K when it is filed.\nA conference call to discuss Vishay’s fourth quarter and full year financial results is scheduled for Tuesday, February 6, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET. The dial-in number for the conference call is 877-589-6174 (+1 706-643-1406 if calling from outside the United States or Canada) and the conference ID is 8184089.\nThere will be a replay of the conference call from 12:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, February 6, 2018 through 11:59 p.m. ET on Tuesday, February 13, 2018. The telephone number for the replay is 800-585-8367 (+1 855-859-2056 or 404-537-3406 if calling from outside the United States or Canada) and the access code is 8184089.\nA live audio webcast of the conference call and a PDF copy of the press release and the quarterly presentation will be accessible directly from the Investor Relations section of the Vishay website at http://ir.vishay.com .\nAbout Vishay\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc., a Fortune 1000 Company listed on the NYSE (VSH), is one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors (diodes, MOSFETs, and infrared optoelectronics) and passive electronic components (resistors, inductors, and capacitors). These components are used in virtually all types of electronic devices and equipment, in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer, telecommunications, military, aerospace, power supplies, and medical markets. Vishay’s product innovations, successful acquisition strategy, and \"one-stop shop\" service have made it a global industry leader. Vishay can be found on the Internet at www.vishay.com .\nThis press release includes certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), including adjusted net earnings; adjusted earnings per share; adjusted operating margin; free cash; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"); adjusted EBITDA; and adjusted EBITDA margin; which are considered \"non-GAAP financial measures\" under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These non-GAAP measures supplement our GAAP measures of performance or liquidity and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity. Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin do not have uniform definitions. These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management believes that such measures are meaningful to investors because they provide insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company. Although the terms \"free cash\" and \"EBITDA\" are not defined in GAAP, the measures are derived using various line items measured in accordance with GAAP. Reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net earnings represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding the Company's intrinsic operations. Reconciling items to calculate adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA represent those same items used in computing adjusted net earnings, as relevant. Furthermore, the presented calculation of adjusted EBITDA is substantially similar to, but not identical to, a measure used in the calculation of financial ratios required for covenant compliance under Vishay's revolving credit facility. These reconciling items are indicated on the accompanying reconciliation schedules and are more fully described in the Company's financial statements presented in its annual report on Form 10-K and its quarterly reports presented on Forms 10-Q.\nStatements contained herein that relate to the Company's future performance, including statements with respect to forecasted revenues, margins, manufacturing capacities, customer confidence, anticipated growth areas for the company, global growth markets generally and the performance of the economy in general, are forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"will be,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" or other similar words or expressions often identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on current expectations only, and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance, or achievements may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Among the factors that could cause actual results to materially differ include: general business and economic conditions; delays or difficulties in implementing our cost reduction strategies; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; uncertainty related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; competition and technological changes in our industries; difficulties in new product development; difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, consummating a transaction on terms which we consider acceptable, and integration and performance of acquired businesses; changes in applicable domestic and foreign tax regulations and uncertainty regarding the same; changes in applicable accounting standards and other factors affecting our operations that are set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nSource: Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nContact:\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nPeter Henrici\nSenior Vice President, Corporate Communications\n+1-610-644-1300\nVISHAY INTERTECHNOLOGY, INC.
