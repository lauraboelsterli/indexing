    "text": "CASTLE ROCK, Colo., Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Riot Blockchain, Inc. (Nasdaq: RIOT) (the \"Company\") today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire additional cryptocurrency mining equipment consisting of 3,800 Antminer S9 Bitcoin miners manufactured by Bitmain. The Antminer S9 is considered the world's most efficient ASIC cryptocurrency mining machine.\nThe Company expects its total hashing power to be over 60 Petahash of SHA 256 Bitcoin mining computing power and 252 Gigahash of Scrypt for Litecoin mining following the Acquisition and the full deployment of all equipment. The closing of the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close on or before February 21, 2018.\nThe blockchain is a decentralized and encrypted ledger that offers a secure, efficient, verifiable and permanent way of storing records and other information without the need for intermediaries. These protocols are the backbone of numerous cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. Blockchain protocols have a wide range of use, including processing transactions, accounting, verification and proof of ownership across a far-reaching spectrum of applications.\nAbout Riot Blockchain\nRiot Blockchain, Inc. is leveraging its expertise and a network of professional advisors to build and support blockchain technologies. It is establishing an Advisory Board with technical experience intending to become a leading authority and supporter of blockchain, while providing investment exposure to the rapidly growing Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystems.

Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and forward-looking statements described under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on November 13, 2017 and in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2017, as amended as of April 27, 2017 and August 15, 2017. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that event, the value of our securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results in the future.
