    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 6:23 PM / Updated 2 minutes ago U.S. drillers boost oil rig count to highest nearly three years: Baker Hughes Scott DiSavino 3 Min Read \n  \nThe increase in the week to Feb. 9 was the biggest weekly rise since January 2017, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. \nMore than half of those oil rigs were located in the Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico where the number of active units increased by 10 this week to 437, the most since January 2015. \nThose rigs were expected to help boost oil output in the Permian to a record high near 2.9 million barrels per day in February, according to federal projections, representing about 30 percent of total U.S. oil production. \n  \nU.S. crude prices on Friday fell through $60 a barrel for the first time since December and have tumbled more than 11 percent from this year’s   \nLooking ahead, futures were trading above $57 for the balance of 2018 and below $54 for calendar 2019. \nIn anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 36 of the roughly 65 E&Ps they track, including Pioneer Natural Resources Corp, have already provided capital expenditure guidance indicating an 8 percent increase in planned spending over 2017. \nPioneer said it expects to spend about $2.65 billion in drilling and completions in 2018. Cowen said that was up 1 percent from 2017. \nCowen said the E&Ps it tracks planned to spend about $66.1 billion on drilling and completions in the lower 48 U.S. states in 2017, about 53 percent over what they planned to spend in 2016. \n  \n  \n  [EIA/M] \nThe current all-time U.S. output annual peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data.
