Cofense reflects the full breadth of our portfolio of enterprise-wide attack detection, response, and orchestration solutions.\"\nCofense now has the added backing of multiple private equity firms to support future innovation via organic and inorganic growth initiatives. With hundreds of enterprise customers in more than 50 countries and across 23 industry verticals, Cofense will continue to deliver leading solutions in phishing defense by offering solutions that sit at the intersection of human intelligence and technology.\n\"This acquisition further strengthens the alignment between our management team, employees, and investors as we focus on building an enduring company,\" continued Rohyt Belani. \"With cybersecurity a top priority for organizations everywhere, our goal is to continue bringing innovative products to markets around the globe to help stop active attacks faster than ever.\"\nThe new identity and acquisition comes on the heels of another year of explosive growth for the company, with major milestones including:\nApproximately 80% revenue CAGR over the last four years.
