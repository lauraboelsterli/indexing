    "text": " 25   U.N. AIDS agency deputy chief to leave after unsubstantiated allegations Reuters Staff 1 Min Read GENEVA (Reuters) - Luiz Loures, deputy head of the U.N. agency for HIV/AIDS, will not seek to renew his position, the agency’s spokesman said, adding it was not reasonable to link his departure to sexual harassment allegations that were found to be unsubstantiated. UNAIDS spokesman Mahesh Mahalingam told a U.N. briefing on Friday that Loures had had a long and distinguished career with four decades spent working on combating AIDS, including 22 years at UNAIDS, but “he clearly feels that it is time for him to move on”. Mahalingam said it was not reasonable to link his departure to allegations of sexual harassment. “The independent investigation done by the WHO’s (World Health Organization‘s) internal oversight services division clearly found that the case was unsubstantiated and recommended the case to be closed,” he said.
