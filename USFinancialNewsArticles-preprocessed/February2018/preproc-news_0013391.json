    "text": "February 1, 2018 / 6:20 PM / Updated 10 hours ago UK power capacity auction for 2018/19 clears at 5-10 pounds kW/year - national grid Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Britain secured 10.66 gigawatts of backup electricity capacity for 2018/2019 at 5-10 pounds/kilowatt (kW)/year, data on the National Grid auction website showed on Thursday. \nBritain began capacity auctions in 2014, looking to head off future power shortages as coal plants close and low power prices dissuade investors from building new ones. \nPower plant owners are paid to make available backup electricity at short notice.
