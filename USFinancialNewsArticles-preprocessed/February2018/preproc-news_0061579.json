    "text": "CORAL GABLES, Fla., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MasTec, Inc. (NYSE: MTZ) today announced strong 2017 fourth quarter and full year financial results, and issued its initial 2018 guidance expectation.\nFourth quarter 2017 revenue was $1.60 billion, a 19% increase compared with $1.34 billion for the same period last year. GAAP net income was $160.7 million, or $1.95 per diluted share, compared to $55.9 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP net income included an after-tax benefit of $120.1 million or $1.46 per diluted share related to the impact of re-measurement of the Company's U.S. deferred income tax balances because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"2017 Tax Act\") enacted in December 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $38.8 million, compared to $60.0 million in the same period of the prior year. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.47, compared to $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2016, and exceeded the Company's previously announced 2017 fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance expectation by $0.11. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP measure, was $128.9 million, compared to $154.1 million in the same period in 2016. Record 18-month backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $7.1 billion, a 31% increase compared to $5.4 billion for the prior year end and a 41% sequential increase when compared to backlog as of third quarter of 2017. 18-month backlog as of December 31, 2017 included record levels of Oil & Gas, Communications and Power Generation & Industrial segment backlog, as well as a significant sequential increase in Electrical Transmission segment backlog.\nThe Company also reported:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue was $6.6 billion, a 29% increase compared with $5.1 billion for the prior year. GAAP net income, inclusive of the after-tax benefit related to the 2017 Tax Act, was $348.9 million, or $4.22 per diluted share, compared to $134.0 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, in 2016. Full year 2017 adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $241.9 million, a 53% increase compared to $157.7 million for 2016. Full year 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $2.92, a 54% increase compared to $1.90 in 2016, and exceeded the Company's previously announced 2017 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance expectation by $0.12. Full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP measure, was $645.6 million, a 35% increase compared to $476.9 million in 2016.\nAdjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, which are all non-GAAP measures, exclude certain items which are detailed and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP-reported measures in the attached Supplemental Disclosures and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Disclosures.\nJose Mas, MasTec's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are pleased that 2017 marks the second consecutive year of record financial performance for MasTec and proud that our 2018 guidance expectation is at yet another record level.\"\nMr. Mas continued, \"We enter 2018 with record levels of 18-month backlog, which only partially represents the strength of the significant demand for our services, as many items in our backlog represent multi-year programs that will initiate over the course of the 2018 period. This gives us visibility for continued growth in 2019 and beyond. I want to thank the men and women of MasTec for their dedicated efforts during 2017 and look forward to even greater performance in the future.\"\nGeorge Pita, MasTec's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer noted, \"Our capital structure and ample liquidity gives us full financial flexibility to support the significant multi-year growth opportunities that exist across the multiple markets we serve. During 2017, we invested over $200 million dollars in acquisitions and other strategic initiatives. We also deployed working capital associated with over $1.5 billion in annual revenue growth, including a higher than normal level of fourth quarter working capital as we work towards the completion of several major projects. Thus, we expect 2018 to be a record year of cash flow from operations for MasTec.\"\nBased on the information available today, the Company is providing both first quarter and full year 2018 guidance. The Company currently expects full year 2018 revenue will approximate $6.75 billion, a record level. 2018 full year GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are expected to approximate $277 million and $3.34, respectively, compared to 2017 GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share (inclusive of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act) of $348 million and $4.22, respectively. Full year 2018 non-GAAP measures including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share represent record levels, with adjusted EBITDA expected to approximate $685 million or 10.2% of revenue, and adjusted earnings per share expected to be $3.45, an 18% increase over 2017. Full year 2018 guidance expectation assumes an estimated 2018 income tax rate of approximately 29.5% because of the 2017 Tax Act.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, The Company expects revenue of approximately $1.23 billion. First quarter 2018 GAAP net income is expected to approximate $14 million, with GAAP diluted earnings per share expected to be $0.17. First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is expected to approximate $90 million or 7.3% of revenue, with adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, expected to be $0.20.\nManagement will hold a conference call to discuss these results on Wednesday, February 28, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The call-in number for the conference call is (719) 325-4768 and the replay phone number is (719) 457-0820 with a pass code of 9270429. The replay will be available for 30 days.
