Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected by management of the Company.

A revenue-earning day is defined as a 24-hour period during which a rig earns a dayrate after commencement of operations and excludes mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation days.\n(2)\nUtilization is calculated as the ratio of total revenue-earning days divided by the total calendar days in the period for all specified rigs in our fleet (including cold-stacked rigs). Our current fleet includes three ultra-deepwater and two deepwater semisubmersible rigs that are cold stacked.\n(3)\nOperational efficiency is calculated as the ratio of total revenue-earning days divided by the sum of total revenue-earning days plus the number of days (or portions thereof) associated with unanticipated equipment downtime.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)\nTo supplement the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, this press release provides investors with adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures provide meaningful information about the Company's performance by excluding certain charges that may not be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating results. This allows investors and others to better compare the company's financial results across previous and subsequent accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long-term performance of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered to be a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nIn order to fully assess the financial operating results of the Company, management believes that the results of operations adjusted to exclude the impairment charges related to rigs and associated inventory, gains and losses on the sale of rigs, the fourth quarter 2017 restructuring and separation costs, which include costs associated with the termination of our Brazilian agency agreement, and the third quarter 2017 loss on extinguishment of debt, as well as the related tax effects thereof and other discrete tax items, are appropriate measures of the continuing and normal operations of the Company. However, these measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, contract drilling revenue, contract drilling expense, operating income, cash flows from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\nReconciliation of As Reported Operating (Loss)\nIncome to Adjusted Operating Income:\n(In thousands)\nAs reported operating (loss) income\n$ (6,385)\n$ 58,581\n$ 123,879\n$ (356,884)\nImpairments and other charges:\nImpairment of rigs (1)\n28,045\n-\n99,313\n678,145\nRestructuring and separation costs (2)\n14,146\n-\n14,146\n-\n(Gain) loss on sale of rigs (3)\n(8,417)\n-\n(8,919)\n4,938\nAdjusted operating income\n$ 27,389\n$ 58,581\n$ 228,419\n$ 326,199\nReconciliation of As Reported Net (Loss)\nIncome to Adjusted Net (Loss) Income:\n(In thousands)\nAs reported net (loss) income\n$ (31,941)\n$ 10,799\n$ 18,346\n$ (372,503)\nImpairments and other charges:\nImpairment of rigs (1)\n28,045\n-\n99,313\n678,145\nRestructuring and separation costs (2)\n14,146\n-\n14,146\n-\n(Gain) loss on sale of rigs (3)\n(8,417)\n-\n(8,919)\n4,938\nLoss on extinguishment of senior notes (4)\n-\n35,366\n35,366\n-\nTax effect of impairments and other charges:\nImpairment of rigs (5)\n(9,816)\n-\n(34,760)\n(143,165)\nRestructuring and separation costs (5)\n(1,070)\n-\n(1,070)\n-\n(Gain) loss on sale of rigs (5)\n556\n-\n720\n(1,718)\nLoss on extinguishment of senior notes (5)\n-\n(12,378)\n(12,378)\n-\nOther discrete items (6)\n1,154\n-\n1,154\n77,252\nAdjusted net (loss) income\n$ (7,343)\n$ 33,787\n$ 111,918\n$ 242,949\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\nReconciliation of As Reported (Loss) Income\nper Diluted Share to Adjusted Earnings per Diluted\nShare:\nAs reported (loss) income per diluted share\n$ (0.23)\n$ 0.08\n$ 0.13\n$ (2.72)\nImpairments and other charges:\nImpairment of rigs (1)\n0.21\n-\n0.72\n4.94\nRestructuring and separation costs (2)\n0.10\n-\n0.10\n-\n(Gain) loss on sale of rigs (3)\n(0.06)\n-\n(0.06)\n0.04\nLoss on extinguishment of senior notes (4)\n-\n0.26\n0.26\n-\nTax effect of impairments and other charges:\nImpairment of rigs (5)\n(0.07)\n-\n(0.25)\n(1.04)\nRestructuring and separation costs (5)\n(0.01)\n-\n(0.01)\n-\n(Gain) loss on sale of rigs (5)\n-\n-\n0.01\n(0.01)\nLoss on extinguishment of senior notes (5)\n-\n(0.09)\n(0.09)\n-\nOther discrete items (6)\n0.01\n-\n0.01\n0.56\nAdjusted (loss) earnings per diluted share\n$ (0.05)\n$ 0.25\n$ 0.82\n$ 1.77\n(1)\nRepresents the aggregate amount of impairment losses recognized during 2016 and 2017 related to certain of our drilling rigs and associated inventory.\n(2)\nRepresents restructuring and separation costs recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with a plan to restructure our world-wide operations, including a reduction in workforce at our corporate facilities and onshore bases, and costs associated with the termination of our Brazilian agency agreement.\n(3)\nRepresents the aggregate amount of (gains) losses recognized during 2016 and 2017 related to the sale of one ultra-deepwater, two deepwater and six mid-water semi-submersible rigs and five jack-up rigs.\n(4)\nRepresents the loss recognized during the third quarter of 2017 related to the early retirement of our 5.875% senior notes due 2019.\n(5)\nRepresents the income tax effects of the aggregate impairment losses and (gains) losses on the sale of rigs recognized during 2016 and 2017, the aggregate restructuring and separation costs recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the loss on extinguishment of the 2019 senior notes recognized in the third quarter of 2017. The income tax effects have been calculated on a discrete tax basis, utilizing the statutory tax rates for the applicable tax jurisdictions. We believe that this approach provides investors and others with useful information regarding the actual tax impact of these transactions when the appropriate tax returns are filed with the taxing authorities.\n(6)\nRepresents the aggregate of certain discrete income tax adjustments recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017, related to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation and during the second quarter of 2016, primarily related to valuation allowances for current and prior year tax assets associated with foreign tax credits, which we no longer expect to be able to utilize to offset income taxes in the U.S. tax jurisdiction.\nContact:\nSamir Ali\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Development\n(281) 647-4035\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/diamond-offshore-announces-fourth-quarter-2017-results-300596830.html\nSOURCE Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.",
