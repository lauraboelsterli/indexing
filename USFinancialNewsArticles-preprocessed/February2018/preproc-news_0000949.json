    "text": "Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. states, cities, schools and other issuers in the municipal market sold only $19.57 billion of debt in January, the lowest supply for that month since 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data on Thursday.\nIssuance plummeted after nearly $58.2 billion of debt hit the $3.8 trillion market in December. Fears that federal tax legislation would terminate certain types of tax-exempt bonds sparked a rush by many issuers to sell debt. That resulted in record-high supply for the month of December.\nThe final bill, signed into law in late December by President Donald Trump, did not eliminate a federal tax break for private activity bonds typically sold to finance hospitals, affordable housing and other projects. But the law ended a practice used by most muni issuers to refinance bonds on a tax-exempt basis beyond 90 days from their call date for interest rate savings.\nJanuary supply was also hit by the postponed pricing this week of a $1.39 billion deal from Pennsylvania’s Commonwealth Financing Authority. The revenue bond issue, backed by Pennsylvania’s share of a multi-state settlement with U.S. tobacco companies, was aimed at raising money for the current state budget.\nA spokesman for Governor Tom Wolf said this week that the bond deal would be completed in February.
