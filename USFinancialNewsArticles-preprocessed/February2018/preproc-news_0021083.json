    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp ( CVS.N ) on Thursday said that a request for more information from U.S. antitrust regulators reviewing its proposed $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) does not impact its expectation that the deal will close in the second half of 2018.\nThe companies said on Feb. 1 that they had been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice for additional information. The companies have a shareholder meeting scheduled for March 20 to vote on the transaction.\nReporting by Caroline HumerEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
