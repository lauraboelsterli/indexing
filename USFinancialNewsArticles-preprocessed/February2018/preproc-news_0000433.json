    "text": "LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell profit more than doubled in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $4.3 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts, supported by higher oil and gas prices and production, the company said on Thursday.\nNet income attributable to shareholders, based on a current cost of supplies (CCS) and excluding identified items, rose 140 percent from $1.795 billion.\nA company-provided analysts’ consensus forecast was $4.24 billion.\nThe Anglo-Dutch company took a $2 billion charge in the quarter due to the new U.S. tax regime, it said.\nOn an annual basis, Shell’s profits more than doubled to $15.76 billion from $7.185 billion.\nReporting by Ron Bousso; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
