    "text": "OXFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RBC Bearings Incorporated (Nasdaq: ROLL), a leading international manufacturer of highly-engineered precision bearings and components for the industrial, defense and aerospace industries, today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nThird Quarter Highlights\n($ in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Change GAAP Adjusted (1) GAAP Adjusted (1) GAAP Adjusted (1) Net sales $166.9 $166.9 $146.7 $146.7 13.8% 13.8% Gross margin $64.7 $64.7 $52.4 $55.6 23.4% 16.3% Gross margin % 38.8% 38.8% 35.7% 37.9% Operating income $33.1 $34.2 $20.5 $27.6 61.3% 24.0% Operating income % 19.9% 20.5% 14.0% 18.8% Net income $23.8 $25.7 $12.8 $17.4 86.6% 48.1% Diluted EPS $0.97 $1.05 $0.54 $0.73 79.6% 43.8% (1) Results exclude items in reconciliation below. Nine Month Highlights\n($ in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Change GAAP Adjusted (1) GAAP Adjusted (1) GAAP Adjusted (1) Net sales $495.1 $495.1 $455.2 $455.2 8.8% 8.8% Gross margin $188.4 $188.4 $166.4 $170.0 13.2% 10.8% Gross margin % 38.1% 38.1% 36.5% 37.3% Operating income $90.2 $97.8 $79.3 $87.0 13.7% 12.4% Operating income % 18.2% 19.8% 17.4% 19.1% Net income $60.5 $67.9 $49.0 $53.8 23.3% 26.2% Diluted EPS $2.49 $2.79 $2.07 $2.27 20.3% 22.9% (1) Results exclude items in reconciliation below. “Our third quarter results demonstrated strong year-over-year and sequential improvements in each of our key performance metrics, during what is traditionally our slowest seasonal fiscal quarter,” said Dr. Michael J. Hartnett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Continued sales growth in our aerospace and industrial markets, combined with the execution of our cost initiatives, have driven strong quarterly and year-to-date results, positioning the Company well as we enter the fourth quarter.”\nThird Quarter Results\nNet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $166.9 million, an increase of 13.8% from $146.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Net sales for the aerospace markets increased 8.9% and the industrial markets increased by 23.1%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $64.7 million compared to $52.4 million for the same period last year. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 38.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 35.7% for the same period last year.\nSG&A for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $28.2 million, an increase of $2.5 million from $25.7 million for the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 16.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 17.5% for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel related expenses of $1.7 million, $0.3 million of additional incentive stock compensation and other items of $0.5 million.\nOther operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $3.4 million compared to $6.1 million for the same period last year. For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, other operating expenses were comprised of $1.1 million related to restructuring of our Canadian operation and $2.3 million of amortization of intangible assets. Other operating expenses last year consisted of $3.8 million in restructuring and integration costs associated with our industrial manufacturing operation in South Carolina and $2.3 million in amortization of intangible assets.\nOperating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $33.1 million compared to operating income of $20.5 million for the same period last year. Excluding costs associated with restructuring of our Canadian operation, operating income would have been $34.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to an adjusted $27.6 million for the same period last year. Excluding these adjustments, operating income as a percentage of net sales would have been 20.5% compared to 18.8% for the same period last year.\nInterest expense, net was $1.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $2.1 million for the same period last year.\nIncome tax expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $7.5 million compared to $5.9 million for the same period last year. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 23.9% compared to 31.5% for the same period last year. Tax provision was impacted by the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) signed into law by the President on December 22, 2017. The income tax expense includes approximately $9.5 million expense related to the one-time repatriation transition tax offset by approximately $8.7 million benefit associated with the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. The income tax expense also includes approximately $1.2 million of benefit associated with the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” and reflects the lower blended statutory rate as a result of the enactment of TCJA.\nNet income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $23.8 million compared to $12.8 million for the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, net income would have been $25.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to an adjusted net income of $17.4 million for the same period last year.\nDiluted EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 97 cents per share compared to 54 cents per share for the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 would have been $1.05 per share compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of 73 cents per share for the same period last year, an increase of 43.8%.\nBacklog, as of December 30, 2017, was $392.5 million compared to $349.1 million as of December 31, 2016.\nTax Reform\nThe third quarter of fiscal 2018 includes the impact of adjustments made in relation to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). These one-time adjustments resulted in a net tax charge of $0.8 million. These one-time adjustments were mainly comprised of a charge of $9.5 million for the estimated repatriation transition tax offset by an estimated benefit of $8.7 million associated with revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities. The third quarter tax provision also benefited from a lower blended statutory tax rate of 31.5% due to the enactment of TCJA. Based on our initial reviews and subject to further regulatory guidance issued in connection with TCJA, we estimate the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 effective tax rate will be approximately 25.0% to 27.0% and we estimate the full year fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will be approximately 20.0% to 22.0%.\nRestructuring of Canadian Operation\nThe Company recorded an after-tax charge of $1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with the second quarter fiscal 2018 decision to restructure its manufacturing operation in Montreal, Canada. The $1.1 million charge was primarily associated with employee severance and termination costs. Year to date after-tax charges are $6.7 million and the total expected impact of the restructuring remains between $7.0 million and $7.5 million in after-tax charges.\nOutlook for the Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018\nThe Company expects net sales to be approximately $172.0 million to $175.0 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2018. This would result in a growth rate of approximately 7.4% to 9.2% on a year over year basis.\nLive Webcast\nRBC Bearings Incorporated will host a webcast at 11:00 a.m. ET today to discuss the quarterly results.
