The year-over-year decrease in cash provided by operations during fiscal 2018 primarily relates to decreases in certain working capital asset accounts, partially offset by a decrease in net income. The Company's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 were $12.8 million, an increase of $1.3 million when compared to $11.5 million at June 30, 2017.

The Company's adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share guidance excludes any non-operating or non-recurring expenses that may materialize during fiscal 2018. The Company is not providing GAAP earnings per diluted share guidance for fiscal 2018 due to the potential occurrence of one or more non-operating, one-time expenses, which the Company does not believe it can reliably predict.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will hold an investor conference call today at 2:30 p.m. MST (4:30 p.m. EST).

Non-GAAP EBITDA and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We define Non-GAAP Net Income as GAAP net income less certain tax adjusted non-recurring one-time expenses incurred during the period and Non-GAAP Earnings per Share as Non-GAAP Net Income divided by weighted-average shares outstanding.\nWe are presenting Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share because management believes that they provide additional ways to view our operations when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net income, which we believe provides a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share are presented solely as supplemental disclosure because: (i) we believe these measures are a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of the business without the effect of these items; (ii) we believe that investors will find this data useful in assessing shareholder value; and (iii) we use Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share internally as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance or compare our performance to that of our competitors. The use of Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings per Share has limitations and you should not consider these measures in isolation from or as an alternative to the relevant GAAP measure of net income prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of profitability or liquidity.\nThe tables set forth below present Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings per Share which are non-GAAP financial measures to Net Income and Earnings per Share, our most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nInvestor Relations Contacts:\nScott Van Winkle\nManaging Director, ICR\n(617) 956-6736\nscott.vanwinkle@icrinc.com\nLIFEVANTAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (unaudited) (In thousands, except per share data) December 31, 2017 June 30, 2017 ASSETS Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 12,794 $ 11,458 Accounts receivable 1,542 1,334 Income tax receivable 86 913 Inventory, net 16,819 16,575 Prepaid expenses and deposits 4,052 5,266 Total current assets 35,293 35,546 Property and equipment, net 4,644 3,127 Intangible assets, net 1,181 1,247 Long-term deferred income tax asset 3,396 4,087 Other long-term assets 1,142 1,242 TOTAL ASSETS $ 45,656 $ 45,249 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 3,269 $ 4,850 Commissions payable 6,692 6,837 Income tax payable 407 215 Other accrued expenses 10,360 9,453 Current portion of long-term debt 2,000 2,000 Total current liabilities 22,728 23,355 Long-term debt Principal amount 4,500 5,500 Less: unamortized discount and deferred offering costs (43 ) (60 ) Long-term debt, net of unamortized discount and deferred offering costs 4,457 5,440 Other long-term liabilities 1,966 1,927 Total liabilities 29,151 30,722 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity Preferred stock — par value $0.001 per share, 50,000 shares authorized, no shares issued or outstanding — — Common stock — par value $0.001 per share, 250,000 shares authorized and 14,211 and 14,232 issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively 14 14 Additional paid-in capital 122,627 121,599 Accumulated deficit (106,108 ) (106,992 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (28 ) (94 ) Total stockholders’ equity 16,505 14,527 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY $ 45,656 $ 45,249\nLIFEVANTAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands, except per share data) Revenue, net $ 49,482 $ 48,947 $ 98,609 $ 103,841 Cost of sales 9,117 7,500 17,856 16,332 Gross profit 40,365 41,447 80,753 87,509 Operating expenses: Commissions and incentives 23,395 23,540 46,804 49,836 Selling, general and administrative 14,643 17,207 30,224 34,987 Total operating expenses 38,038 40,747 77,028 84,823 Operating income 2,327 700 3,725 2,686 Other expense: Interest expense (103 ) (138 ) (265 ) (275 ) Other expense, net (169 ) (150 ) (147 ) (321 ) Total other expense (272 ) (288 ) (412 ) (596 ) Income before income taxes 2,055 412 3,313 2,090 Income tax expense (1,738 ) (129 ) (2,179 ) (627 ) Net income $ 317 $ 283 $ 1,134 $ 1,463 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.02 $ 0.02 $ 0.08 $ 0.11 Diluted $ 0.02 $ 0.02 $ 0.08 $ 0.10 Weighted-average shares outstanding: Basic 13,956 13,840 13,959 13,830 Diluted 14,153 14,132 14,117 14,176\nLIFEVANTAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Revenue by Region (unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Americas $ 36,903 75 % $ 37,613 77 % $ 73,066 74 % $ 77,748 75 % Asia/Pacific & Europe 12,579 25 % 11,334 23 % 25,543 26 % 26,093 25 % Total $ 49,482 100 % $ 48,947 100 % $ 98,609 100 % $ 103,841 100 % Active Independent Distributors (1) (unaudited) As of December 31, 2017 2016 Americas 44,000 71 % 46,000 73 % Asia/Pacific & Europe 18,000 29 % 17,000 27 % Total 62,000 100 % 63,000 100 % Active Preferred Customers (2) (unaudited) As of December 31, 2017 2016 Americas 86,000 80 % 89,000 80 % Asia/Pacific & Europe 22,000 20 % 22,000 20 % Total 108,000 100 % 111,000 100 % (1) Active Independent Distributors have purchased product in the prior three months for retail or personal consumption.
