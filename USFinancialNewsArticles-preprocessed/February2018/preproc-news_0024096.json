    "text": "(Corrects 3rd paragraph to remove extraneous word)\nBEIJING, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Securities regulators in several provinces of China are investigating the use of shares as collateral for financing activities to curb potential risks, the state-owned Securities Times newspaper reported on Saturday.\nThe provincial regulators have launched an “intensive investigation” into stock-backed borrowing by major shareholders of listed firms, the paper said.\nThe investigations focus on listed firms with greater exposure to such financing, including details on their shareholders and financial transactions, the paper said.\nIn September, China’s securities regulator published draft rules to restrict borrowing using stocks as collateral, as part of efforts to reduce leverage in the financial system and ward off systemic risks.\nThe rules, which have been finalised and are due to be implemented from March 12, are aimed at curbing leverage and reducing risk in the event of a sharp decline in stock prices.\nOn Friday, Chinese stocks suffered their worst day in almost two years, with a plunge by blue-chips dragging the main indexes into correction territory after steep falls overnight for U.S. stocks.
