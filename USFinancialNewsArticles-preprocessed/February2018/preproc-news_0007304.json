I look forward to the work of helping build innovative companies that address those challenges and opportunities.\"\nRob's and Jason's appointments follow a year of unprecedented growth for Flagship Pioneering. In 2017, the firm hired executive partners David Epstein (former CEO of Novartis Pharmaceuticals) and Stephen Berenson (a former vice chair of JP Morgan); raised $618 million in new capital ; completed initial public offerings for two of its pioneering ventures; and spun out six new companies from Flagship VentureLabs®, among other milestones.\nAbout Rob Rosiello\nRob Rosiello joins Flagship as an executive partner and chief operating officer.

In addition, he will provide operating and strategic support to key Flagship companies.\nRob joins the firm after a long tenure at McKinsey & Company, where he was a senior partner emeritus. For more than 30 years he advised the CEOs and boards of leading health care, technology, and consumer companies on corporate strategy, M&A, and improved business unit performance. Rob has worked in McKinsey's Cleveland, London, New York, and Stamford offices and was also a member of McKinsey's Partner and Senior Partner Review Committees, as well as the Partner Compensation and Client Risk Committees.
