    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As part of the company’s continued focus on growth, GoodData ® has brought on Carol Lee as its new Chief Financial Officer. Prior to joining GoodData, Lee was Vice President of Finance for Konica Minolta Business Solutions, where she led the valuation and financial due diligence of acquiring 22 recurring revenue technology companies between 2011 and 2017.\n“I’m delighted to be joining the talented team at GoodData during such an exciting time for the company,” said Lee. “We’re now at a point where we can focus on expanding to new markets. I’m looking forward to leading us to the fast growth phase.”\nIn addition to guiding the acquisition of new companies, Lee also helped expand the Managed IT Services division of Konica Minolta from 200 people to more than 1,000 people during a 7 year period. She aims to draw on these experiences at GoodData to drive better results and to ensure continued financial discipline.\n“I am particularly excited to welcome Carol to GoodData because of her admirable track record when it comes to acquisitions and company expansion,” said Roman Stanek, founder and CEO of GoodData. “Last year we focused our efforts on enhancing our platform to incorporate the latest in governance, security and machine learning. This year, we’re striving for substantial growth, and we are well-poised to meet our financial and operational targets with Carol’s help.”\nLee will join two other recently hired executives , all of whom were selected for their ability to drive and execute the leading embedded analytics company’s growth and go-to-market strategies.\nAbout GoodData\nGoodData provides an integrated set of data management, analytics, and insight application development and management tools as the leading platform in the Systems of Insight category.
