    "text": "(Reuters) - Toronto, one of the world’s hottest property markets, is struggling with supply bottlenecks and developers and some experts say that, ironically, a growth plan drawn up for the city may have contributed to the crunch.\nHere are the main facts about the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe adopted by the Ontario provincial government to manage the expansion of Toronto and its surrounding areas through 2031.\nIt was created in 2006 and updated in 2017 following a review in 2016, with the aim of managing population growth largely through more construction in existing developed areas, locating the highest densities where infrastructure and municipal servicing already are in place and ensuring the protection of agricultural land and the environment.\nFor details on Ontario growth plan, click bit.ly/2t1ZbP4\nKey points:\nConfine at least 50 percent of growth to already built-up areas with existing or planned water and wastewater systems until 2031, and 60 percent from 2031 onwards.\nAll municipalities must develop strategies to achieve minimum targets, including identifying strategic growth areas, updating zoning and prioritising infrastructure investment.\nIdentified 25 urban growth centres, central areas of already built-up towns and suburbs, as the focal points for growth with a range of mandated densities per hectare (2.47 acres): 400 people and jobs combined within the City of Toronto, 200 in Toronto suburbs and 150 in centres of outer ring towns.\nGreenfield areas should have a minimum of 80 residents and jobs combined per hectare.\nMunicipalities must develop housing strategies that promote a mix of housing options and densities and establish targets for affordable housing; accommodate the plan’s forecasted growth and density targets; and maintain land with servicing capacity for a three-year supply of housing.\nMinimum density targets along transit corridors range from 200 residents and jobs per hectare near subways to 160 around light rail and buses to 150 around the regional public transit system.\nPublic transit is the first priority for transportation infrastructure planning and investment.\nNew developments should demonstrate no negative impacts on, or disruption to, key natural heritage or natural water resources.\nPrime agricultural areas identified in official plans should be protected.\nPlanning for infrastructure corridors should undergo environmental assessments that include impacts on agricultural land, natural heritage features and natural water systems.\nWater and wastewater systems should support achievement of the plan’s minimum intensification and density targets.\nReporting By Nichola Saminather and Matt Scuffham\n ",
