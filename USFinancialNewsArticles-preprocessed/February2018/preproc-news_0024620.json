    "text": "PYEONGCHANG (Reuters) - Strong cross-winds at Pyeongchang’s Phoenix Snow Park have played havoc during the first run of the women’s snowboard slopestyle final on Monday.\nOnly five of the 25 riders who attempted a run made it down the slope without a fall. Finland’s Sochi Olympic silver medalist Enni Rukajarvi and Austrian favorite Anna Gasser were among those to struggle.\nThe start of the final was delayed by over an hour because of the wind but, after qualification was canceled entirely on Sunday due to the weather, organizers decided it could continue.\nSochi gold medalist Jamie Anderson of the United States leads after the first round with a score of 83.00 points, almost 10 more than Norway’s Silje Norendal.\nThe conditions had already been blamed for injuries suffered on the mountain.\nSnowboarding - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Slopestyle Finals - Phoenix Snow Park - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 12, 2018 - Yuka Fujimori of Japan crashes. REUTERS/Mike Blake Australian snowboarder Tess Coady took to Instagram to blame the wind for the injury she suffered in practice for qualifying on Sunday.\n“(I) got picked up in the wind on the bottom jump in practice and my ACL was not a big fan!” Coady said in her Instagram post.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Earlier in the day, POCOG spokesman Sung Baik-you told reporters that the windy weather would continue into Wednesday.\n“The temperature in the mountains is minus 15 to minus 25 Celsius,” he said. “The wind speed is five-10 metres per second and it is making competitions very difficult.”\nAll the athletes have a second run, with the best score from the two counting towards their final position.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ",
