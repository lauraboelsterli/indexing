    "text": "Updated 8 Mins Ago CNBC.com \nThe White House budget calls for $3 trillion in deficit reduction, including $1.7 trillion in mandatory spending cuts. \nThe plan also proposes reducing discretionary spending by 2 percent a year after 2019. \nThe budget, however, doesn't balance , marking a reversal from Republican priorities in recent years. \nIn a summary outline circulated Monday, the White House said the budget accounts the massive $320 billion spending deal hashed out between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, which includes spending cap increases. \nThe budget also calls for $18 billion to construct a southern border wall, a key part of President Donald Trump 's campaign pitch to voters in 2016. The proposal also allocates more than $2.5 billion for additional border-security initiatives, including additional Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement staff, and expanded capacity for detention. \nOn Monday, the administration also released its long-awaited plan to stimulate more than $1.5 trillion in infrastructure projects . The White House budget proposes $200 billion in federal investment that focuses mainly on grants, \"transformative projects\" and rural infrastructure. \nCNBC's Mike Calia contributed to this report.",
