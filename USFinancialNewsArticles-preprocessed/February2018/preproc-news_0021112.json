    "text": "U.S. wholesale inventories grew at a faster rate than expected in December, though still slower than the month before.\nThe Commerce Department's survey of wholesalers' inventories increased 0.4 percent in December to a value of $612.1 billion, beating estimates of 0.2 percent from a survey of Reuters economists. \nIn November, the amount of unsold inventories on wholesalers' shelves jumped 0.6 percent, rebounding from an October decline that snapped a six-month streak of gains. The November figure was revised down from 0.8 percent in an advance report released Friday. \nAt current levels, it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear their shelves, a faster pace than the year-ago ratio of 1.29.\nThe monthly metric is built from a survey of about 4,200 U.S. wholesale firms.",
