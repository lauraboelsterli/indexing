At private colleges, the average is a whopping $34,740. Room and board can add another $10,000 or more to that annual cost.\nEligibility for the University of Wisconsin-Madison free-tuition program begins with incoming freshman this fall, the school's announcement said. Beyond the income requirement, there will be no requirements or other qualifying factors.\nshow chapters Here's what you can do to save money in college      11:23 AM ET Mon, 22 Jan 2018 | 00:57 The award will be automatic to eligible students based on the information provided on their Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.

The cost is pegged at about $825,000 per year for each class.\nMore from Personal Finance: \nStrategies for surviving the volatile stock market \nWatch out for these Valentine's Day scams \nThese new rules will help protect older Americans from financial fraud",
