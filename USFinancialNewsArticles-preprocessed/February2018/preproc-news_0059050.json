Discovery said on Tuesday advertising revenue from its U.S. networks rose 8 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, while ad revenue from international networks climbed 11 percent. The company also said it expects to close its $14.6 billion acquisition of U.S. peer Scripps Network Interactive ( SNI.O ) by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Discovery is awaiting the completion of a review by regulators in Ireland. Discovery said its net loss was $1.14 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to a profit of $304 million, a year earlier. Results included a $1.3 billion one-time goodwill impairment charge. Excluding one-time items, Discovery earned 47 cents per share. Revenue rose 11.5 percent to $1.86 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Silver Spring, Maryland-based Discovery rose 1.3 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday. Reporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar",
