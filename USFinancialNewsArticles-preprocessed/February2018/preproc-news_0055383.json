Expansion of operations to enable accelerated growth in target markets in Europe, the Middle East and India are already progressing, along with further enhancements to Servcorp's unified global IT platform.\nTaine Moufarrige, Executive Director at Servcorp , commented:\n\"Our objective is to cater to businesses that want to be successful at all stages of growth, providing both an office infrastructure and business community in which they can flourish. Our business model is purpose-built to deliver on this objective, and we are confident that it will continue to perform. With stronger sales in the Middle East and Europe to date in the current quarter, we expect this geography to deliver a strong second half.\"\nThe recent rapid growth in the global market for shared office space has seen the Company commit to invest AUD 20 million (USD 15.6 million) in its co-working offering, successfully pivoting both office design and customer experience towards this high-growth segment. This investment has already seen Servcorp open new co-working spaces globally, including in London and in Middle Eastern markets including Abu Dhabi, Beirut and Jeddah, and is expected to be fully deployed with the launch of new workspaces by the end of calendar year 2018.\nServcorp's programme for enhancing floor design and customer experience across its existing office footprint has shown encouraging early results and will continue during the remainder of the 2018 calendar year. In parallel, the company has invested in unlocking more of the value inherent in its technology platform. Servcorp, which is headquartered in Sydney and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:SRV), is a global company employing 850 staff and servicing 35,000 members in 53 cities across 23 countries.\nThe Company reports its financial results in Australian dollars, with US dollar values for the reporting period ended 31 December 2017 converted using average rates for the same period . Rates are as issued by the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nNotes to Editors\nAbout Servcorp Group\nFounded in Australia in 1978 by Alf Moufarrige, Servcorp has grown from a quarter-floor in Sydney's MLC Centre into a global brand employing 850 staff, servicing 35,000 members in 53 cities across 23 countries.
