These forward-looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. Forward-looking statements are those that incorporate management’s current expectations and plans based on information currently known to them. These statements can sometimes be identified by words such as “believe,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” “may,” “should,” or other similar phrases or words. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. In particular, they should not be construed as assurances of a given level of performance or as promises of a given set of management’s actions. Some of the factors that could cause management to deviate from its current plans, or could cause the Company’s results to differ from current expectations, include the effect of localized or regional economic shifts that may affect the collectability of loans or the value of the collateral underlying those loans; the effects of laws, regulations, policies and government actions upon the Company’s assets and operations; sensitivity to the Northwestern Oregon geographic markets and events affecting those markets; and the impacts of new government initiatives upon us and our borrowers. The Company does not intend to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180223005646/en/\nOregon Bancorp, Inc.\nNeil Grossnicklaus, 503-485-2222\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nneil@wvbk.com\nSource: Oregon Bancorp, Inc.",
