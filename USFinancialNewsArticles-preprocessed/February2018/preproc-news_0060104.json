    "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Zynex, Inc. (OTCQB: ZYXI), an innovative medical technology company specializing in the manufacture and sale of non-invasive medical devices for pain management, stroke rehabilitation, cardiac monitoring and neurological diagnostics, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nPresident and CEO Commentary:\nThomas Sandgaard, CEO commented: \"I am pleased to report net income of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter which continues our trend of bottom line improvement. Our revenue grew to $8.1 million, an increase of 19% compared to the third quarter and 178% above the fourth quarter of last year. Our gross profit margin increased to 81% versus 76% in Q4-2016. I am particularly satisfied with our Adjusted EBITDA for the full year of $9.5 million.\"\n\"We currently estimate our first quarter revenue to range between $6.5 and $7.0 million with Adjusted EBITDA between $2.0 and $2.5 million. First quarter revenue is historically affected by health insurance deductibles not being met in the beginning of the year. The revenue estimate is approximately 89% to 104% above last year's first quarter revenue of $3.4 million.\"\n\"Our flagship product, the NexWave, is an important technology for physicians to prescribe in today's opioid crisis, allowing patients with debilitating pain access to prescription strength pain relief without side effects. In many cases, our NexWave device should be prescribed as a first-line-of-defense before prescribing medications such as opioids. I am dedicated to promoting our technology in order to minimize addiction and other side effects from prescription opioids.\"\nFourth Quarter Financial Results Summary:\nThe Company reported net revenue of $8.1 million, a 178% increase over Q4-2016 and a 19% increase compared to Q3-2017.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income grew 10,521% to $7.4 million from $69,000 in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 481% to $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.7 million last year.

In addition, the Company is providing in this news release financial information in the form of adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock compensation). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and lenders in evaluating the overall financial health of the Company in that they allow for greater transparency of additional financial data routinely used by management to evaluate performance. Adjusted EBITDA can be useful for investors or lenders as an indicator of earnings available to service debt. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Zynex\nZynex, founded in 1996, markets and sells its own design of electrotherapy medical devices used for pain management and rehabilitation; and the company's proprietary NeuroMove device designed to help recovery of stroke and spinal cord injury patients.
