Non-GAAP net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $501.1 million, an increase of 61% compared to $310.8 million for the same period last year.\nAdvertising revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $424.8 million, an increase of 58% compared to $269.6 million for the same period last year. The year-over-year growth in advertising revenues was mainly resulted from an increase of $144.4 million, or 77% growth in Weibo advertising and marketing revenues and a 16% growth in portal advertising revenues in the fourth quarter.\nNon-advertising revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $79.0 million, an increase of 80% compared to $43.9 million for the same period last year. Non-GAAP non-advertising revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $76.4 million, an increase of 85% compared to $41.3 million for the same period last year. The year-over-year growth in non-advertising revenues was driven by revenues derived from SINA fintech business, increased Weibo membership fees and revenue share from live broadcasting business.\nGross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 75%, compared to 70% for the same period last year. Advertising gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 76%, compared to 72% for the same period last year. The increase in advertising gross margin was primarily due to stronger advertising demand from Weibo advertisers and the further operating leverage of Weibo business. Non-advertising gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 66%, compared to 57% for the same period last year. The increase in non-advertising gross margin was the result of higher revenue contribution from businesses with better margin profile compared with the same period last year, such as Weibo's membership services.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $248.4 million, compared to $194.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily for user acquisition of Weibo and SINA News Application and the increase of product development expenses in relation to personnel-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $226.8 million, compared to $136.2 million for the same period last year.\nIncome from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $128.7 million, an increase of 421% compared to $24.7 million for the same period last year. Operating margin was 26%, up from 8% for the same period last year. Excluding the one-off recognition of goodwill and acquired intangibles impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2016, the increase in operating margin was a result of further operating leverage of Weibo business. Non-GAAP income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $149.8 million, an increase of 82% compared to $82.1 million for the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30%, up from 26% for the same period last year.\nNon-operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.7 million, compared to a non-operating income of $28.8 million for the same period last year. Non-operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 composed of an $11.2 million net interest and other income and a $2.8 million loss pick-up from equity-method investments, which is reported one quarter in arrears and is mainly resulted from the loss pick-up related to the Company's investment in Leju Holding Limited (\"Leju\"). Non-operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 included a $48.6 million net gain on sale of and impairment on investments and a $25.8 million loss in the fair value change of the Company's option liability related to E-House, which are excluded under non-GAAP measures.\nIncome tax expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $17.2 million, compared to $5.4 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher profitability and the change in tax status of the Weibo's PRC subsidiary in 2017 from being fully tax exempted to being subject to a reduced enterprise income tax rate of 12.5%.\nNet income attributable to SINA's ordinary shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $45.4 million, compared to $19.9 million for the same period last year. Diluted net income per share attributable to SINA's ordinary shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.60, compared to $0.27 for the same period last year.

Aside from earnings, the increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was also attributed to the cash received from the issuance of a $900 million convertible senior notes by Weibo, which was partially offset by a share repurchase of $47.6 million from the Company, in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $76.3 million, capital expenditures totaled $29.3 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses amounted to $9.3 million.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nFor fiscal year 2017, SINA reported net revenues of $1.58 billion, compared to $1.03 billion in 2016.

Non-operating income in 2017 mainly included (i) a $132.0 million gains from disposing of certain marketable securities and other gains, which are excluded under non-GAAP measure; (ii) a $113.1 million of investment impairment write down of the Company's investment in Leju, which is excluded under non-GAAP measure; and (iii) a $16.1 million loss pick-up from equity-method investments, which is accounted for under the equity-method and reported one quarter in arrears, mainly resulting from the loss pick-up from the Company's investment in Leju.

Such revenue forecast includes the recognition of $10.4 million in deferred license revenues related to the license granted to Leju. This forecast reflects SINA's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP net revenues, non-GAAP non-advertising revenues, non-GAAP advertising and non-advertising gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to SINA's ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to SINA's ordinary shareholders. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of the Company's financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies. Accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how the Company defines its non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company's non-GAAP financial measures exclude recognition of deferred revenues related to the license granted to Leju, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, adjustment for non-GAAP to GAAP reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, gain(loss) on sale of investment/business, deemed disposal and impairment on investment, impairment on goodwill and acquired intangibles, change in fair value in option liability, income tax effects of above non-GAAP to GAAP reconciling items and adjustment for non-GAAP to GAAP reconciling items for the income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests and amortization of convertible debt issuance cost. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their financial and operating decision-making, because management believes these measures reflect the Company's ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in the following ways: (i) in comparing the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results in a consistent manner, and (ii) in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items (i) that are not expected to result in future cash payments or (ii) that are non-recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results and business outlook.\nUse of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures do not include all income and expense items that affect the Company's operations. They may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures are set forth in the section below titled \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Results.\"\nConference Call\nSINA will host a conference call from 7:10 a.m. – 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on February 13 , 2018 (or 8:10 p.m. – 9:00 p.m. Beijing Time on February 13 , 2018) to present an overview of the Company's financial performance and business operations.
