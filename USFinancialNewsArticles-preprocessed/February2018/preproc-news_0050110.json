Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fourth quarter 2017 net revenues increased 12.6% over the year ago period.\nFourth quarter 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 171.3% to ($0.92), as compared to $1.29 in the prior year period. The decrease in GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is due to $107.9 million of tax expense reflecting the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), which was enacted on December 22, 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 14.6% to $2.44, compared to $2.13 in the prior year period.\nFull year 2017 net revenues were $2,146.3 million, an increase of 14.9% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, full year 2017 net revenues increased 14.1% over the year ago period.\nFull year 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 33.1% to $3.33, as compared to $4.98 in the prior year period. The decrease in GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is due to $107.9 million of tax expense reflecting the impact of the TCJA, which was enacted on December 22, 2017. Full year 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 14.4% to $8.40, compared to $7.34 in the prior year period.\nLiam Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Despite modestly softer than expected sales in the fourth quarter, due in part to Vascular Solutions distributor go-directs within EMEA, we reported solid gross and operating margin performance in the period and delivered full year adjusted earnings per share results at the high-end of our guidance range. Following our acquisition of NeoTract, the business continues to perform at a high level, with UroLift experiencing deeper penetration of the BPH market. UroLift delivered $39 million in revenues for the fourth quarter, which represented growth of 121% year-over-year, and we remain excited about the long-term contributions the business will make to our revenue growth and margin profile.”\nAdded Mr. Kelly, “As we look into 2018, our new product launches, our acquisitions of Vascular Solutions and NeoTract, and gross and operating margin expansion programs give us confidence we can deliver double digit constant currency revenue growth and significant adjusted earnings per share expansion.”\nFOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR NET REVENUE BY SEGMENT\nFollowing the Company's acquisition of Vascular Solutions, the Company commenced an integration program under which it is combining the Vascular Solutions business with some of its legacy businesses. Specifically, the Company is combining the Vascular Solutions North American business with the Company's interventional access business, which formerly was part of the Vascular North America operating segment, and the Company's cardiac business, which formerly was a separate operating segment included in the \"all other\" category for purposes of segment reporting. These businesses are now in the Company's Interventional North America operating segment. Additionally, the Company is combining the Vascular Solutions businesses in Europe, Asia and Latin America with the Company's legacy businesses in the respective locations, and these Vascular Solutions businesses are now part of the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), Asia and Latin America operating segments, respectively. The changes in the Company’s operating segments, which became effective in the fourth quarter 2017, also reflect the manner in which the Company’s new chief operating decision maker assesses business performance and allocation of resources.\nAs a result of the operating segment changes described above, the Company has the following seven reportable segments: Vascular North America, Interventional North America, Anesthesia North America, Surgical North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\"), Asia and Original Equipment and Development Services (\"OEM\"). In connection with the presentation of segment information, we will continue to present certain operating segments, which now include Interventional Urology North America and Respiratory North America as well as Latin America, in the “all other” category because they are not material. All prior comparative periods presented in this release have been restated to reflect these changes.\nThe following tables provide information regarding net revenues in each of the Company's reportable operating segments and all of its other operating segments for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 on both a GAAP and constant currency basis. The discussion below the table of the principal factors behind changes in net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period applies to both GAAP revenue and constant currency revenue, although GAAP revenue also was affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as indicated in the \"Foreign Currency\" column of the table.\nThree Months Ended % Increase/ (Decrease) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Constant\nCurrency\nForeign\nCurrency\nTotal\nChange\n(Dollars in millions) Vascular North America $ 80.7 $ 80.3 0.3 % 0.2 % 0.5 % Interventional North America 61.7 22.2 177.2 % 0.4 % 177.6 % Anesthesia North America 49.9 54.9 (9.4 ) % 0.2 % (9.2 ) % Surgical North America 43.7 48.3 (9.8 ) % 0.4 % (9.4 ) % EMEA 143.6 135.7 (2.0 ) % 7.8 % 5.8 % Asia 78.8 73.0 4.5 % 3.5 % 8.0 % OEM 46.0 45.3 (0.1 ) % 1.4 % 1.3 % All Other 90.7 54.2 67.0 % 0.6 % 67.6 % Total $ 595.1 $ 513.9 12.6 % 3.2 % 15.8 % Twelve Months Ended % Increase/ (Decrease) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Constant\nCurrency\nForeign\nCurrency\nTotal\nChange\n(Dollars in millions) Vascular North America $ 313.6 $ 295.2 6.1 % 0.1 % 6.2 % Interventional North America 220.6 82.4 167.5 % 0.1 % 167.6 % Anesthesia North America 198.0 198.8 (0.5 ) % 0.1 % (0.4 ) % Surgical North America 175.2 172.2 1.6 % 0.1 % 1.7 % EMEA 552.7 510.9 6.3 % 1.9 % 8.2 % Asia 269.2 249.4 7.0 % 0.9 % 7.9 % OEM 183.0 161.0 13.2 % 0.5 % 13.7 % All Other 234.0 198.1 18.0 % 0.1 % 18.1 % Total $ 2,146.3 $ 1,868.0 14.1 % 0.8 % 14.9 % Vascular North America fourth quarter 2017 net revenues were $80.7 million, an increase of 0.5% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fourth quarter 2017 net revenues increased 0.3% compared to the prior year period. The increase in constant currency revenue is primarily attributable to higher sales volumes of existing products, despite the unfavorable impact of five fewer shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase in new product sales and price increases.\nInterventional North America fourth quarter 2017 net revenues were $61.7 million, an increase of 177.6% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fourth quarter 2017 net revenues increased 177.2% compared to the prior year period. The increase in constant currency revenue is primarily attributable to net revenues generated by sales of Vascular Solutions' products. We acquired Vascular Solutions in February 2017.\nAnesthesia North America fourth quarter 2017 net revenues were $49.9 million, a decrease of 9.2% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fourth quarter 2017 net revenues decreased 9.4% compared to the prior year period. The decrease in constant currency revenue is primarily attributable to a decline in sales volumes of existing products, due in part to five fewer shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by an increase in net revenues generated by an acquired business and an increase in new product sales.\nSurgical North America fourth quarter 2017 net revenues were $43.7 million, a decrease of 9.4% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fourth quarter 2017 net revenues decreased 9.8% compared to the prior year period. The decrease in constant currency revenue is primarily attributable to a decline in sales volumes of existing products, due in part to five fewer shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by an increase in new product sales and price increases.\nEMEA fourth quarter 2017 net revenues were $143.6 million, an increase of 5.8% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fourth quarter 2017 net revenues decreased 2.0% compared to the prior year period. The decrease in constant currency revenue is primarily attributable to a decline in sales volumes of existing products, due in part to five fewer shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by net revenues generated by acquired businesses and an increase in new product sales.\nAsia fourth quarter 2017 net revenues were $78.8 million, an increase of 8.0% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fourth quarter 2017 net revenues increased 4.5%. The increase in constant currency revenue is primarily attributable to net revenues generated by acquired businesses and price increases.\nOEM fourth quarter 2017 net revenues were $46.0 million, an increase of 1.3% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fourth quarter 2017 net revenues decreased 0.1% compared to the prior year period. The decrease in constant currency revenue is primarily attributable to a decline in sales volumes of existing products, due in part to five fewer shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by an increase in new product sales.\nAll Other fourth quarter 2017 net revenues were $90.7 million, an increase of 67.6% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fourth quarter 2017 net revenues increased 67.0% compared to the prior year period. The increase in constant currency revenue is primarily attributable to net revenues generated by NeoTract.\nOTHER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS AND KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS\nDepreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets and deferred financing charges for 2017 totaled $160.3 million compared to $128.3 million for the prior year period.\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 were $333.6 million compared to $543.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nNet accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 were $345.9 million compared to $272.0 million at December 31, 2016.\nNet inventories at December 31, 2017 were $395.7 million compared to $316.2 million at December 31, 2016.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nOn a GAAP basis, revenues in 2018 are expected to increase 14% to 15% over the prior year, reflecting the anticipated 2.0% favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, the Company estimates that revenues for full year 2018 will increase 12% to 13%.\nThe Company expects full year 2018 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $7.10 and $7.20. The Company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $9.55 and $9.75 for full year 2018, representing an increase of 13.7% to 16.1% over 2017, reflecting our expectation of an approximately 3% positive impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nForecasted 2018 Constant Currency Revenue Growth Reconciliation\nLow High 2018 GAAP revenue growth 14 % 15 % Estimated impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (2 ) % (2 ) % 2018 constant currency revenue growth 12 % 13 % Forecasted 2018 Adjusted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation\nLow High Diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders $7.10 $7.20 Restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items, net of tax $0.17 $0.20 Acquisition, integration and divestiture related items, net of tax $0.27 $0.30 Other items, net of tax $0.01 $0.02 Intangible amortization expense, net of tax $2.00 $2.03 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $9.55 $9.75 CONFERENCE CALL WEBCAST AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nAs previously announced, Teleflex will comment on its financial results on a conference call to be held today at 8:00 a.m. (ET). The call will be available live and archived on the company’s website at www.teleflex.com and the accompanying presentation will be posted prior to the call. An audio replay will be available until February 27, 2018 at 11:59pm (ET), by calling 855-859-2056 (U.S./Canada) or 404-537-3406 (International), Passcode: 6373419.\nADDITIONAL NOTES\nReferences in this release to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on adjusted diluted earnings per share include both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on foreign currency denominated transactions.\nIn the discussion of segment results, \"new products\" refers to products we have sold commercially within the past 36 months and \"existing products\" refers to products we have sold commercially for more than 36 months.\nCertain financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.\nSegment results and commentary exclude the impact of discontinued operations.\nNOTES ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, commonly referred to as “GAAP.” In this press release, we provide supplemental information, consisting of the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted diluted earnings per share and constant currency revenue growth. These non-GAAP measures are described in more detail below. Management uses these financial measures to assess Teleflex’s financial performance, make operating decisions, allocate financial resources, provide guidance on possible future results, and assist in its evaluation of period-to-period and peer comparisons. The non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors because they provide insight into management’s assessment of our business, and provide supplemental information pertinent to a comparison of period-to-period results of our ongoing operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Moreover, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nTables reconciling historical adjusted diluted earnings per share to historical GAAP diluted earnings per share are set forth below. Tables reconciling changes in historical constant currency net revenues to historical GAAP net revenues are set forth above under “Fourth Quarter and Full Year Net Revenue by Segment”. Tables reconciling forecasted 2018 constant currency revenue growth and forecasted 2018 adjusted earnings per share to their respective most directly comparable forecasted GAAP measures, forecasted 2018 revenue growth and forecasted 2018 diluted earnings per share available to common stockholders, are set forth above under “2018 Outlook.”\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share : This non-GAAP measure is based upon diluted earnings per share available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, adjusted to exclude, depending on the period presented, the impact (net of tax) of (i) restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items; (ii) acquisition, integration and divestiture related items; (iii) other items identified in note (C) to the reconciliation tables set forth below; (iv) amortization of debt discount on convertible notes; (v) intangible amortization expense; (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt and (vii) tax adjustments. Management does not believe that any of the excluded items are indicative of our underlying core performance or business trends.\nIn addition, the calculation of the weighted average number of diluted shares within adjusted earnings per share gives effect to the anti-dilutive impact of shares due to the Company under its previously outstanding convertible note hedge agreements. The convertible note hedge agreements reduced the potential economic dilution that otherwise would have occurred upon conversion of the Company’s senior subordinated convertible notes (under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedge agreements was not reflected in the weighted average number of diluted shares). We believe that an adjustment to show the anti-dilutive effect of the convertible note hedge agreements provides supplemental information that can be useful to investors in assessing the computation of diluted earnings per share.\nConstant currency revenue growth : This non-GAAP measure is based upon net revenues, adjusted to eliminate the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from period to period. The impact of changes in foreign currency may vary significantly from period to period, and generally are outside of the control of our management. We believe that this measure facilitates a comparison of our operating performance exclusive of fluctuations that do not reflect our underlying performance or business trends.\nRECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ITEMS\nDollars in millions, except per share amounts\nQuarter Ended - December 31, 2017 Cost of\ngoods sold\nSelling, general\nand\nadministrative\nexpenses\nResearch and\ndevelopment\nexpenses\nRestructuring\nand\nimpairment\ncharges\n(Gain) loss on\nsale of\nbusiness and\nassets\nInterest\nexpense, net\nIncome taxes Net income (loss)\nattributable to\ncommon\nshareholders from\ncontinuing\noperations\nDiluted earnings\nper share available\nto common\nshareholders\nShares used\nin calculation\nof GAAP and\nadjusted\nearnings per\nshare\nGAAP Basis $264.4 $213.3 $25.5 $1.1 — $23.5 $110.2 ($42.8 ) ($0.92 ) 46,636 Adjustments Restructuring,\nrestructuring\nrelated and\nimpairment\nitems (A)\n3.9 0.3 0.3 1.1 — — 1.8 3.7 $0.08 — Acquisition,\nintegration and\ndivestiture\nrelated items\n(B)\n0.4 16.2 0.2 — — — (2.8 ) 19.5 $0.42 — Other items (C) 1.3 1.9 — — — — 0.6 2.7 $0.06 — Amortization of\ndebt discount\non convertible\nnotes (D)\n— — — — — — — — — — Intangible\namortization\nexpense (E)\n— 34.7 0.1 — — — 10.0 24.8 $0.53 — Loss on\nextinguishment\nof debt (F)\n— — — — — — — — — — Tax\nadjustments (G)\n— — — — — — (106.0 ) 106.0 $2.27 — Shares due to\nTeleflex under\nnote hedge (H)\n— — — — — — — — — — Adjusted basis $258.8 $160.2 $24.9 — — $23.5 $13.9 $113.7 $2.44 46,636 Quarter Ended - December 31, 2016 Cost of\ngoods sold\nSelling, general\nand\nadministrative\nexpenses\nResearch and\ndevelopment\nexpenses\nRestructuring\nand\nimpairment\ncharges\n(Gain) loss on\nsale of\nbusiness and\nassets\nInterest\nexpense, net\nIncome taxes\nNet income (loss)\nattributable to\ncommon\nshareholders\nfrom continuing\noperations\nDiluted earnings\nper share\navailable to\ncommon\nshareholders\nShares used in\ncalculation of\nGAAP and\nadjusted\nearnings per\nshare\nGAAP Basis $240.9 $144.2 $15.7 $46.4 ($0.2 ) $16.2 ($10.1 ) $60.9 $1.29 47,112 Adjustments Restructuring,\nrestructuring\nrelated and\nimpairment\nitems (A)\n3.7 0.5 0.0 46.4 — — 18.0 32.5 $0.69 — Acquisition,\nintegration and\ndivestiture\nrelated items\n(B)\n— (5.1 ) — — (0.2 ) 3.4 1.9 (3.7 ) ($0.08 ) — Other items (C) — 0.2 — — — — 0.1 0.1 $0.00 — Amortization of\ndebt discount on\nconvertible\nnotes (D)\n— — — — — 1.1 0.4 0.7 $0.02 — Intangible\namortization\nexpense (E)\n— 15.9 0.1 — — — 4.0 12.0 $0.26 — Loss on\nextinguishment\nof debt (F)\n— — — — — — 0.0 0.0 $0.00 — Tax adjustments\n(G)\n— — — — — — 4.9 (4.9 ) ($0.10 ) — Shares due to\nTeleflex under\nnote hedge (H)\n— — — — — — — — $0.06 (1,343 ) Adjusted basis $237.2 $132.7 $15.6 — — $11.7 $19.3 $97.5 $2.13 45,769 (A) Restructuring, restructuring related and impairment items - Restructuring programs involve discrete initiatives designed to, among other things, consolidate or relocate manufacturing, administrative and other facilities, improve operating efficiencies and integrate acquired businesses. Our restructuring charges consist of termination benefits, contract termination costs, facility closure costs and other exit costs associated with a specific restructuring program. Restructuring related charges are directly related to our restructuring programs and consist of facility consolidation costs, including accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures, costs to transfer manufacturing operations between locations, and retention bonuses offered to certain employees as an incentive for them to remain with our company after completion of the restructuring program. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, pre-tax restructuring related charges were $4.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively. There were no impairment items during the three months ended December 31, 2017. In the three months ended December 31, 2016, impairment items included (i) a pre-tax, non-cash $41.0 million impairment charge and a $14.9 million reduction in related deferred tax liabilities in connection with discontinuation of an in-process research and development project; (ii) $2.4 million in pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges related to two properties, one of which was classified as an asset held for sale; and (iii) a $0.7 million reduction in related deferred tax liabilities.\n(B) Acquisition, integration and divestiture related items - Acquisition and integration expenses are incremental charges, other than restructuring or restructuring related expenses, that are directly related to specific business or asset acquisition transactions. These charges may include, among other things, professional, consulting and other fees; systems integration costs; legal entity restructuring expense; inventory step-up amortization (amortization, through cost of goods sold, of the increase in fair value of inventory resulting from a fair value calculation as of the acquisition date); fair value adjustments to contingent consideration; and bridge loan facility and backstop financing fees in connection with facilities that ultimately were not utilized. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the majority of these charges were related to our acquisitions of Vascular Solutions and NeoTract. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, amounts attributable to these activities reflect reversals related to contingent consideration liabilities, including $8.3 million related to the discontinuation of an in-process research and development project, somewhat offset by acquisition costs. Divestiture related activities involve specific business or asset sales. Depending primarily on the terms of the divestiture transaction, the carrying value of the divested business or assets on our financial statements and other costs we incur as a direct result of the divestiture transaction, we may recognize a gain or loss in connection with the divestiture related activities.\n(C) Other items - These are discrete items that occur sporadically and can affect period-to-period comparisons. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, these items included both gains and losses associated with litigation settlements, the reversal of previously recognized income due to distributor acquisitions related to Vascular Solutions, the reversal of previously recognized income due to our distributor conversion in China, and relabeling costs. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, these items included relabeling costs.\n(D) Amortization of debt discount on convertible notes - When we sold $400 million principal amount of our 3.875% convertible notes (the “convertible notes”) in 2010, we allocated the proceeds between the liability and equity components of the debt, in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the $83.7 million difference between the proceeds of the sale of the convertible notes and the liability component of the debt constituted a debt discount that was to be amortized to interest expense over the approximately seven-year term of the convertible notes, which significantly increased the amount we recorded as interest expense attributable to the convertible notes. The amount of the amortization of the debt discount was reduced as a result of our repurchases of convertible notes in 2016 and 2017 and redemptions of the convertible notes by holders of the notes, although we continued to amortize the remaining portion of the debt discount to interest expense until August 2017, when all remaining convertible notes were either converted or matured.\n(E) Intangible amortization expense - Certain intangible assets, including customer relationships, intellectual property, distribution rights, trade names and non-competition agreements, initially are recorded at historical cost and then amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. The amount of such amortization can vary from period to period as a result of, among other things, business or asset acquisitions or dispositions.\n(F) Loss on extinguishment of debt - In connection with debt refinancings, debt repayments, repurchases of convertible notes and redemptions of convertible notes, outstanding indebtedness is extinguished. These events, which have occurred from time to time on an irregular basis, have resulted in losses reflecting, among other things, unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as debt prepayment fees and premiums (including conversion premiums resulting from conversion of convertible securities).\n(G) Tax adjustments - These adjustments represent the impact of the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations for prior year returns, the resolution of audits, the filing of amended returns with respect to prior tax years and/or tax law changes affecting our deferred tax liability. In addition, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, these items include tax expense associated with the TCJA, which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\n(H) Adjusted diluted shares are calculated by giving effect to the anti-dilutive impact of the Company’s convertible note hedge agreements, which reduced the potential economic dilution that otherwise would have occurred upon conversion of the Company's convertible notes.

Our restructuring charges consist of termination benefits, contract termination costs, facility closure costs and other exit costs associated with a specific restructuring program. Restructuring related charges are directly related to our restructuring programs and consist of facility consolidation costs, including accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures, costs to transfer manufacturing operations between locations, and retention bonuses offered to certain employees as an incentive for them to remain with our company after completion of the restructuring program. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, pre-tax restructuring related charges were $14.6 million and $15.3 million. There were no impairment items during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, impairment items included (i) a pre-tax, non-cash $41.0 million impairment charge and a $14.9 million reduction in related deferred tax liabilities in connection with discontinuation of an in-process research and development project; (ii) $2.4 million in pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges related to two properties, one of which was classified as an asset held for sale and (iii) a $0.7 million reduction in related deferred tax liabilities.\n(B) Acquisition, integration and divestiture related items - Acquisition and integration expenses are incremental charges, other than restructuring or restructuring related expenses, that are directly related to specific business or asset acquisition transactions. These charges may include, among other things, professional, consulting and other fees; systems integration costs; legal entity restructuring expense; inventory step-up amortization (amortization, through cost of goods sold, of the increase in fair value of inventory resulting from a fair value calculation as of the acquisition date); fair value adjustments to contingent consideration; and bridge loan facility and backstop financing fees in connection with facilities that ultimately were not utilized. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the majority of these charges were related to our acquisitions of Vascular Solutions and NeoTract. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, amounts attributable to these activities reflect reversals related to contingent consideration liabilities, including $8.3 million related to the discontinuation of an in-process research and development project, and the gain on a sale of assets, somewhat offset by acquisition costs. Divestiture related activities involve specific business or asset sales. Depending primarily on the terms of the divestiture transaction, the carrying value of the divested business or assets on our financial statements and other costs we incur as a direct result of the divestiture transaction, we may recognize a gain or loss in connection with the divestiture related activities.\n(C) Other items - These are discrete items that occur sporadically and can affect period-to-period comparisons. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, these items included both gains and losses associated with litigation settlements, the reversal of previously recognized income due to distributor acquisitions related to Vascular Solutions, the reversal of previously recognized income due to our distributor conversion in China, and relabeling costs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, these items included relabeling costs and costs associated with a facility that was exited.\n(D) Amortization of debt discount on convertible notes - When we sold $400 million principal amount of our 3.875% convertible notes (the “convertible notes”) in 2010, we allocated the proceeds between the liability and equity components of the debt, in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the $83.7 million difference between the proceeds of the sale of the convertible notes and the liability component of the debt constituted a debt discount that was to be amortized to interest expense over the approximately seven-year term of the convertible notes, which significantly increased the amount we recorded as interest expense attributable to the convertible notes. The amount of the amortization of the debt discount was reduced as a result of our repurchases of convertible notes in 2016 and 2017 and redemptions of the convertible notes by holders of the notes, although we continued to amortize the remaining portion of the debt discount to interest expense until August 2017, when all remaining convertible notes were either converted or matured.\n(E) Intangible amortization expense - Certain intangible assets, including customer relationships, intellectual property, distribution rights, trade names and non-competition agreements, initially are recorded at historical cost and then amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. The amount of such amortization can vary from period to period as a result of, among other things, business or asset acquisitions or dispositions.\n(F) Loss on extinguishment of debt - In connection with debt refinancings, debt repayments, repurchases of convertible notes and redemptions of convertible notes, outstanding indebtedness is extinguished. These events, which have occurred from time to time on an irregular basis, have resulted in losses reflecting, among other things, unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as debt prepayment fees and premiums (including conversion premiums resulting from conversion of convertible securities).\n(G) Tax adjustments - These adjustments represent the impact of the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations for prior year returns, the resolution of audits, the filing of amended returns with respect to prior tax years and/or tax law changes affecting our deferred tax liability. In addition, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, these items include tax expense associated with the TCJA, which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\n(H) Adjusted diluted shares are calculated by giving effect to the anti-dilutive impact of the Company’s convertible note hedge agreements, which reduced the potential economic dilution that otherwise would have occurred upon conversion of the Company's convertible notes. Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is not reflected in the weighted average number of diluted shares.\nABOUT TELEFLEX INCORPORATED\nTeleflex is a global provider of medical technologies designed to improve the health and quality of people’s lives.
