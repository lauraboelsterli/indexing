The largest U.S. auto maker is becoming more dependent on Chinese operations, where it now sells far more vehicles than it does in any other nation. \nThe company, once the dominant player in the international auto industry, has gotten significantly smaller under Barra. GM GM, -1.10% now holds the No. 4 slot behind Volkswagen AG VW, +0.94% VLKAY, -0.24% , Toyota Motor Corp. 7203, -2.53% TM, -2.95% and the Nissan Motor Co. 7201, -0.89% NSANY, -1.22% / Renault SA RNO, -0.25% alliance in global vehicle sales. \nThe decision to close a plant in the coastal city of Gunsan will trim a glut of unused factory space and lead to a charge of $850 million. The decision affects 2,000 workers at an operation that accounted for only about 7% of the 520,000 vehicles produced by GM Korea in 2017. ",
