He and King will be based in London and report to Bob Elfring and Jim Oâ€™Neil, co-heads of CIB for EMEA, according to a memo sent to staff on Friday and seen by IFR. \nCannon will join from Morgan Stanley, where he spent eight years, most recently as co-head of financial institutions for EMEA. He has also previously worked at Lehman Brothers and subsequently Nomura. \nKing joined BAML in 2010 as head of UK corporate banking, where he has helped build out the corporate banking business in Britain, Benelux and Scandinavia.
