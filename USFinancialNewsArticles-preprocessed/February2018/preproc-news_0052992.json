    "text": "3 COMMENTS A monthslong battle for control of $232 million raised in an initial coin offering came to an abrupt end on Thursday.\nFor months, the husband-and-wife team behind a cryptocurrency project known as Tezos has been locked in a fierce battle for control of the funds with the head of the board of a nonprofit foundation that sold the digital coins. More than 30,000 participants in that coin offering, one of the biggest of 2017, were in limbo while the two sides duked it out.\nNow, the head of the nonprofit foundation, Johann Gevers, has said he would step down. This clears the way for new leadership at the foundation, opening up the $232 million to be used by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman to develop the Tezos project.\n“I’m extremely happy about this,” Mr. Gevers said, adding the environment in recent months around the project had been “extremely difficult.” He declined to comment further due to ongoing litigation related to the coin offering.\nRelated\nFed’s Dudley Warns on Dangerous ‘Speculative Mania’ Around Cryptocurrencies What Bitcoin Rout? Sales of New Digital Tokens Are Still Soaring What’s an Initial Coin Offering? ICOs Explained in 11 Questions Thursday’s news is a good thing for investors in the coins sold by Tezos and for developers who have been unable to tap the funds, said Kathleen Breitman. “Arthur and I embrace the change in leadership and look forward to working with the foundation,” she said.\nNeither side disclosed details of the fight’s resolution.\nThe Breitmans began Tezos, which is a software platform, four years ago in a bid to address some of the governance issues that have surrounded other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. They launched the coin offering for Tezos last July, selling digital tokens through a Switzerland-based foundation.\nThe ensuing dispute over control of the $232 million the offering raised highlighted some of the many risks facing investors who participate in coin offerings.\nAlthough coin offerings, or ICOs, have raised more than $8 billion since the start of 2017, they generally aren’t regulated. Authorities in a number of countries are still grappling with how or whether to oversee them, or if the token sales should qualify as offerings of securities.\nThe coins being sold typically don’t offer ownership rights to a company, either. They usually give a holder the right at some future point to purchase a good or service, if the company selling the tokens produces one. Many don’t even have a working product or service. In some cases, they are simply concepts.\nWhat’s more, many of the entities selling coins are struggling with the best ways to structure the offerings, and the projects themselves. That is where the Breitmans ran into trouble.\nThe Breitmans formed a nonprofit to handle the money raised through the offering and oversee development of the project, naming Mr. Gevers president of the foundation board. This structure has been used for other cryptocurrency projects, like Ethereum, and is designed to ensure no one person or group controls what are essentially decentralized platforms.\nShortly after forming the Tezos Foundation, a power struggle erupted , with Mr. Gevers claiming the Breitmans were trying to exert control. The fight effectively froze the project, with the offering money tied up and unspent for months, while competitors raced ahead with their own projects .\nOriginally, a beta launch for Tezos was expected within a few months of the offering. That launch remains delayed, and Ms. Breitman said there currently isn’t a date for it.\nWhat’s more, distribution of the Tezos tokens sold through the offering was tied to the platform’s launch. That means investors have yet to receive the tokens they purchased.\nIn a brief statement on Thursday, the Tezos Foundation said that Mr. Gevers would be succeeded at the foundation by Ryan Jespersen.\nHe is a Utah resident and Tezos investor who spearheaded a rival nonprofit foundation, called the T2 Foundation, that was created to exert pressure on the first foundation. Mr. Jespersen wasn’t available for comment.\nMr. Jespersen was previously chief operating officer at a Lehi, Utah-based fintech startup called Divvy, according to the foundation.\nTezos tokens, which trade on the secondary market in a “prelaunch,” options-like manner, were up 12% at $4.10 Thursday; they had been down 11% before the announcement.\nWrite to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.com",
