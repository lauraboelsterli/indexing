    "text": "BELOIT, Wis., Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Regal Beloit Corporation (NYSE: RBC) today reported fourth quarter 2017 diluted earnings per share of $1.15, up 13.9% from the prior year. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share* were $1.14, up 9.6% from the prior year.\nKey financial results for the fourth quarter 2017 included:\nTotal net sales of $820.7 million increased 8.3% from the prior year and included a positive 1.3% foreign currency translation impact. The result was a positive organic sales growth rate of 6.9%. Income from operations was $78.3 million or 9.5% of net sales, up 30 basis points from prior year. Adjusted income from operations was $79.5 million or 9.7% of net sales, up 20 basis points from prior year. The Company repatriated $90.0 million of cash and paid down $74.3 million of debt.\nFourth quarter 2017 segment results versus the prior year fourth quarter included:\nCommercial and Industrial Systems Segment net sales were $407.7 million, an increase of 10.4%. Foreign currency had a positive 1.7% translation impact. The result was a positive organic sales growth rate of 8.7% driven by broad based global end market strength in both the OEM and distribution channels. Operating margin was 5.9%. Excluding $1.1 million in restructuring and related costs and a $0.4 million gain on sale of assets, adjusted operating margin was 6.1%. Climate Solutions Segment net sales were $216.4 million, an increase of 0.6%. Foreign currency had a positive 0.7% translation impact. The result was an organic sales growth rate that was essentially flat at negative 0.1%. North American residential HVAC sales were unchanged from a strong prior year. Operating margin was 14.0%. Excluding restructuring and related costs of $0.5 million, adjusted operating margin was 14.3%. Power Transmission Solutions Segment net sales were $196.6 million, an increase of 13.2%. Foreign currency had a positive 1.3% translation impact. The result was a positive organic sales growth rate of 11.9% driven by increased demand in the oil & gas and renewable energy end markets as well as in the distribution channel. Operating margin was 12.2%. There were no adjustments to the segment operating margin in the quarter.\nThe Company's fourth quarter 2017 results included the provisional impact of the U.S. tax reform legislation, which resulted in a $1.0 million decrease in the Provision for Income Taxes. This impact was a $0.02 benefit to GAAP diluted earnings per share but was excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share.\n*This earnings release includes non-GAAP financial measures. Descriptions of why we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included with this earnings release.\n\"In the fourth quarter, our organic sales growth was a strong 6.9% versus the prior year,\" said Regal Chairman and CEO Mark Gliebe. \"We ended the quarter with a 20 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin over the prior year. We offset most of the commodity inflation impact with increased volume, incremental price and continued execution of our simplification initiative.\n\"Reflecting on the year, we made meaningful progress on our four key Enterprise Strategy metrics: organic sales growth, adjusted operating margin, return on invested capital, and free cash flow to net income.\"\n2018 Outlook\n\"We are off to a good start this year with order strength in all three segments. In 2018, we are forecasting another year of low to mid-single digit organic sales growth, and we expect to improve our adjusted operating margin for the third consecutive year. We expect the benefits from our price actions and simplification projects will more than offset the commodity inflation headwind. Accordingly, we forecast our 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $5.35 to $5.75,\" continued Mr. Gliebe.\nThe Company forecasts 2018 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.19 to $5.59. The difference between the GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance and the adjusted diluted per share guidance relates to Restructuring and Related Costs of $0.16 per share.\nConference Call\nRegal will hold a conference call to discuss the earnings release at 9:00 AM CST (10:00 AM EST) on Tuesday, February 6, 2018.

statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). We also periodically disclose certain financial measures in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and in investor presentations and similar events that may be considered \"non-GAAP\" financial measures. This additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nIn this earnings release, we disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures, and we reconcile these measures in the tables below to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures: adjusted diluted earnings per share (both historical and projected), adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, and free cash flow as a percentage of net income attributable to Regal Beloit Corporation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures for providing investors with additional information regarding our results of operations and for helping investors understand and compare our operating results across accounting periods and compared to our peers. Our management primarily uses adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin to help us manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions, while adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of net income are primarily used to help us evaluate our business and forecast our future results. Accordingly, we believe disclosing and reconciling each of these measures helps investors evaluate our business in the same manner as management.\nIn addition to these non-GAAP measures, we also use the term \"organic sales\" to refer to GAAP sales from existing operations excluding sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to any divested businesses (\"acquisition sales\"), and the impact of foreign currency translation. The impact of foreign currency translation is determined by translating the respective period's sales (excluding acquisition sales) using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year periods. We use the term \"organic sales growth\" to refer to the increase in our sales between periods that is attributable to organic sales. For further clarification, we may use the term \"acquisition growth\" to refer to the increase in our sales between periods that is attributable to acquisition sales.\nADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nGAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share\n$\n1.15\n$\n1.01\n$\n4.74\n$\n4.52\nRestructuring and Related Costs\n0.02\n0.04\n0.22\n0.10\nGain on Disposal of Businesses\n—\n—\n—\n(0.14)\nGain on Sale of Assets\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.07)\n(0.04)\nProvisional Benefit of the New US Tax Legislation\n(0.02)\n—\n(0.02)\n—\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\n$\n1.14\n$\n1.04\n$\n4.87\n$\n4.44\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME\nThree Months Ended\nCommercial &\nIndustrial Systems\nClimate Solutions\nPower\nTransmission\nSolutions\nTotal Regal\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nGAAP Income from Operations\n$\n24.0\n$\n20.5\n$\n30.4\n$\n27.0\n$\n23.9\n$\n22.6\n$\n78.3\n$\n70.1\nRestructuring and Related Costs\n1.1\n1.5\n0.5\n0.6\n—\n0.5\n1.6\n2.6\nGain on Sale of Assets\n(0.4)\n(0.5)\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(0.4)\n(0.5)\nAdjusted Income from Operations\n$\n24.7\n$\n21.5\n$\n30.9\n$\n27.6\n$\n23.9\n$\n23.1\n$\n79.5\n$\n72.2\nGAAP Operating Margin %\n5.9\n%\n5.6\n%\n14.0\n%\n12.5\n%\n12.2\n%\n13.0\n%\n9.5\n%\n9.2\n%\nAdjusted Operating Margin %\n6.1\n%\n5.8\n%\n14.3\n%\n12.8\n%\n12.2\n%\n13.3\n%\n9.7\n%\n9.5\n%\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME\nTwelve Months Ended\nCommercial &\nIndustrial Systems\nClimate Solutions\nPower\nTransmission\nSolutions\nTotal Regal\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nGAAP Income from Operations\n$\n100.0\n$\n103.5\n$\n140.6\n$\n129.9\n$\n89.5\n$\n87.2\n$\n330.1\n$\n320.6\nRestructuring and Related Costs\n10.9\n2.5\n2.5\n2.6\n0.7\n1.7\n14.1\n6.8\nGain on Disposal of Businesses\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(0.1)\n(11.6)\n(0.1)\n(11.6)\nGain on Sale of Assets\n(1.1)\n(1.7)\n—\n—\n(2.8)\n—\n(3.9)\n(1.7)\nAdjusted Income from Operations\n$\n109.8\n$\n104.3\n$\n143.1\n$\n132.5\n$\n87.3\n$\n77.3\n$\n340.2\n$\n314.1\nGAAP Operating Margin %\n6.2\n%\n6.8\n%\n14.2\n%\n13.5\n%\n11.7\n%\n11.9\n%\n9.8\n%\n9.9\n%\nAdjusted Operating Margin %\n6.8\n%\n6.8\n%\n14.4\n%\n13.8\n%\n11.4\n%\n10.5\n%\n10.1\n%\n9.7\n%\nFREE CASH FLOW\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nDec 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n$\n56.9\n$\n111.9\n$\n291.9\n$\n442.3\nAdditions to Property Plant and Equipment\n(16.2)\n(19.1)\n(65.2)\n(65.2)\nFree Cash Flow\n$\n40.7\n$\n92.8\n$\n226.7\n$\n377.1\nFree Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Regal Beloit Corporation\n79.0\n%\n203.5\n%\n106.4\n%\n185.4\n%\n2018 ADJUSTED ANNUAL GUIDANCE\nMinimum\nMaximum\n2018 Diluted EPS Annual Guidance\n$\n5.19\n$\n5.59\nRestructuring and Related Costs\n0.16\n0.16\n2018 Adjusted Diluted EPS Annual Guidance\n$\n5.35\n$\n5.75\nORGANIC SALES GROWTH\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 30, 2017\nCommercial &\nIndustrial\nSystems\nClimate\nSolutions\nPower\nTransmission\nSolutions\nTotal Regal\nNet Sales\n$\n407.7\n$\n216.4\n$\n196.6\n$\n820.7\nImpact from Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n(6.4)\n(1.4)\n(2.2)\n(10.0)\nAdjusted Net Sales\n$\n401.3\n$\n215.0\n$\n194.4\n$\n810.7\nNet Sales Three Months Ended Dec 31, 2016\n$\n369.2\n$\n215.2\n$\n173.7\n$\n758.1\nOrganic Sales Growth %\n8.7\n%\n(0.1)\n%\n11.9\n%\n6.9\n%\nNet Sales Growth %\n10.4\n%\n0.6\n%\n13.2\n%\n8.3\n%\nORGANIC SALES GROWTH\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 30, 2017\nCommercial &\nIndustrial\nSystems\nClimate\nSolutions\nPower\nTransmission\nSolutions\nTotal Regal\nNet Sales\n$\n1,604.3\n$\n990.6\n$\n765.4\n$\n3,360.3\nNet Sales from Business Divested\n—\n—\n9.0\n9.0\nImpact from Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n(2.5)\n(0.7)\n(1.6)\n(4.8)\nAdjusted Net Sales\n$\n1,601.8\n$\n989.9\n$\n772.8\n$\n3,364.5\nNet Sales Twelve Months Ended Dec 31, 2016\n$\n1,530.9\n$\n960.0\n$\n733.6\n$\n3,224.5\nOrganic Sales Growth %\n4.6\n%\n3.1\n%\n5.3\n%\n4.3\n%\nNet Sales Growth %\n4.8\n%\n3.2\n%\n4.3\n%\n4.2\n%\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regal-beloit-corporation-announces-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-results-300593644.html\nSOURCE Regal Beloit Corporation",
