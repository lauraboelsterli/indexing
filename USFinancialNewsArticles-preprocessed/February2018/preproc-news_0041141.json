    "text": "SAO PAULO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - All members of Brazilâ€™s central bank policy board agreed that halting interest rate cuts would be appropriate if the economic outlook evolves as expected, but kept the door open for a potential final rate reduction next month, according to the minutes of its Feb. 7 meeting published on Thursday.\nAt the Feb. 7 monetary policy meeting, when it reduced the benchmark interest rate to an all-time low of 6.75 percent, policymakers diverged as to how strongly to hint at the end of monetary easing.
