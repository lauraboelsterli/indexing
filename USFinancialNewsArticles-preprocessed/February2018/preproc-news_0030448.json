Realized copper price of $3.17 per pound A $17.0 million gain on the sale of the Kutcho mineral property. A commodity derivative loss of $4.1 million, comprising realized losses of $14.7 million and the reversal of unrealized losses recorded in a prior period of $10.6 million. The zero-cost collar and copper forwards expired in 2017. A derivative loss of $3.8 million primarily related to unrealized losses on the embedded derivative asset. Cash flow from operating activities of $44.8 million or $0.12 per common share. Working capital increased $11.2 million to $189.4 million at December 31, 2017 (which included $116.2 million of cash and cash equivalents) from $178.2 million at September 30, 2017. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital 1 was $38.2 million or $0.10 per share. Produced a total of 22,600 tonnes of payable copper at a C1 cash cost 1 of $1.98 per pound of payable copper produced and fully-loaded all-in cost 1 of $2.82 per pound of payable pound copper produced. Revenue of $152.8 million generated primarily from the sale of 22,575 tonnes of copper.\nFinancial and Production Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet income of $55.1 million included: Earnings from mining operations of $117.5 million. Realized copper price of $2.86 per pound A non-cash impairment reversal of $20.6 million related to Minto mineral property, plant and equipment. A $17.0 million gain on the sale of the Kutcho mineral property. A commodity derivative loss of $24.8 million, comprising realized losses of $45.6 million and the reversal of unrealized gains recorded in a previous period of $20.8 million. The zero-cost collar and copper forwards expired in 2017 and Capstone has no commodity derivatives in place effective January 1, 2018. An income tax expense of $28.9 million. Cash flow from operating activities of $112.5 million or $0.29 per common share. Working capital increased $18.3 million to $189.4 million at December 31, 2017 (which included $116.2 million of cash and cash equivalents) from $171.1 million at December 31, 2016. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital 1 was $129.7 million or $0.34 per common share. Production of 87,268 tonnes of payable copper at a C1 cash cost 1 of $1.92 per pound of payable copper produced and fully-loaded all-in cost 1 of $2.72 per pound of payable pound copper produced. Revenue of $541.9 million generated primarily from the sale of 87,918 tonnes of copper.\nProduction, Costs and Additional Highlights\nPinto Valley Mine:\nProduced 16,160 tonnes of copper during Q4 2017 at a C1 cash cost 1 of $1.79 per pound of payable copper produced and all-in cost 1 of $2.17 per pound of payable copper produced. Produced 57,332 tonnes of copper during 2017 at a C1 cash cost 1 of $1.95 per pound of payable copper produced and all-in cost 1 of $2.34 per pound of payable copper produced. Pinto Valley had a strong fourth quarter, with production exceeding expectations on higher grade and recoveries. Work in the later part of the year focused on overall operation optimization. 2017 C1 cash cost 1 and all-in cost 1 per pound of payable copper produced were in line with revised 2017 cost guidance.\nCozamin Mine:\nProduced 4,254 tonnes of copper during Q4 2017 at a C1 cash cost 1 of $1.04 per pound of payable copper produced and all-in cost 1 of $2.08 per pound of payable copper produced. Produced 16,732 tonnes of copper during 2017 at a C1 cash cost 1 of $1.16 per pound of payable copper produced and all-in cost 1 of $1.90 per pound of payable copper produced. At Cozamin, production for the fourth quarter and full year exceeded expectations, largely on higher mining and processing rates as the mine achieved development rates that allowed for increased flexibility. 2017 C1 cash cost 1 and all-in cost 1 per pound of payable copper produced were in line with 2017 guidance.\nMinto Mine:\nAt the start of 2017, it was Capstone's intention to place the Minto Mine on care and maintenance at the end of 2017. As a result of rising copper prices and the downside protection provided by the renegotiation of the precious metals stream in 2017, Capstone made the decision to continue operations until at least mid-2021. Significant development and stripping costs were expensed in the second half of 2017 as part of the mine life extension that will benefit future periods. These additional costs, combined with lower than planned production for the fourth quarter, impacted C1 cash cost 1 per pound of payable copper produced. Produced 3,003 tonnes of copper during Q4 2017 at a C1 cash cost 1 of $4.29 per pound of payable copper produced and all-in cost 1 of $4.80 per payable pound of copper. Produced 16,332 tonnes of copper during 2017 at a C1 cash cost 1 of $2.60 per pound of payable copper produced and all-in cost 1 of $2.75 per payable pound of copper produced. At Minto, underground production continued to lag planned rates, resulting in higher utilization of partially oxidized and low-grade sulphide ore stockpiles. The lower proportion of sulfide ore in the mill feed negatively impacted grade and recovery. As a result, 2017 C1 cash cost 1 and all-in cost 1 per pound of payable copper produced were higher than revised 2017 guidance.\nAdditional Highlights:\nOn December 15, 2017, Capstone completed the sale of its Kutcho development project to Kutcho Copper Corp. (formerly Desert Star Resources Ltd.). Under the terms of the agreement, Capstone received C$28.8 million in cash and 4,646,892 common shares of the newly named Kutcho Copper Corp. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, Capstone acquired an additional 3,076,923 shares and 1,538,461 share purchase warrants through a private placement, resulting in Capstone owning and controlling at December 31, 2017, directly or indirectly, approximately 16.5% of the current issued and outstanding shares of Kutcho Copper on a non-diluted basis. As a result, Capstone recorded a gain on the sale of the Kutcho development project of $17.0 million. Debt repayments totalling $24.0 million were made on the senior secured corporate revolving credit facility (\"RCF\") during Q4 2017, with total repayments of $54.0 for the full year 2017, reducing the outstanding balance to $274.9 million at December 31, 2017. The zero-cost collar and copper forward contracts matured during 2017. The Company has no commodity derivatives on any copper sales in 2018 and beyond.\nSubsequent Event:\nOn February 14, 2018, Capstone entered into a definitive share purchase agreement (the \"Agreement\") pursuant to which it has agreed to sell its Minto Mine to Pembridge Resources plc (\"Pembridge\") (the \"Transaction\"). Under the terms of the Agreement, Capstone will receive US$37.5 million in cash, plus working capital adjustments, and common shares representing 9.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Pembridge upon completion of the Transaction. The Transaction is subject to closing conditions, including the requirement for Pembridge to post the required financial security with respect to the closure bonding requirements at Minto. Capstone has agreed, for a period of one year post-closing, to retain one-third (approximately Cdn$24 million) of the existing surety bond if requested by Pembridge, after which time Capstone will have no further obligation with respect to the closure of the Minto Mine. The Transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. Capstone intends to use net proceeds from the sale primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\n2018 Operating and Capital Guidance\nIn 2018, Capstone expects to produce 90,000 tonnes (±5%) of copper at a C1 cash cost 1 of $1.85 to $1.95 per pound of payable copper produced. Capital expenditures for 2018, including $24 million of capitalized stripping and $7 million of brownfield exploration, are expected to be $100 million or $0.50 per pound of payable copper produced. Consolidated all-in sustaining cost 1 guidance is $2.50 to $2.60 per pound of payable copper produced.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nDate:\nThursday, February 15, 2018\nTime:\n11:30 am Eastern Time (8:30 am Pacific Time)\nDial in:\nNorth America: 1-888-390-0546, International: +416-764-8688\nWebcast:\nhttp://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=1559280&s=1&k=9E417F05C934E98FC1A5B362C357B8ED\nReplay:\nNorth America: 1-888-390-0541, International: +416-764-8677\nReplay Passcode:\n894303#\nThe conference call replay will be available until Thursday, February 22, 2018.
