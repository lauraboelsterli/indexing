Our 2018 outlook reflects that commitment, with double-digit growth in our fastest-growing product lines, including active safety, infotainment, vehicle electrification and connected services. This outlook underscores our unparalleled commitment to solving mobility's toughest challenges.\"\nFull Year 2017 Results\nThe Company reported full year 2017 revenue of $12.9 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year. Adjusted for currency exchange, commodity movements and the divestiture of the Company's Mechatronics business, revenue increased by 5% during the year. This reflects growth of 9% in Europe, 10% in Asia and 24% in South America, partially offset by a decline of 3% in North America.\nFor full year 2017, the Company reported U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations of $1,021 million and earnings from continuing operations of $3.81 per diluted share, compared to $834 million and $3.05 per diluted share in the prior year. Full year 2017 Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, totaled $1,243 million, or $4.64 per diluted share. Adjusted Net Income in the prior year was $1,224 million, or $4.47 per diluted share.\nThe Company reported Adjusted Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, of $1,594 million for full year 2017, compared to $1,623 million in the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income margin was 12.4% for full year 2017, compared to 13.2% in the prior year, reflecting the 40 basis point impact of the Mechatronics divestiture and continued incremental investments for growth, partially offset by sales growth and the beneficial impacts of cost reduction initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $546 million, an increase from $489 million in the prior year.\nInterest expense for full year 2017 totaled $140 million, as compared to $155 million in the prior year, which reflects the benefits of our debt refinancing transactions in the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, the year ended December 31, 2016 included a loss on the extinguishment of debt totaling $73 million.\nTax expense for full year 2017 was $223 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 18%, which includes approximately $55 million, or 4 points, for the one-time impacts of the U.S. tax reform enactment. Tax expense for full year 2016 was $167 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 17%.\nThe Company generated net cash flow from continuing operating activities of $1,106 million in 2017, compared to $1,494 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the $310 million payment made in 2017 to settle the Unsecured Creditors litigation. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion and total debt of $4.1 billion.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nThe Company reported fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $3.4 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior year period. Adjusted for currency exchange, commodity movements and the divestiture of the Company's Mechatronics business, revenue increased by 4% in the fourth quarter. This reflects growth of 11% in Europe, 8% in Asia and 26% in South America, partially offset by a decline of 6% in North America.\nThe Company reported fourth quarter 2017 U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations of $207 million and earnings from continuing operations of $0.77 per diluted share, compared to $182 million and $0.67 per diluted share in the prior year period. Fourth quarter Adjusted Net Income totaled $343 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, which includes the unfavorable impacts of a higher tax rate compared to the prior period. Adjusted Net Income in the prior year period was $382 million, or $1.41 per diluted share.\nFourth quarter Adjusted Operating Income was $450 million, compared to $455 million in the prior year period. Fourth quarter Adjusted Operating Income margin was 13.1%, compared to 14.2% in the prior year period, reflecting continued incremental investments for growth and a 30 basis point reduction as a result of the Mechatronics divestiture, partially offset by above-market sales growth. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $154 million in the fourth quarter, an increase from $126 million in the prior year period.\nInterest expense for the fourth quarter totaled $37 million, as compared to $33 million in the prior year period.\nTax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $135 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 39%, compared to a tax benefit of $4 million in the prior year period. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes $55 million, or 16 points, for the one-time impacts of the U.S. tax reform enactment, as well as tax impacts of approximately $27 million resulting from the timing of recognition of the spin-off and classification of Powertrain Systems as discontinued operations.\nReconciliations of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Share, Adjusted Operating Income and Cash Flow Before Financing, which are non-GAAP measures, to the most directly comparable financial measures, respectively, calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") are provided in the attached supplemental schedules.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2017, the Company repurchased 4.67 million shares for approximately $383 million under its existing authorized share repurchase program, leaving approximately $989 million available for future share repurchases. All repurchased shares were retired, and are reflected as a reduction of ordinary share capital for the par value of the shares, with the excess applied as reductions to additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings.\nQ1 and Full Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company's first quarter and full year 2018 financial guidance is as follows:\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nQ1 2018\nFull Year 2018\nNet sales\n$3,275 - $3,375\n$13,400 - $13,800\nAdjusted operating income\n$390 - $410\n$1,685 - $1,765\nAdjusted operating income margin\n11.9% - 12.1%\n12.6% - 12.8%\nAdjusted net income per share\n$1.17 - $1.22\n$5.00 - $5.20\nCash flow from operations\n$1,550\nCapital expenditures\n$750\nAdjusted effective tax rate\n15% - 16%\n15% - 16%\nDiscontinued Operations - Spin-off of Powertrain Systems Segment into Delphi Technologies\nAs previously disclosed, the spin-off of the Company's former Powertrain Systems segment into a new, independent publicly traded company, Delphi Technologies PLC, was completed on December 4, 2017. The results of the Powertrain Systems business through December 4, 2017 are presented as discontinued operations separate from the Company's continuing operations for all periods presented. In connection with the spin-off, Aptiv received a dividend of approximately $1,148 million from Delphi Technologies, which the Company intends to use to fund growth initiatives, including increased investment in advanced technologies and engineering, and for general corporate purposes.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results at 8:30 a.m. (ET) today, which is accessible by dialing 888.486.0553 (US domestic) or 706.634.4982 (international) or through a webcast at ir.aptiv.com . The conference ID number is 1786308. A slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks and has been posted on the investor relations section of the Company's website. A replay will be available two hours following the conference call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains information about Aptiv's financial results which are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Operating Income represents net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expense, equity income (loss), net of tax, income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, restructuring, other acquisition and portfolio project costs, asset impairments, gains (losses) on business divestitures and deferred compensation related to acquisitions. Other acquisition and portfolio project costs include costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions, including business and product acquisitions and divestitures. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of Net sales.\nAdjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to Aptiv before discontinued operations, restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. Cash Flow Before Financing represents cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses.\nManagement believes the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, management believes Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are useful measures in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nSuch non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the attached supplemental schedules at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAbout Aptiv\nAptiv PLC (NYSE: APTV) is a global technology company that develops safer, greener and more connected solutions, which enable the future of mobility. Headquartered in Gillingham, England, Aptiv has 147,000 employees and operates 14 technical centers, as well as manufacturing sites and customer support centers, in 45 countries.

Our management utilizes Adjusted Operating Income in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Management also utilizes Adjusted Operating Income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to our segments, as management also believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments. Adjusted Operating Income is defined as net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expense, equity income (loss), net of tax, income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, restructuring and other special items. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Operating Income, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Operating Income margin represents Operating Income as a percentage of Net sales, and Adjusted Operating Income margin represents Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of Net sales.\nConsolidated Adjusted Operating Income\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions)\n$\nMargin\n$\nMargin\n$\nMargin\n$\nMargin\nNet income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n256\n$\n281\n$\n1,355\n$\n1,257\nInterest expense\n37\n33\n140\n155\nOther (income) expense, net\n(1)\n311\n21\n384\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n135\n(4)\n223\n167\nEquity income, net of tax\n(7)\n(12)\n(31)\n(35)\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax\n(55)\n(109)\n(365)\n(458)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n21\n25\n73\n69\nOperating income\n386\n11.2\n%\n525\n16.4\n%\n1,416\n11.0\n%\n1,539\n12.5\n%\nRestructuring\n28\n62\n129\n167\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n17\n9\n28\n57\nAsset impairments\n7\n—\n9\n1\n(Gain) loss on business divestitures, net\n—\n(141)\n—\n(141)\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n12\n—\n12\n—\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n450\n13.1\n%\n$\n455\n14.2\n%\n$\n1,594\n12.4\n%\n$\n1,623\n13.2\n%\nSegment Adjusted Operating Income\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nSignal and Power Solutions\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience\nEliminations and Other\nTotal\nOperating income\n$\n319\n$\n67\n$\n—\n$\n386\nRestructuring\n23\n5\n—\n28\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n13\n4\n—\n17\nAsset impairments\n7\n—\n—\n7\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n—\n12\n—\n12\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n362\n$\n88\n$\n—\n$\n450\nDepreciation and amortization (a)\n$\n122\n$\n32\n$\n—\n$\n154\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2016\nSignal and Power Solutions\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience\nEliminations and Other\nTotal\nOperating income\n$\n306\n$\n219\n$\n—\n$\n525\nRestructuring\n52\n10\n—\n62\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n7\n2\n—\n9\n(Gain) loss on business divestitures, net\n—\n(141)\n—\n(141)\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n365\n$\n90\n$\n—\n$\n455\nDepreciation and amortization (a)\n$\n103\n$\n23\n$\n—\n$\n126\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nSignal and Power Solutions\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience\nEliminations and Other\nTotal\nOperating income\n$\n1,206\n$\n210\n$\n—\n$\n1,416\nRestructuring\n67\n62\n—\n129\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n21\n7\n—\n28\nAsset impairments\n8\n1\n—\n9\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n—\n12\n—\n12\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n1,302\n$\n292\n$\n—\n$\n1,594\nDepreciation and amortization (a)\n$\n438\n$\n108\n$\n—\n$\n546\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nSignal and Power Solutions\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience\nEliminations and Other\nTotal\nOperating income\n$\n1,099\n$\n440\n$\n—\n$\n1,539\nRestructuring\n125\n42\n—\n167\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n48\n9\n—\n57\nAsset impairments\n—\n1\n—\n1\n(Gain) loss on business divestitures, net\n—\n(141)\n—\n(141)\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n1,272\n$\n351\n$\n—\n$\n1,623\nDepreciation and amortization (a)\n$\n401\n$\n88\n$\n—\n$\n489\n(a) Includes asset impairments.\nAPTIV PLC\nRECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS TO ADJUSTED EARNINGS\n(Unaudited)\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share : Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share, which are non-GAAP measures, are presented as supplemental measures of the Company's financial performance which management believes are useful to investors in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends. Management utilizes Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income attributable to Aptiv before discontinued operations, restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n256\n$\n281\n$\n1,355\n$\n1,257\nIncome from discontinued operations attributable to Aptiv, net of tax\n(49)\n(99)\n(334)\n(423)\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Aptiv\n207\n182\n1,021\n834\nAdjusting items:\nRestructuring\n28\n62\n129\n167\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n17\n9\n28\n57\nAsset impairments\n7\n—\n9\n1\n(Gain) loss on business divestitures, net\n—\n(141)\n—\n(141)\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n12\n—\n12\n—\nDebt extinguishment costs\n—\n—\n—\n73\nReserve for Unsecured Creditors litigation\n—\n300\n10\n300\nTransaction and related costs associated with acquisitions\n8\n—\n8\n—\nContingent consideration liability fair value adjustments\n(14)\n3\n(14)\n3\nTax impact of U.S. tax reform enactment\n55\n—\n55\n—\nTax impact of adjusting items (a)\n23\n(33)\n(15)\n(70)\nAdjusted net income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n343\n$\n382\n$\n1,243\n$\n1,224\nWeighted average number of diluted shares outstanding\n267.44\n271.64\n268.03\n273.70\nDiluted net income per share from continuing operations attributable to Aptiv\n$\n0.77\n$\n0.67\n$\n3.81\n$\n3.05\nAdjusted net income per share\n$\n1.28\n$\n1.41\n$\n4.64\n$\n4.47\n(a)\nRepresents the income tax impacts of the adjustments made for restructuring and other special items by calculating the income tax impact of these items using the appropriate tax rate for the jurisdiction where the charges were incurred, the quarterly intra-period tax allocation impacts of approximately $27 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 resulting from the effectiveness of the spin-off, and the elimination of the net impact of deferred tax asset valuation allowance changes in estimates of $15 million of valuation allowances recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nCash Flow Before Financing : Cash Flow Before Financing is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's liquidity which is consistent with the basis and manner in which management presents financial information for the purpose of making internal operating decisions, evaluating its liquidity and determining appropriate capital allocation strategies. Management believes this measure is useful to investors to understand how the Company's core operating activities generate and use cash. Cash Flow Before Financing is defined as cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions (including the settlement of foreign currency derivatives in 2016 related to the 2015 acquisition of HellermannTyton) and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses. Not all companies use identical calculations of cash flow before financing therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The calculation of Cash Flow Before Financing does not reflect cash used to service debt, pay dividends or repurchase shares and, therefore, does not necessarily reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses.\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions)\nCash flows from operating activities:\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n222\n$\n197\n$\n1,063\n$\n868\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n154\n126\n546\n489\nRestructuring expense, net of cash paid\n(7)\n35\n2\n77\nWorking capital\n62\n114\n(243)\n(217)\nPension contributions\n(13)\n(35)\n(40)\n(43)\nOther, net\n3\n167\n(222)\n320\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations\n421\n604\n1,106\n1,494\nCash flows from investing activities:\nCapital expenditures\n(218)\n(160)\n(698)\n(657)\nNet proceeds from divestiture of Thermal discontinued operations\n—\n(4)\n—\n48\nNet proceeds from business divestitures\n—\n197\n—\n197\nCost of business acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n(284)\n—\n(324)\n(15)\nCost of technology investments\n—\n—\n(50)\n(3)\nSettlement of derivatives\n(16)\n15\n(28)\n(1)\nOther, net\n1\n11\n7\n19\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities from continuing operations\n(517)\n59\n(1,093)\n(412)\nAdjusting items:\nAdjustment for net proceeds from divestiture of Thermal discontinued operations\n—\n4\n—\n(48)\nAdjustment for net proceeds from divestiture of Mechatronics business\n—\n(197)\n—\n(197)\nAdjustment for the cost of business acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n284\n—\n324\n15\nAdjustment for settlement of derivatives related to business acquisition\n—\n—\n—\n15\nCash flow before financing\n$\n188\n$\n470\n$\n337\n$\n867\nFinancial Guidance : The reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided in the Company's financial guidance to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measure is as follows:\nEstimated Q1\nEstimated Full Year\n2018 (1)\n2018 (1)\n($ and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nAdjusted Operating Income\n$\nMargin (2)\n$\nMargin (2)\nNet income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n166\n$\n1,088\nInterest expense\n35\n140\nOther (income) expense, net\n(10)\n(30)\nIncome tax expense\n79\n244\nEquity income, net of tax\n(8)\n(30)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n7\n40\nOperating income\n269\n8.1\n%\n1,452\n10.7\n%\nRestructuring\n88\n152\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n29\n64\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n14\n57\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n400\n12.0\n%\n$\n1,725\n12.7\n%\nAdjusted Net Income per Share\nNet income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n166\n$\n1,088\nRestructuring\n88\n152\nOther acquisition and portfolio project costs\n29\n64\nDeferred compensation related to nuTonomy acquisition\n14\n57\nTax impact of adjusting items and other\n23\n1\nAdjusted net income attributable to Aptiv\n$\n320\n$\n1,362\nWeighted average number of diluted shares outstanding\n266.95\n267.26\nDiluted net income per share attributable to Aptiv\n$\n0.62\n$\n4.07\nAdjusted net income per share\n$\n1.20\n$\n5.10\n(1) Prepared at the estimated mid-point of the Company's financial guidance range.\n(2) Represents Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income, respectively, as a percentage of estimated Net sales.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aptiv-reports-2017-financial-results-exceeding-companys-previous-outlook-300591507.html\nSOURCE Aptiv PLC",
