INTENSE LEASING \nWhile shopping centre operators face tough competition online, Klepierre has been helped by a euro-zone economy growing at its fastest rate in a decade, with consumer confidence at a 17-year high last month. \n“We have a reduction in unemployment everywhere in Europe...and that will boost consumption in shopping centres,” Jestin said after Klepierre said leasing activity was “intense” in 2017, with 1,864 deals signed, up 8 percent year-on-year. \nKlepierre said that it expects 2018 cash flow of 2.57–2.62 euros per share, which at the higher end of the range represents growth of 5.6 percent. \nAlthough this would be slower than in 2017, Jestin said it was nevertheless possible Klepierre might beat its forecast. \n“Historically it is true that Klepierre has beaten its objectives and so perhaps we will be in this situation again.” \nThe firm proposed a dividend of 1.96 euros ($2.40) per share for 2017, up 7.7 percent on the previous year.
