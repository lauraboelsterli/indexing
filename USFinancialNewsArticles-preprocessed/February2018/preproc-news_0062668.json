GKN has set a deadline to break itself up by the middle of next year to help boost value for shareholders as it seeks to stave off the 7 billion pound bid from Melrose. PIRC highlighted the hostile nature of the bid, political and security concerns expressed in the United States over the deal, GKN’s strong defence and concerns about losses at Melrose and the risk of further indebtedness.
