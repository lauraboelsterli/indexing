    "text": "Expands International Equity Platform with New Unconstrained, Concentrated Value Strategies\nNEW YORK NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lazard Asset Management LLC (LAM) today announced the expansion of its international equity platform with the addition of a new team. Based in New York, Mark Rooney, Erik Van Der Sande, Craig Lottner and Chris Torino will form the Lazard International Value Concentrated team.\nThe new investment team maintains a value-based investment approach, designed to identify and exploit company-specific inflection points. The team invests in companies listed outside the United States across all market capitalizations, and manages concentrated long-only and long/short portfolios.\n“Lazard understands us well – what makes our investment style unique, and ultimately the value proposition we offer investors,” said Mr. Rooney, Portfolio Manager on the Lazard International Value Concentrated team. “We are excited to gain the benefit of Lazard’s collaborative, research-based culture, the access to its institutional quality infrastructure, and the ability to focus intensely on what we love – picking stocks.”\nThe investment team joins LAM from LRV Capital Management LLC (LRV), which was co-founded by Rooney, Van Der Sande and Lottner with seeding from Stride Capital Group (Stride) in 2012. They began their working relationship more than 15 years ago at Millgate Capital. The Lazard International Value Concentrated team brings collectively more than 55 years of experience in research and investing outside the United States in both developed and emerging markets.\n“Managing international equities has been a key investment focus for Lazard and our clients for more than thirty years,” said John Reinsberg, Deputy Chairman of Lazard Asset Management. “We are pleased to expand our international equity platform to incorporate this new highly differentiated value strategy, which complements our existing line-up.”\nAs of December 31, 2017, LAM has $222 billion of assets under management, including approximately $54 billion in international equity strategies. Substantially all client assets, including those of Stride, previously managed by LRV are transitioning to LAM.\nAbout Lazard Asset Management (LAM) LLC\nAn indirect subsidiary of Lazard Ltd (NYSE: LAZ), LAM offers a range of equity, fixed income, and alternative investment products worldwide. As of December 31, 2017, LAM and affiliated asset management companies in the Lazard Group managed $249 billion worth of client assets.
