    "text": " 51 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Hochtief set to win unconditional EU approval for Abertis bid - source   \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set to approve without conditions German builder Hochtief’s ( HOTG.DE ) bid to purchase Spanish airports and motorway operator Abertis ( ABE.MC ), a person familiar with the matter said. \nHochtief, majority-owned by Spanish builder ACS ( ACS.MC ), is battling Italian airports and motorway operator Atlantia for Abertis. Its bid values Abertis at around 17.1 billion euros (£15 billion), above Atlantia’s cash-and-share offer worth about 15.6 billion euros. \nThe European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on Hochtief’s bid by Feb. 6, declined to comment.
