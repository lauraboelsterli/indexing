    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee voted unanimously on Monday to release a Democratic rebuttal to a memo written by the panel’s Republicans that accused the FBI and the Justice Department of bias against President Donald Trump in the Russia investigation, the committee’s top Democrat said.\nRepresentative Adam Schiff told reporters the document would now go to the White House on Monday night, and that it would be “very hard” for the Trump administration to block its release.\nTrump will have five days to decide whether to block the release of the classified document.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Writing by Mohammad Zargham; Editing by Eric Beech\n ",
