    "text": "WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that while there had been progress on a long-term government funding bill, another stopgap measure would be needed as the details are finalized.\n“Even if we get everything figured out by, say, Tuesday, we still will have to have a CR (continuing resolution) if only for the fact that we have to give the appropriators time to write an omnibus appropriations bill,” Ryan told reporters at a congressional Republican retreat ahead of a Feb. 8 deadline to fund the government.\n“We’re still negotiating the contents and the duration of that,” he added.\nReporting by Amanda Becker; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
