(NYSE:CRI), the largest branded marketer in North America of apparel exclusively for babies and young children, today reported its fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results.\n“We saw strong demand in all channels of distribution in the fourth quarter, and are reporting another year of record sales and earnings,” said Michael D. Casey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “In 2017, we achieved our 29th consecutive year of sales growth, strengthened our business with the acquisitions of Skip Hop and our largest international licensee based in Mexico, and returned $260 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n“The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is expected to have a significant and positive impact on our Company’s future earnings, cash flow, and ability to invest in its growth strategies. In 2018, we plan to reinvest approximately half of the $40 million benefit from the lower corporate tax rate in brand marketing and improved eCommerce capabilities.\n“Given the significant and unexpected benefit in 2017 of the historic tax reform legislation, we are also announcing today that our Board of Directors has approved $20 million in special compensation awards to all of our Company’s eligible full-time and part-time employees provided through enhanced retirement plan contributions and bonuses.\n“With the support of our talented organization throughout the world, we are expecting another good year of sales, earnings and cash flow in 2018 driven by our continued focus on providing the best value and experience in young children’s apparel and related products.”\nImpact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nThe Company’s provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 includes a net tax benefit of $40.0 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This net tax benefit consists of a $50.4 million benefit related to revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities and a $10.4 million provisional estimate for additional tax expense related to accumulated earnings outside of the United States.\nFourth quarter fiscal 2017 results also include pretax expense of $21.2 million for special compensation and related payroll taxes awarded as a result of this tax reform legislation. The nature of the special compensation includes:\nCash bonuses to full-time and part-time global employees with one year of service, with full-time employees receiving a bonus of approximately 5% of base salary and part-time employees receiving approximately $100 per year of service with the Company. The Company’s leadership team will not receive these special bonuses. A 100% match of employee voluntary contributions to Company-sponsored retirement programs, subject to certain statutory thresholds and limits.\nThe net tax benefit and charges related to the special compensation awards described above are excluded from the adjusted operating income, net income, and earnings per diluted share measures (all non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 described below. See the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Results” section of this release for additional disclosures and reconciliations regarding non-GAAP measures.\nConsolidated Results\nFourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017 compared to Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2016\nConsolidated net sales increased $93.1 million, or 10%, to $1.03 billion. This increase reflects growth in all business segments and contributions from the 2017 Skip Hop and Mexico licensee acquisitions. Skip Hop, a global lifestyle brand for families with young children, and the acquired business in Mexico contributed $32.9 million and $8.8 million, respectively, to consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 favorably affected consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 by $4.5 million. On a constant currency basis (a non-GAAP measure), consolidated net sales increased 9.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased $6.4 million, or 4.6%, to $145.8 million, compared to $139.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 70 basis points to 14.2%, compared to 14.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted operating income (a non-GAAP measure) increased $25.4 million, or 17.9%, to $167.4 million, compared to $142.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted operating margin (a non-GAAP measure) increased 110 basis points to 16.3%, compared to 15.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, reflecting improved gross margin, principally due to favorable product costs and other sourcing efficiencies, and SG&A expense leverage.\nNet income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased $48.6 million, or 55.8%, to $135.7 million, or $2.84 per diluted share, compared to $87.1 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) increased $22.2 million, or 25.1%, to $111.0 million, compared to $88.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted earnings per diluted share (a non-GAAP measure) increased 29.6% to $2.32, compared to $1.79 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nFiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016\nConsolidated net sales increased $201.2 million, or 6.3%, to $3.4 billion. The net sales increase reflects growth in the Company’s U.S. Retail segment and contribution from the Skip Hop acquisition. The Skip Hop and Mexico acquisitions contributed $96.3 million and $15.4 million, respectively, to consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 favorably affected consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017 by $6.6 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales increased 6.1% in fiscal 2017.\nOperating income in fiscal 2017 decreased $7.0 million, or 1.6%, to $419.6 million, compared to $426.6 million in fiscal 2016.

Adjusted operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 13.1%, compared to 13.5% in fiscal 2016, reflecting increased investments in retail operations, marketing, and technology in addition to bad debt provisions related to wholesale customer bankruptcies, which were partially offset by favorable product costs.\nNet income in fiscal 2017 increased $44.7 million, or 17.3%, to $302.8 million, or $6.24 per diluted share, compared to $258.1 million, or $5.08 per diluted share, in fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted net income increased $18.6 million, or 7.1%, to $279.7 million, compared to $261.1 million in fiscal 2016. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 12.1%, to $5.76, compared to $5.14 in fiscal 2016.\nCash flow from operations in fiscal 2017 was $329.6 million compared to $369.2 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease primarily reflected unfavorable changes in net working capital.\nBusiness Segment Results\nAt the beginning of fiscal 2017, the Company combined its Carter’s Retail and OshKosh Retail segments into a single U.S. Retail operating segment, and its Carter’s Wholesale and OshKosh Wholesale segments into a single U.S. Wholesale operating segment, to reflect the sales-channel approach executive management now uses to evaluate business performance and manage operations in the United States. The International segment was not affected by these changes. The Company’s reportable segments are now U.S. Retail, U.S. Wholesale, and International. Prior periods have been conformed to reflect this current segment structure.\nU.S. Retail Segment\nFourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017 compared to Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2016\nU.S. Retail segment sales increased $37.8 million, or 7.2%, to $565.7 million.

This increase reflects the contributions from the Skip Hop and Mexico acquisitions and growth in Canada and China, partially offset by decreased wholesale demand in other markets outside of the U.S. The Skip Hop and Mexico acquisitions contributed $31.8 million and $15.4 million, respectively, to segment net sales in fiscal 2017.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 favorably affected International segment net sales in fiscal 2017 by $6.6 million.

As of the end of fiscal 2017, the Company operated 179 retail stores in Canada and 41 stores in Mexico.\nExpanded Return of Capital Initiatives\nAs part of the Company’s ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders, the Company’s Board of Directors on February 22, 2018 authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program and approved a 22% increase ($0.08 per share) in its quarterly cash dividend, to $0.45 per share, for payment on March 23, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 2018.\nSince 2007, the company has returned a total of $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and retired approximately 35% of its outstanding shares.\nThe share repurchase authorization announced today permits the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock up to $500 million, in addition to approximately $74 million remaining under previous authorizations. Such purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, with the level and timing of activity being at the discretion of the Company's management depending on market conditions, stock price, other investment priorities, and other factors. These share repurchase authorizations have no expiration date.\nFuture declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of related record and payment dates will be at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including the Company’s future financial performance and other considerations.\nDividends\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.37 per share totaling $17.5 million.

This forecast for first quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share reflects an anticipated effective tax rate of approximately 22%.\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company projects net sales to increase approximately 5% over fiscal 2017 and adjusted diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 15% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.76 in fiscal 2017. This forecast for fiscal 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share contemplates: 1) adjusted operating income to be approximately comparable to adjusted operating income of $445 million in fiscal 2017, which reflects a significant year-over-year increase in investments in brand marketing and improved eCommerce capabilities; and 2) an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.\nThe Company believes these non-GAAP measurements provide investors with a meaningful view of the Company’s core operating results, and are the same measurements used by the Company's executive management to assess the Company's performance.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call with investors to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results and its business outlook on February 27, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

RECONCILIATION OF U.S. GAAP AND NON-GAAP INFORMATION\n(unaudited)\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP:\nFiscal quarter ended Fiscal year ended December 30, December 31, December 30, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in millions)\nNet income $ 135.7 $ 87.1 $ 302.8 $ 258.1 Interest expense 7.7 6.7 30.0 27.0 Interest income (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.3 ) (0.6 ) Tax expense 2.1 45.3 88.3 138.0 Depreciation and amortization (a) 22.3 19.2 84.4 73.4 EBITDA $ 167.6 $ 158.3 $ 505.1 $ 496.0 Adjustments to EBITDA Revaluation of contingent consideration (b) — — (3.6 ) — Store restructuring costs (c) — — 2.7 — Special employee compensation provision (d) 21.2 — 21.2 — Direct sourcing initiative (e) — 0.2 0.3 0.7 Acquisition-related costs (f) 0.4 2.4 4.6 2.4 Adjusted EBITDA $ 189.2 $ 160.8 $ 530.3 $ 499.1 (a) Includes amortization of acquired finite-life tradenames and customer relationship intangible assets. (b) Revaluation of the contingent consideration liability associated with the Company’s acquisition of Skip Hop. (c) Net costs arising from unusual storm damage and related closures. (d) Special employee compensation provision related to significant benefit related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; includes $1.2 million in related payroll taxes. (e) Pre-tax costs associated with the Company's direct sourcing initiative, which includes severance and relocation. (f) Non-recurring costs incurred in connection with the Skip Hop and Carter's Mexico business acquisitions. Note: Results may not be additive due to rounding.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental financial measures that are not defined or prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for the items described in the footnotes (b) - (f) to the table above.\nWe present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. These measures are used by the Company's executive management to assess the Company's performance.\nThe use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA instead of net income or cash flows from operations has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent net income or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. While EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us for working capital, debt service and other purposes.\nRECONCILIATION OF U.S. GAAP AND NON-GAAP INFORMATION\n(dollars in millions)\n(unaudited)\nThe tables below reflect the calculation of constant currency for total net sales of the International segment and consolidated net sales for the fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 30, 2017:\nFiscal Quarter Ended Reported\nNet Sales\nDecember\n30, 2017\nImpact of\nForeign\nCurrency\nTranslation\nConstant-\nCurrency\nNet Sales\nDecember\n30, 2016\nReported\nNet Sales\nDecember\n31, 2016\nReported\nNet Sales\n% Change\nConstant-\nCurrency\nNet Sales\n% Change\nConsolidated net sales $ 1,027.3 $ (4.5 ) $ 1,022.8 $ 934.2 10.0 % 9.5 % International segment net sales $ 131.8 $ (4.5 ) $ 127.3 $ 109.2 20.7 % 16.6 % Fiscal Year Ended Reported\nNet Sales\nDecember\n30, 2017\nImpact of\nForeign\nCurrency\nTranslation\nConstant-\nCurrency\nNet Sales\nDecember\n31, 2016\nReported\nNet Sales\nDecember\n31, 2016\nReported\nNet Sales\n% Change\nConstant-\nCurrency\nNet Sales\n% Change\nConsolidated net sales $ 3,400.4 $ (6.6 ) $ 3,393.8 $ 3,199.2 6.3 % 6.1 % International segment net sales $ 415.5 $ (6.6 ) $ 408.9 $ 364.7 13.9 % 12.1 % The Company evaluates its net sales on both an “as reported” and a “constant currency” basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that occurred between the comparative periods. Constant currency net sales results are calculated by translating current period net sales in local currency to the U.S. dollar amount by using the currency conversion rate for the prior comparative period. The Company consistently applies this approach to net sales for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The Company believes that the presentation of net sales on a constant currency basis provides useful supplemental information regarding changes in our net sales that were not due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and such information is consistent with how the Company assesses changes in its net sales between comparative periods.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180227005758/en/\nCarter’s, Inc.\nSean McHugh, 678-791-7615\nVice President & Treasurer\nSource: Carter’s, Inc.",
