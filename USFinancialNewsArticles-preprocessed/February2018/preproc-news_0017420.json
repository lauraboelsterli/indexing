    "text": "Third Quarter Summary\nNet sales of $130.6 million increased 11.5 percent over prior year, reflecting the contribution from acquisitions partially offset by lower sales in the base business Net income of $6.0 million; adjusted EBITDA of $19.5 million Cash used for operating activities during first nine months improved by $15.2 million compared to prior year, primarily due to reduced working capital investment Company revises fiscal 2018 outlook for net sales, net income and adjusted EBITDA\nPLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CSS Industries, Inc. (NYSE: CSS), a leading consumer products company serving the seasonal, celebrations and craft markets, today announced results for its fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNet sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $130.6 million compared to $117.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, driven by higher craft sales, partially offset by lower seasonal sales. Sales attributable to The McCall Pattern Company business (“McCall”), which was acquired in December 2016, were $7.0 million in the quarter compared to $1.1 million in the prior year quarter. Sales attributable to the Simplicity Creative Group business (“Simplicity”), which was acquired in November 2017, were $14.9 million.\nGross profit was $37.5 million in the quarter compared to $37.0 million in the prior year quarter and gross margin was 28.7 percent compared to 31.6 percent in the prior year quarter. The lower gross margin was primarily attributable to the step-up of McCall and Simplicity inventory to fair value (net sales price less selling costs) at the time of the respective acquisitions and the corresponding sale of that inventory at little to no gross margin.\nAdjusted gross profit was $42.7 million for the quarter compared to $37.4 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 32.7 percent in the quarter compared to 31.9 percent in the prior year quarter, driven primarily by a higher margin sales mix attributable to McCall and Simplicity.\nOperating income was $8.3 million in the quarter compared to $14.5 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating income was $16.6 million compared to $16.4 million in the prior year quarter. Selling, general & administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $29.1 million in the quarter compared to $22.5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was attributable to the acquisitions of McCall and Simplicity (inclusive of $2.6 million of Simplicity transaction costs), partially offset by lower expenses in the Company’s legacy business.\nThe net income for the quarter was $6.0 million compared to $30.0 million in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter was favorably impacted by a $19.7 million bargain purchase gain related the acquisition of McCall. Adjusted net income was $14.0 million in the current year quarter compared to $11.5 million in the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $19.5 million for the quarter compared to $18.5 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.65 compared to $3.29 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS were $1.52 compared to $1.26 in the prior year quarter.\n“The retail environment remains challenging, but the acquisitions of McCall and Simplicity drove our sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Christopher J. Munyan. “Our seasonal and craft ribbon businesses continue to be impacted by weaker customer demand and conservative inventory management by retailers. We are actively working to reverse our declining base business sales by increasing our focus on product innovation and on new placements with our customers. The integration of the two acquisitions is going well, and we expect accelerating synergies to begin over the next few quarters.”\nThe following is a summary of net sales by product category (dollars in thousands):\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change Seasonal $ 60,217 $ 66,234 (9.1 )% Celebrations 33,997 33,389 1.8 % Craft 36,428 17,530 107.8 % Total $ 130,642 $ 117,153 11.5 % Seasonal\nThe Company defines the seasonal product category as products sold to mass-market retailers for holidays and seasonal events including Christmas, Valentine’s Day, Easter and back-to-school. Sales and production forecasts for these products are known well in advance of shipment. The seasonal nature of this business has historically resulted in lower sales levels in the first and fourth quarters, and higher sales levels in the second and third quarters.\nSeasonal net sales declined 9.1 percent in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower sales of Christmas and Valentine’s Day products. Lower sales of Christmas tags, bags and wrap were partially offset by higher sales of Christmas cards, gift card holders, and ribbon & bows. The lower Valentine’s Day sales were attributable to weaker customer demand and the timing of shipments to a major customer.\nCelebrations\nThe Company defines the celebrations product category as products primarily designed to celebrate certain life events or special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, or the birth of a child, as well as stickers, memory books and stationery. These products are primarily sold into mass and specialty retailers, floral and packaging wholesalers and distributors. Products in this category are generally ordered on a replenishment basis throughout the year.\nCelebrations net sales were essentially flat in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting increased sales of everyday boxed greeting cards partially offset by lower sales of packaging and wholesale products.\nCraft\nThe craft product category reflects products used for craft activities including ribbons, trims, buttons, sewing patterns, knitting needles, needle arts and kids crafts. These products are sold to mass market and specialty retailers on a replenishment basis.\nCraft net sales increased 107.8 percent in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the contributions of the Simplicity and McCall acquisitions. Excluding sales from Simplicity and McCall, net sales declined 12 percent, due primarily to lower replenishment sales with a major customer.\nIncome Tax Items\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.5 percent compared to 12.4 percent for the prior year quarter. The increase in income tax rate was primarily attributable to the $19.7 million nontaxable bargain purchase gain from the McCall acquisition in the prior year quarter, which lowered the prior year effective tax rate. Current year income tax expense was impacted by the adoption of new U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $0.2 million. The net benefit consisted of a $3.1 million benefit from recalculating deferred tax liabilities under the new U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21%, mostly offset by $2.7 million of tax expense related to the mandatory repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The tax cash expenses related to repatriation will be paid over a period of eight years.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nThe Company ended the quarter with $30.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $30.1 million in the prior year quarter. Inventory increased to $110.8 million from $106.5 million in the prior year quarter, attributable to the Simplicity acquisition. Excluding acquisitions in both periods, inventory levels declined $9.9 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the Company’s efforts to better manage working capital. Accounts receivable were $120.6 million compared to $106.5 million in the prior year quarter, largely due to the Simplicity acquisition. Accounts payable increased to $27.6 million from $18.5 million in the prior year quarter, resulting from the Simplicity acquisition as well as efforts to extend vendor payment terms. The Company ended the quarter with $48.4 million in short term debt related to the financing of the Simplicity acquisition.\nCash used for operating activities was $10.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to $25.6 million in the prior year nine months, primarily due to reduced working capital. Cash from operating activities year to date included $4.3 million of acquisition and integration-related cash costs compared to $1.5 million in the prior year nine-month period. Year to date capital expenditures were $4.0 million, consistent with the prior year period. The Company returned $5.5 million to shareholders through cash dividends year to date, also consistent with the prior year period. For the full year, the Company expects continued year over year improvement in cash from operating activities.\nOutlook\nThe Company is adjusting its outlook for fiscal 2018 full year net sales, net income and adjusted EBITDA to reflect continued softness in its base business, primarily in the craft ribbon business. Net sales are now expected to be in the range of $356 million to $362 million, an increase of 10 percent to 12 percent over the prior fiscal year. The primary drivers of growth will be the full year impact of the McCall acquisition and the partial year impact of the Simplicity acquisition. Excluding these acquisitions, sales are expected to be down 5 to 7 percent compared to the prior year.\nThe Company expects to generate a full year net loss of $9.1 million to $11.3 million, compared to net income of $28.5 million in the prior year. The large reduction in reported net income compared to fiscal 2017 will be largely attributable to bargain purchase gains of $20.0 million recorded in fiscal 2017, primarily resulting from the step-up to fair value (estimated net sales price less selling costs), of inventory acquired as part of the McCall acquisition, and the corresponding sale of that inventory throughout fiscal 2018 at little to no gross margin. In addition, the Company’s fiscal 2018 net income will be adversely impacted by the step-up to fair value of inventory acquired as part of the Simplicity acquisition, and Simplicity transaction and integration costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 is now expected to be in the range of $23 million to $26 million, compared to $25.1 million in fiscal 2017. The expected incremental adjusted EBITDA attributable to McCall and Simplicity are expected to be mostly offset by lower sales and manufacturing volumes, and an unfavorable sales mix, in the Company’s other businesses.\n“The underlying demand in our legacy businesses has been challenging this year, but we expect our sales to stabilize quarter over quarter in the fourth quarter,” said Mr. Munyan. “We continue to implement cost reduction initiatives in our legacy business, and to evaluate additional inventory reductions and accelerating acquisition synergies wherever possible. Looking ahead, we believe that our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, along with a lower corporate tax rate, will allow us to continue to execute our strategy of growing our business through targeted acquisition opportunities.”\nThe Company will hold a conference call for investors on February 8, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.
