Luke Maye made one free throw at the 1:50 mark before Miami’s Anthony Lawrence II extended the lead with two foul shots 15 seconds later.\nBerry answered on a drive, but Newton scored on a runner.\nNorth Carolina’s Cameron Johnson missed the last foul shot after hitting two, leaving Miami ahead 84-83 with 38.1 seconds to play.\nNewton sank two foul shots with 24.8 seconds to go. With 11.4 seconds left, Berry hit two free throws.\nNewton hit both ends of a 1-and-1 with 9.2 ticks remaining before Berry’s 3-pointer with 4.1 to play tied it.\nChris Lykes led Miami with 18 points, and Newton had 15. Dewan Huell (14 points), Lonnie Walker IV (13), Ebuka Izundu (12) and DJ Vasiljevic (10) also scored in double figures for Miami (21-8, 10-7 Atlantic Coast Conference).

Maye finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds, and Pinson added 12 points and 11 assists for North Carolina (22-8, 11-6).\nThe Tar Heels wrap up their regular-season schedule Saturday night at No. 5 Duke. North Carolina can claim the ACC tournament’s No. 2 seed by beating the Blue Devils.\nThe Hurricanes held a 44-36 halftime lead, shooting 56 percent from the field.\nMiami padded the lead to 50-36 just 65 seconds into the second half as Berry picked up his third foul.\nThe Hurricanes’ 16-point edge was cut in half with about 15 minutes to play.\nIn the first half, Miami used an 18-3 run to grab a 28-21 lead\nMaye joined four seniors, including walk-ons Kane Ma and Aaron Rohlman, in the North Carolina starting lineup,\nThis was the only scheduled meetings between the teams.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
