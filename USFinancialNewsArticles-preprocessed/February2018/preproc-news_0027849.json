A few highlights include: U.S. Higher Education and K-12 Schools – Within the U.S. higher education market, Canvas was selected by the University of Wisconsin System for their more than 120,000 students across 26 campuses. With the addition of Florida A&M and Florida International University this quarter, all students in the State University System of Florida will use Canvas as their LMS. Central Bucks School District, the third largest school district in Pennsylvania, also chose Canvas to serve their K-12 students. International – Canvas was chosen by the University of Sussex for their 18,000 learners and France's INSEAD, one of the world's leading and largest graduate business schools, selected Canvas for their global students, faculty and executives participating in their executive education programs. Additionally, SUNET, the organization responsible for Sweden's University Computer Network, selected Canvas as a preferred supplier for their member schools. Already, 12 universities in Sweden, representing almost 80,000 students, have signed up for Canvas. Corporate – Bridge was selected by Scripps Networks Interactive, Vivint Smart Home, and a large California-based aerospace company. Additionally, Instructure entered into a partnership with Paychex, which allows Paychex to offer Bridge Learn to their more than half a million customers, representing about 6 million users nationwide.\nBusiness Outlook\nToday, Instructure issued financial guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018. The financial guidance discussed below is on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue, and excludes stock-based compensation expense, reversal of payroll tax expense on secondary stock purchase transactions, amortization of acquisition related intangibles, the change in fair value of the warrant liability, and the deferred income tax benefit (see tables below that reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP measures). On January 1, 2018, Instructure adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" using the full retrospective transition method. The 2018 guidance below includes the expected impact of the adoption of the new accounting standard (see tables below that disclose the 2017 quarterly results as if reported under ASC 606).\nFor the first quarter ending March 31, 2018, Instructure expects revenue of approximately $46.8 million to $47.4 million, a non-GAAP net loss of ($7.4) million to ($6.8) million, and non-GAAP net loss per common share of ($0.24) to ($0.22).\nFor the full year ending December 31, 2018, Instructure expects revenue of approximately $203.5 million to $209.5 million, a non-GAAP net loss of ($32.3) million to ($30.3) million, and non-GAAP net loss per common share of ($1.03) to ($0.97).\nConference Call Details:\nInstructure will discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results today, February 12, 2018, via teleconference at 3:00 p.m. Mountain Time / 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The call may be accessed at (877) 681-3372, or outside the U.S. at (719) 325-2249, conference ID 9922149.\nThe live webcast of the call can be accessed at the Instructure Investor Relations website at ir.instructure.com . A replay of the call will be available at the same web address approximately two hours following the conclusion of the live event. You may register for the live webcast at bit.ly/INST_Q42017EarningsCall .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this press release and related conference call, Instructure's non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and 12-month billings are not presented in accordance with GAAP and are not intended to be used in lieu of GAAP presentations of results of operations.\nManagement presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it considers them to be important supplemental measures of performance. Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including analysis of the company's performance against prior periods, the preparation of operating budgets and to determine appropriate levels of operating and capital investments. Management also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company's financial and operational performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We intend to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics.\nNon-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation, payroll taxes related to secondary stock purchase transactions or the reversal of such expense due to the retirement of the liability, amortization of acquisition related intangibles, the change in fair value of the warrant liability, and the deferred income tax benefit. We believe investors may want to exclude the effects of these items in order to compare our financial performance between time periods:\nStock-based compensation - Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business. Unlike cash compensation, the value of equity awards is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility and forfeiture rates that are beyond our control. Reversal of estimated accruals related to payroll taxes on secondary stock purchase transactions – Prior to our IPO, operating expenses included employer payroll tax-related items on employee sales of securities to investors. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on these transactions was dependent on the fair market value of our stock. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, operating expenses included the reversal of such payroll tax expense due to the reduction of the estimated liability, which will continue to occur in the second quarter of each year. Amortization of acquisition related intangibles - Expense for the amortization of acquisition related intangibles is a non-cash item, and we believe that the exclusion of this expense provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods. Change in fair value of the warrant liability - Under GAAP, we are required to record mark-to-market adjustments for the change in fair value of the liability for warrants issued in connection with term debt and our credit facility. This expense or gain is excluded from management's assessment of our operating performance because management believes that these non-cash items are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Deferred income tax benefit - The deferred income tax benefit is a non-cash item created by the difference in the carrying amount and tax basis of the assets and liabilities acquired. This taxable temporary difference resulted in the recognition of a $0.6 million deferred tax liability which was recorded as an adjustment to goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The creation of the deferred tax liability represents a source of future taxable income which supports the realization of a portion of the income tax benefit associated with historical net operating losses. The deferred income tax benefit is a non-cash item that is unique to the business combination, and we believe the exclusion of this deferred tax benefit provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and our peer companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains, and statements made during the above referenced conference call will contain, \"forward-looking\" statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the company's financial guidance for the first quarter of 2018 and for the full year ending December 31, 2018, the company's growth, customer demand and application adoption, the company's research and development efforts and future application releases, and the company's expectations regarding future revenue, expenses, cash flows and net income or loss.
