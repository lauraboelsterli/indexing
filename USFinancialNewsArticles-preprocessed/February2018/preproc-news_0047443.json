    "text": "Ryan Miller and John Gibson combined to stop 33 shots as the Anaheim Ducks handed the Western Conference-leading Vegas Golden Knights a rare home loss, 2-0, on Monday night at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\nMiller, taking over at the start of the third period for the injured John Gibson, finished with 20 saves. Gibson stopped 13 shots but went down with what was called a lower-body injury after banging skates behind the net with Reilly Smith at the end of the second period.\nBoth Anaheim goalies were helped by a defense that finished with 25 blocks.\nJakob Silfverberg and Josh Manson scored goals and Rickard Rakell had two assists for the Ducks, who tied their season high with a three-game win streak. Anaheim (71 points) also moved past both the Calgary Flames and Los Angeles Kings, who each have 69 points, into third place in the Pacific Division.\nMarc-Andre Fleury made 18 saves for Vegas, which had a three-game win streak snapped and was shut out for the third time this season. The Golden Knights, who lead the NHL with 82 points, lost for just the fifth time at home this season (22-5-2) and only the second time to a Pacific Division rival. Vegas dropped to 14-2-1 against the Pacific Division.\nSilfverberg ended a nine-game drought without a goal at 13:32 of the first period. He deflected Andrew Cogliano’s shot from the high slot past Fleury’s left pad for his 13th of the season.\nAnaheim appeared to make it 2-0 late in the second period when Ryan Getzlaf beat Fleury with a wrist shot. However, the goal was overturned after Vegas successfully challenged that Rakell was offside on the play.\nManson upped the Ducks’ lead to 2-0 at 7:01 of the third period with his fourth goal of the season when a shot by Getzlaf caromed off Vegas winger David Perron and then Manson in front of the net and past Fleury.\nThe Golden Knights’ best scoring chances came when Jonathan Marchessault hit the crossbar with 5:11 remaining and Tomas Hyka, making his NHL debut, was stopped point blank by Miller with 2:29 left.\nVegas played without left winger James Neal, who is second on the team in goals with 24, and defenseman Shea Theodore (18 points), both of whom were scratched because of illness.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
