    "text": "MILWAUKEE, Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Northwestern Mutual announced today that its 2017 results show another year of strong financial performance. The results were bolstered on the client side by consistently growing demand for holistic insurance and investment solutions, and on the corporate front by a diversified investment approach coupled with disciplined expense management.\n\"Our results make clear how we are able to do three key things: pay the benefits we promise to policyowners and their beneficiaries, provide the opportunity to share in a dividend payout that today leads the industry, and remain a company with exceptional financial strength,\" said Chairman and CEO John Schlifske. \"We also continue to invest in a distinctive client experience that will help more people achieve financial security.\"\nAt year-end 2017, the company's results included:\nTotal surplus (including the asset valuation reserve) finished the year at an all-time high of $25.2 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion. The result is even with a one-time $1.2 billion reduction in surplus related to net deferred tax assets due to the recent enactment of tax reform and a lower corporate federal income tax rate. The company expects the tax law changes to be a long-term positive that will benefit earnings beginning in 2018. The highest ever new life insurance premium at $886 million, alongside total premium revenue of $17.9 billion for insurance and annuity products. A record $125.1 billion of client assets under management for investment products and services – up 25 percent from 2016. Growth of the general account investment portfolio to $225.5 billion, an increase of $11.9 billion since year-end 2016. Low life insurance unit costs, a reflection of continued, disciplined expense management.\nThe company expects to pay a total dividend of $5.3 billion to policyowners in 2018, one of the highest payouts in the company's history. 1 It also maintained the highest financial strength ratings awarded to any U.S. life insurer by all four of the major rating agencies. 2\nOther notable 2017 business results included:\nTotal revenue, $28.1 billion, and total assets, $265.0 billion. $10.3 billion in benefits paid to policyowners and their beneficiaries. Approximately 85 percent of dividends paid to traditional permanent life insurance along with expected dividends on individual disability insurance ($377 million) and annuities ($67 million). For more information, see the company's 2018 Dividend Announcement .\nSchlifske noted that Northwestern Mutual is transforming to close a perceptible gap between what consumers need and what they're now getting from most of the financial industry.\n\"We are creating a seamless experience guided by a trusted advisor and powered by an innovative digital platform,\" he said. \"This combination will help more people achieve the financial security they need and deserve.\"\nAbout Northwestern Mutual\nNorthwestern Mutual has been helping families and businesses achieve financial security for more than 160 years.
