    "text": "FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ichor Holdings, Ltd. (NASDAQ: ICHR), a leader in the design, engineering, and manufacturing of critical fluid and gas delivery subsystems for semiconductor capital equipment, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 29, 2017.\nHighlights for the fourth quarter of 2017:\nRecord revenue of $183 million Net earnings of $0.54 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and a new quarterly record of $0.70 per diluted share on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, up 13% quarter-over-quarter and up 43% from the fourth quarter of 2016 Completed the acquisition of Talon Innovations in December, which contributed approximately $4 million in revenue during the quarter\nHighlights for fiscal year 2017:\nRecord revenue of $656 million, up 62% from 2016 Net earnings of $1.99 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and a new annual record of $2.48 per diluted share on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, an increase of 89% from the prior year Successful acquisitions of Cal-Weld and Talon Innovations\n“I am pleased to report a strong fourth quarter for Ichor, and full-year results that reflect all of the key financial and operational objectives set forth during our IPO,” commented Tom Rohrs, Chairman and CEO of Ichor. “Consistent with our objective to outperform industry spending and grow earnings faster than revenues, we delivered 62% revenue growth, or about 50% growth organically, and more than doubled our net income from 2016 levels. We also executed well against our strategic growth initiatives to expand our customer base, expand our served markets, and expand our product offerings, all of which we expect will contribute to continued revenue growth and industry outperformance, with expanding profitability, for Ichor as we look forward. We are off to a strong start in 2018, with a significantly higher base of revenues versus this time one year ago, which is supported by the increased capacity we’ve added over the last year. We look forward to another record revenue year, with expanding gross and operating margins, as we integrate our complementary and accretive acquisitions and continue to gain traction with new products and a broadening customer base.”\nChange Change Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 Q4 2017 vs. Q3 2017\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\n2017 2016 2017 vs. 2016\n(in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages) U.S. GAAP Financial Results: Net sales $ 182,936 $ 164,519 $ 131,408 + 11% + 39% $ 655,892 $ 405,747 + 62% Gross profit percent 16.8 % 14.7 % 16.3 % + 210 bps + 50 bps 15.6 % 16.1 % - 50 bps Operating margin percent 7.8 % 5.2 % 7.3 % + 260 bps + 50 bps 7.3 % 5.9 % + 140 bps Net income from continuing operations $ 14,398 $ 14,298 $ 7,991 + 1% + 80% $ 52,118 $ 20,779 + 151% Diluted EPS $ 0.54 $ 0.54 $ 0.39 n/c n/m (1) $ 1.99 $ 0.87 n/m (1) Change Change Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 Q4 2017 vs. Q3 2017\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\n2017 2016 2017 vs. 2016\n(in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages) Non-GAAP Financial Results: Net sales $ 182,936 $ 164,519 $ 131,408 + 11% + 39% $ 655,892 $ 405,747 + 62% Gross profit percent 17.1 % 16.6 % 16.3 % + 50 bps + 80 bps 16.4 % 16.1 % + 30 bps Operating margin percent 11.2 % 10.6 % 10.3 % + 60 bps + 90 bps 10.7 % 9.1 % + 160 bps Adjusted net income from continuing operations $ 18,640 $ 16,325 $ 11,839 + 14% + 57% $ 65,060 $ 31,596 + 106% Diluted EPS (2) $ 0.70 $ 0.62 $ 0.49 + 13% + 43% $ 2.48 $ 1.31 + 89% (1) Comparing diluted EPS in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 is not meaningful, as during 2016 (through our December 2016 initial public offering (“IPO”)), EPS was calculated using the two-class method, required for participating securities. See the table, Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders, attached to the end of this press release.\n(2) For the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016, assumes the shares sold, the conversion of preferred shares into ordinary shares, and vesting of restricted shares and options in connection with our December 2016 IPO occurred at the beginning of the period, for comparability between periods. No adjustment to GAAP diluted ordinary shares was necessary for the fourth quarter, third quarter, or fiscal year 2017. U.S. GAAP Financial Results Overview\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue was $182.9 million, net income from continuing operations was $14.4 million, and net income from continuing operations attributable to ordinary shareholders per diluted share (“diluted EPS”) was $0.54. This compares to revenue of $164.5 million and $131.4 million, net income from continuing operations of $14.3 million and $8.0 million, and diluted EPS of $0.54 and $0.39, for the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nFor fiscal year 2017, revenue was $655.9 million, net income from continuing operations was $52.1 million, and diluted EPS was $1.99. This compares to revenue of $405.7 million, net income from continuing operations of $20.8 million, and diluted EPS of $0.87, for fiscal year 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Results Overview\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations was $18.6 million and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS was $0.70. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations of $16.3 million and $11.8 million, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS of $0.62 and $0.49, for the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nFor fiscal year 2017, non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations was $65.1 million and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS was $2.48. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations of $31.6 million, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS of $1.31, for fiscal year 2016.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Outlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Ichor expects revenue to be in the range of $240 to $250 million. Ichor expects GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.76 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of and $0.90 to $0.97. These guidance ranges are inclusive of Ichor’s previously announced acquisition of Talon Innovations.\nThis outlook for non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS excludes known charges related to amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, tax adjustments related to these non-GAAP adjustments, and non-recurring charges known at the time of providing this outlook. This outlook for non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS excludes any items that are unknown at this time, such as additional charges from purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisition of Talon Innovations, non-recurring tax-related items, or other unusual items which we are not able to predict without unreasonable efforts due to their inherent uncertainty.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Results\nDuring the fourth quarter, total cash increased by $26.3 million, reflecting new debt financing of $120.0 million and free cash flow of $36.1 million, partially offset by cash payments, net of cash acquired, related to our acquisition of Talon Innovations of approximately $130 million.\nAt December 29, 2017, Ichor had cash and restricted cash of $69.2 million, compared to cash and restricted cash of $52.6 million at December 30, 2016. The net increase in cash was primarily due to $164.6 million of net cash provided by financing activities, including proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in January 2017 in connection with our IPO, proceeds from the exercise of stock options by certain employees and board members of the Company, and proceeds from increased borrowings under our term loan facility and revolving credit facility; and $38.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities; partially offset by $186.8 million of net cash used by investing activities, including our acquisitions of Cal-Weld and Talon Innovations for $181.0 million and capital expenditures of $8.2 million. Our operating cash flows of $38.7 million for the year ended December 29, 2017 was due to net income of $51.4 million and net non-cash charges of $7.1 million, partially offset by a net increase of $19.8 million in our net operating assets and liabilities.\nIchor is still in the process of evaluating the impacts of purchase accounting in connection with our acquisition of Talon Innovations. As a result, total purchase consideration (net of cash acquired) in excess of net assets acquired is reported in other noncurrent assets on the Company’s December 29, 2017 balance sheet included in this press release. After purchase accounting valuations are completed, Ichor expects certain balance sheet accounts to change to reflect the fair value of Talon Innovations’ opening balance sheet accounts, including inventory, intangible assets, and goodwill.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Results\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS. These non-GAAP metrics excluded amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, tax adjustments related to those non-GAAP adjustments, tax benefits from acquisitions, and non-recurring charges, to the extent they are present in gross profit, operating margin, and net income from continuing operations. A table showing these metrics on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, with reconciliation footnotes thereto, is included at the end of this press release.\nNon-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS is defined as non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations divided by adjusted diluted ordinary shares, which assumes the IPO shares sold, the conversion of preferred shares into ordinary shares, and vesting of restricted shares and options in connection with the IPO occurred at the beginning of the period. No adjustment to GAAP diluted ordinary shares was necessary for the fourth quarter, third quarter, or fiscal year 2017.\nManagement uses non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS to evaluate Ichor’s operating and financial results. Ichor believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors’ ability to view Ichor’s results from management’s perspective. A table presenting the reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations to U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations is also included at the end of this press release.\nConference Call\nIchor will conduct a conference call to discuss its fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and business outlook on February 7, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time.\nTo listen to the conference call via the Internet, please visit the investor relations section of Ichor's Web site at ir.ichorsystems.com .

(3) In the third quarter of 2017 the Company re-characterized intercompany debt to equity between its U.S. and Singapore entities resulting in a tax benefit of $1.6 million related to the reversal of previously accrued withholding taxes. (4) This adjustment represents the impact of U.S. corporate tax reform, including revaluing the Company’s deferred tax assets from 35% to 21%. (5) During the second quarter of 2017, we corrected an error related to translating the inventory balances at our Malaysia and Singapore subsidiaries at an incorrect foreign currency rate. The error arose in prior period financial statements beginning in periods prior to 2014 and through 2016. The correction resulted in a $1.75 million increase in cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross profit in our consolidated statement of operations and a decrease to inventories in our consolidated balance sheet during the second quarter of 2017. (6) As part of our purchase price allocation for our acquisition of Cal-Weld, we recorded inventory at fair value. We recorded a fair value step-up to inventory of $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 in connection with our acquisition of Cal-Weld. This amount was released to cost of sales as inventory was sold during the respective quarter. (7) During the third quarter of 2017, we received a final arbitration ruling on our working capital claim with the sellers of Ajax. The ruling was outside the one year measurement period and therefore could not be considered an adjustment to goodwill, resulting in a charge to selling, general, and administrative expense. (8) For the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016, assumes the shares sold, the conversion of preferred shares into ordinary shares, and vesting of restricted shares and options in connection with our December 2016 IPO occurred at the beginning of the period, for comparability between periods. No adjustment to GAAP diluted ordinary shares was necessary for the fourth quarter, third quarter, or fiscal year 2017.

The following table calculates diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to ordinary shareholders using the two class method, required for participating securities, as Ichor had two classes of stock during 2016. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, Ichor no longer uses the two class method, as there is only one class of stock outstanding subsequent to our December 2016 IPO. All preferred shares were converted into ordinary shares in connection with our December 2016 IPO.\nICHOR HOLDINGS, LTD.\nDiluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 29,\n2017\nSeptember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nNet income from continuing operations $ 14,398 $ 14,298 $ 7,991 $ 52,118 $ 20,779 Undistributed earnings attributed to preferred shareholders — — (5,721 ) — (19,060 ) Net income from continuing operations, attributable to ordinary shareholders (1) $ 14,398 $ 14,298 $ 2,270 $ 52,118 $ 1,719 Net income per diluted share from continuing operations attributable to ordinary shareholders $ 0.54 $ 0.54 $ 0.39 $ 1.99 $ 0.87 Diluted shares used to compute net income from continuing operations per share attributable to ordinary shareholders 26,656,065 26,278,147 5,870,331 26,218,424 1,967,926 (1) Under the two-class method, net income attributable to ordinary shareholders after deduction of preferred share dividends, if any, is determined by allocating undistributed earnings between the ordinary shares and the participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Basic net income per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. All participating securities are excluded from basic weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, including all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, if the effect of each class of potential shares of ordinary shares is dilutive. For purposes of calculating EPS under the two-class method, an accounting policy election has been made to treat each income statement line item (net income from continuing operations, net income from discontinued operations, and net income) as an independent calculation and only allocate earnings to participating securities for those line items for which income is reported, as the participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to participate in losses. There is therefore no allocation of losses to participating securities for those line items for which a loss is reported. Under this method, the sum of the individual EPS income statement line items will not reconcile to the total net income per share.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006177/en/\nIchor Holdings, Ltd.\nJeff Andreson, CFO 510-897-5200\nClaire McAdams, IR 530-265-9899\nIR@ichorsystems.com\nSource: Ichor Holdings, Ltd.",
