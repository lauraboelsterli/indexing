    "text": "show chapters Here are three bank stocks to buy on the dip 17 Hours Ago | 01:24 It's been a nailbiter of a week. After sell-offs on Monday and Thursday, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones gave up year-to-date gains and closed its second week in the red for the first time since mid-November.\nThe financials sector, the darling of January, was swept up in the chaos. For the week, the XLF Financials ETF tumbled 6 percent, its second week in the red. Banks are now down 7 percent for the month, on track for their worst performance since June 2016.\nThis kind of damage presents an opportunity for investors to buy the dip in banks, says Mark Tepper , president of Strategic Wealth Partners, who is bullish on the sector. Here's why.\nA more hawkish Federal Reserve ready to raise rates at a faster pace could spook equities markets. But higher rates should help increase bank earnings. Rising interest rates should expand net interest margins. Consumer confidence is close to all-time highs, which should keep consumer financing in good health. Confidence rose in January â€” it hit its highest mark since 2000 in November. The small-business optimism index is also near all-time highs, which should lead to growth in commercial and industrial loans. Tepper's favorite picks? J.P. Morgan , U.S. Bank and KeyCorp . Those three are at least 6 percent from their 52-week highs and have price-to-earnings ratios of between 12 to 13 times forward earnings, lower than the S&P 500's ratio of 16 times.\nIn short, keep calm amid the sell-off and buy the banking dip.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
