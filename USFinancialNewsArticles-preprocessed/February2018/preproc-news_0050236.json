In this role, DiSalvo will be responsible for evaluating investment opportunities and implementing the firm's strategy of investing in risk-adjusted opportunities in the U.S. and in Latin America, particularly multifamily properties in secondary and tertiary U.S. markets.\nKingbird Properties launched in fall 2017 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grupo Ferré Rangel, a 100-year-old San Juan, Puerto Rico-based family office with a diversified investment portfolio that included 3700 units in four states. DiSalvo will report to Kenneth Munkacy, Senior Managing Director, Kingbird Properties based in Boston.\n\"Vincent's strong background in discovering, evaluating and structuring multifamily deals with a focus on sustainable growth will be invaluable as Kingbird Properties expands its portfolio,\" said Munkacy. \"With Vincent on board, Kingbird Properties can move into new markets that have strong fundamentals and bring strategic value-added opportunities to our investment partners.\"\nPrior to Kingbird, DiSalvo worked in the acquisitions group at GID Investment Advisers LLC, a real estate investment and operating company with 25,000-plus units and over $14 billion in assets.
