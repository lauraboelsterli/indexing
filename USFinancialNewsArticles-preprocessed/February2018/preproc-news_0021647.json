    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 11:52 AM / in 10 hours Russia's Sistema: toy retailer Detsky Mir to sell shares in March Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMOSCOW, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Russian childrenâ€™s goods retailer Detsky Mir plans to hold a secondary share offering in March, Vladimir Yevtushenkov, chairman of its parent company Sistema, said on Friday. \nThe size of the share offering, initially planned for December 2017, will be increased to 25 percent from a planned 6.3 percent, Yevtushenkov told reporters. \nSistema last year pulled a sale of shares in Detsky Mir after its stake in the retailer was frozen by a court at the request of oil giant Rosneft. Sistema and Rosneft resolved their legal dispute in late December. (Reporting by Dasha Korsunskaya; Writing by Maria Kiselyova; Editing by Polina Ivanova)",
