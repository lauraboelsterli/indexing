    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rapier Gold Inc. (TSX-V:RPR) (“ Rapier ”) and GFG Resources Inc. (TSX‑V:GFG) (OTCQB:GFGSF) (“ GFG ”) announce today an update on the proposed transaction, pursuant to which GFG has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Rapier by way of a plan of arrangement (the “ Arrangement ”).\nFollowing securityholder approval, the Arrangement remains subject to certain conditions, including the receipt of a final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Rapier appeared before the Court with respect to the Arrangement on February 19, 2018, and one shareholder filed a Response to Petition opposing the Arrangement. The Court has reserved its judgement until February 26, 2018.\nRapier and GFG continue to believe that the Arrangement represents compelling value for all Rapier securityholders.\nAbout Rapier Gold Inc.\nRapier Gold Inc. is a Canada-based gold mining and exploration company, listed on the TSX Venture Exchange on March 8, 2013.
