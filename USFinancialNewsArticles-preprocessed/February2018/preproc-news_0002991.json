As such, all of these are non-GAAP financial measures. The net income and earnings per share measures also eliminate the effect of the one-time adjustment to tax expense attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nThe SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is operating income, net income, earnings per share or operating expenses and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. Our utilization of non-GAAP measurements is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Neither adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, total operating expenses less special item nor total operating expense less fuel and special item are GAAP measurements and our use of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline and travel industry. The reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure for the periods indicated below follow.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThree Months\nEnded December 31, Twelve Months\nEnded December 31, 2017 2017 Reconciliation of operating income excluding special item (millions) Operating income as reported (GAAP) $ 26.2 $ 227.2 Special item: Write down of MD-80 fleet 35.3 35.3 Operating income excluding special item* 61.5 262.5\nThree Months\nEnded December 31, Twelve Months\nEnded December 31, 2017 2017 Reconciliation of operating CASM, excluding special item (millions) Total operating expense (GAAP) $ 352.4 $ 1,276.6 Special item: Write down of MD-80 fleet 35.3 35.3 Total operating expense less special item* 317.1 1,241.3 System available seat miles 3,430.7 13,612.0 Cost per available seat mile (cents) as reported 10.27 9.38 Cost per available seat mile excluding special item (cents)* 9.24 9.12\nThree Months\nEnded December 31, Twelve Months\nEnded December 31, 2017 2017 Reconciliation of operating CASM, excluding fuel and special item (millions) Total operating expense (GAAP) $ 352.4 $ 1,276.6 Less aircraft fuel expense 92.9 343.3 Total operating expense less fuel* 259.5 933.3 Special item: Write down of MD-80 fleet 35.3 35.3 Total operating expense less fuel and special item* 224.2 898.0 System available seat miles 3,430.7 13,612.0 Cost per available seat mile (cents) as reported 10.27 9.38 Cost per available seat mile excluding fuel and special item (cents)* 6.54 6.60\nThree Months\nEnded December 31, Twelve Months\nEnded December 31, 2017 2017 Reconciliation of net income as adjusted for special items (millions) Net income as reported (GAAP) $ 82.5 $ 194.9 Special items: Write down of MD-80 fleet 35.3 35.3 Less benefit related to tax reform (74.1 ) (74.1 ) Net income as adjusted for special items* 43.7 156.1\nThree Months\nEnded December 31, Twelve Months\nEnded December 31, 2017 2017 Reconciliation of diluted earnings per share as adjusted for special items Net income as reported (GAAP) $ 82.5 $ 194.9 Net income as adjusted for special items (in millions)* $ 43.7 $ 156.1 Diluted shares used for computation (thousands) 15,879 16,095 Diluted earnings per share as reported (per share) (GAAP) $ 5.13 $ 11.93 Diluted earnings per share as adjusted for special items (per share)* $ 2.71 $ 9.55\n* Denotes Non-GAAP figure.\n1 Special items include a charge for the MD-80 impairment and the tax benefit due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
