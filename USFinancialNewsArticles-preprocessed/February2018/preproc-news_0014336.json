    "text": "MILPITAS, Calif., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nanometrics Incorporated (NASDAQ:NANO), a leading provider of advanced process control systems, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nRecord Financial Results. All-time record sales into the 3D-NAND market led to record quarterly revenues for the company, along with new five-year highs in quarterly gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share. The strong fourth quarter capped off a record year for Nanometrics in 2017: the fourth straight year of double-digit revenue growth and increasing gross and operating margins. Expanded Position in Integrated Metrology for 3D-NAND Applications. The company recently announced that its IMPULSE ® + integrated metrology platform has been adopted into key interconnect process control applications by multiple 3D-NAND customers. Having already been broadly deployed for 3D-NAND memory cell control, these recent wins expand Nanometrics’ position into advanced interconnect control. With this expansion, the IMPULSE+ with NanoDiffract ® software is supporting high-volume manufacturing across all key steps in 3D-NAND production at multiple customers and factories. Gross Margin Improvements Ahead of Schedule. Nanometrics reported fourth-quarter gross margins of over 56%, exceeding the high end of guidance. While there were a couple of key factors driving this outperformance that were unique to the fourth quarter, normalized margins of approximately 55% for the period indicate the company is ahead of schedule in achieving its gross margin targets at these revenue volumes. More than Half of Stock Repurchase Program Completed by Year-End. Nanometrics announced a $50 million stock repurchase program on November 15 th , and completed $27 million in repurchases before year-end, repurchasing more than 1 million shares, at an average price of $25.33 per share.\nGAAP Results Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 FY 2017 FY 2016 Revenues (Millions) $ 78.2 $ 56.7 $ 59.2 $ 258.6 $ 221.1 Gross Margin 56.2 % 54.1 % 52.1 % 52.9 % 51.6 % Operating Margin 24.5 % 13.2 % 15.2 % 16.6 % 13.2 % Net Income (Millions) $ 10.8 $ 5.8 $ 26.7 $ 30.2 $ 44.0 Earnings per Diluted Share $ 0.42 $ 0.22 $ 1.04 $ 1.17 $ 1.75 Non-GAAP Results Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 FY 2017 FY 2016 Gross Margin 56.4 % 54.4 % 52.3 % 53.1 % 52.3 % Operating Margin 25.3 % 13.9 % 15.4 % 17.3 % 13.8 % Net Income (Millions) $ 13.6 $ 5.7 $ 8.4 $ 31.8 $ 27.1 Earnings per Diluted Share $ 0.53 $ 0.22 $ 0.33 $ 1.23 $ 1.08 A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided following the financial statements that are part of this release and on the investor page of Nanometrics' website. Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, severance costs, executive search costs and certain discrete tax items.\n“I am pleased to announce strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017,” commented Dr. Pierre-Yves Lesaicherre, president and chief executive officer of Nanometrics. “As expected, the revenues delayed from the third quarter were all recognized in the fourth quarter. We experienced some modest upside in high-margin upgrade sales, and also recognized revenue on an evaluation system that had been fully depreciated, which led to gross margins exceeding our guidance, and above normalized levels at these revenue volumes. For the full year, 2017 set new records for the company, and was the fourth straight year of double-digit revenue growth and, importantly, was the fourth straight year of increasing gross and operating margins.\n“As we look to a continued positive business environment for 2018, which is expected to witness strong spending from the memory market, our first quarter is expected to be at a similar revenue level to the fourth quarter (after adjusting for the revenue delay), with positive momentum currently indicated for the second quarter. With our current visibility, we expect the first half of 2018 will be significantly stronger than the second half of 2017, as well as the year-ago period. Based on current activity with our leading customers, we also believe 2018 will be a fifth straight year of double-digit revenue growth and expanding gross and operating margins.” Dr. Lesaicherre concluded, “I am very excited to have joined the company in this period of growth and new product development, and look forward to investing in new technologies, delivering on our R&D investments, and introducing new products to drive continued growth and outperformance in the years to come.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Summary\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $78.2 million, up 38% from $56.7 million in the third quarter of 2017, and up 32% from $59.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a GAAP basis, gross margin was 56.2%, compared to 54.1% in the prior quarter and 52.1% in the year-ago period. Operating income was $19.2 million, compared to $7.5 million in the prior quarter and $9.0 million in the year-ago period. Net income was $10.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $5.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $26.7 million or $1.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter of 2016 included a favorable impact of the change of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets and severance costs, gross margin was 56.4%, compared to 54.4% in the prior quarter and 52.3% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating income was $19.8 million, compared to $7.9 million in the prior quarter and $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income, which also adjusts for certain discrete tax items, was $13.6 million or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $5.7 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $8.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Summary\nRevenues were $258.6 million, up 17% from $221.1 million in 2016. On a GAAP basis, gross margin was 52.9%, compared to 51.6% in 2016, and operating income was $42.8 million, compared to $29.1 million in 2016. Net income was $30.2 million or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to $44.0 million or $1.75 per diluted share in 2016.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets and severance costs, gross margin was 53.1% compared to 52.3% in 2016. Non-GAAP operating income, which also excludes executive search costs and severance costs in 2017, was $44.6 million, compared to $30.6 million in 2016. Non-GAAP net income, which also adjusts for certain discrete tax items was $31.8 million or $1.23 per diluted share, compared to $27.1 million or $1.08 per diluted share in 2016 which excludes the impact of the change of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $18.4 million.\nBusiness Outlook\nManagement expects first-quarter 2018 revenues in the range of $69 to $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 55%, plus or minus 1%, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Management expects first-quarter operating expenses to range between $24.5 million and $25.5 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and earnings in the range of $0.38 to $0.50 per diluted share on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The company’s EPS guidance assumes an improved tax rate of approximately 25%, compared to prior expectations of 30%, and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 25 million.\nConference Call Details\nA conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results will be held today at 4:30 p.m. EST (1:30 p.m. PST). To participate in the conference call, the dial-in numbers are (877) 374-4041 for domestic callers and (253) 237-1156 for international callers. The conference ID is 5497447. A live and recorded webcast and supplemental financial information will be made available on the investor page of the Nanometrics website at www.nanometrics.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, operating income, operating income margin, net income, net income per share, which exclude certain expenses, charges and special items, and free cash flow, were not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Management uses non-GAAP financial results, which exclude amortization of acquired intangibles assets, severance costs, executive search costs and certain discrete tax items, to evaluate the company’s ongoing performance and to enable comparison to other periods that did not include these items. The company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends, comparing performance to prior periods, and enhancing the investor’s ability to view the company’s results from management’s perspective; however, investors are cautioned that other companies may calculate these measures differently than Nanometrics does, which would limit the usefulness of these financial measures. A table presenting a reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included at the end of this press release and is available on the investor page of the Nanometrics website at www.nanometrics.com .\nAbout Nanometrics\nNanometrics is a leading provider of advanced, high-performance process control metrology and inspection systems used primarily in the fabrication of semiconductors and other solid-state devices, including sensors, optoelectronic devices, high-brightness LEDs, discretes and data storage components.
