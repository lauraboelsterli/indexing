    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 1:36 AM / Updated 20 hours ago Olympics - IOC discussing norovirus outbreak, more cases reported Peter Rutherford 2 Min Read \nPYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Olympic officials are discussing measures to combat the spread of a virus that causes vomiting and diarrhoea after 42 new cases were confirmed at the Winter Games, a Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) official said on Friday. \nAfter rising from an initial 32 norovirus cases on Tuesday to 54 on Wednesday, the figure had risen to 128 as of late Thursday, with most of those affected security personnel, the KCDC said. \nThe virus broke out ahead of Friday’s opening ceremony in Pyeongchang and led to some 1,200 security staff being quarantined. Organisers have had to call in military personnel to replace them. \nAs yet, no athletes have been confirmed to have contracted the highly contagious virus. An outbreak at last year’s World Athletics Championship in London forced competitors from several countries to miss events. \nSu Mun-gyo, a KCDC public relations official, told Reuters the International Olympic Committee (IOC) were discussing the issue. \n“The IOC is meeting right now about the Winter Olympics and countermeasures to the norovirus is one of the topic,” Su said. “We will then announce the results of the discussions and update the number of cases again.” \nHealth agencies are undertaking hygiene inspections at accommodation and restaurants, as well as making checks on drinking and tap water.
