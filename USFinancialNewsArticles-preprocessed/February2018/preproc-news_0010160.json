REUTERS/Peter Cziborra \nAIBA named Uzbek Gafur Rahimov as its new Interim President last Saturday, following the unexpected resignation of Interim President Franco Falcinelli. \nThe Olympic ruling body had also announced in December it was freezing payments to AIBA until boxing got its house in order. \nPreviously, the IOC withheld payment of more than $1 million of television rights from the Athens 2004 Olympics after a refereeing scandal at those Games. \nAIBA said in a statement that the IOC had demanded a new report on its governance by April 30th and it would comply with that. \n“This decision was made despite AIBA’s fulfilment of the IOC’s request to submit a Progress Report outlining all steps AIBA was asked to take and continues to take to improve its governance,” it added. \nThe statement said AIBA had hoped the IOC would have understood that “the processes necessary to implement even more measures require more time.” \nThe boxing body added that it had shown already a willingness to reform and would be carrying out a complete organisational review over the next six months leading to a “New Foundation Plan”. \nThe Winter Olympics runs from Feb. 9-25.
