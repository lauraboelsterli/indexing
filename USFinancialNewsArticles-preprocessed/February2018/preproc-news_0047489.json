    "text": "LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Emerging equities soared almost 1 percent on Wednesday while South Africa’s rand held steady as investors awaited Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s first budget under new President Cyril Ramaphosa.\nRisk appetite for emerging market assets was fairly robust, with MSCI’s benchmark emerging stocks index lifted by strong gains in some Asian markets, still catching up after the Lunar New Year holidays.\nHong Kong shares rose 1.8 percent to a two-week high and index heavyweight Taiwan surged 2.8 percent in its biggest one-day gain since September 2016.\nBut the main focus was on South Africa, where investors are waiting to see if Gigaba will deliver sufficient tax hikes to help plug a revenue gap.\nThe rand was steady after three days of losses, having hit three-year highs since Ramaphosa was elected leader of the ruling ANC party late last year, so the risks are for some weakening if the budget is deemed a disappointment.\nJakob Christensen, head of emerging markets research at Danske Bank, said that with government debt at 55 percent of GDP, investors would be looking for deficit reduction measures.\n“But it’s very important that the new government that will be appointed under Ramaphosa implements structural reforms to raise the growth potential,” he added. “That is as important or more important than the cost saving measures in the budget.”\nInvestors are still awaiting details of Ramaphosa’s new cabinet, with the president saying he will screen the lifestyles of future government officials. It is not yet clear if Gigaba will keep his job.\nSouth Africa’s 10-year local government bond yield was steady at a 2-1/2 year low while dollar bonds were little changed.\nIn Emerging Europe, Turkish stocks gained 1.7 percent, rebounding from Tuesday’s 2.1 percent loss.\nThe Turkish lira also firmed 0.3 percent after ending Tuesday down 1 percent when pro-Syrian government forces entered Syria’s northwestern Afrin region to help a Kurdish militia there fend off a Turkish assault.\n“If the conflict worsens and Turkey and is more active we may see further weakening from here,” said Christensen, adding that Turkey was one of the emerging economies that was more vulnerable to U.S. rate rises.\nAnother big Tuesday faller, India’s rupee, touched a fresh three-month trough before firming a touch. The rupee has lost about 1 percent so far this week on concerns over the country’s widening trade deficit and the implications of an alleged $1.8 billion fraud at Punjab National Bank.\nThe bank’s shares were up 0.6 percent but have shed nearly 28 percent in the past week.\nIn debt markets, Indonesia’s local currency bonds are to be added to the Bloomberg Barclays’ Global Aggregate Index, which covers investment grade bonds, from June 1, 2018.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond fell to 6.443 percent from 6.467 percent the previous day, while the rupiah gained as much as 0.3 percent. Index inclusion is expected to encourage further inflows from foreign investors.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1206.08 +11.55 +0.97 +4.11\nCzech Rep 1104.76 -1.38 -0.12 +2.47\nPoland 2408.56 -4.67 -0.19 -2.14\nHungary 38692.91 +25.83 +0.07 -1.74\nRomania 8304.47 -2.57 -0.03 +7.10\nGreece 837.79 -4.04 -0.48 +4.41\nRussia 1274.37 +9.69 +0.77 +10.39\nSouth Africa 51107.88 +87.42 +0.17 -2.71\nTurkey 15375.38 +1942.53 +1.71 +0.04\nChina 3199.48 +14.52 +0.46 -3.26\nIndia 33813.54 +109.95 +0.33 -0.71\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.33 25.33 +0.00 +0.79\nPoland 4.15 4.15 -0.13 +0.53\nHungary 312.04 311.73 -0.10 -0.48\nRomania 4.66 4.66 -0.00 +0.41\nSerbia 117.89 118.01 +0.10 +0.43\nRussia 56.57 56.51 -0.11 +1.92\nKazakhstan 319.43 320.11 +0.21 +4.19\nUkraine 26.99 27.05 +0.22 +4.30\nSouth Africa 11.73 11.73 -0.04 +5.35\nKenya 101.30 101.20 -0.10 +1.78\nIsrael 3.50 3.50 -0.04 -0.60\nTurkey 3.79 3.80 +0.25 +0.05\nChina 6.34 6.34 +0.00 +2.56\nIndia 64.79 64.85 +0.09 -1.48\nBrazil 3.26 3.26 -0.00 +1.74\nMexico 18.73 18.71 -0.11 +4.93\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 309 0 .01 7 88.91 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
