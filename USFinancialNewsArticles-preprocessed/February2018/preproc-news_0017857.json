    "text": "PARIS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - French oil and gas group Total will report 2017 net profits that are expected to be some 30 percent better than the $8.3 billion recorded in 2016, the company’s chief executive Patrick Pouyanne told Le Monde newspaper on Tuesday.\nTotal will report fourth quarter and full year results on Feb. 8.\nThose strong 2017 results were the result of a disciplined approach to the company’s cost base, an increase in production and high oil prices, Pouyanne said in the interview published in Tuesday’s edition of Le Monde.\nHe said Total will continue to invest in renewable energies, with a plan to increase its production of electricity from gas and other renewable energies to respond to the growing demand for electricity.\nPouyanne also said in the interview that work on its Iran South Pars gas project was progressing well despite uncertainties regarding the United States’ position over possible sanctions on Iran.\nHe said Total was consulting with French and European authorities over protecting its investments in Iran, in case there was a resumption of sanctions.\n$1 = 0.8055 euros Reporting by Bate Felix Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
