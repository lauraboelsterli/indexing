    "text": "Houston, Feb. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. (NYSE: SHLX) today announced entry into definitive agreements for two transactions for the sale of an aggregate 36,029,412 common units representing limited partner interests for total gross proceeds of approximately $980,000,000.\nShell Midstream Partners priced a public offering of 25,000,000 common units for total gross proceeds of $680,000,000 before deducting underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses. In addition, the partnership has granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,750,000 common units. The underwriter intends to offer the common units from time to time for sale in one or more transactions on the NYSE, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices, subject to receipt and acceptance by it and subject to its right to reject any order in whole or in part.\nIn addition, Shell Midstream Partners concurrently agreed to sell 11,029,412 common units to Shell Midstream LP Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, at the same price to the public as the common units sold in the public offering, in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000,000. The underwritten public offering and the private placement are expected to close on February 6, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nShell Midstream Partners expects to use the net proceeds from the public offering and the private placement to repay amounts outstanding under the partnership’s credit facilities and for general partnership purposes.\nThe common units being offered and sold in the underwritten public offering are being offered and will be sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such states. The offering is being made only by means of a prospectus and related prospectus supplement meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act.\nThe securities sold in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\nMorgan Stanley is acting as the sole book-running manager for the underwritten public offering.

These statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements. In particular, expressed or implied statements concerning future growth, future actions, closing and funding of acquisitions, future drop downs, volumes, capital requirements, conditions or events, future impact of prior acquisitions, future operating results or the ability to generate sales, income or cash flow or the amount of distributions are forward-looking statements.
