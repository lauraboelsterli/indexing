(Nasdaq:MERC) (TSX:MERC.U) today reported strong results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Operating EBITDA* in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 54% to a record $89.1 million compared to $57.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and by 39% from $64.0 million in the prior quarter of 2017. For 2017, Operating EBITDA increased by approximately 36% to $252.3 million from $185.7 million in 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, our net income was $41.7 million, or $0.64 per basic and diluted share, compared to $18.5 million, or $0.29 per basic and $0.28 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $21.1 million, or $0.33 per basic and $0.32 per diluted share, in the prior quarter of 2017. For 2017, net income was $70.5 million, or $1.09 per basic and $1.08 per diluted share, after giving effect to a loss on the early settlement of debt of $10.7 million (or $0.16 per basic and diluted share), compared to $34.9 million, or $0.54 per basic and diluted share, in 2016.\nSummary Financial Highlights\nQ4\nQ3\nQ4\nYear\nYear\n2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions, except per share amounts)\nPulp segment revenues $ 290.7 $ 272.4 $ 221.7 $ 1,071.7 $ 931.6 Wood products segment revenues 47.0 33.1 97.4 Total revenues $ 337.7 $ 305.5 $ 221.7 $ 1,169.1 $ 931.6 Pulp segment operating income $ 66.5 $ 40.6 $ 43.2 $ 169.8 $ 123.2 Wood products segment operating income 2.5 3.0 5.6 Corporate and other operating loss (2.7 ) (2.3 ) (4.2 ) (8.3 ) (9.5 ) Total operating income $ 66.3 $ 41.3 $ 39.0 $ 167.1 $ 113.7 Pulp segment depreciation and amortization $ 21.2 $ 21.1 $ 18.7 $ 80.8 $ 71.5 Wood products segment depreciation and amortization 1.5 1.4 4.1 Corporate and other depreciation and amortization 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.4 0.5 Total depreciation and amortization $ 22.8 $ 22.7 $ 18.8 $ 85.3 $ 72.0 Operating EBITDA* $ 89.1 $ 64.0 $ 57.8 $ 252.3 $ 185.7 Loss on settlement of debt (1) $ ‑ $ ‑ $ ‑ $ 10.7 $ 0.5 Provision for income taxes $ 11.6 $ 6.6 $ 5.3 $ 33.5 $ 24.5 Net income $ 41.7 $ 21.1 $ 18.5 $ 70.5 $ 34.9 Net income per common share Basic $ 0.64 $ 0.33 $ 0.29 $ 1.09 $ 0.54 Diluted $ 0.64 $ 0.32 $ 0.28 $ 1.08 $ 0.54 Common shares outstanding at period end 65.0 65.0 64.7 65.0 64.7\n(1) Redemptions of 7.0% senior notes due 2019\n*Operating EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. See page 4 of the financial tables included in this press release for a reconciliation of net income to Operating EBITDA.\nMr. David M. Gandossi, the Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"Our long-term strategy to build a platform for growth and invest in operating excellence is highlighted in our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial performance:\nwe generated record Operating EBITDA of $89.1 million in the current quarter and $252.3 million in Operating EBITDA and $70.5 million in net income in 2017;\nwhile we continued to invest in their plant, equipment and operations, our pulp mills generated near record production in the current quarter and the ramp up of the Friesau Facility is ahead of its plan. For the full year 2017, we achieved records for the production of pulp, energy and chemicals; and\nwe continued to reduce debt service costs and increase our financial flexibility through the issuance of $300 million of 5.5% senior notes due 2026 and in January 2018 the redemption of $300 million of our 7.75% senior notes due 2022.\nAt the end of 2017, list pulp prices were approximately $1,030, $890 and $1,205 per ADMT in Europe, China and North America, respectively. List prices increased in China in the second half of 2017, primarily due to steady growth in global demand. More recently, demand has tightened further as a result of a reduction in China's imports of recovered or waste paper which resulted from a major environmental policy shift announced by China in the third quarter of 2017 to reduce and phase out imports of solid waste and scraps, including those within recovered or waste paper. Although NBSK pulp prices have improved recently, there can be no assurance that they will not decline in the future.\nCurrently, the NBSK market fundamentals are generally positive and we expect demand to remain steady in the first quarter of 2018 as supply and demand fundamentals are strong and customer inventories are at low levels. At year end, world producer inventories of NBSK pulp were balanced at about 30 days' supply.\nThe new pulp production capacity that came online in 2017 has not materially impacted the market to date as a result of steady demand growth and diminishing supply and quality of recycled fiber. Our current expectations for 2018 include about one million ADMTs of new NBSK pulp capacity coming online mid-year. If current demand levels are maintained, we would not expect this new 2018 capacity increase to have a material negative impact on the market.\nMercer operates some of the largest and most modern NBSK facilities in the world and we invest in their continuous improvement. Our 2018 capital expenditure plan includes about $39 million for upgrades at the Friesau Facility focused on scanning, sorting and grading automation to increase lumber yields and grade outturn and reduce operating costs.\"\nMr. Gandossi concluded: \"I would like to thank all of our employees for their efforts and dedication which contributed to a highly successful 2017 and recognize the improvements achieved at our Celgar mill.\"\nQuarterly Dividend\nA quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share will be paid on April 4, 2018 to all shareholders of record on March 28, 2018. Future dividends will be subject to Board approval and may be adjusted as business and industry conditions warrant.\nSummary Operating Highlights\nQ4 Q3 Q4 Year Year 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Pulp Segment Pulp production ('000 ADMTs) 382.5 388.1 350.3 1,507.0 1,428.4 Pulp sales ('000 ADMTs) 367.4 383.8 345.1 1,515.1 1,428.7 Average NBSK pulp list prices in Europe ($/ADMT) (1) 997 903 810 901 803 Average NBSK pulp list prices in China ($/ADMT) (1) 863 670 595 712 599 Average NBSK pulp list prices in North America ($/ADMT) (1) 1,183 1,110 992 1,105 978 Average pulp sales realizations ($/ADMT) (2) 716 638 580 640 586 Energy production ('000 MWh) 469.8 497.5 431.8 1,888.3 1,812.6 Surplus energy sales ('000 MWh) 201.2 224.8 179.9 822.1 785.8 Average energy sales realizations ($/MWh) 102 97 93 95 91 Wood Products Segment Lumber production (million board feet) 104.2 109.6 281.3 Lumber sales (million board feet) 97.9 74.2 213.5 Average lumber sales realizations ($/Mfbm) 416 375 385 Energy production ('000 MWh) 25.2 24.5 73.7 Surplus energy sales ('000 MWh) 25.2 24.5 73.7 Average energy sales realizations ($/MWh) 123 127 120 Average Spot Currency Exchange Rates $ / € (3) 1.1778 1.1755 1.0780 1.1301 1.1072 $ / C$ (3) 0.7866 0.7984 0.7496 0.7710 0.7558\n(1) Source: RISI pricing report.\n(2) Sales realizations after customer discounts, rebates and other selling concessions.

In the current quarter, pulp revenues benefited from an approximately 23% increase in pulp sales realizations and an approximately 6% increase in sales volumes.\nCosts and expenses in the current quarter increased by approximately 49% to $271.4 million from $182.6 million in the same quarter of 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of costs and expenses from our wood products segment, the negative impact of a weaker dollar on our euro and Canadian dollar denominated costs and expenses, higher sales volumes in the current quarter and the reversal in the comparative 2016 quarter of an accrual for wastewater fees at our Stendal mill of $13.6 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased to $14.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $12.4 million in the same quarter of 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of the wood products segment.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our operating income increased by approximately 70% to $66.3 million from $39.0 million in the same quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher pulp sales realizations and sales volumes partially offset by the negative impact of a weaker dollar on our euro and Canadian dollar denominated costs and expenses and the reversal of an accrual for wastewater fees in the same quarter of 2016.\nIn December 2017, we issued $300.0 million of 5.5% 2026 senior notes and used the net proceeds along with cash on hand to redeem, on January 5, 2018, $300.0 million of our 7.75% 2022 senior notes at a price of $1,058.13 per thousand of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We will record a loss on the early redemption of the 2022 senior notes of approximately $21.5 million, or $0.33 per basic and diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018.\nInterest expense in the current quarter increased to $14.1 million from $12.9 million in the same quarter of 2016 primarily as a result of interest accruing on both the 2026 and 2022 senior notes during the requisite redemption notice period and borrowings to partially finance the acquisition of the Friesau Facility and build up its increased working capital.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, income tax expense increased to $11.6 million from $5.3 million in the same quarter of 2016 due to higher taxable income for our German mills.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, our net income increased by approximately 125% to $41.7 million, or $0.64 per basic share and diluted share, from $18.5 million, or $0.29 per basic and $0.28 per diluted share, in the same quarter of 2016. Net income in the prior quarter of 2017 was $21.1 million, or $0.33 per basic and $0.32 per diluted share.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Operating EBITDA increased by 54% to a record $89.1 million from $57.8 million in the same quarter of 2016 and by 39% from $64.0 million in the prior quarter of 2017. The increase in the current quarter from the same quarter of the prior year was primarily due to higher pulp sales realizations and sales volumes and the inclusion of our wood products segment.\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nNone of the income or loss items following operating income in our Interim Consolidated Statement of Operations are allocated to our segments, since those items are reviewed separately by management.\nPulp Segment ‑ Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\nSelected Financial Information\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 (in thousands)\nPulp revenues $ 266,835 $ 202,809 Energy and chemical revenues $ 23,852 $ 18,885 Depreciation and amortization $ 21,181 $ 18,666 Operating income $ 66,477 $ 43,234 Pulp revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by approximately 32% to $266.8 million from $202.8 million in the same quarter of 2016 due to higher sales realizations and sales volumes.\nEnergy and chemical revenues increased by approximately 26% to $23.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $18.9 million in the same quarter of 2016 due to higher sales volumes.\nPulp production increased by approximately 9% to 382,487 ADMTs in the current quarter from 350,327 ADMTs in the same quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we had three days (approximately 5,300 ADMTs) of annual maintenance downtime at our Stendal mill compared to 12 days (approximately 21,600 ADMTs) in the same period of 2016. In the current quarter, our Celgar mill had its best production quarter since 2012 in part as a result of the reliability improvements implemented earlier in 2017.\nWe estimate that annual maintenance downtime in the current quarter adversely impacted our operating income by approximately $2.6 million, comprised of approximately $1.8 million in direct out-of-pocket expenses and the balance in reduced production. Many of our competitors that report their financial results using International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") capitalize their direct costs of maintenance downtime.\nPulp sales volumes increased by approximately 6% to 367,393 ADMTs in the current quarter from 345,102 ADMTs in the same quarter of 2016 primarily due to strong production and continued steady demand in China and Europe.\nIn the current quarter of 2017, list prices for NBSK pulp in Europe and China increased from the same quarter of 2016 and the prior quarter of 2017, largely as a result of overall steady demand. Average list prices for NBSK pulp in Europe and China were approximately $997 and $863 per ADMT, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to approximately $903 and $670 per ADMT, respectively, in the prior quarter of 2017. Average list prices for NBSK pulp in Europe and China were approximately $810 and $595 per ADMT, respectively, in the same quarter of 2016.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, as part of its next five-year plan, China announced a major policy shift to enhance environmental standards and green development by sharply reducing the imports of waste/scrap materials including those within recovered or waste paper. In later 2017, China also announced goals to stop imports of unsorted paper, solid waste and scrap imports over the next two years.\nIt is too early to predict how China's new policies will evolve, be implemented and their full effect. However, a material reduction in Chinese imports of waste or unsorted paper is expected to increase virgin pulp demand in China over the medium term.\nAverage pulp sales realizations increased to $716 per ADMT in the fourth quarter of 2017, or 23%, from $580 per ADMT in the same quarter of 2016 and by approximately 12% from $638 per ADMT in the prior quarter of 2017.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the dollar was weaker against the euro and Canadian dollar which increased the cost of our euro and Canadian dollar costs and expenses and contributed to a negative foreign exchange impact on operating income of approximately $19.9 million when compared to the same quarter of the prior year.\nCosts and expenses for our pulp segment in the fourth quarter increased by approximately 26% to $224.5 million from $178.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to the negative impact of a weaker dollar on our euro and Canadian dollar denominated costs and expenses, higher sales volumes in the current quarter and the reversal of an accrual for wastewater fees of $13.6 million in the comparative quarter of 2016.\nOn average, in the current quarter overall per unit fiber costs increased by approximately 11% from the same quarter of 2016 primarily as a result of the weaker dollar on our euro and Canadian dollar denominated fiber costs. In Germany, weather-related harvesting issues, which caused a reduction in chip and pulp log availability and increased demand from pellet and board producers, also contributed to higher fiber costs. In our Celgar mill's fiber supply area, winter weather contributed to lower sawmilling activity and chip availability. In the current quarter, per unit fiber costs in Germany were generally flat compared to the prior quarter and, for our Celgar mill, they were approximately 3% higher than the prior quarter.\nUnseasonably warm winter weather conditions in Germany and British Columbia and summer wild fires in British Columbia have resulted in lower harvesting activities in our mills' fiber supply areas in the current quarter which is expected to moderately increase our per unit fiber costs in the first quarter of 2018.\nTransportation costs for our pulp segment increased by approximately 13% to $19.5 million in the current quarter from $17.3 million in the same quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher sales volumes.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, pulp segment operating income increased by approximately 54% to $66.5 million from $43.2 million in the same quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher pulp sales realizations and sales volumes partially offset by the negative impact of a weaker dollar and the reversal in the same quarter of 2016 of an accrual for wastewater fees of $13.6 million.\nWood Products Segment ‑ Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nSelected Financial Information\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 (in thousands) Lumber revenues $ 40,732 Energy revenues $ 3,111 Other wood residual revenues $ 3,156 Depreciation and amortization $ 1,507 Operating income $ 2,546 On April 12, 2017, we entered into the wood products business with the acquisition of the Friesau Facility.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, lumber revenues were $40.7 million, of which approximately 31% of sales volumes were in the U.S. market and substantially all remaining sales were in Europe. Depending on market conditions, we intend over time, to have a diverse geographic mix for our lumber sales, primarily focused on the European, U.S. and Japanese markets. European and U.S. lumber markets were generally strong and prices steady and near multi-year highs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we produced 104.2 million board feet of lumber. Lumber sales volumes were 97.9 million board feet as we completed our inventory build-up to support sales to the U.S. market, some of which sales will be realized in the first quarter of 2018.\nAverage lumber sales realizations increased by approximately 11% to $416 per Mfbm from $375 per Mfbm in the prior quarter. We expect sales realizations to be modestly lower in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of additional U.S. grading procedures which we expect to resolve by the end of the quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter, energy and other by-product revenues were approximately $6.3 million.\nOur fiber costs were approximately 80% of our lumber cash production costs. Unseasonably warm winter conditions in Germany resulted in lower harvesting activities in the current quarter and are expected to result in moderately higher fiber costs in the first quarter of 2018.\nIn the current quarter we continued to realize upon fiber synergies between the Friesau Facility and our Rosenthal pulp mill. During the current quarter, the facility shipped approximately 266,700 cubic meters of chips to Rosenthal, and Rosenthal shipped approximately 26,200 cubic meters of waste wood to Friesau. Both volumes are in line with our forecasts and have begun to lower costs at both mills.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our wood products segment operating income was $2.5 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nConsolidated – Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nTotal revenues in 2017 increased by approximately 25% to $1,169.1 million from $931.6 million in 2016 primarily due to higher pulp revenues and the inclusion of $97.4 million of revenues from our wood products segment.\nCosts and expenses in 2017 increased by approximately 23% to $1,002.1 million from $817.9 million in 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of our wood products segment and higher pulp sales volumes.\nIn 2017, operating depreciation and amortization increased to $84.9 million from $71.5 million in 2016 due to the completion of large capital projects at our pulp mills and the acquisition of the Friesau Facility.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased to $49.7 million in 2017 from $44.5 million in 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of our wood products segment.\nIn 2017, our operating income increased by approximately 47% to $167.1 million from $113.7 million in 2016 primarily due to higher pulp sales realizations.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we issued an aggregate of $250.0 million of 6.5% 2024 senior notes and utilized the proceeds primarily to acquire the Friesau Facility and redeem $227.0 million of our 7.0% 2019 senior notes at a cost, including premium, of $234.9 million and recorded a loss on such redemption of $10.7 million (being $0.16 per basic and diluted share). In December 2017, we issued $300.0 million of 5.5% 2026 senior notes and used the proceeds and cash on hand to redeem, on January 5, 2018, $300.0 million of 2022 senior notes.\nInterest expense in 2017 increased to $54.8 million from $51.6 million in 2016 primarily as interest accrued on the 2024 and 2026 senior notes issued in 2017 and the redeemed 2019 and 2022 senior notes during the requisite redemption notice periods and increased borrowings to partially finance the acquisition of the Friesau Facility and build up its working capital.\nDuring 2017, income tax expense increased to $33.5 million from $24.5 million in 2016 due to higher taxable income for our German mills.\nIn 2017, net income increased to $70.5 million, or $1.09 per basic and $1.08 per diluted share, from $34.9 million, or $0.54 per basic and diluted share, in 2016.\nIn 2017, Operating EBITDA increased by approximately 36% to $252.3 million from $185.7 million in 2016 primarily as a result of higher pulp sales realizations and, to a lesser degree, the inclusion of our wood products segment.\nPulp Segment – Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nSelected Financial Information\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 (in thousands)\nPulp revenues $ 979,645 $ 847,328 Energy and chemical revenues $ 92,070 $ 84,295 Depreciation and amortization $ 80,833 $ 71,476 Operating income $ 169,779 $ 123,213 Pulp revenues in 2017 increased by approximately 16% to $979.6 million from $847.3 million in 2016 due to higher sales realizations and sales volumes.\nEnergy and chemical revenues increased by approximately 9% to $92.1 million in 2017 compared to $84.3 million in 2016 primarily due to higher sales volumes.\nPulp production increased by approximately 6% to 1,507,019 ADMTs, being an annual production record, in 2017 from 1,428,384 ADMTs in 2016. In 2017, we had annual maintenance downtime of 35 days (approximately 48,000 ADMTs), compared to 43 days (approximately 61,400 ADMTs) in 2016.\nWe estimate that such maintenance downtime in 2017 adversely impacted our operating income by approximately $36.8 million, comprised of approximately $28.1 million in direct out-of-pocket expenses and the balance in reduced production. Many of our competitors that report their financial results using IFRS capitalize their direct costs of maintenance downtime.\nPulp sales volumes increased by approximately 6% to 1,515,084 ADMTs in 2017 compared to 1,428,672 ADMTs in 2016 primarily due to continued steady demand from both China and Europe and record production.\nIn 2017, list prices for NBSK pulp increased from 2016, largely as a result of continued steady demand. Average list prices for NBSK pulp in Europe were approximately $901 per ADMT in 2017, compared to approximately $803 per ADMT in 2016. Average list prices for NBSK pulp in China and North America were approximately $712 per ADMT and $1,105 per ADMT, respectively, in 2017, compared to approximately $599 per ADMT and $978 per ADMT, respectively, in 2016.\nAverage pulp sales realizations increased by approximately 9% to $640 per ADMT in 2017 from approximately $586 per ADMT in 2016 due to higher list prices.\nIn 2017, the dollar was 2% weaker against the euro and Canadian dollar compared to 2016 which increased the dollar cost of our euro and Canadian dollar denominated costs and expenses and contributed to a negative foreign exchange impact on operating income of approximately $28.0 million when compared to 2016.\nCosts and expenses in 2017 increased by approximately 12% to $903.3 million from $808.4 million in 2016 primarily due to higher sales volumes, the negative impact of a weaker dollar on our euro and Canadian dollar denominated costs and expenses and the reversal in 2016 of accruals for wastewater fees at our German mills of $20.8 million.\nOn average, in 2017 overall per unit fiber prices in Germany and for our Celgar mill were flat compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a balanced wood market in both Germany and the Celgar mill's fiber basket. In 2018, we currently expect our overall per unit fiber prices to modestly increase in both Europe and Canada due to increased demand.\nTransportation costs increased by approximately 12% to $76.4 million in 2017 from $68.1 million in 2016 primarily due to higher sales volumes.\nIn 2017, pulp segment operating income increased by approximately 38% to $169.8 million from $123.2 million in 2016 primarily due to higher pulp sales realizations and sales volumes, partially offset by the negative impact of a weaker dollar and the reversal in 2016 of accruals for wastewater fees.\nWood Products Segment – Year Ended December 31, 2017\nSelected Financial Information\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 (in thousands) Lumber revenues $ 82,176 Energy revenues $ 8,872 Other wood residual revenues $ 6,382 Depreciation and amortization $ 4,060 Operating income $ 5,610 In 2017, we had lumber revenues of $82.2 million, the majority of which was in the European market. European lumber markets were generally strong and prices steady and near multi-year highs.\nWe produced 281.3 million board feet of lumber. Lumber sales volumes were 213.5 million board feet as we completed our inventory build-up to support sales to the U.S. market.\nAverage lumber sales realizations in 2017 were approximately $385 per Mfbm.\nIn 2017, energy and other by-product revenues were approximately $15.3 million and we sold 73,698 MWh of electricity.\nOur fiber costs were approximately 80% of our cash production costs. The ramping up of production resulted in our purchasing large volumes of sawlogs in a short period. This resulted in our sawlog costs being marginally higher than our regional competitors.\nIn 2017 we started realizing on identified fiber synergies between the Friesau Facility and our Rosenthal pulp mill.

Management uses Operating EBITDA as a benchmark measurement of its own operating results, and as a benchmark relative to its competitors. Management considers it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because depreciation expense and non-recurring capital asset impairment charges are not an actual cash cost, and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that management considers largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of our operating facilities. In addition, we believe Operating EBITDA is commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance.\nOperating EBITDA does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income, including financing costs and the effect of derivative instruments. Operating EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or income from operations as a measure of performance, nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The following tables set forth the net income to Operating EBITDA:\nQ4\nQ3 Q4 Year\nYear 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands)\nNet income $ 41,718 $ 21,143 $ 18,489 $ 70,483 $ 34,943 Provision for income taxes 11,555 6,632 5,340 33,452 24,521 Interest expense 14,084 13,513 12,857 54,796 51,575 Loss on settlement of debt ‑ ‑ ‑ 10,696 454 Other (income) expenses (1,065 ) 1 2,359 (2,373 ) 2,250 Operating income 66,292 41,289 39,045 167,054 113,743 Add: Depreciation and amortization 22,775 22,673 18,772 85,294 71,984 Operating EBITDA $ 89,067 $ 63,962 $ 57,817 $ 252,348 $ 185,727 APPROVED BY: Jimmy S.H.
