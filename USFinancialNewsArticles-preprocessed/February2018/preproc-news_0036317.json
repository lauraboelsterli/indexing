    "text": "GRAND CAYMAN, Cayman Islands, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocean Rig UDW Inc. (NASDAQ:ORIG), (“Ocean Rig” or the “Company”), an international contractor of offshore deepwater drilling services, today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Q u a r t e r 2017 Financial Hi g hlights\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income of $79.4 million, or $0.87 basic and diluted earnings per share.\nIncluded in the fourth quarter 2017 results are:\n-- Costs of $8.4 million, or $0.09 per share, associated with the Ocean Rig Mykonos and the Leiv Eiriksson shipyard stays are included in operating expenses.\nExcluding the above items, the Company would have reported net income of $87.8 million, or $0.96 per share. The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $136.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOur fleet under contract achieved a revenue efficiency of 98.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure; please see later in this press release for reconciliation to net income.\nRecent Events\nOn January 12, 2018, Lundin Norway AS (“Lundin”) declared its sixth option to extend the existing contract of the Leiv Eiriksson , which is now expected to have firm employment secured until August 2018. Should Lundin exercise its remaining six one-well options, the rig could be employed until the second half of 2019.\nOn February 7, 2018, the drilling rig Leiv Eiriksson commenced its shipyard stay at Olen, Norway where it will undergo certain enhancements related to its contract with Lundin, its intermediate survey and upgrade its BOP to 5-rams. The Leiv Eiriksson is expected to complete its stay by the end of the first quarter.\nThe Company’s previously announced drilling contract of the Ocean Rig Poseidon with Statoil, for a one-well drilling program offshore Tanzania, has been successfully completed. The Ocean Rig Poseidon is transiting to Walvis Bay, where it will remain in “ready-to-drill” state and be actively marketed for employment. The Company’s drilling unit Ocean Rig Mykonos , which is expected to complete her current drilling contract with Petrobras during March 2018, is planned to transit to Las Palmas, where it will remain in “ready-to-drill” state, and be actively marketed for employment. During the Ocean Rig Mykonos stay in Las Palmas, the unit will be fitted with a full Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) package.\nWe are currently in discussions with Total E&P Angola Block 32 for the Ocean Rig Skyros contract to revise its commercial terms. These discussions may lead to no change to the contract, to a blend and extend arrangement, or termination according to the termination for convenience provisions of the contract.\nMr. Pankaj Khanna, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented:\n“Looking ahead, oil prices have increased substantially from the low levels seen in 2016 and 2017 approaching $70 per barrel. Consequently, the cashflow for oil companies even post payment of dividends is positive, allowing for increase in their capital expenditure budgets. Recent results from the oil companies and announcements evidence this development and we expect further FIDs on development projects coming through in the coming months leading to increased rig demand. We are already experiencing an increase in the number of rig enquiries which should result in improving rig utilization in the coming 12-18 months. This obviously does not mean that the worst is over. The bottom of the market appears to have passed but 2018 will still be a tough year with periods of idle time for our rigs that roll off contract. The management team is focused on maximizing shareholder value and taking the Company through one of the worst markets experienced in recent drilling history.”\nF i n a n c i al R e v i e w : 2017 Fourth Q u a r ter\nThe Company recorded net income of $79.4 million, or $0.87 basic and diluted earnings per share, for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a net loss of $3,724.5 million, or $416,195.78 basic and diluted loss per share (1) , for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenues decreased by $146.6 million to $211.5 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $358.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nDrilling units’ operating expenses decreased to $61.6 million (including $8.4 million of shipyard stay costs, associated with the Ocean Rig Mykonos and the Leiv Eiriksson ) and total depreciation and amortization decreased to $26.2 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, from $93.7 million and $82.3 million, respectively, for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016. Total general and administrative expenses decreased to $27.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $35.0 million during the same period in 2016.\nNo impairment charge was recognized for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared with $3,776.3 million for the corresponding period in 2016. Loss on sale of assets amounted to $0.08 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared with $25.3 million for the corresponding period in 2016. Reorganization gain, net amounted to $1.9 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, with no such gain being recorded in the corresponding period in 2016.\nInterest and finance costs, net of interest income, decreased to $8.8 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, compared to $53.5 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016.\n(1) Share and per share data for 2016 give effect to a 1-for-9,200 reverse stock split, which became effective on September 22, 2017.\nOperating Fleet\nThe table below describes our operating fleet profile as of February 19, 2018:\nTotal backlog (1) as of December 31, 2017 amounted to approximately $969 million.\nUnit Year built Redelivery Leiv Eiriksson 2001 Q3 – 2018 Ocean Rig Corcovado 2011 Q2 – 2018 Ocean Rig Poseidon 2011 N/A Ocean Rig Mykonos 2011 Q1 – 2018 Ocean Rig Skyros 2013 Q3 – 2021 Note: The units Eirik Raude , Ocean Rig Olympia , Ocean Rig Apollo , Ocean Rig Mylos, Ocean Rig Paros and Ocean Rig Athena , have completed their preservation works and are currently cold stacked in Greece, remaining available for further employment. The Ocean Rig Poseidon is en-route to Namibia, where it will remain “ready to drill”.\n(1) The contracted backlog of our fleet is adjusted for subsequent events, excludes options to extend and assumes full utilization for the full term of the drilling contract. The actual amount of revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may differ from the amounts and periods described above due to, for example, off-hire for maintenance projects, downtime, scheduled or unscheduled dry-docking, cancellation or early termination of drilling contracts, and other factors that result in lower revenues than our estimated contract backlog.\nOcean Rig UDW Inc.

Adjusted EBITDA is included herein because it is a basis upon which the Company measures its operations.
