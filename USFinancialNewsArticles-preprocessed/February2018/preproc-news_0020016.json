    "text": "MOBILE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CPSI (NASDAQ: CPSI):\nHighlights for Fourth Quarter 2017:\nRevenues of $78.1 million; 12-month backlog of $253.8 million; Quarterly bookings of $19.8 million; GAAP results inclusive of $28.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our post-acute care business; GAAP loss per diluted share of $1.57 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.63; GAAP net loss of $21.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $15.3 million; Cash provided by operations of $5.3 million; and Quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share.\nCPSI (NASDAQ: CPSI), a community healthcare solutions company, today announced results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, payable on March 9, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2018.\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $78.1 million, compared with total revenues of $64.6 million for the prior-year fourth quarter. Inclusive of a $28.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Company’s post-acute care business, net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $21.5 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Cash provided by operations for the fourth quarter was $5.3 million, compared with cash used by operations of $468,000 for the prior-year period.\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $276.9 million, compared with total revenues of $267.3 million for the prior year. Inclusive of the aforementioned non-cash goodwill impairment charge, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $17.4 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared with net income of $3.9 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash provided by operations for 2017 was $23.6 million, compared with $2.1 million for the prior year.\n“Our fourth quarter financial performance was strong from both a revenue and non-GAAP earnings perspective,” said Boyd Douglas, president and chief executive officer of CPSI.\n“Looking back over 2017, we are very proud of the continued affirmation that the value we bring to the community healthcare market is making a real difference. This past year, we launched the CPSI Rural Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program, experienced continued revenue growth with TruBridge and had record bookings performance in three of the four quarters. These bookings included a number of returning clients, and resulted in 10.5% bookings growth across our family of companies in 2017.\n“These developments have helped to steady our operations and support CPSI and our family of companies as we continue to evolve. With our eye toward the long-term health and growth of our company, we also took important steps to enhance our corporate governance structure and strategy. With the addition of three new members in the fourth quarter, we have expanded the talent, financial expertise and industry experience of our board of directors. We look forward to 2018, as we are well positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities that will help us deliver on our shared vision of creating healthier, financially stronger and more vibrant communities,” added Douglas.\nCommenting on the Company’s financial performance for the quarter, Matt Chambless, chief financial officer of CPSI, stated, “Our continued execution around the meaningful use program and consistent success with TruBridge offerings propelled the fourth quarter to all-time highs in terms of revenues. These results translated into non-GAAP EPS and Adjusted EBITDA that were their highest level since our acquisition of Healthland in January 2016. These high marks in profitability were achieved despite elevated general and administrative expenses, including increased bad debt estimates for balance sheet risk related to financing receivables and increased health claims volumes and severity While accounting rules required us to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $28.0 million related to our post-acute care business, and bookings volatility casted a bit of a shadow, we are proud of the fourth quarter’s results and excited about our trajectory as we enter 2018.\n“Looking back on the year, we were able to deliver on our commitment of revenue and non-GAAP profitability growth for 2017 and make significant, smart changes to our capital allocation strategy that will allow for greater flexibility for investment in CPSI’s future growth,” said Chambless.\nCPSI will hold a live webcast to discuss fourth quarter and year-end 2017 results today, Thursday, February 8, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.

These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in order to evaluate the operating performance of the Company and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find these non-GAAP financial measures helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors.\nAs such, to supplement the GAAP information provided, we present in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP net income, and Non-GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”).\nWe calculate each of these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA – Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP net income (loss) as reported and adjusts for: (i) deferred revenue and other adjustments arising from purchase allocation adjustments related to the Healthland acquisition; (ii) depreciation; (iii) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; (iv) stock-based compensation; (v) non-recurring expenses and transaction-related costs; (vi) goodwill impairment charges; (vii) interest expense and other, net; and (viii) the provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP net income – Non-GAAP net income consists of GAAP net income (loss) as reported and adjusts for (i) deferred revenue and other adjustments arising from purchase allocation adjustments related to the Healthland acquisition; (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; (iii) stock-based compensation; (iv) non-recurring expenses and transaction-related costs; (v) non-cash charges to interest expense and other; (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt; (vii) goodwill impairment charges; and (viii) the total tax effect of items (i) through (vii). Adjustments to Non-GAAP net income also include the after-tax effect of non-deductible transaction-related costs, the effects of recent tax reform legislation, and changes in valuation allowances for certain state NOLs acquired in the Healthland acquisition. Non-GAAP EPS – Non-GAAP EPS consists of Non-GAAP net income, as defined above, divided by weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) in the applicable period.\nCertain of the items excluded or adjusted to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures are described below:\nDeferred revenue and other adjustments - Deferred revenue and other adjustments includes acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, which reflect the fair value adjustments to deferred revenues acquired in business acquisitions. The fair value of deferred revenue represents an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin, to perform services related to the acquiree’s software and product support, which assumes a legal obligation to do so, based on the deferred revenue balances as of the acquisition date. We add back deferred revenue and other adjustments for non-GAAP financial measures because we believe the inclusion of this amount directly correlates to the underlying performance of our operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets - Acquisition-related amortization expense is a non-cash expense arising primarily from the acquisition of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions or investments. We exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets. Investors should note that the use of these intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue generation, and the related amortization expense will recur in future periods. Stock-based compensation - Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing and valuation of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future periods, and such expense will recur in future periods. Non-recurring expenses and transaction-related costs - Non-recurring expenses relate to certain severance and other charges incurred in connection with activities that are considered one-time. Transaction-related costs are the non-recurring costs related to specific acquisitions (such as the Healthland acquisition). We exclude non-recurring expenses and transaction-related costs from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods. Goodwill impairment charges – Goodwill impairment charges are non-cash expenses that are the result of annual (and, if necessary, more frequently than annual) impairment tests required by GAAP. These impairment tests are required to be on a per-reporting-unit basis, with our accounting policy elections resulting in any impairment being the result of the reporting unit carrying value exceeding the estimated fair value. We exclude these non-cash goodwill impairment charges because we believe (i) such items are largely non-recurring in nature and (ii) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Non-cash charges to interest expense and other - Non-cash charges to interest expense and other includes amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. We exclude non-cash charges to interest expense and other from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe these non-cash amounts relate to specific transactions and, as such, may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. After-tax effect of non-deductible transaction-related costs – Certain transaction costs incurred in the Healthland acquisition are non-deductible for federal income tax purposes as they are considered facilitative costs of the specific transaction. Similar to the treatment of non-recurring expenses and transaction-related costs, we exclude the after-tax effect of non-deductible transaction-related costs from non-GAAP net income because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods. Tax shortfall (excess tax benefit) from stock-based compensation – ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, became effective for the Company during the first quarter of 2017 and changes the treatment of tax shortfall and excess tax benefits arising from stock-based compensation arrangements. Prior to ASU 2016-09, these amounts were recorded as an increase (for excess benefits) or decrease (for shortfalls) to additional paid-in capital. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, these amounts are now captured in the period’s income tax expense. We exclude this component of income tax expense from non-GAAP financial measures because we believe (i) the amount of such expenses or benefits in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations; (ii) such expenses or benefits can vary significantly between periods as a result of the valuation of grants of new stock-based awards, the timing of vesting of awards, and periodic movements in the fair value of our common stock; and (iii) excluding these amounts assists in the comparability between current period results and results during periods prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Tax reform effects – The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 resulted in a one-time adjustment to deferred tax positions carried on our balance sheet to reflect the reduced federal tax rate at which these temporary items are expected to reverse, with a resulting non-recurring impact to that period’s income tax expense. We exclude tax reform’s effects on income tax expense from non-GAAP net income because we believe (i) such amounts are nonrecurring in nature and (ii) are not indicative of that period’s underlying performance or ongoing operations. Valuation allowance for state NOLs – As part of the Healthland acquisition, we acquired certain state NOLs for which a valuation allowance was established in purchase accounting related to states which do not permit consolidated returns and for which projected taxable income results in a conclusion that some of these NOLs will expire unused. We exclude the impact on our periodic income tax expense arising from changes in these valuation allowances as we believe (i) such amounts are nonrecurring in nature and (ii) are not indicative of that period’s underlying performance or ongoing operations.\nManagement considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends, in particular the extent to which ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance. In addition, management may use Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP net income and/or Non-GAAP EPS to measure the achievement of performance objectives under the Company’s stock and cash incentive programs. Note, however, that these non-GAAP financial measures are performance measures only, and they do not provide any measure of cash flow or liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures are not alternatives for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, there is no certainty that we will not incur expenses in the future that are similar to those excluded in the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release.
