    "text": "Damian Lillard scored 28 points as the Portland Trail Blazers held off a late surge by the host Los Angeles Clippers to win 104-96 Tuesday night at Staples Center.\nCJ McCollum added 16 points and Jusuf Nurkic collected 14 points and 20 rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who have won three in a row and six of their past seven outings.\nLou Williams scored 20 points off the bench for the Clippers, who lost for the fourth in six games. However, Williams was only 5 of 26 from the field, missing 16 shots in a row after a 4-of-8 start.\nThe Clippers were short-handed, having traded forward Blake Griffin to Detroit on Monday for a package that included Avery Bradley and Tobias Harris from the Pistons. None were in uniform for the Clippers on Tuesday.\nPortland saw a 20-point, third-quarter lead shrink to six points in the final three minutes, but the Blazers held on to win.\nLillard had 16 points and McCollum 10 as Portland led 56-51 at the half. Williams had 15 points for the Clippers at the break.\nThe Blazers opened the third quarter by outscoring the Clippers 24-9 to go ahead 80-60. Portland’s edge was 86-67 heading into the final period.\nThe Clippers trimmed the difference to 93-82 with 8:17 left. Danilo Gallinari’s dunk made it 100-89 with 3:43 to play. Williams scored on a drive, and Portland’s lead was 100-91 with 3:04 to go.\nWilliams sank three free throws to cut the Clippers’ deficit to 100-94 with 2:34 remaining. Nurkic’s rebound basket upped Portland’s lead to 102-94, and Al-Farouq Aminu’s dunk made it 104-94 with 2:00 left.\nGallinari dunked to trim the margin to 104-96 with 1:44 to go. Neither team scored the rest of the way.\nLillard scored 14 points to stake Portland to a 30-27 lead after one quarter.\nThe score was tied 35-35 when the Blazers went on a 7-0 run to seize a 42-35 advantage. Portland carried a five-point edge into intermission.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
