    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE: LCI) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n\"Our record revenues for the second quarter reflect strong sales across several product categories,\" said Tim Crew, Lannett's recently appointed chief executive officer. \"Our topline increased 19% from the preceding quarter and would have been even higher, but for the shorter than anticipated supply disruption for a key product by a competitor.\n\"With regard to our fiscal 2018 second quarter bottomline, our adjusted earnings substantially benefited from recently enacted U.S. tax reform. We also anticipate our future results will be positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate.\n\"Looking ahead, we recently commenced shipping an authorized generic version of Toprol-XL ® (Metoprolol Succinate) Extended Release Tablets and expect over the next several months to launch a number of products, which include previously approved, as well as recently acquired or licensed, commercially ready products. While we have revised several components of our outlook, we expect our profitability on an adjusted basis for the fiscal 2018 full year to slightly improve from our previous guidance.\"\nFor the fiscal 2018 second quarter, net sales were $184.3 million compared with $170.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit was $87.5 million, or 47% of net sales, compared with $88.1 million, or 52% of net sales. Research and development (R&D) expenses increased to $10.7 million from $9.9 million for the fiscal 2017 second quarter. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to $28.5 million from $18.1 million. Restructuring expenses were $1.0 million compared with $1.7 million. In the prior year second quarter, the company recorded an impairment charge of $23.0 million related to an acquired in-process R&D project. Operating income increased 37% to $47.1 million from $34.3 million. Interest expense declined to $20.7 million from $23.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Income tax expense was $18.1 million compared with $3.5 million in the prior-year period. Net income attributable to Lannett was $14.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared with $8.2 million, or $0.22 per share, for the fiscal 2017 second quarter.\nFor the fiscal 2018 second quarter reported on a Non-GAAP basis, adjusted net sales were $184.3 million compared with $170.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted gross profit was $96.7 million, or 52% of adjusted net sales, compared with $96.2 million, or 56% of adjusted net sales, for the prior year second quarter. Adjusted R&D expenses were $10.7 million compared with $9.9 million. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $20.9 million compared with $17.0 million. Adjusted operating income was $65.1 million compared with $69.3 million for the prior-year second quarter. Adjusted interest expense declined to $16.2 million from $17.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted income tax expense was $10.5 million compared with $17.5 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted net income attributable to Lannett was $40.6 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, compared with $34.5 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the fiscal 2017 second quarter.\nGuidance for Fiscal 2018\nBased on its current outlook, the company revised its 2018 fiscal year financial guidance from November 6, 2017. The revised guidance for net sales and profitability is higher than the guidance provided on August 23, 2017, which did not include the impact of the supply disruption for a key product mentioned above.\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP Adjusted\nNet sales\n$680 million to $700 million, down from 710 million to $720 million\n$680 million to $700 million, down from $710 million to $720 million\nGross margin %\n42% to 43%, down from 46% to 47%\n48% to 49%, down from 51% to 52%\nR&D expense\n$36 million to $38 million, down from $46 million to $48 million\n$36 million to $38 million, down from $46 million to $48 million\nSG&A expense\n$79 million to $81 million, up from $78 million to $80 million\n$71 million to $73 million, down from $77 million to $79 million\nIntegration and restructuring related expense\n$4 million to $5 million, unchanged\n$ --\nInterest expense and other\n$77 million to $78 million, down from $85 million to $86 million\n$62 million to $63 million, down from $66 million to $67 million\nEffective tax rate\nApproximately 39%, up from 35%\nApproximately 27%, down from 35%\nCapital expenditures\n$45 million to $55 million, down from $65 million to $75 million\n$45 million to $55 million, down from $65 million to $75 million\nConference Call Information and Forward-Looking Statements\nLater today, the company will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET to review its results of operations for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended December 31, 2017.

Management uses these measures internally for evaluating its operating performance. The Company's management believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information regarding operational performance, because it enhances an investor's overall understanding of the financial results for the Company's core business. Additionally, it provides a basis for the comparison of the financial results for the Company's core business between current, past and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nDetailed reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included with this release.\nNon-GAAP financial measures exclude, among others, the effects of (1) amortization of purchased intangibles and other purchase accounting entries, (2) acquisition and integration-related expenses, (3) non-cash interest expense, as well as (4) certain other items considered unusual or non-recurring in nature.\nAbout Lannett Company, Inc.:\nLannett Company, founded in 1942, develops, manufactures, packages, markets and distributes generic pharmaceutical products for a wide range of medical indications – see financial schedule below for net sales by medical indication.

Any such statements, including, but not limited to, realizing the expected increase in sales of generic Toprol-XL ® , expected benefits of a lower effective tax rate, successfully launching and commercializing recently acquired and previously approved products, and achieving the financial metrics stated in the company's guidance for fiscal 2018, whether expressed or implied, are subject to risks and uncertainties which can cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors which include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in predicting the timing or outcome of FDA or other regulatory approvals or actions, the ability to successfully commercialize products upon approval, including acquired products, and Lannett's estimated or anticipated future financial results, future inventory levels, future competition or pricing, future levels of operating expenses, product development efforts or performance, and other risk factors discussed in the company's Form 10-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.
