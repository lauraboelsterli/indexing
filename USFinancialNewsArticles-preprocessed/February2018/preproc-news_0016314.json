    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on offshore oil drilling proposal by the Trump administration (all times local):\n10:20 a.m.\nThe California Assembly has overwhelmingly passed a resolution opposing the Trump administration's push to renew oil drilling off the Pacific coast.\nThe Assembly on Thursday also asked U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to remove California from the proposed leasing plan.\nThe 55-8 vote came on the same day as the only federal hearing in California on the plan.\nAssemblywoman Monique Limón, a Santa Monica Democrat who sought the resolution, cited previous offshore spills that have tarred the state's picturesque coastline.\nRepublicans Randy Voepel of Santee and Travis Allen of Huntington Beach say oil and gas can be can safely harvested. Allen, a GOP candidate for governor, says the move could help lower gasoline prices.\n11:33 p.m.\nFishermen, environmentalists and other critics plan to protest at the California Capitol before a public hearing on federal government plans to expand offshore drilling.\nThe meeting and march in Sacramento on Thursday come as two California commissions that oversee coastal lands and water pushed the Trump administration to leave the state out of its drilling plans.\nThe California State Lands Commission and California Coastal Commission say they will use their power to block pipelines that would get the oil on to land.\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke wants to open nearly all U.S. coastlines to offshore oil and gas drilling.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Ocean Emergency Management has proposed six sales of drilling rights off the California coast and a seventh off Oregon and Washington between 2020 and 2023.",
