    "text": "NEW HAVEN, Conn., Feb. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Specialty diagnostics company Precipio, Inc. (NASDAQ:PRPO), announces preliminary, unaudited revenues for the 4 th quarter of 2017 of approximately $945,000, representing three-fold from the previous quarter of approximately $270,000, as well as a three-fold year-over-year from the 4 th quarter of 2016 revenues of approximately $316,000.\n2017 Business Integration; 2018 Sales Acceleration\nFollowing the merger with Transgenomic, Inc. in June 2017, we undertook the task of relocating Transgenomic’s laboratory operations to Precipio’s New Haven location, which was completed within 90 days, by the end of the 3 rd quarter of 2017. In early October, following a successful migration of all operations, and the training of the necessary staff, Precipio announced the re-opening of its CLIA operations in New Haven. When we resumed operations in October 2017, we were able to retain all customers and quickly refocus on business growth.\n“Now that assets have been integrated and systems optimized, we have resumed our focus on sales growth and aggressively capturing market share with our disruptive diagnostic products and services,” commented Ilan Danieli, CEO. “Our team worked around the clock to ensure resumption of services within Q3-2017, and our sales growth in Q4 reflects that hard work. We will remain completely focused on continuing this revenue growth throughout the year.”\nRevenue Composition & ICP potential\nThe majority of revenue was generated by our pathology diagnostic services and various pharma projects handled in our laboratory. Our first ICE-COLD PCR™ (ICP) kit was launched mid-way through Q4-2017, as previously announced, and we were able to quickly convert those products into new customers and revenue.\nAlthough ICP kit sales made up less than 5% of the revenue for this quarter, with our customer, product, and platform expansion, we expect ICP to drive and contribute a significantly larger share of our revenue by year end.\nPrecipio’s ICP kit, our mutation enrichment technology for liquid biopsies, leads to better cancer outcomes due to the ability to cost effectively test and monitor patients using a simple blood draw instead of an invasive tissue sample. Patients can be frequently tested and monitored for genetic mutations, which may provide an immediate and critical indication of possible treatment responses.\nAs we continue to release additional ICP panels into the market, those tests will also be available in our CLIA laboratory for direct ordering by physicians and hospitals. Many such hospitals don’t have the necessary facilities to bring those tests in-house, yet they would like to monitor their patients in a rapid, cost-effective manner to identify genetic changes that can help those physicians manage their patient’s treatment.\nThese customers will be able to now send those tests to Precipio’s CLIA laboratory for immediate and rapid testing and results, generating an additional revenue stream.\nOur multi-pronged solution enables hospitals of any size, located anywhere in the world, to either on-board these tests in-house, or use our laboratory to run tests on liquid biopsies, and provide them with this critical information.\nFurthermore, we believe that with the increased variability of platforms upon which ICP can be utilized (including Next Generation Sequencing), other segments such as pharmaceutical and clinical trial customers (such as CROs) will become substantial potential users of ICP within their business, generating additional revenue from the continuous commercialization of ICP.\nAbout Precipio\nPrecipio has built a platform designed to eradicate the problem of misdiagnosis by harnessing the intellect, expertise and technology developed within academic institutions and delivering quality diagnostic information to physicians and their patients worldwide. Through its collaborations with world-class academic institutions specializing in cancer research, diagnostics and treatment, initially the Yale School of Medicine, Precipio offers a new standard of diagnostic accuracy enabling the highest level of patient care.
