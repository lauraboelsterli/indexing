    "text": "WAYNE, Pa., Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Egalet Corporation (Nasdaq: EGLT) (\"Egalet\"), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions, today announced that its fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results will be released on Monday, March 12, 2018. Following the announcement, Egalet's management will host a live conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to review the company's financial and operating results and provide a general business update.\nInterested parties may listen to the call via a live audio webcast which may be accessed by visiting Egalet's website . Please connect to the website a few minutes prior to the live webcast to ensure adequate time for any software download that may be needed to access the webcast. Individuals also may participate in the call by dialing 1-888-346-2615 (domestic) or 1-412-902-4253 (international) and asking for the \"Egalet Earnings Call.\" The replay will be available approximately two hours after the call on the Egalet website.\nAbout Egalet\nEgalet, a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company, is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. Egalet has three approved products: ARYMO ® ER (morphine sulfate) extended-release tablets for oral use —CII, developed using Egalet's proprietary Guardian™ Technology, OXAYDO ® (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only —CII and SPRIX ® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray. Using Guardian Technology, Egalet is developing a pipeline of clinical-stage, product candidates for which we are seeking partners including Egalet-002, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral oxycodone formulation for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Guardian Technology can be applied broadly across different classes of pharmaceutical products and can be used to develop combination products that include multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients with similar or different release profiles.\nFor full prescribing information on ARYMO ER, including the boxed warning and medication guide, please visit arymoer.com . For full prescribing information on SPRIX, including the boxed warning and medication guide, please visit sprix.com .
