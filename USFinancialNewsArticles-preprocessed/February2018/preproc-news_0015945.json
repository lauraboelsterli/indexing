The company pioneered Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery, or MIGS, to revolutionize the traditional glaucoma treatment and management paradigm. Glaukos launched the iStent ® Trabecular Micro-Bypass Stent, its first MIGS device, in the United States in July 2012 and is leveraging its platform technology to build a comprehensive and proprietary portfolio of micro-scale injectable therapies designed to address the complete range of glaucoma disease states and progression. The company believes the iStent, which measures 1.0 mm long and 0.33 mm wide, is the smallest medical device ever approved by the FDA.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207005295/en/\nGlaukos Corporation\nChris Lewis, (949) 481-0510\nDirector, Investor Relations, Corporate Strategy & Development\nclewis@glaukos.com\nSource: Glaukos Corporation",
