    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Seitel, Inc., a leading provider of onshore seismic data to the oil and gas industry in North America, today reported results for the fourth quarter and\nFourth Quarter Highlights -\nTotal revenue was $21.9 million compared to $35.0 million in Q4 2016. Cash resales totaled $16.3 million compared to $28.3 million in Q4 2016. Cash flows from (used in) operating activities were $(3.9) million compared to $1.4 million in Q4 2016. Cash EBITDA was $12.2 million compared to $21.0 million in Q4 2016.\nFull Year Highlights -\nTotal revenue was $90.3 million compared to $94.5 million in 2016. Cash resales totaled $59.7 million compared to $59.4 million in 2016. Cash flows from operating activities were $40.4 million compared to $30.5 million in 2016. Cash EBITDA was $41.5 million compared to $39.4 million in 2016.\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $21.9 million, consisting of acquisition underwriting revenue of $4.6 million, resale licensing revenue of $16.8 million and solutions and other revenue of $0.5 million. This compares to total revenue of $35.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, consisting of acquisition underwriting revenue of $4.0 million, resale licensing revenue of $30.3 million and solutions and other revenue of $0.7 million. Cash resales, a component of resale licensing revenue, were $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to cash resales of $28.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $90.3 million compared to $94.5 million for the same period last year. Acquisition underwriting revenue was $22.8 million in 2017 compared to $21.5 million in 2016. New data acquisition activity in 2017 was focused in the EagleFord/Woodbine, Permian and Louisiana Cotton Valley areas in the U.S and in the Montney and Duvernay areas in Canada. Total resale licensing revenue was $65.4 million in 2017 compared to $71.0 million in 2016. Cash resales were $59.7 million compared to $59.4 million in 2016. Solutions and other revenue was $2.1 million in both 2017 and 2016.\n“Our cash resales increased modestly year over year as we saw a more consistent spending pattern quarter to quarter by E&P companies in licensing seismic data from our library in 2017,” commented Rob Monson, president and chief executive officer. “Improved fundamentals have fostered steady price growth in crude oil in the second half of 2017 and into early 2018. As a result, North America E&P capital spending is expected to increase 15% to 20% in 2018. We believe our clients will remain judicious with capital spending in 2018 with cash flows remaining the leading determinant of overall budget decisions.\n“We continued to spend our net cash capex judiciously in 2017 as we grew our library by about 2,500 square miles. We added approximately 400 square miles from new data acquisition and 2,100 square miles through purchases of existing data,” stated Monson. “We will continue to pace our level of capital spending with our cash flows and our clients’ needs as the recovery continues.”\nOur net loss was $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The change between quarters was primarily due to a decrease in total revenues, partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses and a decrease in income tax expense. Our net loss was $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net loss of $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in loss between years was primarily due to a decrease in total revenues and a decrease in income tax benefits.\nWe did not have a significant impact from the enactment of U.S. tax reform in December 2017 because we have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal net deferred tax asset. We recognized a benefit of $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to U.S. tax reform as a result of the realizability of our alternative minimum tax credit.\nCash flows from (used in) operating activities were $(3.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in cash flows between the periods was primarily due to the fact that the fourth quarter of 2017 included income tax payments whereas the fourth quarter of 2016 included over $3.5 million of tax refunds. The decrease between periods was also partially due to lower collections of acquisition underwriting revenue as a result of invoice timing. Cash flows from operating activities were $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase between periods was primarily due to 2017 including higher collections due to increased cash resale activity beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by payments made in 2017 related to 2016 annual incentive compensation (2016 included no such payments) and lower collections of acquisition underwriting revenue as a result of invoice timing. As mentioned for the fourth quarter periods, the year-to-date 2016 period also included receipt of income tax refunds whereas the 2017 period included income tax payments.\nCash EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, generally defined as cash resales and solutions revenue less cash operating expenses (excluding severance and various non-routine items), was $12.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $21.0 million in the same period last year. The decrease between periods was primarily the result of lower cash resales, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. Cash EBITDA was $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase between years was primarily the result of lower SG&A expenses.\nSG&A expenses were $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $8.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $24.1 million in the same period last year. In both the quarterly and annual periods, we had a decrease in variable compensation, consisting of commissions and annual incentive compensation, resulting from an overall reduction in total revenues and from our 2017 Cash EBITDA results not achieving the full target goals established at the beginning of the year. In 2016, we exceeded our Cash EBITDA target goals; therefore, annual incentive compensation was higher in 2016 than 2017. Additionally, 2016 included termination benefits related to layoffs of personnel while such amounts were minimal in 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, gross capital expenditures were $34.6 million, of which $24.8 million related to new data acquisition projects primarily located in the Eagle Ford/Woodbine, Permian and Louisiana Cotton Valley areas in the U.S. and in the Montney and Duvernay areas in Canada. Capital expenditures also included $7.2 million related to purchases of seismic data and data processing costs. Our net cash capital expenditures totaled $10.1 million for the Our current backlog of capital expenditures relates to new data acquisition projects located in the Permian, Niobrara, Montney and Duvernay areas and totals $10.9 million, of which we have obtained cash underwriting of $8.5 million. We expect the majority of our $2.4 million committed net cash capital expenditures to be incurred in 2018 with the remainder to be incurred in 2019.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nSeitel will hold its annual conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full year results for 2017 on Thursday, February 15, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

We believe cash resales are an important measure of our operating performance and are useful in assessing overall industry and client activity. Cash resales are likely to fluctuate quarter to quarter as they do not require the longer planning and lead times necessary for new data creation. Cash resales were $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $28.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table summarizes the components of Seitel’s revenue (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Total acquisition underwriting revenue $ 4,553 $ 3,972 $ 22,766 $ 21,458 Resale licensing revenue: Cash resales 16,275 28,257 59,746 59,404 Non-monetary exchanges 825 — 2,075 1,840 Revenue recognition adjustments (253 ) 2,067 3,571 9,752 Total resale licensing revenue 16,847 30,324 65,392 70,996 Total seismic revenue 21,400 34,296 88,158 92,454 Solutions and other 542 705 2,092 2,092 Total revenue $ 21,942 $ 35,001 $ 90,250 $ 94,546 Cash EBITDA represents cash generated from licensing data from our seismic library net of recurring cash operating expenses. We believe this measure is helpful in determining the level of cash from operations we have available for debt service and funding of capital expenditures (net of the portion funded or underwritten by our customers). Cash EBITDA includes cash resales plus all other cash revenues other than from data acquisitions, less cost of goods sold and cash selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding severance and other non-routine costs). The following is a quantitative reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, cash flows from operating activities (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Cash EBITDA $ 12,217 $ 20,977 $ 41,541 $ 39,362 Add (subtract) other components not included in cash EBITDA: Cash acquisition underwriting revenue 4,503 3,921 22,487 21,329 Revenue recognition adjustments from contracts payable in cash 572 1,523 4,396 8,413 Severance and other non-routine costs (28 ) (124 ) (171 ) (1,984 ) Interest expense, net (6,116 ) (5,979 ) (24,652 ) (24,967 ) Amortization of deferred financing costs 333 302 1,285 1,224 Decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts — 1 — (20 ) Other cash operating income 1 11 1 14 Current income tax expense (352 ) (517 ) (2,943 ) (561 ) Changes in operating working capital (15,057 ) (18,703 ) (1,590 ) (12,267 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (3,927 ) $ 1,412 $ 40,354 $ 30,543 Net cash capital expenditures represent total capital expenditures less cash underwriting revenue from our clients and non-cash additions to the seismic data library. We believe this measure is important as it reflects the amount of capital expenditures funded from our operating cash flow. The following table summarizes our actual capital expenditures for 2017 and shows how net cash capital expenditures (a non-GAAP financial measure) are derived from total capital expenditures, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNew data acquisition $ 24,811 Cash purchases and data processing 7,217 Non-monetary exchanges 2,064 Property and equipment 534 Total capital expenditures 34,626 Less: Non-monetary exchanges (2,064 ) Cash underwriting revenue (22,487 ) Net cash capital expenditures $ 10,075\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180214006386/en/\nSeitel, Inc.\nMarcia Kendrick, 713-881-8900\nmkendrick@seitel.com\nSource: Seitel, Inc.",
