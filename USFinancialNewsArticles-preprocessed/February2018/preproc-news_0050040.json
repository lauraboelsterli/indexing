    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Bid Corp Ltd (Bidcorp) , an international distributor of fresh, frozen and dry food, on Wednesday reported an 8.6 percent rise in its half-year earnings, supported by positive trading conditions across all geographies in which the company operates.\nThe Johannesburg-based food service group, spun out of Bidvest in a $5 billion listing in 2016, posted headline earnings per share (HEPS) from continuing operations of 640 cents for the six months till end-December, compared with 589.3 cents a year earlier.\nHEPS is the most widely watched profit gauge in South Africa and strips out certain one-off items.
