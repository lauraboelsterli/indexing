    "text": "LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Drinks bottler Coca-Cola European Partners is proposing to close a UK factory and distribution centre, moves that would result in the loss of 288 roles.\nAt the same time, the seller of Coca-Cola drinks is proposing to transfer production and warehousing to other sites in Britain, which would create 121 jobs.\nThe net result is a loss of 167 jobs.\nThe closures, of a factory in Milton Keynes and a distribution centre in Northampton, are planned for 2019.
