    "text": "FRANKFURT, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Mortgage lending rules in the Netherlands may need to be tightened as high household debt endangers the country’s financial health, a European Central Bank director said on Thursday.\n“There might be a need for more active macroprudential policy,” Sabine Lautenchslaeger, the ECB board member in charge of bank oversight, told a conference in Amsterdam. “And by this I mean a tightening of existing borrower-based measures.”\nShe added a high ratio between the value of mortgage and that of the property “poses a risk to financial stability”.
