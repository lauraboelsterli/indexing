Croda said adjusted pretax profit rose to 320.3 million pounds for the year ended Dec. 31, from 288.3 million pounds a year earlier. Croda, which held unsuccessful talks with U.S. peer Ashland Global Holdings Inc for a possible merger earlier this month, said sales grew by 10.4 percent to 1.37 billion pounds in 2017.
