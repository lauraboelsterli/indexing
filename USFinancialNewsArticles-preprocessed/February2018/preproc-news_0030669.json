    "text": "February 14, 2018 / 2:42 PM / in 11 minutes Dutch gas regulator orders new review of Groningen production Reuters Staff 1 Min Read AMSTERDAM, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Dutch gas sector regulator SodM on Wednesday ordered a new review of production at the Groningen field in the north of the Netherlands after a string of small earthquakes this month. Gas company NAM was given a week to produce a report and proposed measures to reduce seismic risks after three tremors with magnitudes of 1.7 to 2.2 between Feb. 8 and Feb. 11. After a 3.4 earthquake in January the Dutch government said it would cut Groningen production to 12 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year as quickly as possible, from a current level of 21.6 bcm.
