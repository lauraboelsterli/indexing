Total portfolio occupancy at December 31, 2017 was 93.2%, representing a decline of 160 basis points from the prior year-end. Same-center sales per square foot for 2017 were $372, a decline of 1.8% compared with $379 for 2016.

In 2017, CBL completed more than $1.1 billion of financing activity.\nCBL's President & CEO, Stephen D. Lebovitz, commented, \"Fourth quarter results and our outlook for 2018 reflect the impact of significant retailer bankruptcies, store closings and rent adjustments during 2017. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the stronger holiday results compared to 2016 and generally more positive retail sentiment. We are also focused on effectively executing our property transformation strategy by diversifying the offerings at our centers. We are adding dining, entertainment, value retail, fitness, service and other new uses to generate additional traffic. Recently, we announced an anchor redevelopment project at Eastland Mall as well as the redevelopment of two recaptured Sears Auto Centers and will announce additional projects throughout the year.\n\"Our balance sheet is well-positioned to support this strategy with a longer maturity profile and minimal near-term maturities. In addition, we fund the majority of our redevelopment and capital expenditures using our significant portfolio free-cash-flow, which allows us to generate new income on a leverage neutral basis. Looking forward, we expect some continued headwinds from retailers; however, we are encouraged that many of these companies are adopting new technologies that are driving increased store traffic and sales. Our goal for 2018 is to stabilize the performance of our portfolio and accelerate the reinvention of our properties, positioning CBL for growth in 2019 and beyond.\"\nNet income attributable to common shareholders 2017 was $25.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared with net income of $57.6 million, or $0.34 per diluted share 2016.\nNet income attributable to common shareholders for 2017 was $76.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared with net income of $128.0 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, for 2016.\nFFO allocable to common shareholders, as adjusted, of 2017 was $96.4 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared with $116.6 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, of 2016.

In July, CBL completed the extension and modification of two unsecured term loans totaling $535 million. CBL expects to reduce the outstanding balance of the $490 million term loan by $190 million in July 2018. CBL retired loans totaling $350.9 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.4%. The loans were secured separately by seven properties, each of which were added to CBL's unencumbered pool of assets.\nIn April, the $122.4 million loan secured by Acadiana Mall in Lafayette, LA, matured. After negotiations with the lender to seek a modification of the existing loan, CBL and the lender were not able to reach a satisfactory agreement. The property is in receivership and foreclosure proceedings have commenced.\nIn January 2018, CBL retired the $37.3 million loan secured by Kirkwood Mall in Bismarck, ND, using availability on its lines of credit. The loan bore an interest rate of 5.85% and was scheduled to mature in April 2018.\nREDEVELOPMENT\nDuring the fourth quarter, CBL announced details of its transformation plan for Eastland Mall in Bloomington, IL. Global fashion retailer H&M and popular fitness center Planet Fitness will join the center as part of the redevelopment of the former JCPenney store.

Construction has commenced with openings planned for later this year.\nOUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE\nCBL is providing 2018 FFO guidance in the range of $1.70 - $1.80 per diluted share.

Additional information can be found at cblproperties.com .\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nFunds From Operations\nFFO is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on sales of depreciable operating properties and impairment losses of depreciable properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests are calculated on the same basis. We define FFO as defined above by NAREIT less dividends on preferred stock of the Company or distributions on preferred units of the Operating Partnership, as applicable. The Company’s method of calculating FFO may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nThe Company believes that FFO provides an additional indicator of the operating performance of its properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes the value of real estate assets declines predictably over time. Since values of well-maintained real estate assets have historically risen with market conditions, the Company believes that FFO enhances investors’ understanding of its operating performance. The use of FFO as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of the Company’s properties and interest rates, but also by its capital structure. The Company presents both FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders and FFO allocable to common shareholders, as it believes that both are useful performance measures. The Company believes FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders is a useful performance measure since it conducts substantially all of its business through its Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of the Company’s common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership. The Company believes FFO allocable to its common shareholders is a useful performance measure because it is the performance measure that is most directly comparable to net income (loss) attributable to its common shareholders.\nIn the reconciliation of net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders to FFO allocable to operating partnership common unitholders, located in this earnings release, the Company makes an adjustment to add back noncontrolling interest in income (loss) of its Operating Partnership in order to arrive at FFO of its Operating Partnership. The Company then applies a percentage to FFO of its Operating Partnership in order to arrive at FFO of the Operating Partnership common unitholders. The percentage is computed by taking the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and dividing it by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and the weighted average number of Operating Partnership units outstanding during the period.\nFFO does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) for purposes of evaluating the Company’s operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.\nThe Company believes that it is important to identify the impact of certain significant items on its FFO measures for a reader to have a complete understanding of the Company’s results of operations. Therefore, the Company has also presented adjusted FFO measures excluding these significant items from the applicable periods. Please refer to the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders on page 9 of this earnings release for a description of these adjustments.\nSame-center Net Operating Income\nNOI is a supplemental measure of the operating performance of the Company's shopping centers and other properties. The Company defines NOI as property operating revenues (rental revenues, tenant reimbursements and other income) less property operating expenses (property operating, real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs).\nWe believe that presenting NOI and same-center NOI (described below) based on our Operating Partnership’s pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated properties is useful since we conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership. The Company computes NOI based on the Operating Partnership's pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated properties. The Company's definition of NOI may be different than that used by other companies and, accordingly, the Company's NOI may not be comparable to that of other companies.\nSince NOI includes only those revenues and expenses related to the operations of its shopping center and other properties, the Company believes that same-center NOI provides a measure that reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs and the impact of those trends on the Company's results of operations. The Company’s calculation of same-center NOI also excludes lease termination income, straight-line rent adjustments, and amortization of above and below market lease intangibles in order to enhance the comparability of results from one period to another, as these items can be impacted by one-time events that may distort same-center NOI trends and may result in same-center NOI that is not indicative of the ongoing operations of the Company’s shopping center and other properties. A reconciliation of same-center NOI to net income is located at the end of this earnings release.\nPro Rata Share of Debt\nThe Company presents debt based on its pro rata ownership share (including the Company's pro rata share of unconsolidated affiliates and excluding noncontrolling interests' share of consolidated properties) because it believes this provides investors a clearer understanding of the Company's total debt obligations which affect the Company's liquidity. A reconciliation of the Company's pro rata share of debt to the amount of debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheet is located at the end of this earnings release.\nInformation included herein contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

revenues, tenant reimbursements and other income), less property operating expenses (property operating, real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs). Same-center NOI excludes lease termination income, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles and write-offs of landlord inducement assets. We include a property in our same-center pool when we own all or a portion of the property as of December 31, 2017, and we owned it and it was in operation for both the entire preceding calendar year and the current year-to-date reporting period ending December 31, 2017. New properties are excluded from same-center NOI, until they meet this criteria. Properties excluded from the same-center pool that would otherwise meet this criteria are properties which are either under major redevelopment, being considered for repositioning, where we intend to renegotiate the terms of the debt secured by the related property or return the property to the lender, or minority interest properties in which we own an interest of 25% or less.\nCompany's Share of Consolidated and Unconsolidated Debt\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAs of December 31, 2017 Fixed Rate Variable\nRate Total per\nDebt\nSchedule Unamortized\nDeferred\nFinancing\nCosts Total Consolidated debt $ 3,158,973 $ 1,090,810 $ 4,249,783 $ (18,938 ) $ 4,230,845 Noncontrolling interests' share of consolidated debt (77,155 ) (5,418 ) (82,573 ) 687 (81,886 ) Company's share of unconsolidated affiliates' debt 532,766 64,455 597,221\n(2,441 ) 594,780 Company's share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt $ 3,614,584 $ 1,149,847 $ 4,764,431 $ (20,692 ) $ 4,743,739 Weighted average interest rate 5.19 % 2.93 % 4.65 % As of December 31, 2016 Fixed Rate Variable\nRate Total per\nDebt\nSchedule Unamortized\nDeferred\nFinancing\nCosts Total Consolidated debt $ 3,594,379 $ 888,770 $ 4,483,149 $ (17,855 ) $ 4,465,294 Noncontrolling interests' share of consolidated debt (109,162 ) (7,504 ) (116,666 ) 945 (115,721 ) Company's share of unconsolidated affiliates' debt 530,062 73,263 603,325 (2,806 ) 600,519 Company's share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt $ 4,015,279 $ 954,529 $ 4,969,808 $ (19,716 ) $ 4,950,092 Weighted average interest rate 5.30 % 2.18 % 4.70 % Debt-To-Total-Market Capitalization Ratio as of December 31, 2017\n(In thousands, except stock price)\nShares Outstanding\nStock Price (1) Value Common stock and Operating Partnership units 199,297 $ 5.66 $ 1,128,021 7.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 1,815 250.00 453,750 6.625% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 690 250.00 172,500 Total market equity 1,754,271 Company's share of total debt, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs 4,764,431 Total market capitalization $ 6,518,702 Debt-to-total-market capitalization ratio 73.1 % (1) Stock price for common stock and Operating Partnership units equals the closing price of the common stock on December 29, 2017.
