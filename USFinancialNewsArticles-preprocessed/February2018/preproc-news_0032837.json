Woodside has a market value of A$26 billion,\n“There’s a lot of money to pay,” said Macquarie analyst Andrew Hodge.\nThe company announced the Scarborough deal after reporting an 18-percent rise in annual profit of $1.02 billion, just short of analyst forecasts.\nWoodside’s shares were on a trading halt for the offering, which closes on Thursday. It is offering one new share for every nine shares owned at A$27 a share, a 13-percent discount to Woodside’s last trade.\nGAS UP? The company also said it was pushing out a final investment decision on the Browse LNG project off Western Australia to 2021, a year later than last flagged and now estimated to cost $15 billion to get to start-up.\n“A lot of Woodside capital is due to be chewed up in coming years with the Senegal, Scarborough and Browse developments,” said Saul Kavonic, an analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie.\n“All face uncertainties and risk delays ... but Scarborough could now prove the most ‘do-able’ of the three.”\nBHP Billiton welcomed Woodside’s expanded role in Scarborough.\n“This development could enhance the commercial viability of Scarborough and the region,” BHP’s petroleum president Steve Pastor said in a comment emailed to Reuters.\nPart of the $744 million cost of the stake in Scarborough will only be due when the project, in 900 metres of water with no liquids to boost the value of the gas, gets its final go-ahead.\n“Exxon aren’t in the habit of making dumb decisions. They probably see more future in Qatar, PNG (Papua New Guinea), Mozambique and Golden Pass (in Texas),” said Andrew Blakely, an analyst at fund manager Perpetual.\nMeanwhile, Woodside on Wednesday said the North West Shelf LNG joint venture is pursuing arbitration on an LNG contract dispute with Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS).
