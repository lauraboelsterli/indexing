We know the number of vehicles ... is increasing in that space so we know the market for us is going to grow for the next two or three years.”\nBritain’s car industry body expects demand for new cars to fall by up to 7 percent this year, continuing a downward trend it has blamed on uncertainty created by Brexit and the government’s diesel policy.\nShares in Pendragon were up 17 percent in early trade as investors welcomed details of how the company intends to restore profit growth. It said results would be in line with expectations in 2018. ($1 = 0.7223 pounds) (Editing by Paul Sandle and David Goodman)\n ",
