YouCaring has raised over $1 billion to date for medical and charitable causes, bolstered by the efforts of high-profile athletes and influencers like JJ Watt and Ricky Martin.\nWill Wagner joins YouCaring to help the company grow its engineering operations and scale for rapid growth in 2018.

Part of YouCaring's unique strength is its investment in its data platform and technology and those in need will directly benefit from our innovation.”\nRob Chesnut brings to YouCaring’s Advisory Board a wealth of experience in trust and safety, starting with his 10 year tenure at eBay, where he founded the company’s Trust and Safety Department under Meg Whitman.
