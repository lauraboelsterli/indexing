    "text": "PARIS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The French Treasury and central bank urged Credit Mutuel Arkea on Monday to present details about the impact that would result from its potential split from cooperative bank Credit Mutuel.\nThe board of Credit Mutuel Arkea, part of France’s fifth-biggest lender, gave its management approval this month to do whatever was necessary to break away from its parent group of cooperative banks.\nMembers of Credit Mutuel Arkea’s local banks will vote in the first half of 2018 on whether to proceed.\nFrench Treasury chief Odile Renaud-Basso and central bank Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau told Credit Mutuel Arkea’s President Jean-Pierre Denis in a letter that a detailed scenario about the potential split should be presented to local banks.\nThey said the government did not want to change existing legislation for cooperative banks to make the split happen.\nCredit Mutuel Arkea, made up of regional banks in western and central France and now seeking financial independence from its parent, has challenged the European Central Bank’s power to oversee the whole network of lenders as a single entity.\nCredit Mutuel Arkea said in a statement that it was in discussions with the ECB and the French authorities about its plan.\nReporting by Maya Nikolaeva; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ",
