    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nPhilip Morris International Inc.’s (NYSE / Paris Euronext: PM) Chief Executive Officer, André Calantzopoulos, Chief Operating Officer, Jacek Olczak, and Chief Financial Officer, Martin King, address investors today at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference in Boca Raton, Florida, USA.\nThe presentation and Q&A session are being webcast live, in a listen-only mode, beginning at approximately 9:00 a.m. ET, at www.pmi.com/2018cagny , and on the PMI Investor Relations App available at www.pmi.com/irapp . An archived copy of the webcast, together with presentation remarks and slides, will be available on the same site and the App.\nThe presentation will provide an overview of the company’s: strategy for a smoke-free future; key success factors; strong combustible business; operating model and investment plans for driving the commercial success of its reduced-risk products; and its 2018 financial outlook, including capital structure and shareholder return priorities.\nThe company reaffirms its 2018 reported diluted EPS guidance, announced on February 8, for 2018 full-year reported diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $5.20 to $5.35, versus $3.88 in 2017. Excluding a favorable currency impact, at then-prevailing rates, of approximately $0.16 per share, the reported diluted EPS range represents an increase of approximately 7% to 10% versus adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 in 2017 is calculated as reported diluted EPS of $3.88, plus tax items of $0.84 per share primarily related to the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nThis 2018 forecast assumes: currency-neutral net revenue growth of over 8%, operating cash flow of over $9.0 billion; capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion; and no share repurchases. This forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and any unusual events. The company notes that, while currency spot rates have moved in a favorable direction since it provided guidance on February 8, these rates remain volatile. The company will revisit the impact of currency when it provides EPS guidance with its first quarter earnings results on April 19.\nAs communicated on February 8, the company anticipates reported diluted EPS of approximately $0.87 in the first quarter of 2018, including approximately $0.03 of favorable currency, at then-prevailing rates.\nThe presentation, related discussion and this release contain statements that, to the extent they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
