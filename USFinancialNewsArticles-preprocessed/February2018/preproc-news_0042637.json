It is a coming of age story that looks at the friendship between two girls from opposite ends of the social spectrum and how they view the life that lies ahead of them. Eros’ FY16 blockbuster Bajarangi Bhaijan has secured a release in China in more than 8,000 screens in March 2018 during the annual Chinese Lantern Festival.

Eros Now continues to be focused on building and releasing its original slate with exciting concepts that will entertain global audience.\nFinancial Highlights:\nEros has $134.6 million of cash on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.

See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nManagement Comments:\nKishore Lulla, Eros’ Group Executive Chairman said:\n“We are pleased to announce a strategic partnership with Reliance, which we believe will be transformational for us and the Indian entertainment industry. Our new joint venture, combined with Eros’ existing library of over 10,000 digital titles, our new originals and our current telco partnerships will not only enhance our competitive advantage and cement our position as owners of the largest premium content offering in India, but will also equip us to be in a unique position as a global digital content company. Jyoti and I look forward to continuing to work together closely in her new role.”\nJyoti Deshpande, Eros’ Group Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director said:\n“The Reliance stake and content JV deal gives Eros incredible fire power to take a lead in content consolidation. The synergies are complementary and I hope this is the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership. I think this will allow Eros to once again scale up the content slate significantly as well as build a competitive advantage for ErosNow. On a bittersweet note, while I will stay on as a non-executive director on the board of Eros I will be going on to head RIL’s media and entertainment business as President of the Chairman’s office. The last 20 years with Eros have been nothing short of magical and I am glad it's not a goodbye but a continued meaningful association from a win-win perspective.\"\nPrem Parameswaran, Group Chief Financial Officer and President of North America also commented:\n“We are proud to deliver a strong performance in the third quarter. The $100 million convertible notes offering in December 2017 has further strengthened our balance sheet and increased our liquidity position. As of December 30, 2017, our net leverage on a trailing basis has reduced to 2.35x, and our net debt now stands at just over $150 million. The investment in the business has already shown positive results in several areas, which is reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA margin of 36% for the quarter.\nWe continue to invest aggressively in our Eros Now platform, including new originals and increased marketing efforts around our new campaign in India and globally. We feel strongly that our subscriber growth, compelling content library and focus on new originals positions us well to capitalize on the growing demand and opportunity in the OTT space. In this context, I want to reiterate our previously stated guidance of reaching 6-8 million paying subscribers by March 31, 2018, and doubling that base by fiscal year end 2019.”\nRecent Operational Highlights\nFour films were released in Q3 Fiscal Year 2018, all of which were low budget films as compared to eight films in Q3 Fiscal Year 2017, of which three were medium budget and five were low budget films. This is in line with the Eros strategy of developing its own intellectual property and concentrating on content driven films rather than high budget star driven films. Rukh (Hindi), Ribbon (Hindi), Kadvi Hawa (Hindi) and Viswa Vikhyatharaya Payyanmar (Malayalam) were the main revenue contributing films during the quarter. Eros has a compelling film slate planned for Fiscal Year 2019, including films such as Haathi Mere Saathi, Kaptan, Manmarziyan, Happy Bhaag Jayegi Returns, ‘Bhavesh Joshi’, ‘Chandamama Door Ke’, the India-China co-productions, ‘Panda’ by Kabir Khan, a Colour Yellow Production films starring Shah Rukh Khan, Tanu Weds Manu 3 and films to be co-produced under its deal with Dhrishyam Films.

The company uses Adjusted EBITDA along with other IFRS measures to evaluate operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of capitalized film content and debt issuance costs) adjusted for impairments of financial assets and available-for-sale financial assets, profit/loss on held for trading liabilities (including profit/loss on derivatives) share based payments and transaction costs related to equity transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA, as used and defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures employed by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operating investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA provides no information regarding a company’s capital structure, borrowings, interest costs, capital expenditures and working capital movement or tax position. However, our management team believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our results of operations because this measure:\nis widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such, term, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors; help investors to evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating structure; and is used by our management team for various other purposes, including presentations to our board of directors, as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nSee the supplemental financial schedules for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nSome of the information presented in this press release and in related comments by Eros’ management contains forward-looking statements.
