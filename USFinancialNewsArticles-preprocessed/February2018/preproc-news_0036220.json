    "text": "GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - There will be no big Valentine’s Day celebration for one husband and wife figure skating pair, who are choosing rest and relaxation over champagne and roses on Wednesday as another day of competition looms.\nThe duo in question are 26-year-old Alexa Scimeca Knierim and her 30-year-old husband Chris Knierim, two-time U.S. pairs champions making their Olympic debut, who started skating together in 2012 and were married four years later.\nThe two embraced and kissed after finishing their short program on Wednesday, with Chris gently running a hand over his wife’s hair.\n“It’s Valentine’s Day and I think we showed how much we love each other and love to skate with each other during the program,” Chris told reporters after the pair finished 14th to just about qualify for the free skate.\nJust two years ago, Alexa developed a rare gastrointestinal illness that saw her weight plummet to 36 kg (80 lb) before several abdominal surgeries solved the life-threatening issue.\nFigure Skating – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Pair Skating short program competition – Gangneung Ice Arena - Gangneung, South Korea – February 14, 2018 - Alexa Scimeca Knierim and Chris Kneirim of the U.S. in action. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Her absence took months off their training schedule as she was forced to learn the basic skating moves from scratch until her strength returned.\n“It makes this journey so much different and possibly more special than anyone who hasn’t experienced the super lows of life,” Alexa said.\nSlideshow (5 Images) “We’re just feeding off each other and reminding each other how lucky we are to be here. It’s keeping us humble and happy.”\nThe two helped the U.S. figure skating team win bronze in the team competition earlier this week but struggled on Wednesday after she touched the ice with her hand in a throw triple flip.\nAsked how they planned to celebrate making it into the top-16 pairs advancing to Thursday’s free skate, they both said they would rest.\n“We have another program tomorrow and that will be the last of our Olympic journey,” Chris said. “So we’re just going to rest, recover and get ready for tomorrow morning.”\nReporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by John O'Brien\n ",
