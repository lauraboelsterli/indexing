He declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media. \nSeparately, India's Axis Bank said on Thursday that it had dealt in transactions that had been guaranteed with letters of undertaking from Punjab National Bank, but has since sold those transactions. \nShares in PNB, which fell 10 percent on Wednesday, were down more than 5 percent in early trading on Thursday.
