    "text": "President Donald Trump lashed out at the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee Monday, a day after Democrats and Republicans said Trump was wrong to assert that a GOP-produced classified memo on FBI surveillance powers cleared him in the Russia investigation.\nThe House intelligence panel plans to meet Monday afternoon and is expected to consider whether to release a Democratic rebuttal memo. The committee rejected that move last week, with one Republican member saying revisions were needed so the memo would not endanger national security.\nTrump would decide whether to release the memo if it contains classified information.\nA White House official said Monday that the administration would consider releasing the Democratic memo, subjecting it to a similar review process as the Republican memo. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and sought anonymity to discuss internal thinking.\nThe Senate's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, has urged Trump to back the public release and said that refusing to do so would show the president's intent to undermine the Russia investigation.\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is investigating possible collusion between the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and Russia as well as whether there have been efforts to obstruct the investigation.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has said he supports the release of the Democrats' memo, if sensitive intelligence information is removed.\nTrump strode into the debate Monday on Twitter, saying: \"Little Adam Schiff , who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey , Warner , Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!\"\nSchiff has branded the GOP memo \"a political hit job\" and has questioned whether the chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., had coordinated with the White House in drafting the document seized on by the president to vent his grievances against the nation's premier law enforcement agencies.\n\"The goal here is to undermine the FBI, discredit the FBI, discredit the Mueller investigation, do the president's bidding,\" Schiff said. \"I think it's very possible his staff worked with the White House.\"\nNunes was asked during a Jan. 29 committee meeting whether he had coordinated the memo with the White House. \"As far as I know, no,\" he responded, then refused to answer when asked whether his staff members had communicated with the White House. He had previously apologized for sharing with the White House secret intelligence intercepts related to an investigation of Russian election interference before talking to committee members.\nTrump's Saturday tweet that the memo \"totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe\" even as \"the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on\" found no echo from four committee Republicans who appeared on the Sunday talk shows.\nRep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, said, \"I think this is a separate issue.\" Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said, \"No, it doesn't end that.\" Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, said, \"I don't,\" when asked whether he agreed with Trump. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., asked whether the memo affected the investigation, said, \"No, not to me, it doesn't, and I was pretty integrally involved in the drafting of it.\"\nThe Democratic response was more expected: \"Of course, not at all,\" said Schiff. Added Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill.: \"No, of course it does not.\"\nLawmakers also said the memo should not impede Mueller.\n\"I think it would be a mistake for anyone to suggest that the special counsel shouldn't complete his work. I support his work. I want him to finish it. I hope he finishes it as quickly as possible,\" Stewart said.\nThe memo released Friday alleges misconduct on the part of the FBI and the Justice Department in obtaining a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page and his ties to Russia. Specifically, it takes aim at the FBI's use of information from former British spy Christopher Steele, who compiled a dossier containing allegations of ties between Trump, his associates and Russia.\nThe underlying materials that served as the basis for the warrant application were not made public in the GOP memo. Even as Democrats described it as inaccurate, some Republicans quickly cited the memo — released over the objections of the FBI and Justice Department — in their arguments that Mueller's investigation is politically tainted.\nThe memo's central allegation is that agents and prosecutors, in applying in October 2016 to monitor Page's communications, failed to tell a judge that the opposition research that provided grounds for the FBI's suspicion received funding from Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Page had stopped advising the campaign sometime around the end of that summer.\nSteele's research, according to the memo, \"formed an essential part\" of the warrant application. But it's unclear how much or what information Steele collected made it into the application, or how much has been corroborated.\nRepublicans say a judge should have known that \"political actors\" were involved in allegations that led the Justice Department to believe Page might be an agent of a foreign power — an accusation he has consistently denied.\nThe memo confirms the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began in July 2016, months before the surveillance warrant was sought, and was \"triggered\" by information concerning campaign aide George Papadopoulos. He pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI.\nThe confirmation about Papadopoulos is \"the most important fact disclosed in this otherwise shoddy memo,\" Schiff said Saturday.\nSchiff did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
