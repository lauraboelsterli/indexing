(NYSE:CCS), a leading homebuilder in select U.S. markets, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nAdjusted net income of $28.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share excluding the one-time charges related to the impact of remeasurement of deferred tax amounts and homebuilding acquisitions, an increase of 90%, and net income of $17.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted share Net new home contracts increased 62% to 922 contracts Home sales revenues increased 77% to a record $516.5 million Deliveries grew 62% to a record 1,311 homes Backlog value increased 89% to $572.9 million Backlog improved 76% to 1,320 homes Adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage increased 30 basis points to 21.7% Adjusted EBITDA improved 90% to $58.6 million Completed the bolt-on acquisition of the assets of Sundquist Homes (“Sundquist”), strengthening the Company’s presence and enhancing operating efficiencies in the Seattle, Washington market\nDale Francescon, Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “2017 represented the most exciting year in the history of the Company. We dramatically expanded our geographical footprint as a result of the UCP acquisition while experiencing sustained improvement across the entire Century platform, including new and legacy markets. This progress resulted in a record year of home sales revenues and earnings to produce our 15 th consecutive year of profitability. During the fourth quarter of 2017, our team’s superior performance allowed us to meaningfully increase growth in net new home contracts and deliveries by over 60% year-over-year. This solid operating momentum combined with our stable margin performance demonstrates our ability to successfully execute the goals of our dynamic growth strategy. As we move forward in 2018, we anticipate another year of record results fueled by our solid pipeline of new communities and strategic investments which should further enhance our returns on equity.”\n“During 2017, we continued to improve our backlog quantity and quality and strengthen our balance sheet,” said Rob Francescon, Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “So far in 2018, the buyer traffic and overall market dynamics in our West, Mountain, Texas and Southeast regions are encouraging, with our newly acquired operations in California and Washington having already positively impacted our results. Additionally, our joint venture and financing divisions have each surpassed our expectations, contributing cumulative pretax income in excess of $13 million during 2017 and meaningful returns on investment. With our planned community openings, strong backlog, and recent acquisitions of leading homebuilders in attractive markets, we are well positioned to continue this positive momentum into 2018 and beyond.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNet income 2017 was $17.2 million, or $0.60 per share. Excluding the impact of one-time charges associated with the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and our homebuilder acquisitions, adjusted net income increased 90% to a record $28.8 million, or $1.01 per share, as compared to $15.1 million, or $0.71 per share, for the prior year quarter.\nHome sales revenues and deliveries were at record levels for the Company 2017. Home sales revenues 2017 increased 77% to $516.5 million, compared to $292.4 million for the prior year quarter. The growth in home sales revenues was primarily due to a 62% increase in deliveries to 1,311 homes compared to 812 homes for the prior year quarter, and a higher average sales price of home deliveries of $394,000, compared to $360,100 in the prior year quarter. Deliveries and average sales price of home deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2017 were both favorably impacted, primarily in the West, by the acquisitions of UCP and Sundquist. Excluding the West, the Company’s legacy regions experienced growth in revenue and deliveries of 22% and 31%, respectively.\nAdjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage, excluding interest and purchase price accounting, was 21.7% in the fourth quarter 2017, as compared to 21.0% in the third quarter and 21.4% in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of favorable product and geographical mix. Homebuilding gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter 2017 was 17.6%, as compared to 19.2% in the prior year quarter, with approximately half of the difference attributable to the impact of purchase price accounting in the fourth quarter 2017. SG&A as a percent of home sales revenues was 12.1%, compared 11.9% in the prior year quarter, largely attributable to numerous investment initiatives to support growth objectives in 2018.\nNet new home contracts in the fourth quarter 2017 increased to 922 homes, representing an increase of 62%, compared to 569 homes in the prior year quarter, attributable to the addition of the new West region and stronger demand trends in all legacy regions driving an overall increase in absorption rates. Excluding the West, the Company’s legacy regions experienced a 30% increase in net new home contracts. At the end of the fourth quarter 2017, the Company had 1,320 homes in backlog, representing $572.9 million of backlog dollar value, compared to 749 homes in backlog, representing $302.8 million of backlog dollar value in the prior year quarter, an increase of 76% in units and 89% in dollar value.\nFinancial services revenue was $5.2 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and financial services costs were $4.0 million. Equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries was $4.5 million, compared to $0.2 million in the prior year quarter.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nNet income for the full year 2017 was $50.3 million, or $2.03 per share. Adjusted net income increased 42% to a record $71.1 million, or $2.87 per share, compared to $50.1 million, or $2.36 per share, for the prior year.\nHome sales revenues for 2017 increased 44% to $1.4 billion, compared to $978.7 million for 2016. The increase in home sales revenues was primarily due to home deliveries increasing 29% to 3,640 homes and the average selling price of homes delivered increasing to $386,100 compared to $346,500 in the prior year, helped by a shift in regional and product mix.\nHomebuilding gross margin percentage in 2017 was 17.9%, compared to 19.7% in 2016. Adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage, excluding purchase price accounting and interest in cost of home sales revenues, was 21.4% compared to 21.7% in the prior year. SG&A as a percent of home sales revenues remained constant at 12.5% compared to the prior year, with tight cost controls offsetting numerous investment initiatives to support growth objectives in 2018.\nNet new home contracts in 2017 increased to 3,814 homes, an increase of 33%, compared to 2,860 homes in the prior year, largely attributable to increased demand, additional open communities and acquisitions.\nAt the end of full year 2017, the Company had 119 open communities, an increase of 34%, compared to 89 open communities at the end of the prior year.\nFinancial services revenue was $9.9 million for the full year 2017 and financial services costs were $8.7 million. Equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries was $12.2 million, compared to $0.2 million in the prior year.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had the full $400.0 million of availability under its credit facility.\nDuring the full year of 2017, in addition to shares issued in connection with the UCP business combination, the Company issued 3.7 million shares of its common stock under its ATM Program for proceeds of $98.9 million, or $27.31 per share.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nDavid Messenger, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, commented, “We are encouraged by the strong activity in our communities during 2017 and the potential for continued success in 2018. Based on our current market outlook, we expect home deliveries to be in the range of 4,500 to 5,000 homes and our home sales revenues to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $2.0 billion. We expect our active selling community count to be in the range of 130 to 140 communities at the end of the full year 2018. With the benefit of recent U.S. tax reform, we expect to incur an income tax rate of approximately 25% in 2018.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call on Tuesday, February 13, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, 3:00 p.m. Mountain time, to review the Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, discuss recent events and conduct a question-and-answer period.

Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted Diluted EPS) is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of certain non-recurring items. We believe excluding certain non-recurring items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by excluding the effect of acquisition costs and purchase price accounting for acquired work in process from the calculation of reported EPS.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Numerator Net income $ 17,195 $ 15,073 $ 50,295 $ 49,540 Less: Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (85) (255) (384) (1,050) Net income allocable to common stockholders $ 17,110 $ 14,818 $ 49,911 $ 48,490 Denominator Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 27,967,797 20,775,450 24,280,871 20,679,189 Dilutive effect of restricted stock units 387,762 186,250 274,638 112,748 Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 28,355,559 20,961,700 24,555,509 20,791,937 Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.61 $ 0.71 $ 2.06 $ 2.34 Diluted $ 0.60 $ 0.71 $ 2.03 $ 2.33 Adjusted Earnings per share Numerator Income before income tax expense $ 33,848 $ 21,892 $ 84,164 $ 73,149 Purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory 9,295 70 15,625 389 Acquisition expense 1,260 24 9,905 490 Adjusted income before income tax expense 44,403 21,986 109,694 74,028 Adjusted income tax expense (1) (15,630) (6,848) (38,612) (23,893) Adjusted net income 28,773 15,138 71,082 50,135 Less: Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (141) (256) (543) (1,062) Adjusted net income allocable to common stockholders $ 28,632 $ 14,882 $ 70,539 $ 49,073 Denominator - Diluted 28,355,559 20,961,700 24,555,509 20,791,937 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 1.01 $ 0.71 $ 2.87 $ 2.36 (1)\nThe tax rate used in calculating adjusted net income was 35.2% for the three months and 2017. The tax rate used is reflective of our GAAP tax rate for the applicable periods adjusted for certain acquisition costs which are not deductible for tax and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets as a result of the tax cuts and Jobs Act which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. For the three months and 2016, our GAAP tax rate was utilized. Adjusted homebuilding gross margin excluding interest and purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory is not a measurement of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, the Company’s management believes that this information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that indebtedness and acquisitions have on homebuilding gross margin and permits the Company’s stockholders to make better comparisons with the Company’s competitors, who adjust gross margins in a similar fashion. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be used as a substitute for the Company’s operating results. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nGross Margin from Home Sales Excluding Interest and Purchase Price Accounting for Acquired Work in Process Inventory\n(in thousands)\n 2017 % 2016 % Home sales revenues $ 516,501 100.0 % $ 292,398 100.0 % Cost of home sales revenues (425,782) (82.4) % (236,241) (80.8) % Gross margin from home sales 90,719 17.6 % 56,157 19.2 % Add: Interest in cost of home sales revenues 12,274 2.4 % 6,325 2.2 % Adjusted homebuilding gross margin excluding interest 102,993 19.9 % 62,482 21.4 % Add: Purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory 9,295 1.8 % 70 0.0 % Adjusted homebuilding gross margin excluding interest and purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory $ 112,288 21.7 % $ 62,552 21.4 % Year Ended December 31, 2017 % 2016 % Home sales revenues $ 1,405,443 100.0 % $ 978,733 100.0 % Cost of home sales revenues (1,153,359) (82.1) % (786,127) (80.3) % Gross margin from home sales 252,084 17.9 % 192,606 19.7 % Add: Interest in cost of home sales revenues 32,898 2.3 % 19,502 2.0 % Adjusted homebuilding gross margin excluding interest 284,982 20.3 % 212,108 21.7 % Add: Purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory 15,625 1.1 % 389 0.0 % Adjusted homebuilding gross margin excluding interest and purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory $ 300,607 21.4 % $ 212,497 21.7 % Century Communities, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure we use as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance. We define adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income before (i) income tax expense, (ii) interest in cost of home sales revenues, (iii) other interest expense, (iv) depreciation and amortization expense, and (v) adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations. We believe adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization, and items considered to be non-recurring. Accordingly, our management believes that this measurement is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our adjusted EBITDA is limited as an analytical tool, and should not a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\n(in thousands)\n Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Net income $ 17,195 $ 15,073 14.1 % $ 50,295 $ 49,540 1.5 % Income tax expense 16,653 6,819 144.2 % 33,869 23,609 43.5 % Interest in cost of home sales revenues 12,274 6,325 94.1 % 32,898 19,502 68.7 % Interest expense (income) (5) 1 (600.0) % (3) 5 (160.0) % Depreciation and amortization expense 1,900 1,365 39.2 % 6,973 5,580 25.0 % EBITDA 48,017 29,583 62.3 % 124,032 98,236 26.3 % Purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory 9,295 70 13,178.6 % 15,625 389 3,916.8 % Purchase price accounting for investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries outside basis 30 1,228 (97.6) % 915 1,228 (25.5) % Acquisition expense 1,260 24 5,150.0 % 9,905 490 1,921.4 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 58,602 $ 30,905 89.6 % $ 150,477 $ 100,343 50.0 % Century Communities, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nNet Debt to Net Capital\nThe following table presents our ratio of net debt to net capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate this by dividing net debt (notes payable and revolving line of credit less cash held in escrow and cash and cash equivalents) by net capital (net debt plus total stockholders’ equity). The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the ratio of debt to capital. The Company believes the ratio of net debt to net capital is a relevant and useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in its operations and as an indicator of the Company’s ability to obtain external financing.\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31, 2017 2016 Total debt $ 824,602 $ 454,088 Total stockholders' equity 735,233 473,636 Total capital $ 1,559,835 $ 927,724 Debt to capital 52.9% 48.9% Total debt $ 824,602 $ 454,088 Cash and cash equivalents (88,832) (29,450) Cash held in escrow (37,723) (20,044) Net debt 698,047 404,594 Total stockholders' equity 735,233 473,636 Net capital $ 1,433,280 $ 878,230 Net debt to net capital 48.7% 46.1%\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180213006478/en/\nCentury Communities, Inc.\nInvestor Relations:\n303-268-8398\nInvestorRelations@CenturyCommunities.com\nSource: Century Communities, Inc.",
