    "text": "20 COMMENTS Two Princeton economists are sounding off on what they consider to be warning signs of a crisis of American capitalism.\nWatch more Moving Upstream videos here Prof. Anne Case and Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton see increases in suicides and other “deaths of despair” — particularly among middle-aged, white Americans — as a sign that “something is not right,” with society.\nThe husband and wife team are continuing to research why suicide deaths are far higher in the U.S. than in many other economically advanced nations. They argue that it’s not simply a function of economics. It’s a “failure of spiritual and social life that drives people to suicide,” Mr. Deaton says.",
