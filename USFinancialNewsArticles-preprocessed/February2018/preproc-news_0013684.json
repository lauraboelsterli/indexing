    "text": "2 killed, nearly 90 injured in South Carolina train crash An Amtrak train traveling in South Carolina collided with a CSX freight train on Sunday. Two people were killed and at least 89 people were taken to hospitals. The train with 140 passengers and eight crew members was traveling between New York and Miami. Authorities said they haven't determined if both trains were moving at the time. Published 48 Mins Ago The Associated Press Steve Dipaola | Reuters Officials investigate the scene where an Amtrak passenger train derailed on a bridge over interstate highway I-5 in DuPont, Washington, December 18, 2017. \nA crash between an Amtrak passenger train and a CSX freight train near South Carolina's capital killed two people and injured nearly 90 early Sunday, authorities said. It was the third deadly wreck involving Amtrak in less than two months. \nAmtrak's Silver Star was on its way from New York to Miami with eight crew members and about 140 passengers when the crash happened around 2:45 a.m. near Cayce, authorities said. \nLexington County Coroner Margaret Fisher said the two people killed were on the Amtrak train. TWEET \nThe crash happened by a rail yard about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Columbia, where several track spurs split off for freight cars to be unloaded. Authorities said they haven't determined if both trains were moving at the time. \nThe Amtrak train's lead engine and some of the passenger cars derailed, Amtrak said. TV footage showed the locomotive on its side, its front crumpled. \nAt least 89 people were taken to hospitals, and three were admitted, hospital officials said. \nAmtrak officials worked to gather luggage and other belongings and line up buses to take passengers on to their destinations. Those who weren't hurt were taken in patrol cars to a shelter, and local businesses provided coffee and breakfast. TWEET \n\"We know they are shaken up quite a bit. We know this is like nothing else they have ever been through. So we wanted to get them out of the cold, get them out of the weather -- get them to a warm place,\" sheriff's spokesman Adam Myrick said. \nOn Wednesday, a chartered Amtrak train carrying Republican members of Congress to a strategy retreat slammed into a garbage truck at a crossing in rural Virginia, killing one person in the truck and injuring six others. \nAnd on Dec. 18, an Amtrak train ran off the rails along a curve during its inaugural run on a route south of Tacoma, Washington, killing three people and injuring dozens. It was going nearly 80 mph, more than twice the speed limit.",
