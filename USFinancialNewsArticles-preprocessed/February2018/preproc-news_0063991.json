I have never asked for a seat on the supervisory board, and that doesn’t have any priority for me,” German weekly Bild am Sonntag quoted Li as saying in an interview. Geely’s purchase of a $9 billion stake in the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars has rekindled fears in Germany of its highly-prized expertise falling into Chinese hands.
