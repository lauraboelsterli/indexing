    "text": "February 2, 2018 / 1:04 PM / Updated an hour ago Thousands protest against unemployment benefit cuts in Helsinki Tuomas Forsell 3 Min Read \nHELSINKI (Reuters) - More than 7,000 Finns rallied on Friday in Helsinki to protest cuts to unemployment benefits, with strikes halting public transport in the capital and closing harbours and factories around the country. \nThe demonstrators, mainly union activists, gathered outside the Government’s Palace and called on the centre-right government to revoke a new law that pushes the jobless to take on short-term jobs or risk of losing some of their benefits. \nAround 200,000 industrial, transport and construction workers went on strike, and other unions encouraged their members to join the demonstration in Helsinki. \n“My promise to you is, that when the Social Democrats (SDP) is in the government, we will cancel this,” Antti Rinne, the leader of the biggest opposition party, told the crowd. \nUnions are powerful in Finland, and SDP has close relationship with them. \nFinnish Technology Industries estimated that the one-day strike cost its member companies 230 million euros ($287 million) in lost revenue.

They’re blocked by the left’s soapbox. Party politics from the 70‘s”, Sampo Terho, minister for European affairs and leader of the co-ruling Blue Reform party, wrote on his Twitter account. \nThe Finnish economy has recovered from a slump and is now growing briskly. But at 8.4 percent, its jobless rate remains higher than unemployment in other Nordic countries, putting a strain on public finances and a generous welfare system in the face of an ageing population.

That violates the 2016 pact, unions say. \n“The government has let us down. We agreed to the competitiveness pact with the condition that unemployment benefits stay untouched. And now they’ve done it anyway,” Jani Polla, a metal worker who had traveled from south-western city of Turku, told Reuters. \nThe government has promised to give more money for services to support jobseekers, noting that the activation model was part of a larger reform package which has been negotiated together with labour unions.
