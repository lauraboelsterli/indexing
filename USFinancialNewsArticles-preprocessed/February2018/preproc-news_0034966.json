    "text": "MADISON, Wis., Sonic Foundry, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFO), the trusted leader for video creation and management solutions, today announced consolidated financial results for its fiscal 2018 first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Highlights\nTotal revenues were $8.9 million compared to $9.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 Gross margin was $6.5 million, or 73% of sales compared to $6.7 million, or 72% of sales in the first quarter of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA more than cut in half to $(335,000), compared to $(765,000) in the first quarter of 2017 Net income of $320 thousand, or $0.06 per share compared to a net loss of $(1.5) million, or $(0.34) per share in the first quarter of 2017 (Net Income in the first quarter of 2018 benefited from a tax gain of $1.3 million related to tax legislation changes in December 2017) Billings totaled $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 5% compared to the same period last year Unearned revenue decreased to $13.0 million as of December 31, 2017, as we recognized over $1.3 million in revenues primarily from a number of large events billed in the prior quarter Over $1 million positive swing in operating cash flow, to $231,000 for the three month period\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Review\nService billings, including support, hosting, events, and installs saw an increase of 5% from prior year to a total of $4.7 million. Product billings saw an increase of 4% to $2.9 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The company expects to recognize $3.8 million of the current unearned revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nRecurring revenue of $6.2 million was 70% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2018, up from $5.9 million, or 64% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2017. These increases were driven by the strong demand for our cloud offering and annual software licenses, strength in support services, and continued customer repeat purchases and renewals.\nThe loss before income taxes decreased by $573,000 due in large part to efforts made by the company to reduce operating expenses, including certain headcount reductions made in the third quarter of 2017. Operating expenses were $7.4 million, down $776 thousand or 9% from the same period in 2017. The net loss in the prior year of $1.5 million improved to income of $320,000 due to a tax credit of $1.3 million related to the recent reduction in Federal tax rates.\n“In the first quarter we saw our right-sized video solutions continue to extend the value of Mediasite product and services technologies to a broadening customer base. This allows customers to ‘mix and match’ capture solutions ranging from software only to our most capable recorders. Our strategy to address low-technology rooms and grow the market for our affordable hardware solutions is an area of increased interest from customers. This has resulted in a 50% increase in recorders shipped over Q1 of 2017,” said Gary Weis, CEO of Sonic Foundry.\nMr. Weis continued, “We continue to invest in technology partnerships based on value to our customers, such as the recently announced integration of our platform with NewTek NDI, which are geared to enabling our customers to harness the power of Mediasite for their specific video creation and management needs. In 2018 we will remain focused on customer acquisition, higher levels of sales and operating performance, and technology development.\"\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement and enhance the reader’s understanding of our operating performance and our ability to satisfy lender requirements, we disclose adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (adjusted EBITDA), a non-GAAP measure of operating performance. Our adjusted EBITDA measure additionally adds back stock compensation expense from the SEC definition of EBITDA. As such, our adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income as a measurement of our operating performance. Our credit agreement contains a minimum EBITDA calculation based, in part, on adjusted EBITDA since this measure is representative of adjusted income available for debt and interest payments. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are included in the release. The company is unable to provide a reconciliation of projected EBITDA to projected net income due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of certain income statement items.\nWebcast\nThe company will hold its corporate webcast for analysts and investors at 4:30 p.m. ET today, February 13. Sonic Foundry will use its webcasting technology, Mediasite, to stream the presentation for live and on-demand viewing.
