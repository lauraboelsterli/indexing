GAAP income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $133.6 million compared to $120.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. GAAP income before taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $48.4 million compared to $72.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 results reflect higher gains on sales of loans and securities as well as increased operating lease income, offset by lower gains on sales of real estate. Diluted EPS for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.40 and $1.13, respectively, compared to $0.63 and $1.06 for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. After-tax GAAP return on average equity was 12.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCore earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $60.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $44.6 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, core earnings was $178.8 million compared to $158.2 million for 2016. The results reflect higher gains on sales of loans and securities as well as an increase in operating lease income. We believe core earnings, which adjusts GAAP income before taxes for certain non-cash expenses, unrecognized derivative results, and the economic gains on securitization transactions not recognized for GAAP accounting for which risk has substantially transferred, is useful in evaluating our earnings from operations across reporting periods. Core EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $0.47 for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.54 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.37 and $1.48 for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nLadder Capital Corp today announced the declaration by its Board of Directors of a first quarter 2018 dividend of $0.315 per share of Class A common stock. The cash dividend is payable on April 2, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 12, 2018.\nPortfolio Overview\nThe following table summarizes the book value of our investment portfolio as of the dates indicated below ($ in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Loans Balance sheet loans: Balance sheet first mortgage loans $ 3,123,268 51.9\n% $ 1,832,626 32.9 % Other commercial real estate-related loans 159,194 2.6 % 167,469 3.0 % Provision for loan losses (4,000 ) (0.1 )% (4,000 ) (0.1 )% Total balance sheet loans 3,278,462 54.4\n% 1,996,095 35.8 % Conduit first mortgage loans 230,180 3.8 % 357,882 6.4 % Total loans 3,508,642 58.2\n% 2,353,977 42.2 % Securities CMBS investments 1,066,570\n17.7 % 2,043,566 36.6 % U.S. Agency Securities investments 39,947\n0.7 % 57,381 1.1 % Total securities 1,106,517\n18.4 % 2,100,947 37.7 % Real Estate Real estate and related lease intangibles, net 1,032,041 17.1 % 822,338 14.7 % Total real estate 1,032,041 17.1 % 822,338 14.7 % Other Investments Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 35,441 0.6 % 34,025 0.6 % FHLB stock 77,915 1.3 % 77,915 1.4 % Total other investments 113,356 1.9 % 111,940 2.0 % Total investments 5,760,556\n95.6\n% 5,389,202 96.6 % Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 182,683 3.0 % 64,017 1.1 % Other assets 82,376 1.4 % 125,118 2.3 % Total assets $ 6,025,615\n100.0\n% $ 5,578,337 100.0 % Note: CMBS investments and U.S. Agency Securities are carried at fair value.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we consummated two securitizations of floating-rate commercial mortgage loans through a static collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) structure. In the first CLO transaction, we contributed over $456.9 million of balance sheet loans and retained an approximately 18.5% interest, and in the second CLO transaction, we contributed over $431.5 million of balance sheet loans and retained an approximately 25.0% interest. Certain of the loans contributed to the CLOs have future funding components that are retained by a subsidiary of ours in the form of a participation interest or separate note. However, for a limited period of time, to the extent loans in the CLOs are repaid, the CLO trusts may acquire portions of the future fundings from our affiliate.\nOn October 27, 2017, we amended our syndicated revolving credit facility to increase the maximum funding capacity to $241.4 million.\nThe following table summarizes our debt obligations as of the following dates ($ in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Committed loan repurchase facilities $ 398,653 $ 567,163 Committed securities repurchase facility — 228,317 Uncommitted securities repurchase facilities 74,757 311,705 Total repurchase facilities 473,410 1,107,185 Revolving credit facility — 25,000 Mortgage loan financing 692,696 590,106 CLO debt(1) 688,479 — Participation financing - mortgage loan receivable 3,107\n— Borrowings from the FHLB 1,370,000 1,660,000 Senior unsecured notes(2) 1,152,134 559,847 Total debt obligations $ 4,379,826\n$ 3,942,138 (1) Presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $6.0 million as of December 31, 2017.

In connection with this transaction, pursuant to the risk retention requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company sold a restricted “horizontal interest” to a “Third Party Purchaser” (“TPP”), which must be held by the TPP for at least five years. The Company initially concluded that the transfer restrictions placed on the TPP of the risk retention securities, imposed by the risk retention rules of the Dodd-Frank Act, precluded sale accounting under generally accepted accounting principles and, accordingly, the Company originally accounted for the transaction as a financing. As a result of industry discussions, in November 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff indicated that, despite such restrictions, they would not take exception to a registrant treating such transfers as sales if they otherwise met all the criteria for sale accounting. The Company believes treatment of such transfers as sales is more consistent with the substance of such transaction, and accordingly, changed its accounting principles to treat such transfers as sales. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company reflected this change in accounting principle retrospectively to prior interim periods within 2017.\nAs a result of the change in accounting principle, the Company recognized a gain of $26.1 million on the transaction when it closed on June 29, 2017. In addition, upon consummation, the Company recognized $12.9 million and $62.7 million in restricted and unrestricted securities, respectively, which are included in real estate securities, available-for-sale on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company also recognized a liability for $78.8 million for 23 intercompany loans with a combined principal balance of $76.7 million. This change in accounting principle had no material impact on previously reported core earnings or core EPS.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present core earnings, core EPS, and after-tax core return on average equity (“after-tax core ROAE”), which are non-GAAP financial measures, as supplemental measures of our performance. We believe core earnings, core EPS and after-tax core ROAE assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding non-cash expenses and unrecognized results from derivatives and agency interest-only securities, which we believe makes comparisons across reporting periods more relevant by eliminating timing differences related to changes in the values of assets and derivatives. In addition, we use core earnings, core EPS and after-tax core ROAE: (i) to evaluate our earnings from operations and (ii) because management believes that they may be useful performance measures for us. Core earnings is also used as a factor in determining the annual incentive compensation of our senior managers and other employees.\nWe consider the Class A common shareholders of the Company and limited partners of Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP other than Ladder Capital Corp (“Continuing LCFH Limited Partners”) to have fundamentally equivalent interests in our pre-tax earnings and net income. Accordingly, for purposes of computing core earnings, core EPS and after-tax core ROAE, we start with pre-tax earnings or net income and adjust for other noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures but we do not adjust for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest held by Continuing LCFH Limited Partners. Similarly, when calculating undepreciated book value per share we include total shareholders' equity and the noncontrolling interest held by Continuing LCFH Limited Partners, but exclude noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures.\nCore earnings\nWe define core earnings as income before taxes adjusted for (i) real estate depreciation and amortization, (ii) the impact of derivative gains and losses related to the hedging of assets on our balance sheet as of the end of the specified accounting period, (iii) unrealized gains/(losses) related to our investments in agency interest-only securities, (iv) economic gains on securitization transactions not recognized under GAAP accounting for which risk has substantially transferred during the period and the exclusion of resultant GAAP recognition of the related economics during the subsequent periods, (v) non-cash stock-based compensation and (vi) certain one-time transactional items.\nFor core earnings, we include adjustments for economic gains on securitization transactions not recognized under GAAP accounting for which risk has substantially transferred during the period and exclusion of resultant GAAP recognition of the related economics during the subsequent periods. This adjustment is reflected in core earnings when there is a true risk transfer on the mortgage loan transfer and settlement. Historically, this has represented the impact of economic gains on (discounts) on intercompany loans secured by our own real estate which we had not previously recognized because such gains were eliminated in consolidation. Conversely, if the economic risk was not substantially transferred, no adjustments to net income would be made relating to those transactions for core earnings purposes. Management believes recognizing these amounts for core earnings purposes in the period of transfer of economic risk is a reasonable supplemental measure of our performance.\nWe do not designate derivatives as hedges to qualify for hedge accounting and therefore any net payments under, or fluctuations in the fair value of, our derivatives are recognized currently in our income statement. However, fluctuations in the fair value of the related assets are not included in our income statement. We consider the gain or loss on our hedging positions related to assets that we still own as of the reporting date to be “open hedging positions.” While recognized for GAAP purposes, we exclude the results on the hedges from core earnings until the related asset is sold and the hedge position is considered “closed,” whereupon they would then be included in core earnings in that period. These are reflected as “adjustments for unrecognized derivative results” for purposes of computing core earnings for the period. We believe that excluding these specifically identified gains and losses associated with the open hedging positions adjusts for timing differences between when we recognize changes in the fair values of our assets and changes in the fair value of the derivatives used to hedge such assets.\nOur investments in agency interest-only securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in current period earnings. We believe that excluding these specifically identified gains and losses associated with the agency interest-only securities adjusts for timing differences between when we recognize changes in the fair values of our assets.

Includes $8 thousand and $29 thousand of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures which are included in net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in operating partnership on the consolidated statements of income for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.

For purposes of core earnings, our share of real estate depreciation and amortization is eliminated and, accordingly, the resultant gain/losses must also be adjusted. Following is a reconciliation of the related consolidated GAAP amounts to the amounts reflected in core earnings.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP realized gain on sale of real estate, net $ 3,633 $ 5,020 $ 11,423 $ 20,636 Adjusted gain/loss on sale of real estate for purposes of core earnings\n(2,820 ) (4,323 ) (9,163 ) (17,650 ) Our share of accumulated depreciation and amortization on real estate sold $ 813 $ 697 $ 2,260 $ 2,986 (3) The following is a reconciliation of GAAP net results from derivative transactions to our hedging unrecognized result presented in the computation of core earnings in the preceding table ($ in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net results from derivative transactions $ 5,710 $ 64,739 $ (12,641 ) $ (1,409 ) Hedging interest expense 2,749 6,625 15,320\n29,870 Hedging realized result (4,808 ) (29,707 ) 7,460 (17,356 ) Adjustments for unrecognized derivative results $ 3,651 $ 41,657 $ 10,139\n$ 11,105 (4) We recorded an additional $0.1 million and $3.3 million income tax expense for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, a proposed tax settlement for pre-acquisition liabilities on certain corporate entities acquired in certain transactions effected immediately prior to our initial public offering. We also recorded other income of $0.1 million and $3.3 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, relating to the expected recovery of these amounts pursuant to an indemnification. While these items are presented on a gross basis, there was no impact to either net income or core earnings. Accordingly, since pre-tax income excludes the tax effect but includes the recovery pursuant to indemnification, the recovery amount must also be excluded from core earnings.\n(5) Core estimated corporate tax benefit (expense) based on effective tax rate applied to core earnings generated by the activity within our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Core EPS\nCore EPS is defined as after-tax core earnings divided by the adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the period. The adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding is defined as the GAAP weighted average diluted shares outstanding, adjusted for shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B shares, if excluded from the GAAP measure because they would have an anti-dilutive effect. The inclusion of shares issuable upon conversion of Class B shares is consistent with the inclusion of income attributable to noncontrolling interest in operating partnership in core earnings and after-tax core earnings.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding to adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 89,242 66,037 109,705 107,639 Weighted average shares issuable to converted Class B shareholders 20,541 42,582 — — Adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding 109,783 108,619 109,705 107,639 Set forth below is an unaudited computation of core EPS ($ in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 After-tax core earnings $ 51,342 $ 40,434 $ 169,484\n$ 158,840 Adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding 109,783 108,619 109,705 107,639 Core EPS $ 0.47 $ 0.37 $ 1.54 $ 1.48 After-tax core ROAE\nAfter-tax core ROAE is presented on an annualized basis and is defined as after-tax core earnings divided by the average total shareholders' equity and noncontrolling interest in operating partnership during the period. The inclusion of noncontrolling interest in operating partnership is consistent with the inclusion of income attributable to noncontrolling interest in operating partnership in after-tax core earnings. Set forth below is an unaudited computation of after-tax core ROAE ($ in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 After-tax core earnings $ 51,342 $ 40,434 $ 169,484\n$ 158,840 Average shareholders' equity and NCI in operating partnership 1,472,845 1,500,134 1,477,479 1,486,772 After-tax core ROAE 13.9 % 10.8 % 11.5 % 10.7 %\nIncome from sales of securitized loans, net of hedging\nWe present income from sales of securitized loans, net of hedging, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of the performance of our loan securitization business. Since our loans sold into securitizations to date are comprised of long-term fixed-rate loans, the result of hedging those exposures prior to securitization represents a substantial portion of our securitization profitability. Therefore, we view these two components of our profitability together when assessing the performance of this business activity and find it a meaningful measure of our performance as a whole. When evaluating the performance of our sale of loans into securitization business, we generally consider the income from sales of securitized loans, net, in conjunction with other income statement items that are directly related to such securitization transactions, including portions of the realized net result from derivative transactions that are specifically related to hedges on the securitized or sold loans, which we reflect as hedge gain/(loss) related to loans securitized, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the table below.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of income from sale of securitized loans, net to income from sale of loans, net as reported in our consolidated financial statements and an unaudited reconciliation of hedge gain/(loss) relating to loans securitized to net results from derivative transactions as reported in our consolidated financial statements ($ in thousands except for number of loans and securitizations):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Number of loans 57 44 114 104 Face amount of loans sold into securitizations $ 851,087 $ 663,798 $ 1,476,741 $ 1,327,856 (1 ) Number of securitizations 6 3 7 6 Income from sales of securitized loans, net (2) $ 29,157 $ (4,088 ) $ 55,220 $ 23,098 Hedge gain/(loss) related to loans securitized (3) 3,139 22,087 (5,929 ) 15,271 Income from sales of securitized loans, net of hedging 32,296 17,999 49,291 38,369 Adjustment for economic gain on securitization transactions not recognized under GAAP for which risk has been substantially transferred (1,695 ) (275 ) 2,051 413 Core gain on sale of securitized loans $ 30,601 $ 17,724 $ 51,342 $ 38,782 (1) Excludes one $21.7 million loan acquired from a third party and sold into a securitization at equal values.

We believe undepreciated book value per share assists investors in comparing our financial condition across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding accumulated depreciation on real estate, which implicitly assumes that the value of our real estate diminishes in value predictably over time, whereas real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions.\nWe consider the Class A common shareholders of the Company and Continuing LCFH Limited Partners to have fundamentally equivalent interests in our pre-tax earnings and net income. Accordingly, when calculating undepreciated book value per share we include total shareholders' equity and the noncontrolling interest held by Continuing LCFH Limited Partners but exclude noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures.\nWe define undepreciated book value per share as the sum of total shareholders' equity, noncontrolling interest in operating partnership, and our share of accumulated real estate depreciation and amortization, divided by the total Class A and Class B shares outstanding. Set forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of total shareholders' equity to undepreciated book value, and an unaudited computation of undepreciated book value per share ($ in thousands except per share date):\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Total shareholders' equity $ 1,234,968 $ 971,390 Noncontrolling interest in operating partnership 240,861 533,246 Our share of accumulated real estate depreciation and amortization (1) 149,494 112,606 Undepreciated book value 1,625,323 1,617,242 Class A shares outstanding 93,641 71,586 Class B shares outstanding 17,667 38,002 Total shares outstanding 111,308 109,588 GAAP book value per share $ 13.19 $ 13.57 Undepreciated book value per share $ 14.60 $ 14.76 (1) The following is a reconciliation of GAAP accumulated real estate depreciation and amortization to our share of accumulated real estate depreciation and amortization presented in the computation of undepreciated book value per share in the preceding table ($ in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 GAAP accumulated real estate depreciation and amortization $ 161,063 $ 122,007 Less: Noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures' share of accumulated real estate depreciation and amortization (11,569 ) (9,401 ) Our share of accumulated real estate depreciation and amortization $ 149,494 $ 112,606\nCore gain on sale of loans\nWe present core gain on sale of loans, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define core gain on sale of loans as income from sales of loans, and the economic gains on the transfer of loans not considered sold for accounting purposes, net of the realized hedging result related to the hedging of loans sold or transferred. We believe core gain on sale of loans assists investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by eliminating timing differences related to changes in values of assets and derivatives.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of GAAP sale of loans, net to core gain on sale of loans ($ in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP sale of loans, net $ 29,917 $ (4,256 ) $ 54,046 $ 26,009 Adjustment for economic gain on securitization transactions not recognized under GAAP for which risk has been substantially transferred (1) (1,695 ) (275 ) 2,051 413 Hedging gain/(loss) related to loans securitized and other loan activity 3,095 25,027 (2,732 ) 17,156 Core gain on sale of loans $ 31,317 $ 20,496 $ 53,365 $ 43,578 (1) For core gain on sale of loans, we include adjustments for economic gains on securitization transactions not recognized for GAAP accounting. Management believes recognizing these amounts for core purposes in the period of economic transfer of risk is a reasonable supplemental measure of our performance. Core gain on sale of securities\nWe present core gain on sale of securities, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define core gain on sale of loans as income from sales of securities net of the realized hedging result related to the hedging of securities sold. We believe core gain on sale of securities assists investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by eliminating timing differences related to changes in values of assets and derivatives.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of GAAP realized gain (loss) on securities to core gain on sale of securities ($ in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP realized gain (loss) on securities $ (1,973 ) $ (1,800 ) $ 17,209 $ 7,724 Plus: Other than temporary impairment, net of hedging 694 59 1,254 643 Hedging realized result - security sales 1,713 4,680 (4,728 ) 200 Core gain on sales of securities $ 434 $ 2,939 $ 13,735 $ 8,567 Net rental income\nWe present net rental income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define net rental income as the total of operating lease income and tenant recoveries, less real estate operating expenses, all of which are disclosed on our consolidated statements of income. We present net rental income as a measure of the recurring income from our real estate investments before non-recurring items such as gains on sale or fee income, which we believe assists investors in analyzing our performance across reporting periods.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of operating lease income to net rental income ($ in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating lease income $ 24,751 $ 19,432 $ 89,492 $ 77,277 Plus: Tenant recoveries 2,058 2,113 7,179 5,958\nLess: Real estate operating expenses (8,355 ) (7,301\n) (33,216 ) (30,545 ) Net rental income $ 18,454 $ 14,244\n$ 63,455 $ 52,690\nAdjusted leverage\nWe present adjusted leverage, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define adjusted leverage as the ratio of debt obligations, net of deferred financing costs, adjusted for non-recourse debt obligations related to securitizations that are consolidated on our GAAP balance sheet. We believe adjusted leverage assists investors in comparing our leverage across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding non-recourse debt related to securitized loans.\nSet forth below is an unaudited computation of adjusted leverage ($ in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 GAAP debt obligations, net $ 4,379,826 $ 3,942,138 Less: CLO debt (688,479 ) (1) — Adjusted debt obligations 3,691,347 3,942,138 GAAP total equity\n1,488,146 1,509,554 Adjusted leverage 2.5 2.6 (1) As discussed above, we contributed over $888.4 million worth of balance sheet loans into two CLO securitizations that remain on our balance sheet for accounting purposes, but are excluded from debt obligations for adjusted leverage calculation purposes. Non-GAAP Measures - Limitations\nOur non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are:\ncore earnings, core EPS and after-tax core ROAE do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations and are not necessarily indicative of cash necessary to fund cash needs; core EPS and after-tax core ROAE are based on a non-GAAP estimate of our effective tax rate, including the impact of Unincorporated Business Tax and the impact of our election to be taxed as a REIT effective January 1, 2015, assuming the conversion of all shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock. Our actual tax rate may differ materially from this estimate; undepreciated book value per share excludes accumulated real estate depreciation and amortization and may not reflect an accurate measure of the value of our real estate; and other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to shareholders, earnings per share or book value per share, or any other performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to cash flows from operations as a measure of our liquidity. Undepreciated book value per share should not be considered a measure of the value of our assets upon an orderly liquidation of the our company.\nIn the future, we may incur gains and losses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nFor additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the disclosures available on our website or our Annual Report on Form 10-­K.\nAbout Ladder\nLadder is an internally-managed real estate investment trust that is a leader in commercial real estate finance.
