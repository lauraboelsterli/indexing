Additionally, a significant proportion of Xiangli's flooring products are polymer based and can be enhanced by applications developed by our China partner as part of its ongoing program of research & development which it conducts in cooperation with a number of leading universities in China.\"\nExisting management team of Xiangli will be retained and the transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nAbout Jiangsu Xiangli\nXiangli Anti-Static Decorative Material Co., Ltd (Jiangsu), established in 1996, is a leading manufacturer of raised access floor material in China.
