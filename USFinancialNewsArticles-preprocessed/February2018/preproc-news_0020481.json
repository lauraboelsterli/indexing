    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 2:10 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Norwegian police investigate 2016 hydrogen leak at Statoil refinery Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Norwegian police have launched an investigation into a hydrogen gas leak at Statoil’s Mongstad refinery in October 2016, the company said on Friday. \nStatoil temporarily shut and evacuated its main refinery on Norway’s west coast when a rusted pipe socket ruptured. The firm’s own investigation found the resulting leak was caused by insufficient maintenance and a poor understanding of risk. \nWhile nobody was injured, the leak could have been fatal if the gas had ignited, Statoil’s probe concluded. \n“The October 2016 leak is being investigated by police and ... we are cooperating,” a company spokeswoman said. She declined to provide to further details. \nThe police were not immediately available to comment. Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis; editing by Alexander Smith",
