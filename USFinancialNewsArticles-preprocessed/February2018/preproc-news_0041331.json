    "text": "PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: CDR) (\"Cedar\" or the \"Company\") today announced that Paul G. Kirk, Jr. has advised that he will retire from the Company's Board of Directors effective at the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting. Senator Kirk served as a director from 2005 to September 2009, when he resigned to accept appointment as a United States Senator for Massachusetts to succeed the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy. At the conclusion of his Senate term, Senator Kirk was subsequently re-elected to the Cedar Board in June 2010.\n\"On behalf of the entire Board and management team, we thank Paul for his 13 years of service and many contributions to Cedar's success,\" said Roger M. Widmann, Chairman of the Cedar Board. \"Under Paul's watch, Cedar has made great strides executing our strategic plan to further improve the Company's portfolio, strengthen the balance sheet and deliver enhanced shareholder value. We wish Paul all the best in his future endeavors.\"\nBruce Schanzer, Chief Executive Officer of Cedar, added, \"Paul is the paragon of a great American, and has proven himself time and again to be an invaluable contributor to our Board and a most capable steward of our corporate governance, as the Chair of our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. It has been our privilege to have Paul on our Board these past thirteen years, and we wish him well in his retirement.\"\n\"It has been an honor to be part of Cedar's transformation over the past several years,\" said Senator Kirk. \"I am confident that Cedar has the right team and strategy in place to achieve its objectives, and I look forward to following the Company's continued success for many years to come.\"\nSenator Kirk's decision to retire and not stand for re-election was not the result of any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's financial condition or financial reporting.\nAbout Cedar Realty Trust\nCedar Realty Trust, Inc. is a fully-integrated real estate investment trust which focuses on the ownership, operation and redevelopment of grocery-anchored shopping centers in high-density urban markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston.
