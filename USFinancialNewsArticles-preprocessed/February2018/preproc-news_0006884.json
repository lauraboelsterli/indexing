    "text": "February 3, 2018 / 5:14 PM / Updated an hour ago Engie board puts four candidates forward for chairman role - report   \nPARIS (Reuters) - French utility Engieâ€™s ( ENGIE.PA ) board has recommended four candidates to chair it, including Airbus COO Fabrice Bregier and Solvay Chief Executive Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, television channel BFM Business reported on Saturday. \nEngie, in which the French state owns a 24.1 percent stake, has decided to keep the roles of chief executive and board chairman separate, the group said in a statement on Saturday. \nFrench media have reported that Chief Executive Isabelle Kocher had made a bid to combine both roles after current chairman Gerard Mestrallet retires in May. \nBFM Business said Kocher had failed to convince the government to merge the positions and that the board had reviewed four names to succeed Mestrallet this week. \nThe other two candidates are Frederic Lemoine, a former executive at investment firm Wendel ( MWDP.PA ), and Yann Delabriere, a Zodiac ( ZODC.PA ) executive, BFM Business said. \nA spokesman for Engie declined to comment.
