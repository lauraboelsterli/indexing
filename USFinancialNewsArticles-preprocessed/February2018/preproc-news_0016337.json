    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. Brands are still doing a sterling job of causing a stir on social media. Mercedes sells more cars in China than any other country, so it might have been wise for its social media team to double-check their “MondayMotivation” Instagram post , which featured a Quote: from the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is considered an “anti-China separatist” by Beijing. After coming under attack on Chinese social media and from state-media outlets, Mercedes issued a statement saying, “Although we deleted the relevant information as soon as we could, we know this deeply hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and also our colleagues who work in China.”\nSnap Your Hands Say Yeah Companies that make the majority of their money through advertising always hope to celebrate a strong fourth quarter, and Snap, after a run of disappointing results, delivered. The company beat Wall Street estimates on revenue and user growth , and reduced its net loss more than expected. What went so right? Snap’s self-serve offering really revved into gear, with the company saying more than 90% of ads on the platform were bought programmatically in the quarter, up from 80% in the prior quarter. The shift to self-serve has helped bring more small- to medium-size businesses on board, a strategy that helped Google and Facebook dominate the digital ad landscape. It also led to prices falling by 25% sequentially, but Snap is growing the volume of ad impressions it serves: up 90% sequentially and 575% from a year ago. Snap, you’ll remember, is in the middle of rolling out a redesign, and CEO Evan Spiegel said early results suggest people spend more time watching publisher stories, which is where it houses lots of premium ads. (Indeed, Snap said publishing partners received “more than $100 million” in ad revenue share deals last year, up from $58 million in 2016.) Now to do it all over again in Q1!\n—Snapaday Night Live—\nOne way to keep advertisers returning is with a constant pipeline of new products and features. As WSJ reports, Snap is now launching a tool to let TV networks show live broadcasts directly in the app. The first version of the tool won’t include advertising, but Snap’s likely to monetize the broadcasts in the future. First to use the tool is NBC, which will broadcast live segments of big moments from the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. NBC invested $500 million in Snap’s IPO, which explains why it’s often the first to try out and champion new products like these.\nJust Like You I Got My Vices We reported last year that new media darlings were hitting turbulence and failing to meet their numbers. WSJ’s Keach Hagey now has more details on Vice: The digital media outfit missed its $805 million revenue target for 2017 by more than $100 million . The shortfall is largely due to the company’s struggling cable channel, Viceland, which is only drawing an average of 55,000 prime-time viewers among the 18-to-49 demo. Another setback: Vice Co-President Andrew Creighton, who leads Vice’s ad business, is on leave after sexual-harassment allegations in a New York Times report. Sources say he’s unlikely to return to his current role. Mr. Creighton, who has denied the allegations, didn’t respond to requests for comment and Vice says the company’s investigation into the matter is ongoing. The situation with Mr. Creighton is complicating efforts to fill out the executive ranks to give more support to CEO Shane Smith. All this said, Vice says it posted double-digit revenue growth in 2017 and recorded its highest web traffic ever. But, even with a valuation of $5.7 billion, Vice is struggling to meet the expectations of its big-name and deep-pocketed investors.\nTangled The rise of cord-cutting and the shift of younger consumers to content consumption on digital channels has traditional broadcasters experimenting with new platforms like Snapchat but also their own direct-to-consumer offerings. Disney gave us some more details on ESPN Plus , due to launch this spring, on Tuesday during its first-quarter earnings call. It’ll cost $4.99 a month and feature news and other ad-supported content. That will sit alongside feeds of ESPN channels for cable subscribers and some additional content from sports including soccer and hockey that don’t make it onto the linear channels. ESPN’s ad revenue fell 11% in the quarter, because of lower ratings and the timing of college football playoff games, two of which shifted to the second quarter this year. In the broadcast division, Disney said double-digit affiliate growth was offset by lower ad revenue, reflecting a ratings decline at ABC and spending on political ads in the year-earlier period.\nWendy’s House Photo: Getty Images CMO Today’s Suzanne Vranica has the scoop : Wendy Clark, the CEO of DDB North America, is being elevated to worldwide chief of the agency. Ms. Clark assumes the post from Chuck Brymer, who had been the head of DDB Worldwide since 2006 and will become chairman. Since joining the Omnicom-owned agency in 2016 from Coca-Cola, Ms. Clark helped DDB North America return to revenue growth, partly by winning new business from brands such as McDonald’s, Miller Lite and Kellogg. “The last two years has been about stabilizing our relationships, proving that we know the business, delivering results and then getting the opportunity to expand” the work we do for marketers, Ms. Clark said. In her new role, she faces plenty of headwinds. Marketers continue to cut back on how much they are willing to pay agencies, and companies are increasingly doing more content creation in-house. “As a client, what I wanted [from my agency] was the scale and creativity of a big network, but I wanted something that was nimble and agile,” she said. “That is what DDB is trying to do.”\nBest of the rest Tronc is in advanced talks to sell the Los Angeles Times to billionaire investor Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong for around $500 million. [ WSJ ]\nViacom is shaking up the leadership at Nickelodeon, giving Sarah Levy, the executive in charge of operations and strategy at Viacom’s other domestic and international networks, a remit to help oversee the children’s television network. Viacom also laid off approximately 100 employees as part of an effort to save $100 million. [ WSJ ]\nSpaceX’s big rocket launch on Tuesday was also a huge marketing vehicle for Elon Musk’s other business. The rocket is carrying a cherry-red Tesla Roadster, manned by a dummy, with David Bowie’s “Life on Mars” playing on repeat. [ The Atlantic ]\nNielsen has created a new metric to measure the effectiveness of branded product integrations across platforms. [ Adweek ]\nFacebook hired a full-time pollster last year to monitor Mark Zuckerberg’s approval ratings. But Tavis McGinn quit after six months after realizing he “was not going to be able to change the way that the company does business.” [ The Verge ]\nAmanda Hill, the chief marketing officer at A+E Networks, is leaving the company in May to become chief marketing officer and chief customer experience officer at Harrods, the London department store.
