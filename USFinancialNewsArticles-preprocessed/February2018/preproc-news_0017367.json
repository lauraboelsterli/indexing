The following dates apply to the distribution declared:\nEx-Date: February 16, 2018\nRecord Date: February 20, 2018\nPayable Date: February 28, 2018\nA portion of the distribution may be treated as paid from sources other than net income, including but not limited to short-term capital gain, long-term capital gain and return of capital.
