    "text": "HIGHLAND HEIGHTS, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- General Cable Corporation (NYSE: BGC) reported today results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. For the quarter, reported earnings per share was $0.31 and reported operating income was $8 million. Adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating income were $0.03 and $20 million, respectively, for the quarter. See page two of this press release for the reconciliation of reported to adjusted results and related disclosures.\nMichael T. McDonnell, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our fourth quarter reflects improved performance in Latin America and demand stability of key businesses in North America (electric utility, construction and automotive) and Europe (land turnkey). Although industry dynamics, especially in Europe, and business uncertainties resulting from our review of strategic alternatives did impact results, our 2018 outlook is positive based on trends we have seen since the beginning of this year.” McDonnell added, “We are also pleased to have now received our stockholders’ approval for the pending merger with Prysmian S.p.A., and we continue to expect the merger to be completed by the third quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.”\nSummary\nAnnounced, at its special meeting of common stockholders on February 16, 2018, a majority of the votes cast, which also represented a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, voted to approve the adoption of the previously announced definitive merger agreement under which Prysmian will acquire General Cable for $30.00 per share in cash Reported operating income of $8 million primarily impacted by charges of $15 million related to the review of strategic alternatives that resulted in the previously announced definitive merger agreement with Prysmian Adjusted operating income of $20 million decreased $7 million year over year as restructuring savings and continued performance improvement in Latin America were offset by ongoing challenging industry dynamics particularly in Europe and unfavorable product mix in North America Operating cash flow was a use of $39 million for the full year of 2017 including payments totaling $82 million for the resolution of FCPA related matters Completed the divestiture program focused on the sale or liquidation of non-core operations in Asia Pacific and Africa generating total proceeds of approximately $260 million consistent with management’s expectations Maintained significant liquidity with $326 million of availability on the Company’s $700 million asset-based revolving credit facility and $85 million of cash and cash equivalents Impact of rising metal prices was a benefit of $4 million and $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively\nFourth Quarter Segment Demand\nNorth America – Unit volume as measured in metal pounds sold was up 5% versus prior year driven by stronger demand for aerial transmission cables and construction products.\nEurope – Unit volume as measured in metal pounds sold was up 6% versus prior year as stronger demand for electric utility products including land turnkey projects helped to more than offset lower subsea project activity and weakness in industrial and construction markets.\nLatin America – Unit volume as measured in metal pounds sold was down 6% versus prior year driven by uneven spending on electric infrastructure and construction projects throughout the region as well as the impact of the Company’s go-to-market initiatives (focused on margin improvement). Shipments of aerial transmission cables in Brazil were up sharply year over year.\nNet Debt\nAt the end of 2017 and 2016, total debt was $1,086 million and $939 million, respectively, and cash and cash equivalents were $85 million and $101 million, respectively. The increase in net debt was principally driven by payments totaling $82 million related to the resolution of FCPA matters as well as investments in working capital (partly due to higher metal prices) and funding of restructuring actions.\nOther Matters – Income Taxes\nThe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”) provides for a one-time deemed taxable repatriation of the Company’s off-shore accumulated earnings. This deemed repatriation resulted in a preliminary estimate of $46 million of noncash deferred tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 as the deemed repatriation income was offset by existing net operating losses. In addition, the Tax Reform Act provides for the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective for 2018. Accordingly, the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were required to be remeasured in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in a preliminary estimated noncash deferred tax benefit of approximately $62 million. Prospectively, the Company expects its reported earnings to be favorably impacted by the reduced U.S. tax rate.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted operating income (defined as operating income before extraordinary, nonrecurring or unusual charges and other certain items), adjusted earnings per share (defined as diluted earnings per share before extraordinary, nonrecurring or unusual charges and other certain items) and net debt (defined as long-term debt plus current portion of long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents) are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Metal-adjusted revenues, and return on metal-adjusted sales on a segment basis, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, are also provided herein. See “Segment Information.”\nThese Company-defined non-GAAP financial measures exclude from reported results those items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing performance and are being provided herein because management believes they are useful in analyzing the operating performance of the business and are consistent with how management reviews our operating results and the underlying business trends. Use of these non-GAAP measures may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies and should only be used in conjunction with the Company’s results reported according to GAAP. Historical segment adjusted operating results are disclosed in the Fourth Quarter 2017 Investor Presentation available on the Company’s website.\nA reconciliation of GAAP operating income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share to adjusted operating income and earnings per share follows:\nFourth Quarter of 2017 versus Fourth Quarter of 2016 Fourth Quarter 2017 2016 Operating Operating In millions, except per share amounts Income EPS Income EPS Reported $ 7.5 $ 0.31 $ (96.8 ) $ (2.10 ) Adjustments to reconcile operating Income/EPS Non-cash convertible debt interest expense (1) - 0.01 - 0.01 Mark to market (gain) loss on derivative instruments (2) - (0.11 ) - (0.08 ) Restructuring and divestiture costs (3) 17.6 0.20 27.8 0.44 Legal and investigative costs (4) 0.3 - (0.7 ) (0.01 ) (Gain) loss on sale of assets (5) - - 1.0 0.02 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) accrual (6) - - 49.3 0.99 US Pension Settlement (7) - - 7.4 0.12 Asia Pacific and Africa (income)/loss (8) (5.3 ) (0.07 ) 39.3 0.66 Tax reform act (9) - (0.31 ) - - Total adjustments 12.6 (0.28 ) 124.1 2.15 Adjusted $ 20.1 $ 0.03 $ 27.3 $ 0.05 NOTE: The tables above reflect EPS adjustments based on the Company's full year effective tax rate for 2017 of 40% and 2016 of 50%. (1) The Company's adjustment for the non-cash convertible debt interest expense reflects the accretion of the equity component of the 2029 convertible notes, which is reflected in the income statement as interest expense. (2) Mark to market (gains) and losses on derivative instruments represents the current period changes in the fair value of commodity instruments designated as economic hedges. The Company adjusts for the changes in fair values of these commodity instruments as the earnings associated with the underlying contracts have not been recorded in the same period. (3) Restructuring and divestiture costs represent costs associated with the Company's announced restructuring and divestiture programs as well as costs associated with the review of strategic alternatives that resulted in the previously announced definitive merger agreement with Prysmian. Examples consist of, but are not limited to, employee separation costs, asset write-downs, accelerated depreciation, working capital write-downs, equipment relocation, contract terminations, consulting fees and legal costs. The Company adjusts for these charges as management believes these costs will not continue at the conclusion of both the restructuring and divestiture programs and closing of the merger. (4) Legal and investigative costs represent costs incurred for external legal counsel and forensic accounting firms in connection with the restatement of our financial statements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation. The Company adjusts for these charges as management believes these costs will not continue at the conclusion of these investigations which are considered to be outside the normal course of business. (5) Gains and losses on the sale of assets are the result of divesting certain General Cable businesses. The Company adjusts for these gains and losses as management believes the gains and losses are one-time in nature and will not occur as part of the ongoing operations. (6) Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) accrual represents the Company’s additional accruals recorded in 2016 to settle the investigations with the SEC and the DOJ. The Company adjusts for this accrual as management believes this is a one-time charge and will not occur as part of ongoing operations. (7) The US pension settlement charge is a one-time cost related to the lump sum payment to term-vested participants of the US Master Pension Plan. This charge represents the payments made to those participants who elected to take the lump sum payment and for which the Company no longer has obligations to pay in the future. The Company has adjusted for this US pension settlement charge as management does not expect it to occur in the future, nor is it part of the ongoing operations. (8) The adjustment excludes the impact of operations in the Africa and Asia Pacific segment which are not considered \"core operations\" under the Company's strategic roadmap. The Company has divested or closed these operations which are not expected to continue as part of the ongoing business. For accounting purposes, the continuing operations in Africa and Asia Pacific do not meet the requirement to be presented as discontinued operations. Fourth quarter 2017 reflects a pre-tax gain of $5.4 million on the liquidation of our New Zealand business. Fourth quarter 2016 reflects the non-cash impacts of a $28 million currency translation reclassification out of accumulated other comprehensive income related to the closure of our South African Facilities and an $11 million asset impairment charge for the Company’s business in China. (9) The tax reform act adjustment relates to the effect on the Company’s financial statements resulting from the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See “Other Matters – Income Taxes” on page 2 of this press release. The Company adjusts for the enactment of the Tax Reform Act as management believes this is a one-time net benefit and will not occur as part of ongoing operations.
