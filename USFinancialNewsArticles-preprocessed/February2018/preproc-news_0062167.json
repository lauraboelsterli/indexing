The bank’s state owners on Wednesday said that they sealed the sale to a consortium of buyout groups Cerberus and J.C. Flowers, with investors Goldentree, Centaurus and Austrian bank BAWAG ( BAWG.VI ) also taking stakes. The purchase price for 94.9 percent of HSH is roughly 1 billion euros (£879.6 million), they said. The buyers had been since mid-January in exclusive talks with HSH’s owners, the German regional states of Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg as well as regional savings banks.
