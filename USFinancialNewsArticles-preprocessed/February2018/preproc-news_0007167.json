This press release may contain “forward-looking statements” with respect to the Tender Offers, the Redemption, the Satisfaction and Discharge, our business, results of operations and financial condition, and our expectations or beliefs concerning future events and conditions. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as, but not limited to, “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “should,” “approximately,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “targets,” likely,” “will,” “would,” “could” and similar expressions (or the negative of these terminologies or expressions). All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Many risks and uncertainties are inherent in our industry and markets. Others are more specific to our business and operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the ability of Constellium and Wise Metals to achieve expected synergies and the timing thereof, Constellium’s increased levels of indebtedness which could limit Constellium’s operating flexibility and opportunities; the potential failure to retain key employees, the loss of customers, suppliers and other business relationships; disruptions to business operations; slower or lower than expected growth in the North American market for Body-in-White aluminium rolled products, and other risk factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 20-F and our registration statement on Form F-3, filed on October 30, 2017, and as described from time to time in subsequent reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The occurrence of the events described and the achievement of the expected results depend on many events, some or all of which are not predictable or within our control. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nRyan Wentling – Investor Relations\nPhone: +1 (212) 675-5450\nInvestor-relations@constellium.com\nNicolas Brun – Communications\nPhone : +33 1 73 01 46 13\nNicolas.brun@constellium.com\nDelphine Dahan-Kocher – Communications\nPhone: +1 (212) 858 9963\ndelphine.dahan-kocher@constellium.com\nSource: Constellium Paris",
