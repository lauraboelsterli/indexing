    "text": "SHERBROOKE, Québec--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Excel Management Inc. is pleased to announce it will acquire the business of Active Claims Management Inc. (ACM), as well as CanAm Special Risk Insurance Agency Limited, effective March 1, 2018 or such later date when all conditions of closing are met.\nWith this acquisition, Global Excel reinforces its position as a leading supplier of global healthcare risk management solutions. Both ACM and CanAm will continue doing business under their current brand names. Concurrently, David Rivelis has been added to the Global Excel executive leadership team as President of ACM and CanAm.\n“ACM has built a very strong reputation for providing medical assistance services focused on the Canadian travel insurance industry,” said Reg Allatt, CEO of Global Excel. “Delivering a comprehensive range of healthcare risk management services, which exceed our clients’ expectations, has always been our primary focus. One thing we’ve been emphasizing to our clients is that true risk management needs to occur very early in the claims cycle. Early intervention has a direct impact on reducing claims costs while providing an improved customer journey. This acquisition strengthens our capacity to provide pro-active medical assistance and case management.”\nGlobal Excel’s core values include customer service excellence and commitment to people, and as noted by Mr. Allatt, “it’s a perfect fit in that both organizations share the same qualities – a very strong client focus and dedicated, knowledgeable employees. Moving forward we will continue our strategy of expanding the depth of our risk management services, our client base, as well as our geographic presence though continued profitable organic growth and qualified acquisitions.”\nAccording to David Rivelis, “the ACM team prides itself on service and customer satisfaction. In an industry that truly revolves around people, these factors have been fundamental to our success. Over the years we’ve come to know Global Excel well, both as a competitor and as a partner. We recognize an industry leader with a determined international focus in Global Excel. We feel this transaction will provide synergies for ACM on the domestic level and will allow us to further grow our international scope.”\nOver the next few months the goal of both management teams will be continuing to focus on providing the highest level of service to our respective clients. Simultaneously Global Excel and ACM will focus on identifying those synergies which will bring added value to existing clients and allow them to extend their service offering to new markets and clients.\nAbout Global Excel Management Inc.\nGlobal Excel is a full-service provider of global healthcare risk management solutions.
