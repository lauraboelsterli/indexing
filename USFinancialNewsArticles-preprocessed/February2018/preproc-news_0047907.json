    "text": "REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\niPass Inc. (NASDAQ:IPAS), a leading provider of global mobile connectivity, reported total revenue of $13.2 million, GAAP net loss of $4.3 million, and Adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and total revenue of $54.4 million, GAAP net loss of $20.6 million, and Adjusted EBITDA loss of $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n“While 2017 was not a memorable year for us, we did accomplish much to set us up well for 2018,\" said Gary Griffiths, president and CEO. \"We made great progress in Q4, for example, to restructure our agreements with our network supply partners, lowering our revenue break-even point. And while iPass SmartConnect TM experienced growing pains typical for new technology last year, it is now stable with several enhanced features. So, given that, we expect 2018 will be the year to prove that our iPass SmartConnect software and Veri-Fi TM big data analytics products, under development over the last two years, can transform iPass from a Wi-Fi reseller to a true technology company. We expect revenues from Veri-Fi and technology licensing to represent more than 10% of total revenue, up from 2% in 2017, which will mark an inflection point for us. Several game changing trials or proof of concepts are in various stages, and, based on recent activity, we finally expect our partnership with HP to start regaining momentum. We have other new initiatives well underway such as continual improvement of our enterprise value proposition, adding high demand inflight footprint such as United Airlines, and integrating the data driven analytics that enterprises need to effectively manage their mobile connectivity digital agenda.\"\nFinancial Metrics\nRevenue of $13.2 million in the fourth quarter included $1.0 million in non-recurring revenue. Net Annual Contract Value (ACV), defined as the annualized sales value under committed contract for newly acquired or significant upsell customers signed, in Q4’17 totaled $1.2 million. Total net ACV for 2017 was $1.9 million. Customer Churn , defined as the annualized impact on revenue, based on the prior quarter run-rate, of any customer that terminates or has write-down of committed contract value, was $1.0 million in Q4’17. Total customer churn for 2017 was $5.4 million compared to $9.1 million in 2016. Network Access Cost (NAC) was $9.1 million in the fourth quarter, down from $10.3 million in the third quarter. On a cost per hour basis, NAC was $3.86 in 2017, down from $4.02 in 2016 and $4.80 in 2015. Capital Raise was $1.2 million in the quarter from the common stock purchase agreement signed in November 2017, which provides up to $10.0 million under the agreement.\nFinancial Outlook\n\"We have two simple goals for 2018: returning to revenue growth and achieving positive quarterly cash flow,\" continued Griffiths. \"We have successfully re-negotiated the majority of our 2018 NAC commitments to carve approximately $10.0 million out of the 2017 annual expense. We will manage operating expense to minimize our revenue break-even point and with modest quarterly revenue growth expect to be cash flow positive by the second half of 2018. Finally, we will be opportunistic as we look to strengthen our balance sheet and optimize shareholder value.”\nFinancial Guidance\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018:\nTotal Revenue Growth from $54.4 million in 2017 Adjusted EBITDA Loss (1) Better than $3.3 million loss (1) A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA loss to GAAP net loss is provided in the attached schedules. The accompanying guidance for Adjusted EBITDA loss excludes foreign exchange gain or loss estimates.\nSelected Financial Results\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited; in millions) Revenue Mobile Connectivity Services $ 13.2 $ 13.4 $ 16.1 $ 54.4 $ 63.2 Enterprise 10.0 9.7 12.1 41.8 49.1 Strategic Partnerships 2.8 3.3 3.5 11.0 11.9 Legacy iPC 0.4 0.4 0.5 1.6 2.2 Network Access Costs 9.1 10.3 8.8 38.5 33.2 Gross Margin (1) 20.9 % 10.9 % 34.9 % 17.7 % 35.8 % Network Operations Expense 1.4 1.6 1.7 6.2 7.4 R&D, S&M and G&A Expense 7.3 7.9 7.0 29.8 29.2 Restructuring Expense — — — — 0.8 Total Operating Expenses 8.7 9.5 8.7 36 37.4 Other (Expense) income, net 0.3 (0.3 ) 0.1 (0.5 ) (0.4 ) GAAP Total Net Loss (4.3 ) (6.7 ) (1.3 ) (20.6 ) (7.8 ) Adjusted EBITDA Loss (2) (3.8 ) (4.9 ) (0.5 ) (16.5 ) (3.2 ) As of December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Shares of Common Stock Outstanding at Period End 69.3 66.7 65.8 69.3 65.8 Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 5.2 $ 7.1 $ 16.1 $ 5.2 $ 16.1 Deferred Revenue (Short-term plus Long-term) $ 3.8 $ 2.8 $ 2.5 $ 3.8 $ 2.5 (1) Gross Margin is defined as Total Revenue less Network Access Costs less Network Operations expense divided by Total Revenue.

Wi-Fi Network Users (Enterprise and Strategic Partnerships) is the number of iPass platform users each month in a given quarter that used Wi-Fi network services from iPass. Active Platform Users is the number of users who were billed platform fees and who have used or deployed the platform during the period. This metric excludes UNLIMITED subscribers unless they have actively accessed network during the period. Hours Consumed represent the number of network hours consumed by our customers each month in a given quarter. ACV represents the annualized sales value committed under contract for newly acquired customers or significant upsell, in total across Enterprise and Strategic Partnerships.\nFor the Quarter Ended (in thousands) December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 Wi-Fi Network Users: Enterprise 65 68 74 76 81 Strategic Partnerships 53 69 65 48 47 Total Wi-Fi Network Users 118 137 139 124 128 Active Platform Users 774 742 786 752 732 Hours Consumed 771 943 848 770 795 Annual Contract Value $ 1,183 $ 933 $ (991 ) $ 780 $ 4,771\nConference Call\niPass will host a live conference call today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern time).

Actual results may the expectations contained in these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following: the risk that consumers and customers will not perceive the benefits of the iPass UNLIMITED, iPass EVERYWHERE and iPass INVISIBLE initiatives to be as iPass expects; the risk that iPass will not be able to achieve the cost savings that iPass currently expects; the risk that the “End of Life” of iPass’ legacy Mobile Office product may negatively impact customer retention and mobility revenues more than iPass expects; the risk that the iPass solution will not continue to achieve the market acceptance iPass expects; the risk of material reductions in iPass customers’ existing minimum commitments more than iPass currently expects; the risk that iPass does not accurately predict usage for its Enterprise flat rate price plans which could result in iPass expenses exceeding revenues for these plans; the risk that iPass customers do not widely deploy iPass Open Mobile on smartphones, tablets and other mobile handheld devices at the rate iPass expects; the risk that demand for Mobility Services does not grow as iPass expects; the risk that strong competition in the market for Mobility Services could reduce demand for iPass’ services; and the risk that a meaningful portion of iPass business is international, which subjects iPass to additional risks such as currency fluctuations. Detailed information about these and other risk factors that could potentially affect iPass’ business, financial condition and results of operations are included in iPass’ Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2017, and available at its Web site at www.sec.gov and the company’s website at http://investor.ipass.com . iPass undertakes no responsibility to update the information in this press release if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be an inaccurate prediction of the actual results.\nIn addition, investors and others should note that iPass announces material financial information to its investors using its investor relations website, SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. iPass also uses social media to communicate with its customers and the public about iPass, its products and services and other matters relating to its business and market. It is possible that the information iPass posts on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, iPass encourages investors, the media, and others interested in iPass to review the information it posts on U.S. social media channels including the iPass Twitter Feed, the iPass LinkedIn Feed, the iPass Google+ Feed, the iPass Facebook Page, the iPass Blog, and the iPass Instagram account. These social media channels may be updated from time to time.\nInformation Regarding Non-GAAP Financial and Operational Measures\nThis press release also contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). iPass considers Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of iPass’ performance that is not required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP.\niPass defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation, out of period adjustment, and nonrecurring legal costs. iPass believes Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful comparison between its core operating results, on a consistent basis, over different periods of time. Accordingly, management uses this financial measure for evaluating and making operating decisions and for purposes of comparison with its strategic plan, operating budgets and allocation of resources.\nFurthermore, iPass believes the use of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors:\nTo provide an additional analytical tool for understanding the company’s financial performance by excluding the impact of items which may obscure trends in the core operating performance of the business; To provide consistency and enhance investors’ ability to compare iPass’ performance across financial reporting periods; and To facilitate comparisons to the operating results of other companies in iPass’ industry, which may use similar financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to net income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than iPass does, which would limit its usefulness in comparing iPass’ financial results with those of such other companies.\nThe company defines a key operating metric, ACV, as the annualized sales value committed under contract for newly acquired customers or significant upsell, in total across the Enterprise and Strategic Partnership go-to-market strategies, in the period. Because ACV is not an alternative measure for GAAP revenue, but only an operational metric to provide insight on the health and progress of the sales pipeline and revised go-to-market strategy, the signing of committed contract value should not be assumed to have met the entire revenue recognition criteria. For example, while persuasive evidence of an arrangement always exist before reporting ACV, service may not yet have been provided to the customer or collections may not yet be determined to be reasonably assured. iPass makes reasonable efforts to substantiate the viability of all reported ACV, but future events could change that conclusion. As an example, when a previously reported ACV customer fails to perform under the committed contract, such remaining calculated ACV will be reversed in the current period reported ACV.\nAbout iPass Inc.\niPass (NASDAQ:IPAS) is a leading provider of global mobile connectivity, offering simple, secure, always-on Wi-Fi access on any mobile device.
