    "text": "13 COMMENTS Regarding Mike Gecan’s “ Better Call Saul: The U.S. Needs Radicalism, Not Extremism ” (op-ed, Feb. 17): To understand President Obama and Hillary Clinton, one must understand Saul Alinsky. At the top of a short presidential resume in 2008, then- Sen. Barack Obama touted himself a “community organizer,” a construct of Saul Alinsky. In 1969 Hillary Clinton wrote a fawning senior thesis on Alinsky. In Alinsky’s 1971 book “Rules for Radicals,” in the chapter titled “Tactics,” he divides the electorate into demographic groups (today’s identity politics) and says the organizer must “rub raw the resentments of the people.” This cynical tactic may win elections but serves as a poison pill for our national cohesion. After eight years of Obama-Clinton we are left to wonder why our culture is so divided and filled with resentment.\nEnter Mr. Gecan to offer Alinsky as the cultural solution to the problem he helped create.\nJohn Noren\nGreenbrae, Calif.\nAlinsky organized people around the propositions of victimhood, resistance, disrespect for others, intimidation and violence. Popular, democratic governance is a product of mutual respect, unity, shared goals and civil liberties, not divide and conquer.\nRichard La Motte\nValencia, Calif.\nSaul Alinsky is no model for American politics. For a truly radical and constructive thinker, try John Locke.\nMarisa Manley\nWestport, Conn.",
