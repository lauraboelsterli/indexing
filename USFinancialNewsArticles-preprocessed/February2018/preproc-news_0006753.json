    "text": "February 4, 2018 / 9:21 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Exclusive: Broadcom to raise bid for Qualcomm to about $120 billion: sources Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd ( AVGO.O ) plans to unveil a new offer of approximately $120 billion for Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) on Monday, aiming to ratchet up pressure on its U.S. semiconductor peer to engage in negotiations, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. \nThe move comes ahead of a Qualcomm shareholder meeting scheduled for March 6, when Broadcom is seeking to replace Qualcomm’s board of directors by nominating its own slate for election. \nBroadcom is scheduled to meet with its advisers later on Sunday to finalize an offer that values Qualcomm between $80 and $82 per share, two of the sources said. Broadcom’s previous $70 per share offer consisted of $60 per share in cash and $10 per share in stock.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nBroadcom also plans to offer Qualcomm a higher-than-usual breakup fee in the event regulators thwart the deal, according to the sources. Typically, such break-up fees equate to approximately 3 percent to 4 percent of a deal’s size. \nThe sources cautioned that Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan may decide to significantly change the terms at the last minute. \nThe sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Broadcom and Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Additional reporting by Liana B.
