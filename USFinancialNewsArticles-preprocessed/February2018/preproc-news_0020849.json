Excluding a favorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.16, the forecast range represents a projected increase of approximately 7% to 10% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 in 2017 as detailed in the attached Schedule 17. This forecast assumes: Net revenue growth, excluding excise taxes, of over 8.0%, excluding currency; Operating cash flow of over $9.0 billion; Capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion; and No share repurchases. This forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as discussed below, and any unusual events. Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.\nImpact of U.S. Tax Reform\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The principal elements of the Act relevant to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, were:\nA reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; and The requirement to pay a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, including 2017 earnings (\"transition tax\").\nIn connection with these elements of the Act, PMI recognized a provisional expense of $1.6 billion, which was included as a component of income tax expense as follows:\nA provisional charge of $1.4 billion, which represents the transition tax of $2.2 billion, net of a reversal of $0.7 billion of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities on part of the accumulated foreign earnings, and other items of $0.1 billion; and Re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using a rate of 21%, which, under the Act, is expected to be in place when such deferred assets and liabilities reverse in the future. In connection with this re-measurement, we recorded a provisional charge of $0.2 billion.\nWhile the impacts of the Act reduced net earnings by $1.6 billion, there was no net impact on operating cash flows for the year, as the changes in deferred taxes and income taxes payable offset the net earnings impact. At December 31, 2017, PMI recorded an income tax payable of $1.7 billion representing the transition tax of $2.2 billion, primarily offset by foreign tax credits related to foreign withholding taxes previously paid of $0.5 billion. The income tax payable is due over an 8-year period beginning in 2018.\nOther provisions of the Act did not have a significant impact on PMI’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, but may impact the effective tax rate in subsequent periods.\nThe Act has significant complexity and our final tax liability may materially differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in PMI's assumptions, guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service and related interpretations and clarifications of tax law. For the transition tax, further information is required to finalize the estimated amount of accumulated foreign earnings as well as to validate the amount of earnings represented by the aggregate foreign cash position as defined in the Act. For the re-measurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities, further analysis will be required to refine PMI's calculations and related account balances. PMI will complete the remaining elements of its analysis during 2018, and any adjustments to the provisional charges will be included in income tax expense or benefit in the appropriate period, in accordance with guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.\nFollowing the enactment of the Act, PMI's 2018 full-year diluted earnings per share forecast -- based on the current interpretation of the legislation -- assumes a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 28%, subject to future regulatory developments and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction. The difference between the 21% statutory rate under the new law and PMI's effective rate reflects the fact that PMI operates in markets outside of the United States and is driven by three main factors: foreign tax rate differences, non-deductibility of interest expense and a partial disallowance of foreign tax credits related to the application of the rules for global intangible low-taxed income.\n2017 FULL-YEAR AND FOURTH-QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE/Euronext Paris: PM) today announced its 2017 full-year and fourth-quarter results.\n\"A strong fourth-quarter performance helped drive robust full-year results, exemplified by currency-neutral, double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, despite previously disclosed challenges in Russia and Saudi Arabia,\" said André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer.\n\"The excellent performance of our flagship smoke-free product IQOS -- not only in Asia, but also in the vast majority of our launch geographies -- underscored its great promise and the commitment of our employees to lead the transformation of our industry towards a smoke-free future. Continued investment behind IQOS in 2018 is expected to further drive its positive momentum.\"\n\"For the first time since 2011, we have entered the year with annual guidance that reflects a positive currency impact. Our combustible product portfolio provides us with a strong foundation. The confirmed potential of our smoke-free alternatives reinforces our strong determination to deploy all necessary resources to accelerate their growth, which will drive our business success and ability to generously reward our shareholders over the long term.\"\nConference Call\nA conference call, hosted by André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer, and Martin King, Chief Financial Officer, with members of the investor community and news media, will be webcast at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 8, 2018. Access is at www.pmi.com/2017Q4earnings . The audio webcast may also be accessed on iOS or Android devices by downloading PMI’s free Investor Relations Mobile Application at www.pmi.com/irapp .\nDividends\nDuring 2017, PMI increased its regular quarterly dividend by 2.9%, from $1.04 to $1.07, representing an annualized rate of $4.28 per common share. Since its spin-off in March 2008, PMI has increased its regular quarterly dividend by 132.6% from the initial annualized rate of $1.84 per common share, or a compound annual growth rate of 9.8%.\nKey Terms, Definitions and Explanatory Notes\nGeneral\n“PMI” refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries. Trademarks and service marks that are the registered property of, or licensed by, the subsidiaries of PMI, are italicized. Comparisons are made to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, PMI volume and PMI market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units. References to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares are PMI estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or PMI's duty free business. \"Combustible products\" is the term PMI uses to refer to cigarettes and OTP, combined. \"OTP\" is defined as other tobacco products, primarily roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos, and does not include reduced-risk products. \"Total shipment volume\" is defined as the combined total of cigarette shipment volume and heated tobacco unit shipment volume. \"EEMA\" is defined as Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa and includes PMI's international duty free business. \"North Africa\" is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.\nFinancial\nNet revenues, excluding excise taxes, related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, net of sales and promotion incentives. \"Operating Companies Income,\" or \"OCI,\" is defined as operating income, excluding general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles, plus equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, net. Management evaluates business segment performance and allocates resources based on OCI. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding asset impairment and exit costs, and unusual items. \"Net debt\" is defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents. Management reviews OCI, OCI margins, operating cash flow and earnings per share, or “EPS,” on an adjusted basis, which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, tax items and other special items. Management reviews these measures because they exclude changes in currency exchange rates and other factors that may distort underlying business trends, thereby improving the comparability of PMI’s business performance between reporting periods. Furthermore, PMI uses several of these measures in its management compensation program to promote internal fairness and a disciplined assessment of performance against company targets. PMI discloses these measures to enable investors to view the business through the eyes of management. Non-GAAP measures used in this release should neither be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see the relevant schedules provided with this press release.\nReduced-Risk Products\n\"Reduced-risk products,\" or \"RRPs,\" is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Because PMI's RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful compounds than found in cigarette smoke. \"Heated tobacco units\" is the term PMI uses to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include the company's HEETS, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO, defined collectively as HEETS, as well as Marlboro HeatSticks and Parliament HeatSticks. Net revenues, excluding excise taxes, related to RRPs represent the sale of heated tobacco units, IQOS devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, primarily e-vapor products, net of sales and promotion incentives.\nSHIPMENT VOLUME\nPMI Shipment Volume by Region\nFourth-Quarter\nFull-Year\n(million units) 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Cigarettes\nEuropean Union 45,881 45,193 1.5 % 187,293 193,586 (3.3 )% EEMA 66,332 67,763 (2.1 )% 256,157 271,393 (5.6 )% Asia 61,234 63,815 (4.0 )% 234,253 260,029 (9.9 )% Latin America & Canada 22,922 23,794 (3.7 )% 84,223 87,938 (4.2 )% Total PMI 196,369 200,565 (2.1 )% 761,926 812,946 (6.3 )% Heated Tobacco Units\nEuropean Union 849 122 +100.0% 1,889 224 +100.0% EEMA 820 63 +100.0% 1,581 100 +100.0% Asia 14,032 3,510 +100.0% 32,729 7,070 +100.0% Latin America & Canada 15 — — % 27 — — % Total PMI 15,716 3,695 +100.0% 36,226 7,394 +100.0% Cigarettes and Heated Tobacco Units\nEuropean Union 46,730 45,315 3.1 % 189,182 193,810 (2.4 )% EEMA 67,152 67,826 (1.0 )% 257,738 271,493 (5.1 )% Asia 75,266 67,325 11.8 % 266,982 267,099 — % Latin America & Canada 22,937 23,794 (3.6 )% 84,250 87,938 (4.2 )% Total PMI 212,085 204,260 3.8 % 798,152 820,340 (2.7 )% 2017 Full-Year\nEstimated international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding China and the United States, of 2.8 trillion, down by 2.8%\nPMI's total shipment volume decreased by 2.7%, principally due to:\nthe EU, notably reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume in Greece, Italy and Spain, partly offset by higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume; EEMA, notably reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume in Russia, Saudi Arabia - where PMI's cigarette shipment volume declined by 35.8%, impacted by the new excise tax implemented in June 2017 that resulted in the doubling of retail prices - and Ukraine; partly offset by higher cigarette shipment volume in North Africa, notably Algeria, and higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume; Asia, notably reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Pakistan - impacted by excise tax-driven price increases and an increase in the prevalence of illicit trade - and the Philippines; fully offset by higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume, mainly in Japan and Korea; and Latin America & Canada, notably reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia and Mexico.\nExcluding the favorable net impact of estimated cigarette and heated tobacco unit inventory movements of approximately 3.3 billion units, PMI's total shipment volume decreased by 3.1%. The favorable inventory movements were driven primarily by approximately 8.5 billion units net in Japan reflecting: the increasing demand for HeatSticks, anticipated to further increase in the first quarter of 2018 following a planned lifting of the restriction on IQOS device sales; the establishment of appropriate distributor inventory levels of heated tobacco units, given the current high dependence on a single manufacturing center; and the transition from air freight to sea freight of heated tobacco units, largely completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. These favorable inventory movements were partly offset by a reduction of combustible product inventory levels, mainly in: the EU, notably Italy and Spain; and EEMA, notably North Africa, Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n2017 Fourth-Quarter\nPMI's total shipment volume increased by 3.8%, principally driven by:\nthe EU, notably reflecting higher cigarette shipment volume in France, Germany and Portugal, partly offset by lower cigarette shipment volume in Spain; and Higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across all Regions, notably in Asia driven by Japan and Korea.\nThe increase in PMI's total shipment volume was partly offset by lower cigarette shipment volume in:\nEEMA, notably Russia, as well as Saudi Arabia where PMI's cigarette shipment volume declined by 60.3%, reflecting the impact of the aforementioned new excise tax, partly offset by North Africa, notably Algeria, and Turkey; Asia, notably Japan and Korea, partly offset by the Philippines; and Latin America & Canada, notably Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, partly offset by Mexico and Venezuela.\nExcluding the favorable net impact of estimated cigarette and heated tobacco unit inventory movements of approximately 5.0 billion units, driven primarily by Japan, reflecting the same dynamics as for the full year, PMI's total shipment volume increased by 1.4%.\nPMI shipment volume by brand is shown in the table below.\nPMI Shipment Volume by Brand\nFourth-Quarter\nFull-Year\n(million units) 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Cigarettes\nMarlboro 70,251 70,295 (0.1 )% 270,366 281,720 (4.0 )% L&M 21,726 23,177 (6.3 )% 90,817 96,770 (6.2 )% Chesterfield 14,764 12,088 22.1 % 55,075 46,291 19.0 % Philip Morris 12,389 9,069 36.6 % 48,522 35,914 35.1 % Parliament 12,243 11,424 7.2 % 43,965 45,671 (3.7 )% Bond Street 9,312 11,775 (20.9 )% 37,987 44,567 (14.8 )% Lark 5,838 6,540 (10.7 )% 24,373 27,571 (11.6 )% Others 49,846 56,197 (11.3 )% 190,821 234,442 (18.6 )% Total Cigarettes 196,369 200,565 (2.1 )% 761,926 812,946 (6.3 )% Heated Tobacco Units 15,716 3,695 +100.0% 36,226 7,394 +100.0% Total PMI 212,085 204,260 3.8 % 798,152 820,340 (2.7 )% 2017 Full-Year\nPMI's cigarette shipment volume of Marlboro decreased in: the EU, mainly due to Greece, Italy and Spain; EEMA, predominantly due to Saudi Arabia, reflecting the impact of the new excise tax implemented in June 2017 that resulted in the doubling of the retail price of Marlboro from SAR 12 to SAR 24 per pack, partly offset by North Africa, notably Algeria and Egypt, and Turkey; Asia, mainly due to Japan and Korea, principally reflecting out-switching to heated tobacco products, partly offset by Indonesia and the Philippines; and Latin America & Canada, mainly due to Argentina and Brazil.\nPMI's cigarette shipment volume of the following brands decreased: L&M, mainly due to Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, partly offset by Algeria, Argentina, Colombia and Kazakhstan; Parliament, mainly due to Japan, Russia and Saudi Arabia, partly offset by Kazakhstan; Bond Street, mainly due to Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine; Lark, principally due to Japan; and \"Others,\" mainly due to low-price brands in Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia and Ukraine.\nPMI's cigarette shipment volume of the following brands increased: Chesterfield, notably driven by Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Venezuela, partly offset by Italy and Russia; and Philip Morris, mainly driven by Russia and Ukraine, notably reflecting successful portfolio consolidation of local, low-price brands in \"Others,\" partly offset by Argentina and Italy.\n2017 Fourth-Quarter\nPMI's cigarette shipment volume of Marlboro was essentially flat, with declines in: EEMA, predominantly due to Saudi Arabia, reflecting the same dynamic as for the full year, partly offset by North Africa, notably Algeria and Egypt; and Latin America & Canada, mainly due to Argentina and Brazil; offset by growth in the EU, driven notably by France, Germany and Italy.

Pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.\nPMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials; and the integrity of its information systems. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent.\nPMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.\nSchedule 1 PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INC.\nand Subsidiaries\nCondensed Statements of Earnings\nFor the Quarters Ended December 31,\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n(Unaudited) 2017 2016 % Change Net Revenues $ 21,585 $ 19,189 12.5 % Cost of sales 3,001 2,499 20.1 % Excise Taxes on products (1) 13,291 12,218 8.8 % Gross profit 5,293 4,472 18.4 % Marketing, administration and research costs 1,952 1,842 Asset impairment and exit costs — — Amortization of intangibles 23 18 Operating Income (2) 3,318 2,612 27.0 % Interest expense, net 259 201 Earnings before income taxes 3,059 2,411 26.9 % Provision for income taxes 2,265 658 100+% Equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, net (2 ) (22 ) Net Earnings 796 1,775 (55.2 )% Net Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 102 64 Net Earnings attributable to PMI $ 694 $ 1,711 (59.4 )% Per share data (3): Basic Earnings Per Share $ 0.44 $ 1.10 (60.0 )% Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.44 $ 1.10 (60.0 )% (1) The segment detail of Excise Taxes on products sold for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is shown\non Schedule 2.\n(2) PMI's management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on operating companies income,\nwhich PMI defines as operating income, excluding general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, plus\nequity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, net.

revenue amounts for our combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, net of sales and promotion incentives. These net revenue amounts consist of\nthe sale of our cigarettes and other tobacco products combined. Other tobacco products primarily include tobacco for roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos and do\nnot include reduced-risk products.\n(2) Net revenue amounts for our reduced-risk products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, net of sales and promotion incentives. These net revenue amounts consist of\nthe sale of our heated tobacco units, our IQOS devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, which primarily include our e-vapor products. Reduced-risk products is the term we\nuse to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.
