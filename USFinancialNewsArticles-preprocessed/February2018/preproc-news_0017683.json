    "text": "MEDFORD, N.Y., Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chembio Diagnostics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CEMI) (“Chembio”), a leader in point-of-care diagnostic tests for infectious diseases, announced today that it has won a three-year tender from the Ethiopia Pharmaceuticals Fund and Supply Agency to deliver its HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK ® Assay with a total contract value of $15.8 million. The contract was awarded through its distributor in Ethiopia. The Company expects shipments to begin during the second quarter of 2018.\nChembio also announced that revenue for full year 2017 is expected to be in the range of $23.7 million to $24.0 million. Cash and cash equivalents are estimated to be approximately $3.7 million as of December 31, 2017. These amounts are unaudited and preliminary. They also are subject to the Company’s management completing its customary closing procedures and the Company’s independent auditor completing the year-end audit for 2017, among other factors.\n“We are pleased with the significant year-over-year growth that we achieved in 2017,” said John Sperzel, Chembio's Chief Executive Officer. “In addition, we are excited about the business award in Ethiopia which represents the largest single tender in the Company’s history.
