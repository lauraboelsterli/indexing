    "text": "(Reuters) - Chinese video streaming service provider iQiyi Inc, a unit of Baidu Inc ( BIDU.O ), on Tuesday filed for an initial public offering of up to $1.50 billion with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe company plans to list its American Depository Shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"IQ.\" bit.ly/2ouHhzO\nThe company, known for its Netflix-like services, has over 50 million subscribed members and more than 420 million mobile monthly average users.\nUpon the completion of the offering, Baidu will continue to be its controlling shareholder, iQiyi said in its IPO filing.\nIQiyi said it plans to use half of the net proceeds from the offering to expand and enhance it content offerings.\nThe Beijing-based company has posted losses since its inception in 2010, and reported a net loss of 3.74 billion yuan ($592 million) for 2017, compared with 3.07 billion yuan a year earlier.\nRevenue, however, rose to 17.38 billion yuan from 11.24 billion yuan.\nGoldman Sachs (Asia) LLC, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch are among the lead underwriters to the IPO.\nThe amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filing is usually a temporary placeholder.\nReporting by Nikhil Subba in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ",
