    "text": "MONTREAL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jet Blue Airways Corp ( JBLU.O ) met with Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ) and also had plans to meet with Brazil’s Embraer SA ( EMBR3.SA ) this month, according to an internal email reviewed by Reuters, in a signal that talks are picking up for the U.S. airline’s closely watched sales campaign.\nLow-cost carrier JetBlue has previously said it is weighing whether to replace its fleet of about 60, 100-seater E-190 jets, in a campaign pitting Bombardier’s CSeries against its Brazilian rival’s latest model, the E190-E2.\nJetBlue officials also met Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare at the company’s Montreal-area plant on Monday, said an industry source, confirming earlier media reports. The source said JetBlue had not finalized a deal with either planemaker.\nA spokeswoman for Bombardier declined to comment on a sales campaign.\nJetBlue said in a statement it is “exploring a full range of options from maintaining the current fleet to a full replacement with an alternative aircraft type.”\nEmbraer is determined to keep JetBlue as a key customer, while Bombardier wants to grow sales in the United States after a trade agency ruled the Canadian plane-and-train-maker could sell its 110-to-130 seat CSeries to American carriers duty-free following a dispute with Boeing Co ( BA.N ).\nThe Feb. 17 email says “the Bombardier team was in to discuss product support and maintenance for its C Series. And later this month, we’ll have a chance to take a close-up look at the Embraer E2.”\nIt was not clear whether JetBlue already saw the E2 and a spokesman for Embraer could not immediately answer Monday night.\nIn January, JetBlue said it would prolong an internal review over the future of its fleet at a time of an evolving landscape for commercial aviation. Embraer is now holding tie-up talks with Boeing and Bombardier is working to complete a deal giving a majority stake in the CSeries to Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ).\nReporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal and Alana Wise in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ",
