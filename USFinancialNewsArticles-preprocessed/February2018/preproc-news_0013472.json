    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 4:02 PM / in 7 minutes Macron backs Corsica mention in constitution, rejects other demands Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBASTIA, France (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday said he was open to mentioning Corsica specifically in the French Constitution but rejected several other key demands made by the island’s nationalist leaders for more autonomy. \nMacron said mentioning Corsica in France’s supreme law would both recognize its identity and anchor it within the French Republic. He added that further talks would determine what that would entail. \nDuring his first visit to the island since his election last year, Macron said the Corsican language would not be given official status and that local authorities would not be allowed to veto property-buying on the island.
