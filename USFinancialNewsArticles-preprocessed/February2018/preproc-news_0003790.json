It continues to fly to Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C. using 777-300s and A380s.\nThe 777-200LRs had also been used on flights to Brazilâ€™s Sao Paulo, which Etihad stopped flying to in 2017.\nEtihad sold all seven of its A340 jets last year, a source said, and on Jan. 24 Etihad told Reuters that it had stopped using five Airbus cargo planes.
