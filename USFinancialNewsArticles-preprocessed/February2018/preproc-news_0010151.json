    "text": "FORT SMITH, Ark., Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FFO Home, a fast growing Top 100 value-oriented home furnishings retailer with 47 stores across 7 southern states, announced today that it has acquired Service Furniture and Bedding, Inc, a leading operator of home furnishings and bedding retailers in the greater Louisville, Ky. area. The acquisition includes 13 stores operating under the Furniture Liquidators banner, and 15 Mattress and More Bedding stores. FFO Home now moves into the top 50 home furnishing retailers. This is the first acquisition activity to complement aggressive organic growth since FFO Home received an investment from an affiliate of private equity firm Sun Capital Partners, Inc. in 2016. Terms of the private transactions were not disclosed.\n\"We are incredibly excited to welcome Furniture Liquidators and Mattress and More to the FFO Home family,\" said Larry Zigerelli, President and CEO of FFO Home. \"Both of these brands have enjoyed strong leadership positions for many years. Furniture Liquidators provides us strong critical mass in one of our key expansion markets, and fits us strategically as a leading value-oriented retailer. Mattress and More provides an important platform to accelerate the growth of our vertically integrated Bedding business.\"\nFFO Home, headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas, just opened its 47 th location in December, and operates retail stores in Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kansas. FFO Home also manufactures bedding under the Comfort Coil and Natural Elements brands. The retailer offers superior value products priced below the competition, and distinguishes itself by eschewing the showroom distribution model and allowing consumers to purchase products immediately from on-site inventory.\nAbout FFO Home\nFFO Home opened its first store on Rogers Avenue in Fort Smith, Arkansas in 1984 (known then as Furniture Factory Outlet) and is headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas. They have grown to 47 stores across the 7-state area of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Texas, Mississippi and Tennessee.
