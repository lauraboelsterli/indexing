    "text": "HUNTINGTON, W.Va., Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Services of America (the \"Company\" or \"Energy Services\") (OTC QB: ESOA), parent company of C.J. Hughes Construction Company (\"C.J. Hughes\") and Nitro Electric Company (\"Nitro Electric\"), announced the filing of the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Energy Services earned revenues of $32.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit and net income available to common shareholders were $2.0 million and $71,000, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The Company had adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million ($0.07 per share) for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The backlog at December 31, 2017 was $54.2 million.\nBelow is a comparison of the Company's operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nRevenue\n$ 32,547,603\n$ 37,496,872\nCost of revenues\n30,572,149\n32,812,085\nGross profit\n1,975,454\n4,684,787\nSelling and administrative expenses\n2,009,091\n2,195,610\nIncome (loss) from operations\n(33,637)\n2,489,177\nOther income (expense)\nInterest income\n132,281\n-\nOther nonoperating income expense\n(55,124)\n(71,429)\nInterest expense\n(295,844)\n(230,969)\nGain on sale of equipment\n368,705\n26,990\n150,018\n(275,408)\nIncome from continuing operations\nbefore income taxes\n116,381\n2,213,769\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(32,119)\n975,112\nIncome from continuing operations\n148,500\n1,238,657\nDividends on preferred stock\n77,250\n77,250\nIncome from continuing operations\navailable to common shareholders\n71,250\n1,161,407\nIncome from discontinued operations\nnet of tax benefit\n-\n-\nNet income available to common shareholders\n$ 71,250\n$ 1,161,407\nRevenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $5.0 million compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.8 million revenue decrease in petroleum and gas work, partially offset by a $3.7 million revenue increase in electrical and mechanical services, and a $100,000 revenue increase in water and sewer and other ancillary projects. The gross profit percentage for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 6.1%, as compared to 12.5% for the same period in 2016. The revenue and gross profit percentage decreases for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to finishing two major projects with losses in fiscal year 2017.\nDouglas Reynolds, President, commented on the announcement. \"In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we were primarily finishing projects that started in the prior fiscal year. Due to an overall labor shortage in the pipeline construction industry last year, we suffered production inefficiencies and schedule overruns on two major projects. This prevented us from securing additional work in the quarters ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017. It also had a negative effect on our gross margin percentage for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\" Reynolds continued, \"To help expand our customer base and improve our performance on pipeline work, we have made a new hire to help bolster our sales and marketing efforts in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions as well as added an experienced industry professional to assist our construction management team. We are working very hard to improve operating results in fiscal year 2018.\"\nPlease refer to the table below that reconciles adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share with net income available to common shareholders:\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nNet income available to\ncommon shareholders\n$ 71,250\n$ 1,161,407\nAdd: Income tax expense (benefit)\n(32,119)\n975,112\nAdd: Dividends on preferred stock\n77,250\n77,250\nAdd: Interest expense\n295,844\n230,969\nLess: Non-operating (income) expense\n(445,862)\n44,439\nAdd: Depreciation expense\n1,049,688\n678,331\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,016,051\n$ 3,167,508\nCommon shares outstanding\n14,239,836\n14,239,836\nAdjusted EBITDA per common share\n$ 0.07\n$ 0.22\nCertain statements contained in the release, including without limitation statements including the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"expects\" or words of similar import, constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\").
