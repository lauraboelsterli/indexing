    "text": "Elon Musk has a really big Tuesday ahead of him. His company, SpaceX, is set to launch its Falcon Heavy rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 1:30 p.m. If successful, the 27-engine behemoth will be the most powerful rocket in use today.\nJeff Bezos took to Twitter Monday to wish his competitor well. In addition to launching Amazon , Bezos founded Blue Origin , a private space company that makes and launches reusable rockets with the ultimate goal of enabling millions of people to live and work in space .\nBest of luck @SpaceX with the Falcon Heavy launch tomorrow – hoping for a beautiful, nominal flight! @BlueOrigin #GradatimFerociter \n\"Gradatim Ferociter\" is the motto for Blue Origin and means, \" step by step, ferociously .\"\nMusk, not one to let an opportunity for humor pass, thanked Bezos for the well-wishes — and included a winking, kissing emoji.\nThanks \nThe response on Twitter to the competitors' civility was effusive, with some calling their mutual affection a \"bromance.\"\nBromance \nSpace solidarity. \nElon and Jeff - Bromance 2018 \nSo is it #eleff or #jefflon. Either I'm a fan of this bromance. I haven't decided on a ticket to Mars though. \nawwww :) \nThe two have tweeted at each other about space accomplishments in the past. For example, in 2015, when Musk landed a rocket for reuse , Bezos tweeted, pointing out that Blue Origin had already done as much. \nCongrats @SpaceX on landing Falcon's suborbital booster stage. Welcome to the club! \nTuesday's Falcon Heavy rocket launch, if successful, will carry Musk's cherry red Tesla Roadster to space. Musk Tweeted SpaceX's animated graphic of the liftoff.\nFalcon Heavy sends a car to Mars \nSee also: \nWhat to know before SpaceX attempts to launch Falcon Heavy – Elon Musk's most powerful rocket \nSpaceX set to fire Elon Musk's Roadster into orbit on back of world's 'most powerful' rocket \nSwag from Elon Musk's Boring Company hits eBay for thousands of dollars \nshow chapters Billionaire Elon Musk responds to unhappy Tesla customer      1:59 PM ET Mon, 18 Sept 2017 | 00:50 Like this story?
