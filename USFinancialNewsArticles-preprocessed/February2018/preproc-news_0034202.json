Increasing fiscal year 2018 operating cash flow guidance from $970 million to $1,050 million\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) today reported revenue of $1.21 billion for the first-quarter ended January 31, 2018, up 14 percent year over year (up 10 percent on a core basis (2) ).\nOn a GAAP basis, including the $533 million charge related to U.S. Tax Reform legislation, first-quarter net loss was $320 million, or $0.99 net loss per share. Last year’s first-quarter GAAP net income was $168 million, or $0.52 per share.\nDuring the first quarter, Agilent had an adjustment related to U.S. Tax Reform of $533 million, intangible amortization of $25 million, a pension settlement gain of $5 million, transformation costs of $5 million, acquisition and integration costs of $3 million, and $3 million in other costs. Excluding these items and a tax benefit of $28 million, Agilent reported first-quarter non-GAAP net income of $216 million, or $0.66 per share (1) .\n“We are very pleased with our strong start to the year,” said Mike McMullen, Agilent CEO and President. “The Agilent team continued our positive momentum and delivered another excellent quarter of operating results.”\n“Looking forward, we will keep our focus on driving sustainable above-market growth and delivering value to shareholders through the execution of our proven strategy,” continued McMullen. “Overall, we are well-positioned to continue delivering excellent operating results.”\nFirst-quarter revenue of $618 million from Agilent’s Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (LSAG) grew 14 percent year over year (up 11 percent on a core basis (2) ), with broad strength across all major end markets. LSAG’s operating margin for the quarter was 25.8 percent.\nFirst-quarter revenue of $408 million from Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) grew 12 percent year over year (up 9 percent on a core basis (2) ). Growth was strong across services and consumables. ACG’s operating margin for the quarter was 21.6 percent.\nFirst-quarter revenue of $185 million from Agilent’s Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) grew 13 percent year over year (up 8 percent on a core basis (2) ) led by strong demand for pathology products and companion diagnostics services. DGG’s operating margin for the quarter was 11.7 percent.\nAgilent expects second-quarter 2018 revenue in the range of $1.20 billion to $1.22 billion. Second-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.63 per share (3) .\nFor fiscal year 2018, Agilent expects revenue of $4.885 billion to $4.905 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.62 to $2.68 per share (3) . The guidance is based on January 31, 2018 currency exchange rates.\nConference Call\nAgilent’s management will present more details about its first-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on a conference call with investors today at 1:30 p.m. (Pacific Time).

Information about Agilent is available at www.agilent.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the safe harbors created therein. The contained herein include, but are not limited to, information regarding Agilent’s future revenue, earnings and profitability; planned new products; market trends; the future demand for the company’s products and services; customer expectations; and revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2018. These involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers’ businesses; unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products, technologies, and services; unforeseen changes in the currency markets; customer purchasing decisions and timing, and the risk that we are not able to realize the savings expected from integration and restructuring activities. In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability of our supply chain to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; the ability of Agilent to successfully integrate recent acquisitions; the ability of Agilent to successfully comply with certain complex regulations; and other risks detailed in Agilent’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017. are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent’s management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.\n(1) Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share primarily exclude the impacts of non-cash intangibles amortization, transformation initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, and Nucleic Acid Solutions Division (“NASD”) site costs. We also exclude any tax benefits or expenses that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. For Q1 FY18, the impact of Tax Reform is also excluded. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net loss is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.\n(2) Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation between Q1 FY18 GAAP revenue and core revenue is set forth on page 7 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. Core revenue growth rate as projected for full fiscal year 2018 excludes the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Most of these exclude amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided for the projection.\n(3) Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q2 FY18 and full fiscal year 2018 excludes primarily the impacts of non-cash intangibles amortization, transformation initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, and Nucleic Acid Solutions Division (“NASD”) site costs. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability, including the impact of Tax Reform. Most of these excluded amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $25 million per quarter.\n(4) For the three months ended January 31, 2018, our preliminary provision for income taxes is $553 million. This includes a $533 provision charge for the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) enactment. This charge primarily consists of: 1) an estimated provision of $480 million for U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries; and 2) an estimated provision of $53 million associated with the decrease in the US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and its impact on the Company’s US deferred tax assets and liabilities. The taxes payable associated with the transition tax, net of tax attributes, on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $440 million, payable over 8 years. The final impact of Tax Reform may differ materially from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis and assumptions made by the Company, additional guidance that may be issued, and actions that the Company may undertake.\nNOTE TO EDITORS: Further technology, corporate citizenship and executive news is available on the Agilent news site at www.agilent.com/go/news .\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nPRELIMINARY Three Months Ended January 31, Percent 2018 2017 Inc/(Dec) Net revenue $ 1,211 $ 1,067 14 % Costs and expenses: Cost of products and services 538 493 9 % Research and development 93 79 18 % Selling, general and administrative 341 289 18 % Total costs and expenses 972 861 13 % Income from operations 239 206 16 % Interest income 9 4 125 % Interest expense (20 ) (20 ) — Other income (expense), net 5 3 67 % Income before taxes 233 193 21 % Provision for income taxes 553 25 — Net income (loss) $ (320 ) $ 168 — Net income (loss) per share: Basic $ (0.99 ) $ 0.52 Diluted $ (0.99 ) $ 0.52 Weighted average shares used in computing net income (loss) per share: Basic 323 322 Diluted 323 326 Cash dividends declared per common share $ 0.149 $ 0.132 The preliminary income statement is estimated based on our current information.

For the three months ended January 31, 2018, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 18.0%. In the same periods last year, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19.0%. (b) GAAP diluted net loss per share was computed using 323 million weighted average diluted shares which excludes from consideration the anti-dilutive effects of all potential common shares outstanding. (c) Non-GAAP diluted net income per share was computed using 327 million weighted average diluted shares which includes the dilutive effects of potential common shares outstanding. We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to amortization of intangibles, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, NASD site costs, special compliance costs, and adjustment for Tax Reform. Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, small site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with the post-separation resizing of the IT infrastructure and streamlining of IT system as well as company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and financial systems. Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. Pension settlement gain resulted from transfer of the substitutional portion of our Japanese pension plan to the government. NASD site costs include all the costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing of nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients incurred prior to the commencement of commercial manufacturing. Special compliance costs include costs associated with transforming our processes to implement new regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), revenue recognition and certain tax reporting requirements. Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments. Adjustment for Tax Reform primarily consists of an estimated provision of $480 million for U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and an estimated provision of $53 million associated with the decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and its impact on our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. The taxes payable associated with the transition tax, net of tax attributes, on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $440 million, payable over 8 years. The final impact of Tax Reform may differ materially from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis and assumptions made, additional guidance that may be issued, and actions that we may undertake. Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance. Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.
