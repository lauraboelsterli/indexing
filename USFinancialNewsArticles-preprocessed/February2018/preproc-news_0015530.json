Authorities say that the passenger train that slammed into a CSX Corp. CSX -5.90% train outside Columbia, S.C., was on the wrong track and the freight railroad stationary when the crash happened before dawn on Sunday. The WSJ’s Scott Calvert and Cameron McWhirter report the Amtrak engineer and conductor were killed and that more than 100 people were injured. The National Transportation Safety Board began its investigation almost immediately amid growing concerns over Amtrak’s safety performance following the passenger railroad’s third fatal crash in less than two months. Amtrak has installed the safety braking system known as positive train control across parts of its network. CSX is responsible for maintenance of track and signals in the area where the crash happened, as well as for the dispatching of all trains. Railroads are required to have the new technology installed by the end of this year.\nDigital commerce is fueling more jobs growth than ever in logistics fields. Companies most closely tied to online sales distribution added more than 10,000 jobs last month, WSJ’s Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes. The expanding payrolls at package-delivery operators and at warehouse and storage companies highlights the growing weight e-commerce has in distribution and across the American economy. The U.S. Department of Labor has been resetting numbers over the past year to take into account the shifting role of some jobs, and logistics operations look to carry an increasingly significant role. The broader jobs report also suggests trucking and other freight operations are benefitting from bigger moves in the U.S. economy. Good-producing businesses boosted payrolls by 196,000 jobs from December to January, and hiring in the manufacturing and retail sectors is growing at a rapid clip. Shipping operators may take that as a signal to step up their own hiring heading into the spring.\nChina’s is taking aim at American agriculture as it responds to a tougher White House trade stance. Beijing has launched an anti-dumping action against U.S. sorghum exports, the WSJ reports, after a preliminary finding that government subsidies helped American farmers undercut Chinese growers by shipping out heavy volumes at low prices. That comes after the Trump administration’s move to impose tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. Sorghum doesn’t have the high profile of solar energy products, but it’s a critical piece of agriculture supply chains, providing feed for China’s big livestock sector of low-priced product. China is the top market by far for American sorghum exporters, and the case may carry weight well beyond the nearly 5 million metric tons of sorghum the country imports from the U.S. The tariffs would hit the farm regions that support President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, and will raise concerns among producers of soybeans and other export crops.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES An Amazon fulfillment center in Romeoville, Ill. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images Changing drinking patterns in the U.S. are bringing headaches to the beverage world’s longstanding distribution channels. Some wholesalers are raising concerns over Anheuser-Busch InBev SA’s signature Bud Light brand amid stale sales for the brew, the WSJ’s Nick Kostov reports. Bud Light is still America’s best-selling beer, but its losing market share to craft brews, Mexican lagers, wine and hard liquor, pressing profit margins at the among wholesalers that depend on the brand. It’s a sign of how big changes in markets can trigger tensions between suppliers, middlemen distributors and the retailers on the front lines of consumer sales. The Bud Light brand suffered its biggest volume drop ever last year, tumbling 5.7% in the steepest drop among mass-market brews that have been losing their American audience. AB InBev is trying to halt those losses with intensive marketing while distributors are wrestling with the tighter cash flows of a contracting market\nQUOTABLE\n‘ The driver shortage continues to be a headwind for the industry and will likely impact the ability to increase capacity in this space. ’\n—David Jackson, chief executive of Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc.\nNumber of the Day $7 billion Cumulative profit of container shipping lines in 2017, according to Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd.\nIN OTHER NEWS Average hourly earnings in the U.S. rose 2.9% from a year ago.
