    "text": "Fourth Quarter Revenue and Operating Income Increase 29% and 41%, Respectively\nCharges Related to U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Reduce Earnings Per Diluted Share by $0.90\nOXFORD, Mass., Feb. 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IPG Photonics Corporation (NASDAQ:IPGP) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, (In millions, except per share data) 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Revenue $ 361.1 $ 280.1 29 % $ 1,408.9 $ 1,006.2 40 % Gross margin 57.8 % 55.5 % 56.6 % 54.9 % Operating income $ 148.3 $ 105.2 41 % $ 551.1 $ 364.3 51 % Operating margin 41.1 % 37.6 % 39.1 % 36.2 % Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation $ 53.0 $ 75.1 (30 )% $ 347.6 $ 260.8 33 % Earnings per diluted share $ 0.96 $ 1.39 (31 )% $ 6.36 $ 4.85 31 % Management Comments\n\"We capped off one of the strongest growth years in IPG's history with a record fourth quarter, driven by accelerating adoption of our high-power fiber lasers across our largest applications and geographies,\" said Dr. Valentin Gapontsev, IPG Photonics' Chief Executive Officer. \"Our outstanding performance is a direct result of our scale advantages and unique business model combining a vertically-integrated manufacturing operation with broad-based technology and process abilities that enable us to rapidly increase production, reduce costs and deliver innovation.\"\nFourth quarter revenue of $361.1 million increased 29% year over year. Materials processing sales increased 32% year over year and accounted for approximately 94% of total revenue driven by strength in cutting, welding and 3D printing applications. Sales to other markets decreased 6% from the fourth quarter of 2016. High-power laser sales increased 40% year over year and pulsed laser sales increased 20% year over year. Sales of other laser products increased 24% year over year driven by growth in systems and beam delivery accessories. On a geographic basis, IPG achieved double-digit year over year sales growth in China, Europe, North America and Turkey and grew modestly in Japan.\nEarnings per diluted share (\"EPS\") were $0.96. Charges related to the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced net income by $49 million and EPS by $0.90. These estimated charges include $47 million related to the one-time transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings, $1 million for the associated state tax on foreign earnings no longer deemed to be permanently reinvested and $1 million from a reduction in the value of U.S. net deferred tax assets resulting from the recently-enacted lower U.S. Federal tax rate. The estimated tax charges are subject to change based upon additional analysis and subsequent regulations, interpretations and guidance.\nDuring the fourth quarter, IPG generated $108 million in cash from operations and used $27 million to finance capital expenditures. IPG ended the quarter with $1.12 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, representing an increase of $286 million from December 31, 2016.\nBusiness Outlook and Financial Guidance\n\"Order flow was strong in the fourth quarter with our book-to-bill ratio at 1.0, representing solid performance in light of our record quarterly revenue. Backlog of orders with firm shipment dates increased by 44% to $326 million. Backlog of non-binding frame agreements increased by 123% to $417 million,\" said Dr. Gapontsev. It should be noted that frame agreements are non-binding indications of customer pricing and volume levels but are not firm customer purchase obligations. The underlying growth in frame agreements, while positive, also reflects lower backlog of year-end 2016 frame agreements. As we reported last year, a large number of frame agreements were booked in January 2017.\nFor the full year 2018 IPG Photonics is targeting 10% to 15% revenue growth. Our annual guidance reflects current backlog and annual order indications from our largest OEM customers. This guidance assumes continued momentum in our core materials processing markets, further progress in new application areas, and strong worldwide macroeconomic conditions offset by lower spending related to consumer electronics applications. Based on the accelerating growth within our business in 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be $170 million to $190 million, the high end of our target range of 8% to 12% of revenue. Finally, we expect the recently enacted U.S. tax legislation to lower our 2018 corporate tax rate to 26% from 30% in 2017, excluding effects relating to equity grants.\nFor the first quarter, we expect revenue growth in the range of 15% to 24% year over year or $330 million to $355 million and anticipate earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.62 to $1.87, which reflects earnings growth in the range of 17% to 36% year over year.\nAs discussed in more detail in the \"Safe Harbor\" passage of this news release, actual results may differ from this guidance due to various factors including, but not limited to, product demand, order cancellations and delays, competition and general economic conditions. This guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, and is subject to the risks outlined in the Company's reports with the SEC, and assumes exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar of Euro 0.83, Russian Ruble 58, Japanese Yen 113 and Chinese Yuan 6.53, respectively.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nAdditional supplemental financial information is provided in the Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Data Workbook available on the investor relations section of the Company's website at investor.ipgphotonics.com .\nConference Call Reminder\nThe Company will hold a conference call today, February 16, 2018 at 10:00 am ET.
