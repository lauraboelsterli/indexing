    "text": "(Updates with details)\nFeb 27 (Reuters) - British power producer Drax Group Plc beat full-year core earnings expectations on Tuesday, sending its shares up by as much as 9 percent.\nDrax has converted three of its six power plant units in Yorkshire in the north of England - once Europe’s most polluting coal-fired power station - to burn wood pellets.\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 63.6 percent to 229 million pounds ($319.87 million) for the year ended Dec. 31, the company said.\nThat topped the 225.4 million pounds expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue grew by about 25 percent to 3.69 billion pounds, helped by higher profit from its biomass power plants and the acquisition of Opus Energy.\nDrax shares rose as much as 9 percent in early trade and were up 7 percent at 255 pence by 0812 GMT.\nAs well as higher generation and acquisitions, revenue was buoyed by a 35 percent increase in biomass pellet production at the company’s U.S. manufacturing plants.\nAs a part of its efforts to meet climate targets, Britain plans to close all coal-fired power plants by 2025 unless they are fitted with technology which can capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.\nDrax plans to convert a fourth unit to biomass by the end of the year and eventually replace its existing coal units with two large gas units.\n$1 = 0.7159 pounds Reporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru and Susanna Twidale in London; editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Jason Neely\n ",
