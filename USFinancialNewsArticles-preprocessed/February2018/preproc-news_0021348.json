    "text": "Second Fiscal Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\n$653.5 million of consolidated revenue; including $530.0 million from the Communications Infrastructure segments and $123.5 million from the Allstream segment; Net income of $11.5 million, including $10.6 million from the Communications Infrastructure segments and $0.9 million from the Allstream segment; $329.9 million of adjusted EBITDA, including $300.0 million from Communications Infrastructure and $29.9 million from the Allstream segment; Bookings of $7.9 million, gross installs of $7.6 million, churn of 1.2% and net installs of $1.6 million, all on a monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and monthly amortized revenue (MAR) basis, excluding the Allstream segment. Adjusted unlevered free cash flow of $124.3 million.\nBOULDER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (“Zayo” or “the Company”) (NYSE: ZAYO), a global leader in Communications Infrastructure, announced results for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nSecond quarter operating income increased by $8.6 million and net income decreased by $11.7 million over the previous quarter primarily due to the provision for income taxes. Income tax expense increased by $17.5 million in the second quarter, largely due to the impact from tax reform under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 of $44.1 million partially offset by a $28.5 million release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for certain foreign subsidiaries. Basic and diluted net income per share during the second fiscal quarter was $0.05. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, capital expenditures were $193.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $280.8 million of cash and $442.0 million available under its revolving credit facility.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of Spread Networks\nOn November 26, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Spread Networks, LLC, a privately owned telecommunications provider that owns and operates a 825-mile, high-fiber count long haul route connecting New York and Chicago, for $127.0 million in cash (subject to post-closing adjustments). The all-cash transaction is expected to be funded with cash on hand and debt and is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nAcquisition of Optic Zoo Networks\nOn January 18, 2018, the Company completed the CAD $31.0 million (or $24.9 million) cash acquisition of Vancouver-based Optic Zoo Networks. Optic Zoo Networks owns and operates high-capacity fiber in Vancouver and has achieved a significant penetration of customers, with a focus on the digital media sector. The transaction adds 103 route miles and more than 100 on-net buildings to the Company’s Vancouver footprint.\nAcquisition of Neutral Path Communications\nOn January 28, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Neutral Path Communications and Near North Partners for $31.5 million. The purchase price is subject to net working capital and other customary adjustments, as well as a contingent payment based on sales performance through June 30, 2018. Neutral Path is a long haul infrastructure provider, operating a fiber network in the Midwest. The transaction will add 452 owned plus additional leased route miles to the Company’s extensive North American network, including a unique, high-count fiber route from Minneapolis to Omaha.\nSecond Fiscal Quarter Financial Results\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017\n(in millions)\nThree months ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 Revenue $ 653.5 $ 643.5 Annualized revenue growth 6 % Operating income 104.0 95.4 Income from operations before income taxes 34.4 28.6 Provision for income taxes 22.9 5.4 Net income $ 11.5 $ 23.2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 329.9 $ 316.6 Annualized Adjusted EBITDA growth 17 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 50 % 49 % Levered free cash flow/(deficit) $ (5.7 ) $ 75.4 Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\n(in millions)\nThree months ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Revenue $ 653.5 $ 506.7 Annual revenue growth 29 % Operating income 104.0 90.7 Income from operations before income taxes 34.4 20.0 Provision for income taxes 22.9 0.2 Net income $ 11.5 $ 19.8 Adjusted EBITDA $ 329.9 $ 263.4 Annual Adjusted EBITDA growth 25 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 50 % 52 % Levered free cash flow/(deficit) $ (5.7 ) $ (43.9 ) Conference Call\nZayo will hold a conference call to report the second fiscal quarter 2018 results at 5:00 p.m. EST, February 7, 2018.

Other factors and risks that may affect our business and future financial results are detailed in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on August 22, 2017 (our “Annual Report”). We caution you not to place undue reliance on these , which speak only as of their respective dates. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise to reflect events or circumstances after releasing this supplemental information or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.\nThis earnings release should be read together with the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC on February 7, 2018 and the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2017 included in the Company’s Annual Report.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company provides financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow.\nAdjusted EBITDA, as defined below and in Note 15 – Segment Reporting of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings/(loss) from operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) adjusted to exclude acquisition or disposal-related transaction costs, losses on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation, unrealized foreign currency gains/(losses) on intercompany loans, and non-cash income/(loss) on equity and cost method investments. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted unlevered free cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment, net of stimulus grants, plus additions to deferred revenue, less non-cash monthly amortized revenue. Levered free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, net of stimulus grants. Adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, net cash flows provided by operating activities, total net cash flows or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to net cash flows from operating activities or total net cash flows as measures of our liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance rather than cash flow measure. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA, management uses adjusted unlevered free cash flow, which measures the ability of Adjusted EBITDA to cover capital expenditures. We use levered free cash flow as a measure to evaluate cash generated through normal operating activities. These metrics are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting future periods. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and makes it easier to compare our results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. We believe that the presentation of levered free cash flow is relevant and useful to investors because it provides a measure of cash available to pay the principal on our debt and pursue acquisitions of businesses or other strategic investments or uses of capital.\nWe also monitor Adjusted EBITDA because our subsidiaries have debt covenants that restrict their borrowing capacity that are based on a leverage ratio, which utilizes a modified EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes. The modified EBITDA is consistent with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA; however, it includes the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of and expected cost synergies from the companies acquired by us during the quarter for which the debt compliance certification is due. Adjusted EBITDA results, along with the quantitative and qualitative information, are also utilized by management and our Compensation Committee, as an input for determining incentive payments to employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results of operations and operating cash flows as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA:\ndoes not reflect capital expenditures, or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments; does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service the interest payments, on our debt; and does not reflect cash required to pay income taxes.\nAdjusted unlevered free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, adjusted unlevered free cash flow:\ndoes not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service the interest payments, on our debt; and does not reflect cash required to pay income taxes.\nLevered free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, levered free cash flow:\ndoes not reflect principal payments on debt; does not reflect principal payments on capital lease obligations; does not reflect dividend payments, if any; and does not reflect the cost of acquisitions.\nOur computation of Adjusted EBITDA, and levered free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because all companies do not calculate these measures in the same fashion.\nBecause we have acquired numerous entities since our inception and incurred transaction costs in connection with each acquisition, borrowed money in order to finance our operations and acquisitions, and used capital and intangible assets in our business, and because the payment of income taxes is necessary if we generate taxable income after the utilization of our net operating loss carry forwards, any measure that excludes these items has material limitations. As a result of these limitations, these measures should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of our liquidity. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income/(loss) and for quantitative reconciliations of adjusted unlevered free cash flow and levered free cash flow, each to net cash provided by operating activities.\nAnnualized revenue and annualized Adjusted EBITDA are derived by multiplying the total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the most recent quarterly period by four. Our computations of annualized revenue and annualized Adjusted EBITDA may not be representative of our actual annual results.\nMeasures referred to as being calculated on a constant currency basis are intended to present the relevant information assuming a constant exchange rate between the two periods being compared. Such metrics are calculated by applying the currency exchange rates used in the preparation of the prior period financial results to the subsequent period results.\nTables reconciling non-GAAP measures are included in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this presentation.
