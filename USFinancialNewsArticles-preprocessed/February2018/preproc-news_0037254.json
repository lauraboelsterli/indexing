    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Epazz, Inc . (OTC: EPAZ), a leading provider of blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, announced today that the company’s patent-pending Blockchain Smart Legal Contracts Technology will be called Cordtell ( www.cordtell.com ). Cordtell reduces fraud in business transactional contracts. The technology allows for a transactional contract to become a living contract that is tracked and traced; it also verifies that a section of terms within a contract are followed and that all parties of an agreement obey the terms of the contract.\nCordtell, which is under development, automatically verifies signatures, distributes the contract to the blockchain, records the transaction and verifies the terms are being followed via our blockchain apps, which also trace any changes. The technology sends reminders, and tracks payments and delivery of items. The technology will work with Microsoft Word and Google Docs to provide real-time contract edits and updates via version control. The company will primarily market the technology to law firms, health care providers, businesses and governments.\nPart of Cordtell is the transmission of data storage in a blockchain storage unit. This part of Cordtell will be released first before the Smart Legal Contracts Technology as it is a key feature of storage and data retrieval, which is part of the provisional patent the company filed. The company will use the blockchain storage technology on other new products. Once the company is ready for beta testing, the company will then file a non-provisional patent to include additional claims created during the development process. Our goal is to release Cordtell in two parts: first, the blockchain storage technology in the third quarter and then the Smart Legal Contracts in the fourth.\nEpazz CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D., said, “2018 is a major software development year for the company; we are increasing our blockchain software team to take advantage of new technology and are also updating our existing cloud products and creating new blockchain cloud products.”\nIf you would like to receive updates on Cordtell, visit www.cordtell.com\nAbout Epazz, Inc.
