    "text": "Tuukka Rask’s lengthy points streak came to an end at the hands of an unlikely source.\nEvander Kane, Scott Wilson and Benoit Pouliot each got pucks past the Bruins’ goaltender to snap his career-best personal 21-game points streak and lift the last-place Buffalo Sabres to a 4-2 victory Saturday night in Boston.\nRasmus Ristolainen scored Buffalo’s final tally on an empty-netter.\nRask went 19-0-2 during his streak, with his last regulation loss before Saturday coming in a 5-3 decision at Nashville on Dec. 4. Ryan Spooner and David Backes each scored for Boston, which snapped its four-game winning streak.\nBuffalo won its second straight game following a four-game skid. The Sabres entered the night in the Eastern Conference cellar with the second-fewest points in the NHL and dead last in scoring, averaging 2.3 goals per game.\nJack Eichel left the game with a lower-body injury after the Sabres’ former No. 2 overall pick out of Boston University collided with Boston’s Matt Grzelcyk -- another BU product -- behind the Bruins’ net late in the first period.\nRask made 24 saves as he was outdueled by his former backup Chad Johnson, who had 25 stops. Johnson improved to 12-1-0 at TD Garden.\nKane opened the scoring with a breakaway goal with 12:18 left in the second period, beating Rask high glove-side. His 17 goals are second only to Eichel’s 22 for the Sabres this season.\nWilson scored his third of the year with 7:16 left in the second, firing a rebound past Rask glove-side after he tipped a blue-line shot from Nathan Beaulieu off Boston’s Adam McQuaid in front of the net.\nSpooner’s goal gave the home crowd some life with 5:21 to go in the second, sending a backhanded feed from Jake DeBrusk in front of the crease past Johnson.\nEx-Bruin Pouliot scored his 10th of the year with 1:11 to play in the period after McQuaid’s giveaway led to a 3-on-1 opportunity.\nWith Rask on the bench, Backes tipped in his 10th goal off a shot from Patrice Bergeron with 59 seconds to play. Ristolainen’s empty-netter, his fourth goal of the year, ended hopes of a Boston comeback with 28.2 ticks left.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
