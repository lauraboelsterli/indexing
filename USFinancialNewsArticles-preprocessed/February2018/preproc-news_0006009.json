While initiatives to streamline our processes and enhance digital capabilities will impact near-term results, we are confident that we are taking the right steps to optimally position our business for the future.\nIn particular, we are addressing our relatively lower retail business exposure, making important headway in reducing attrition and attracting new customers. At the same time, we are mindful that loyal customers are key to profitability, and are ensuring that they remain satisfied.\nOur investment in digitalization and mobile banking is underpinning operational innovation and business transformation at Santander Mexico. These initiatives helped us achieve over 25% growth in loyal customers to over 2 million, almost doubling net new customers over the year. Similarly, digital customers grew by 45% and mobile customers by 67% year-on-year. While our focus on margins will enable us to drive higher profitability in coming years, this is resulting in higher expenses and muting profits in the short term.\nIn consumer loans we continue to see good traction, while expanding selectively in corporate and government loans as we prioritize margins over market share. Similarly, our client-centric focus on individuals and SMEs along with strong dynamics for Santander Plus are supporting ongoing deposit growth. Importantly, we maintain healthy asset quality, while keeping stringent standards for loan origination, and recently completed the clean-up of our homebuilder portfolio.\nWe are confident of our strategy to build a stronger, more profitable franchise despite the challenging environment and are pleased with the progress of our initiatives as we execute our investment plan. We remain focused on strengthening our position in retail banking, and realizing the potential of our corporate and investment bank. As such, we look to the coming year with cautious optimism and confidence in our execution.\"\n4Q17 EARNINGS CALL DIAL-IN INFORMATION\nDate:\nThursday, February 1 st , 2018\nTime:\n9:00 a.m. (MCT); 10:00 a.m. (US ET)\nDial-in Numbers:\n1-877-407-4018 US & Canada 1-201-689-8471 International & Mexico\nAccess Code:\nPlease ask for Santander México Earnings Call\nWebcast:\nhttp://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=127923\nReplay:\nStarting: Thursday, February 1 st , 2018 at 1:00 p.m. (US ET)\nEnding: Tuesday, February 6 th , 2018 at 11:59 p.m. (US ET)\nET Dial-in number: 1-844-512-2921 US & Canada; 1-412-317-6671 International & Mexico Access Code: 13675318\nABOUT GRUPO FINANCIERO SANTANDER MÉXICO, S.A.B.
