Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but are based on certain assumptions of management and describe the Company's future plans, strategies and expectations. Forward-looking statements often use forward-looking terminology, including words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"forecast\", \"guidance\", \"intends\", \"likely\", \"may\", \"plan\", \"potential\", \"predicts\", \"seek\", \"will\" and words of similar meaning or the negative thereof.\nForward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on information currently available to the Company and assumptions that management believe to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. As a result, Ferroglobe's actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, which are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond the Company's control.\nForward-looking financial information and other metrics presented herein represent the Company's goals and are not intended as guidance or projections for the periods presented herein or any future periods.\nAll information in this press release is as of the date of its release. Ferroglobe does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect new information, events or circumstances arising after the date of this press release. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are made only as of the date of this press release.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted profit (loss) per ordinary share and adjusted profit (loss) attributable to the parent are, we believe, pertinent non-IFRS financial metrics that Ferroglobe utilizes to measure its success.\nFerroglobe has included these financial metrics to provide supplemental measures of its performance. The Company believes these metrics are important because they eliminate items that have less bearing on the Company's current and future operating performance and highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures.\nINVESTOR CONTACT:\nFerroglobe PLC\nJoe Ragan, US: +1 917 2098581, UK: +44 (0) 7827 227 688\nChief Financial Officer\nEmail: jragan@ferroglobe.com\nFerroglobe PLC and Subsidiaries Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Income Statement (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts) Quarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Quarter Ended\nSeptember 30, 2017 Quarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Sales $ 468,218 451,628 389,878 1,741,693 1,576,037 Cost of sales (285,201 ) (267,364 ) (272,174 ) (1,043,982 ) (1,043,412 ) Other operating income 5,122 7,404 15,202 18,163 26,215 Staff costs (87,304 ) (74,183 ) (89,580 ) (302,140 ) (296,399 ) Other operating expense (53,156 ) (59,741 ) (64,141 ) (238,030 ) (243,946 ) Depreciation and amortization charges, operating allowances and write-downs (23,830 ) (27,076 ) (27,705 ) (104,529 ) (125,677 ) Impairment losses (241 ) (98 ) (200,458 ) (339 ) (268,089 ) Other gain (loss) 1,430 (3,313 ) 2,517 (4,474 ) 2,191 Operating profit (loss) 25,038 27,257 (246,461 ) 66,362 (373,080 ) Finance income 2,487 258 303 3,702 1,536 Finance expense (19,054 ) (14,786 ) (7,802 ) (62,314 ) (30,251 ) Financial derivatives loss (956 ) (1,823 ) -
