If successful, Incyte expects to submit an sNDA seeking approval of ruxolitinib in this indication.\nInitial results, based on progression-free survival, from the pivotal ECHO-301 trial of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma are expected in the first half of 2018. In collaboration with both Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb, we have recently opened eight new pivotal trials of epacadostat plus PD-1 antagonists.\nInitial data from the trial evaluating INCB54828 in patients with cholangiocarcinoma are expected in 2018.\nStatus updates for Incyte’s most advanced clinical programs are provided below.\nIndication Status Update Ruxolitinib\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nSteroid-refractory acute GVHD Pivotal Phase 2 (REACH1); Phase 3 (REACH2) Ruxolitinib\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nSteroid-refractory chronic GVHD Phase 3 (REACH3) Ruxolitinib\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nEssential thrombocythemia Phase 2 (RESET) Itacitinib\n(JAK1)\nTreatment-naïve acute GVHD Phase 3 (GRAVITAS-301) Itacitinib\n(JAK1)\nNSCLC Phase 1/2 in combination with osimertinib (EGFR) Epacadostat\n(IDO1)\nMelanoma Phase 3 (ECHO-301) in combination with pembrolizumab (PD-1) Epacadostat\n(IDO1)\nRenal cancer Phase 3 (ECHO-302) in combination with pembrolizumab (PD-1) Epacadostat\n(IDO1)\nBladder cancer Phase 3 (ECHO-303 & ECHO-307) in combination with pembrolizumab (PD-1) Epacadostat\n(IDO1)\nHead & neck cancer Phase 3 (ECHO-304) in combination with pembrolizumab (PD-1) Epacadostat\n(IDO1)\nNSCLC Phase 3 (ECHO-305 & ECHO-306) in combination with pembrolizumab (PD-1) Epacadostat\n(IDO1)\nNSCLC Phase 3 (ECHO-309) in combination with nivolumab (PD-1)\nEpacadostat\n(IDO1)\nHead & neck cancer Phase 3 (ECHO-310) in combination with nivolumab (PD-1)\nEpacadostat\n(IDO1)\nNSCLC Phase 3 in combination with durvalumab (PD-L1) expected to begin in H1 2018 MGA012\n(PD-1) 1\nSolid tumors Phase 1 dose-escalation completed, monotherapy expansion cohorts ongoing INCB50465\n(PI3Kδ)\nDLBCL Phase 2 (CITADEL-202) INCB50465\n(PI3Kδ)\nFollicular lymphoma Phase 2 (CITADEL-203) INCB50465\n(PI3Kδ)\nMarginal zone lymphoma Phase 2 (CITADEL-204) INCB50465\n(PI3Kδ)\nMantle cell lymphoma Phase 2 (CITADEL-205) INCB54828\n(FGFR1/2/3)\nBladder cancer Phase 2 (FIGHT-201) INCB54828\n(FGFR1/2/3)\nCholangiocarcinoma Phase 2 (FIGHT-202) Notes: 1) MGA012 licensed from MacroGenics A brief status update for Incyte’s earlier-stage clinical candidates is provided below.\nStatus Update INCB57643\n(BRD)\nFirst-in-man data presented at ASH 2017, showing optimized PK profile for combination therapy INCB53914\n(PIM)\nFirst-in-man data at ASH 2017; development expected to focus on combination therapy, including with JAK and PI3Kδ inhibition in hematological malignancies INCB52793\n(JAK1)\n150x greater selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2 in preclinical studies; evaluating combination cohorts with azacitadine in AML INCB59872\n(LSD1)\nEpigenetic mechanism targeting cell differentiation; evaluating both oncology indications and sickle-cell disease INCB62079\n(FGFR4)\n250x greater selectivity for FGFR4 over FGFR1/2/3; initial development expected to focus on hepatocellular carcinoma INCB81776\n(AXL/MER)\nExpected to enter clinical trials in 2018 INCB01158\n(ARG) 1\nNovel mechanism targeting myeloid cells; development expected to focus on combination therapy, including IDO1, PD-1 and chemotherapy combinations INCAGN1876\n(GITR) 2\nDose escalation completed; development expected to focus on combination therapy, including IDO1, PD-1 and CTLA-4 combinations INCAGN1949\n(OX40) 2\nDose escalation completed; development expected to focus on combination therapy, including PD-1 and CTLA-4 combinations INCAGN2390\n(TIM-3) 2\nExpected to enter clinical trials in 2018 INCAGN2385\n(LAG-3) 2\nExpected to enter clinical trials in 2018 Notes: 1) INCB01158 co-developed with Calithera 2) INCAGN1876, INCAGN1949, INCAGN2390 and INCAGN2385 from discovery alliance with Agenus Non-oncology\nIndication Status Update Topical ruxolitinib\n(JAK1/JAK2)\nAtopic dermatitis, vitiligo Phase 2 Partnered – key highlights\nIn December, Lilly announced that it had resubmitted the New Drug Application (NDA) for baricitinib to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA).

The Company believes these adjustments are useful to investors by providing an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company’s core operations.
