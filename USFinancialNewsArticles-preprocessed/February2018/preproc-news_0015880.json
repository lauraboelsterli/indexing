    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) (“Prospect”, “our”, or “we”) today announced financial results for our second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nAll amounts in $000’s except\nper share amounts Quarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Quarter Ended\nSeptember 30, 2017 Quarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Net Investment Income (“NII”) $73,192 $63,732 $84,405 Interest as % of Total Investment Income 94.4% 93.4% 95.3% NII per Share $0.20 $0.18 $0.24 Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations (“NI”) $121,727 $11,973 $100,880 NI per Share $0.34 $0.03 $0.28 Distributions to Shareholders $64,912 $81,647 $89,668 Distributions per Share $0.18 $0.23 $0.25 Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per Share $9.28 $9.12 $9.62 Net of Cash Debt to Equity Ratio 60.2% 71.6% 70.3% For the December 2017 quarter, we earned net investment income (“NII”) of $73.2 million, or $0.20 per weighted average share, up $0.02 from the September 2017 quarter, and exceeding our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.18 per share by $0.02 per share. The increase in NII per share resulted primarily from a reduction in administrative overhead expenses and a restoration of certain loans to income accrual status due to improved performance.\nOur strategy focuses on risk reduction, capital preservation, and avoidance of “yield chasing” investments deemed too risky with a poor risk/return profile at this point in the economic cycle. We remain committed to our historic credit discipline with repayments outpacing originations for the third consecutive quarter. While we have a robust pipeline of potential investments in our target range for credit quality and yield, we have not chased risky assets with low returns and remain underinvested at December 31, 2017. We believe our disciplined approach to credit will serve us well in the coming years, just as that disciplined approach has served us well in past years.\nIn the December 2017 quarter our net of cash debt to equity ratio was 60.2%, down 11.4% from September 2017.\nFor the December 2017 quarter, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations (“NI”) was $121.7 million, or $0.34 per weighted average share, an increase of $0.31 from the September 2017 quarter as a result of NII in excess of dividends and an increase in the fair market value of certain investments.\nOur interest income as a percentage of total investment income was 94.4% in the December 2017 quarter.\nOur net asset value (“NAV”) per share increased by $0.16 to $9.28 during the December 2017 quarter.\nAll amounts in $000’s except\nper share amounts Six Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Six Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 NII $136,924 $163,324 NII per Share $0.38 $0.46 NI $133,700 $182,246 NI per Share $0.37 $0.51 Distributions to Shareholders $146,559 $179,097 Distributions per Share $0.41 $0.50\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, we earned NII of $136.9 million, or $0.38 per weighted average share, down $0.08 from the prior year. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, we earned NI of $133.7 million, or $0.37 per weighted average share, down $0.14 from the prior year.\nDISTRIBUTION DECLARATION\nProspect is declaring distributions as follows:\n$0.06 per share for February 2018 to February 28, 2018 record holders with March 22, 2018 payment date; $0.06 per share for March 2018 to March 30, 2018 record holders with April 19, 2018 payment date; and $0.06 per share for April 2018 to April 30, 2018 record holders with May 24, 2018 payment date.\nThese distributions mark Prospect’s 115 th , 116 th , and 117 th consecutive cash distributions to shareholders.\nBased on the declarations above, Prospect’s closing stock price of $6.29 at February 6, 2018 delivers to shareholders a dividend yield of 11.4%.\nBased on past distributions and our current share count for declared distributions, Prospect since inception through our April 2018 distribution will have distributed $16.44 per share to original shareholders, exceeding $2.5 billion in cumulative distributions to all shareholders.\nProspect expects to declare May 2018, June 2018, July 2018, and August 2018 distributions in May 2018.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nWe continue to prioritize secured lending.

At December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, our structured credit portfolio at fair value consisted of the following:\nAll amounts in $000’s except\nper unit amounts As of As of December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 Total Structured Credit Investments $940,276 $969,478 # of Investments 43 43 TTM Average Cash Yield (1)(3) 19.3% 20.5% Annualized Cash Yield (1)(3) 17.0% 18.3% Annualized GAAP Yield on Fair Value (1)(3) 12.5% 12.4% Annualized GAAP Yield on Amortized Cost (2)(3) 11.0% 11.1% Cumulative Cash Distributions $1,078,373 $1,034,772 % of Original Investment 73.0% 69.8% # of Underlying Collateral Loans 2,225 2,310 Total Asset Base of Underlying Portfolio $19,026,601 $19,225,010 Prospect TTM Default Rate 0.77% 0.55% Broadly Syndicated Market TTM Default Rate 2.05% 1.53% Prospect Default Rate Outperformance vs. Market 1.28% 0.98% (1) Calculation based on fair value.\n(2) Calculation based on amortized cost.\n(3) Excludes deals in the process of redemption.\nTo date, including called deals in the process of liquidation, we have exited 11 structured credit investments totaling $290.5 million with an expected average realized IRR of 16.1% and cash on cash multiple of 1.48 times.\nSince August 29, 2016 (the date of our June 2016 earnings release), 19 of our structured credit investments have completed refinancings to reduce their liability spreads, and eight additional structured credit investments have completed multi-year extensions of their reinvestment periods (also at reduced liability spreads).
