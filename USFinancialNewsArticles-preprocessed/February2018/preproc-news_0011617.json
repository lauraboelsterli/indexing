Estimates made on a quarterly basis are updated as of each interim reporting date.\n(C) Distributions coverage ratio is calculated by dividing (i) the sum of net investment income in excess of distributions at the end of the period and distributions to common stockholders from net investment income during the period by (ii) current period distributions from net investment income to common stockholders.\nNM = Not Meaningful\nHighlights for the Quarter: During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the following significant events occurred:\nPortfolio Activity : Invested $31.1 million through a combination of secured first lien debt and preferred equity into one new portfolio company; and Invested $8.4 million in existing portfolio companies.\nDistributions and Dividends: Paid the following monthly cash distributions to common stockholders and dividends to preferred stockholders for each of October, November, and December 2017: $0.065 per common share, per month; $0.140625 per share, per month, for the Company’s 6.75% Series B Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (“Series B Term Preferred Stock”); $0.135417 per share, per month, for the Company’s 6.50% Series C Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (“Series C Term Preferred Stock”); and $0.13020833 per share to holders of our 6.25% Series D Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (“Series D Term Preferred Stock”). Paid a supplemental cash distribution of $0.06 per share to common stockholders in December 2017.\nThird Quarter Results : Net investment income for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 was $7.5 million, or $0.23 per common share, and $5.8 million, or $0.18 per common share, respectively. Net investment income increased period over period, as the increase in total investment income resulting from higher interest and other income, more than offset the increase in total expenses, net of credits, which was primarily due to higher incentive fees, including $0.8 million of accrued capital gains-based incentive fees, the payment of which is not contractually due under the investment advisory agreement, in the current period.\nNet asset value per common share as of December 31, 2017 increased to $10.37 compared to $10.10 as of September 30, 2017. The quarter over quarter increase was primarily due to improved performance and an increase in comparable multiples used to estimate the fair value of certain portfolio companies, which were partially offset by a decline in performance of certain other portfolio companies.\nSubsequent Events: After December 31, 2017, the following significant events occurred:\nDistributions and Dividends Declared : In January 2018, our Board of Directors declared the following monthly distributions to common stockholders and monthly dividends to holders of our three series of term preferred stock:\nRecord Date Payment Date Distribution per\nCommon Share Dividend per\nShare of\nSeries B Term\nPreferred\nStock Dividend per\nShare of Series\nC Term\nPreferred\nStock Dividend per\nShare of\nSeries D Term\nPreferred\nStock January 22, 2018 January 31, 2018 $ 0.065 $ 0.140625 $ 0.135417 $ 0.13020833 February 16, 2018 February 28, 2018 0.065 0.140625 0.135417 0.13020833 March 20, 2018 March 30, 2018 0.065 0.140625 0.135417 0.13020833 Total for the Quarter: $ 0.195 $ 0.421875 $ 0.406251 $ 0.39062499 Significant Investments : In January 2018, we invested $14.5 million in an existing portfolio company, Schylling, Inc., through a secured first lien debt investment, and invested $11.0 million in another existing portfolio company, Nth Degree, Inc., through a secured first lien debt investment.\nConference Call: The Company will hold its earnings release conference call on Wednesday, February 7, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EST.
