Regulators and legislators on all levels should therefore urgently pay close attention to mitigating the potential risks that could stem from growing virtual currency business,” Mersch added. \nMersch added that he saw no convincing motivation for the ECB to issue digital money, a subject under study by several central banks, as such an innovation is unnecessary for now with likely negative impacts on the financial system.
