    "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SalesLoft, the leading sales engagement platform, today announced it has hired veteran sales executive Sean D. Murray to join the company as its first Chief Revenue Officer (CRO).\nMurray joins SalesLoft from Xactly Corp, where he was Vice President of Global Sales and part of the executive team that took the company public and later sold the company to Vista Equity, a leading private equity firm. Murray has also held several global sales leadership positions, including more than 12 years at CEB.\n\"It's clear that Sean is a master of his craft and has a proven track record growing and driving sales performance for some of the fastest growing companies around,\" says Kyle Porter, Co-Founder and CEO of SalesLoft. \"We are excited to add such an accomplished sales leader - and also a former SalesLoft customer - to our growing team of 'A' players.\"\nMurray has held multiple global sales leadership positions and joins SalesLoft as an expert in sales methodologies, processes and rep behaviors in delivering the customer with the sales experience that is a product in and of itself.\n\"I've spent my career in professional sales and believe this is the most exciting time to work in sales,\" says Murray. \"Our profession is ever evolving and today's leadership must continuously adjust, or they will fail. Our craft has become more data-driven and scientific than ever, but also requires more human touch, and SalesLoft is out in front as one of the most innovative companies supporting the needs of today's sales organizations. I'm looking forward to helping our customers take advantage of new opportunities, continue to deliver the best sales experience for their customers, and generate the most revenue possible.\"\nMurray believes organizations need to change the sales function in order to be more successful, considering many buyers are now much farther along in the sales process when they first engage with a rep. He believes reps must be able to deliver commercial insights and better position themselves as experts that can help solve customer challenges. At SalesLoft, Murray is looking to expand the company's efforts to guide customers to adopt a blend of human and machine learning approaches that will make them more successful.\n\"Our purpose is to activate the authentic seller in all of us,\" adds Murray. \"The best salespeople today rely more on human connection than automation. More on teaching than technology. At the same time, technology plays a more valuable role than ever in assisting great salespeople with the insights and intelligence they need to engage with and build stronger relationships with even more customers and less effort than ever before. I am most excited about leading a team that's doing this better than anyone else in the market today.\"\nMurray is currently reaching out to SalesLoft customers and starting to work with their teams to improve performance in 2018. SalesLoft customers interested in working with Murray more closely should plan to attend SalesLoft's 4th Annual Rainmaker Conference March 5-7 in Atlanta, Georgia . Customers should contact their Account Executive to coordinate time with Murray at the event.\nAbout SalesLoft\nSalesLoft is the number one sales engagement platform, helping companies deliver the best experience to their customers and prospects so they generate the most revenue and prospects so they generate the most revenue. SalesLoft customers are able to harmoniously blend the scalable automation side of sales with that of the human authentic experience.
