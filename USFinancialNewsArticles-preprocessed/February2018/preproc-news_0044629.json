    "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday, during a U.N. Security Council Middle East meeting, that U.S. negotiators were “ready to talk, but we will not chase after you.”\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and U.S. Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt sat behind Haley at the Security Council meeting. Kushner and Greenblatt are working on a new Middle East peace plan.\nAbbas did not stay in the council chamber for Haley’s remarks.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols\n ",
