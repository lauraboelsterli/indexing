The table also provides a reconciliation to GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for each period presented (amounts shown in thousands, except share and per share data 1 — unaudited):\nFor the Three Months Ended December 31,\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(per share)\n(per share)\n(per share)\n(per share)\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n215,983\n$\n1.69\n$\n82,403\n$\n0.65\n$\n479,013\n$\n3.76\n$\n366,127\n$\n2.91\nImpact of the difference in weighted average number of shares – diluted 2\n(0.09)\n(0.04)\n(0.21)\n(0.17)\nAdjustments:\nReal estate depreciation\n44,931\n0.33\n41,563\n0.31\n172,660\n1.28\n155,358\n1.16\nAmortization of intangibles\n2,427\n0.02\n6,042\n0.05\n13,591\n0.10\n20,467\n0.15\nLoss (gain) on real estate transactions, earnout from prior acquisition and impairment of real estate\n(118,808)\n(0.88)\n1,349\n0.01\n(112,789)\n(0.84)\n(8,465)\n(0.06)\nUnconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization\n1,222\n0.01\n1,024\n0.01\n5,489\n0.04\n4,505\n0.03\nUnconsolidated joint venture gain on sale of properties and purchase of partners' interests\n—\n—\n(4,767)\n(0.04)\n—\n—\n(69,199)\n(0.51)\nDistributions paid on Series A Preferred Operating Partnership units\n(572)\n(0.01)\n(1,271)\n(0.01)\n(3,119)\n(0.02)\n(5,085)\n(0.04)\nIncome allocated to Operating Partnership noncontrolling interests\n13,377\n0.10\n8,013\n0.06\n35,306\n0.26\n30,962\n0.23\nFFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders\n$\n158,560\n$\n1.17\n$\n134,356\n$\n1.00\n$\n590,151\n$\n4.37\n$\n494,670\n$\n3.70\nAdjustments:\nRevaluation of deferred tax related to tax reform\n(8,106)\n(0.06)\n—\n—\n(8,106)\n(0.06)\n—\n—\nProperty losses and tenant re-insurance claims due to hurricanes, net\n—\n—\n—\n—\n4,360\n0.03\n—\n—\nNon-cash interest expense related to amortization of discount on equity portion of exchangeable senior notes\n1,276\n0.01\n1,264\n0.01\n5,103\n0.04\n4,980\n0.04\nNon-cash interest benefit related to out of market debt\n—\n—\n(44)\n—\n—\n—\n(872)\n(0.01)\nLoss related to settlement of legal action\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n4,000\n0.03\nAcquisition related costs and other 3\n—\n—\n2,987\n0.02\n—\n—\n12,111\n0.09\nCore FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders\n$\n151,730\n$\n1.12\n$\n138,563\n$\n1.03\n$\n591,508\n$\n4.38\n$\n514,889\n$\n3.85\nWeighted average number of shares – diluted 4\n135,028,104\n134,831,414\n135,066,080\n133,798,946\n(1)\nPer share amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.\n(2)\nAdjustment to account for the difference between the number of shares used to calculate earnings per share and the number of shares used to calculate FFO per share. Earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method, which uses a lower number of shares than the calculation for FFO per share and Core FFO per share, which are calculated assuming full redemption of all OP units as described in note (4).\n(3)\nBeginning January 1, 2017, acquisition related costs have been capitalized due to the adoption of ASU 2017-01\"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\", thus eliminating the need for an adjustment to Core FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders.\n(4)\nExtra Space Storage LP (the \"Operating Partnership\") has outstanding preferred and common Operating Partnership units (\"OP units\"). These OP units can be redeemed for cash or, at the Company's election, shares of the Company's common stock. Redemption of all OP units for common stock has been assumed for purposes of calculating the weighted average number of shares — diluted as presented above. The computation of weighted average number of shares — diluted for FFO per share and Core FFO per share also includes the effect of share-based compensation plans and shares related to the exchangeable senior notes using the treasury stock method.\nOperating Results and Same-Store Performance:\nThe following table outlines the Company's same-store performance for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (amounts shown in thousands, except store count data—unaudited) 1 :\nFor the Three Months\nEnded December 31,\nPercent\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercent\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSame-store rental revenues 2\n$\n210,803\n$\n200,882\n4.9%\n$\n831,453\n$\n790,864\n5.1%\nSame-store operating expenses 2\n55,909\n54,355\n2.9%\n224,353\n223,173\n0.5%\nSame-store net operating income 2\n$\n154,894\n$\n146,527\n5.7%\n$\n607,100\n$\n567,691\n6.9%\nSame-store square foot occupancy as of quarter end\n91.9%\n91.5%\n91.9%\n91.5%\nProperties included in same-store 3\n701\n701\n701\n701\n(1)\nA reconciliation of net income to same-store net operating income is provided later in this release, entitled \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Total Same-Store Net Operating Income.\"\n(2)\nSame-store revenues, same-store operating expenses and same-store net operating income do not include tenant reinsurance revenue or expense.\n(3)\nThe properties included in the same-store pool were reduced from 732 stores as of September 30, 2017 to 701 as of December 31, 2017 due to 30 properties in which a majority interest was sold during the quarter, as well as one property which experienced a fire.\nSame-store revenues for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 increased due to gains in occupancy and higher rental rates for both new and existing customers. Expenses were higher for the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in property taxes, payroll and benefits and marketing, which were partially offset by decreases in repairs and maintenance and insurance. Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were moderately higher primarily due to increases in property taxes and marketing expense offset by decreases in repairs and maintenance and insurance.\nMajor markets with revenue growth above the Company's portfolio average for the year ended December 31, 2017 included Hawaii, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Sacramento. Major markets performing below the Company's portfolio average included Boston, Dallas, Denver and Houston.\nInvestment and Third-Party Management Activity:\nThe following table outlines the Company's acquisitions and developments that are closed, completed or under agreement (dollars in thousands – unaudited):\nClosed through\nDecember 31, 2017\nClosed Subsequent to\nDecember 31, 2017\nScheduled to\nClose/Complete in\n2018\nTotal to\nClose/Complete in\n2018\nTo Close/Complete\nin 2019-2020\nStores\nPrice\nStores\nPrice\nStores\nPrice\nStores\nPrice\nStores\nPrice\nOperating Stores\n30\n$\n407,050\n4\n$\n50,311\n2\n$\n25,550\n6\n$\n75,861\n—\n$\n—\nC of O and Development Stores 1\n9\n105,412\n—\n—\n5\n77,233\n5\n77,233\n4\n48,928\nBuyout of JV Partners' Interest In Operating Stores 2\n6\n58,869\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nBuyout of JV Partners' Interest in C of O Stores 2,3\n—\n4,806\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nTotal Wholly-Owned and Buyout of JV Partners' Interest\n45\n576,137\n4\n50,311\n7\n102,783\n11\n153,094\n4\n48,928\nJV C of O and Development Stores (total purchase price) 1\n7\n87,410\n1\n8,800\n16\n339,414\n17\n348,214\n4\n67,643\n(Less) Joint Venture Partner Investment\n(60,745)\n(7,920)\n(235,568)\n(243,488)\n(35,297)\nTotal EXR Investment in JV C of O and Development Stores\n7\n26,665\n1\n880\n16\n103,846\n17\n104,726\n4\n32,346\nTotal EXR Investment\n52\n$\n602,802\n5\n$\n51,191\n23\n$\n206,629\n28\n$\n257,820\n8\n$\n81,274\n(1)\nThe locations of development and Certificate of Occupancy stores and joint venture ownership interest details are included in the supplemental financial information published on the Company's website at www.extraspace.com .\n(2)\nThe buyout of JV partners' interest in stores is reported at the value paid for the partners' remaining ownership interest.\n(3)\nA joint venture, in which the Company had a majority interest, purchased a Certificate of Occupancy store on April 11, 2017. The Company purchased the JV partner's interest in the same property for $4,806 prior to year-end. The buyout is not counted in the store count totals since it was already considered in the \"Closed through December 31, 2017\" store count, but the buyout amount is considered.\nThe projected developments and acquisitions under agreement described above are subject to customary closing conditions and no assurance can be provided that these developments and acquisitions will be completed on the terms described, or at all.\nDispositions:\nOn November 30, 2017, the Company sold 36 stores, 30 of which were in the same store pool, for a total sales price of $295.0 million into a joint venture. The Company now owns a 10% interest in the joint venture and TIAA, through an account advised by TH Real Estate, ultimately owns the remaining 90%. Proceeds from the transaction were reinvested in a series of acquisitions through 1031 exchanges. All 36 properties sold to the joint venture continue to be managed by the Company.\nProperty Management:\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company managed 422 stores for third-party owners. With an additional 215 stores owned and operated in joint ventures, the Company had a total of 637 stores under management. The Company continues to be the largest self-storage management company in the United States.\nBalance Sheet:\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not sell any shares of common stock using its \"at the market\" (\"ATM\") equity program. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $349.4 million available for issuance under the ATM program.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's percentage of fixed-rate debt to total debt was 74.7%. The weighted average interest rates of the Company's fixed and variable-rate debt were 3.3% and 3.1%, respectively. The combined weighted average interest rate was 3.3% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.7 years.\nDividends:\nOn December 29, 2017, the Company paid a fourth quarter common stock dividend of $0.78 per share to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 15, 2017.\nOutlook:\nThe following table outlines the Company's FFO estimates and annual assumptions for the year ending December 31, 2018 1 :\nRanges for 2018\nAnnual Assumptions\nNotes\nLow\nHigh\nFunds from operations attributable to common stockholders and unit holders\n$\n4.52\n$\n4.62\nCore funds from operations attributable to common stockholders\n$\n4.55\n$\n4.65\nDilution per share from C of O and value add acquisitions\n$\n0.21\n$\n0.21\nSame-store property revenue growth\n3.25\n%\n4.25\n%\nAssumes a same-store pool of 787 stores and excludes tenant reinsurance\nSame-store property expense growth\n3.25\n%\n4.25\n%\nAssumes a same-store pool of 787 stores and excludes tenant reinsurance\nSame-store property NOI growth\n3.00\n%\n4.50\n%\nAssumes a same-store pool of 787 stores and excludes tenant reinsurance\nWeighted average one-month LIBOR\n1.91\n%\n1.91\n%\nNet tenant reinsurance income\n$\n90,500,000\n$\n91,500,000\nManagement fees, other income and interest income\n$\n46,000,000\n$\n47,000,000\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$\n82,000,000\n$\n83,000,000\nIncludes non-cash compensation expense\nAverage monthly cash balance\n$\n50,000,000\n$\n50,000,000\nEquity in earnings of real estate ventures\n$\n16,500,000\n$\n16,500,000\nAcquisition of operating stores (wholly-owned)\n$\n175,000,000\n$\n175,000,000\nDevelopment and C of O stores (wholly-owned)\n$\n120,000,000\n$\n120,000,000\nInvestment in Development and C of O stores in joint venture\n$\n105,000,000\n$\n105,000,000\nRepresents the Company's investment\nInterest expense\n$\n171,000,000\n$\n173,000,000\nNon-cash interest expense related to exchangeable senior notes\n$\n5,000,000\n$\n5,000,000\nExcluded from Core FFO\nTaxes associated with the Company's taxable REIT subsidiary\n$\n9,500,000\n$\n9,500,000\nWeighted average share count\n135,200,000\n135,200,000\nAssumes redemption of all OP units for common stock\n(1)\nA reconciliation of net income outlook to same-store net operating income outlook is provided later in this release entitled \"Reconciliation of Estimated GAAP Net Income to Estimated Same-Store Net Operating Income.\" The reconciliation includes details related to same-store revenue and same-store expense outlooks.

Forward-looking statements include statements concerning the benefits of store acquisitions, developments, favorable market conditions, our outlook and estimates for the year and other statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions and developments and other information that is not historical information. In some cases, can be identified by terminology such as \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"anticipates,\" or \"intends,\" or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. We may also make additional from time to time. All such subsequent , whether written or oral, by us or on our behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to the contained in or contemplated by this release. Any should be considered in light of the risks referenced in the \"Risk Factors\" section included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Such factors include, but are not limited to:\nadverse changes in general economic conditions, the real estate industry and the markets in which we operate; failure to close pending acquisitions and developments on expected terms, or at all; the effect of competition from new and existing stores or other storage alternatives, which could cause rents and occupancy rates to decline; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national, state and local laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those governing real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"), tenant reinsurance and other aspects of our business, which could adversely affect our results; disruptions in credit and financial markets and resulting difficulties in raising capital or obtaining credit at reasonable rates or at all, which could impede our ability to grow; increases in interest rates; reductions in asset valuations and related impairment charges; our lack of sole decision-making authority with respect to our joint venture investments; the effect of recent changes to U.S. tax laws; the failure to maintain our REIT status for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and economic uncertainty due to the impact of natural disasters, war or terrorism, which could adversely affect our business plan.\nAll are based upon our current expectations and various assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them, but there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. All apply only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nDefinition of FFO:\nFFO provides relevant and meaningful information about the Company's operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of the Company's operating results. The Company believes FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net income. Net income assumes that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and the Company believes FFO more accurately reflects the value of the Company's real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (\"NAREIT\") as net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. The Company believes that to further understand the Company's performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with GAAP.\nFor informational purposes, the Company also presents Core FFO, which in previous quarters was referred to as FFO as adjusted. There have been no definitional changes between FFO as adjusted and Core FFO. Core FFO excludes revenues and expenses not core to our operations, acquisition related costs (prior to 2017) and non-cash interest. Although the Company's calculation of Core FFO differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, the Company believes it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance. The Company believes that by excluding revenues and expenses not core to our operations, the costs related to acquiring stores and non-cash interest charges, stockholders and potential investors are presented with an indicator of its operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. Core FFO by the Company should not be considered a replacement of the NAREIT definition of FFO. The computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an indicator of the Company's ability to make cash distributions.\nDefinition of Same-Store:\nThe Company's same-store pool for the periods presented consists of 701 stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented. The same-store pool store count decreased from 732 stores as of September 30, 2017 due to a sale of the majority interest in 30 stores, as well as damage to a store from a fire, requiring removal from the pool. The Company considers a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80.0% or more for one calendar year. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to occupancy, rental revenue (growth), operating expenses (growth), net operating income (growth), etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company's stores as a whole.\nAbout Extra Space Storage Inc.:\nExtra Space Storage Inc., headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and a member of the S&P 500.
