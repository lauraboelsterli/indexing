    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel spared no feelings Thursday as he defended Snapchat’s hotly debated redesign. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs investor event, he said user protests are “ reinforcing ” the company’s philosophy, Variety reports. For example, some people complained that before the redesign, celebrities felt like friends. Now they appear in the app’s public stories section—a move Mr. Spiegel described as fundamentally more authentic. “They’re not your friends,” he said. TGIF.\nOmnigloom Despite signs of an accelerating economy, Omnicom Group predicts organic revenue may come in softer for 2018, CMO Today’s Suzanne Vranica writes. The New York-based ad conglomerate, which owns companies such as BBDO, DDB and ad buyer OMD, said it expects organic growth of 2% to 3%, compared with 2017’s organic revenue growth of 3%. On the earnings call, Omnicom Chief Executive John Wren said challenges in the marketplace remain, such as companies dealing with shareholder activism, new competitors and changes in technology. The company also reported lackluster fourth-quarter revenue, blaming a pullback by marketers on project work, losses at some independent-branded agencies and ​softness in its programmatic business. Marketers have been increasingly asking for more-transparent ways to do automated ad buying. Omnicom’s stock fell 6% in afternoon trading.\nTwo is Better Than One Ad revenue growth is a distant dream for most legacy publishers. But Meredith’s executive chairman, Stephen Lacy, is confident that with added digital scale from its merger with Time Inc., the publisher is in a better position to compete with ad behemoths such as Facebook and Google, he told The Wall Street Journal’s Jeff Trachtenberg in a Q&A. “We think we can move Time Inc.’s advertising revenue in the marketplace to performing at a level of what we’ve done, and reach a point where the growth in digital offsets the print declines and allows for organic growth,” he said. While sobering, declines in ad revenue have forced publishers to make tough decisions—for example, despite Ladies’ Home Journal’s large readership, Meredith decided to end its regular monthly publication in 2014. “Unfortunately it had a very difficult time in the advertising marketplace because the title to young female buyers in the ad agencies was off-putting,” he said. “Even though it was a good journalistic write and read, it was moving to the point where it wasn’t going to make any money anymore.”\nUniversal Problem Inappropriate behavior on Madison Avenue isn’t restricted to ad agencies. After receiving “allegations of inappropriate conduct” in the marketing department, NBCU’s entertainment studio Universal fired creative, strategy and research executive Seth Byers and put marketing chief Josh Goldstine on administrative leave, according to Deadline, which published a copy of an internal memo confirming the news from Universal executives Jeff Shell and Donna Langley. The company didn’t provide details of the allegations. In the memo, the executives said they’ll be doing a “full review in the marketing department to ensure every employee has the opportunity to voice concerns.” Deadline, which made attempts to reach Mr. Byers and Mr. Goldstine, reports that “Goldstine might have tried to handle the issue with Byers by himself, instead of going through studio protocols.” In light of the news, the Hollywood Reporter also reported Thursday that another creative executive, Scott Abraham, was fired for “alleged sexual misconduct” in November. Mr. Abraham told THR, “That is categorically untrue.”\nData Stories Newspapers have their own plans to drum up new business. As CMO Today’s Ben Mullin reports, the New York Times wants to offer data tools to marketers to help them develop targeted branded campaigns. Supporting the effort will be a new team dedicated to adapting existing tools across various divisions, including data science, product and design, technology and advertising. One tool coming out of the new group attaches ads to stories that are expected to have a certain impact on readers. Another looks at which stories resonate with readers in different countries, as well as which topics were popular among different types of readers, helping advertisers do targeted advertising. “Marketers feel inundated with data but have not yet figured out the best way to deal with it,” said Allison Murphy, vice president of ad innovation at the Times.\nElsewhere The NFL may have had its ratings challenges this past season, but it’s still a hot property if the Thursday night streaming auction is any indication. Twitter, Amazon, YouTube and Verizon are all still in the race for the rights to stream games on Thursday nights. [ Recode ]\nState schools salivating at the prospect of selling ads on buses shouldn’t get too excited just yet, since a bill that could generate that added revenue for schools faces some delays. A majority in Virginia Senate Education and Health Committee wants to spend some time studying the issue and revisit it next year. [ Richmond Times Dispatch ]\nThe Sinclair-Tribune deal may have just hit a snag. A federal inspector general “has agreed to investigate actions by federal regulators” that could ease Sinclair Broadcast Group’s effort to acquire Tribune Media, possibly complicating and further delaying the government’s review of the $3.9 billion deal. [ WSJ ]\nIf you had doubts about Amazon’s ad muscle, a new analyst estimate might change your mind. According to Business Insider, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian predicted Amazon will generate $3 billion to $4 billion from advertising in 2018. [ Business Insider ]\nCBS said in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it has five million subscribers across its direct-to-consumer offering for Showtime and streaming service CBS All Access. It expects that number to grow to eight million in 2020. [ WSJ ]\nVimeo wants to simplify the video distribution process for creators with a couple of new tools. One lets creators simultaneously stream live video to behemoths like Facebook, YouTube, Twitch and Periscope, while another allows creators upload to both Facebook and YouTube at the same time.
