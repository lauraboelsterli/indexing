    "text": "PARIS, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Shares in European planemaker Airbus fell on Thursday after the company said it was considering increasing a provision for losses on its contract for the troubled A400M military transport plane.\nAirbus shares were down around 1 percent in early trade, making it one of the worst performers on Franceâ€™s benchmark CAC-40 index, which was down 0.3 percent.\nLate on Wednesday, Airbus issued a warning over the A400M plane programme after its European NATO buyers agreed to negotiate a new delivery schedule and contract terms.\nThe A400M - ordered by Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey - has been hit by engine gearbox problems and delays in fitting parachuting capacity and advanced defences.
