    "text": "KINGSTON, N.Y., Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DragonSearch, a marketing agency based in New York, today announced a rebranding and name change to Dragon360, emphasizing the evolution of marketing to a multi-channel, multi-disciplinary, customer journey. With this rebrand, Dragon360 cements its commitment that marketing should be approached holistically, and every aspect of a company's online presence should work together to serve the end-customer.\n\"With the evolution of digital marketing over the last decade, moving from a search-centric approach to the omnichannel environment of today, our team has always been at the forefront - creating and implementing strategies using a holistic approach that goes beyond search,\" says Andrew Groller, newly appointed executive vice president of Dragon360. \"Now, our name will more accurately represent our capabilities, skills and expertise.\"\nAfter successfully growing the company's media buying and strategy services over the last 10 years, Groller moves into a new role focused on overseeing Dragon360's operations, product development and digital strategy development. Abe Uchitelle, Dragon360's president, will continue to lead business development and client relations.\n\"Instead of viewing digital marketing through the lens of individual tactics, we approach the goals of our clients as a whole,\" continues Groller. \"At the core are three main components or pillars which are part of any successful strategy: traffic acquisition, traffic conversion and brand growth. This three-pillar approach is what Dragon360 is built on to meet the needs of today's omnichannel marketing.\"\nKey services provided by Dragon360 in executing this three-pillared approach:\nMedia Buying, Planning and Strategy\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO)\nContent Strategy and Creation\nCreative Services\nUser Experience Design (UXD) and Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)\nCommunity Building and Influencer Outreach\nEmail Marketing\nFounded in 2007 by company owner Don Tallerman, the agency now known as Dragon360 was formed to provide industry-leading digital marketing services to clients throughout the United States and beyond.
