Reported fourth quarter 2017 results reflected an incremental $37 million non-cash tax expense primarily related to revaluing the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of federal tax reform legislation. Excluding the impact of this one-time charge and other non-run-rate items, adjusted net income was $20 million or $1.22 per diluted share, 2017, down from adjusted net income of $23 million or $1.27 per diluted share, 2016.\nFor the full year 2017, the Company reported net income of $45 million or $2.63 per diluted share, compared to net income of $92 million, or $5.09 per diluted share in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the one-time tax charge in the fourth quarter and other non-run-rate items, adjusted net income was $88 million or $5.09 per diluted share, for the full year 2017 compared to adjusted net income of $87 million or $4.83 per diluted share for the prior year period. Reported full year 2017 results reflected a 66% effective tax rate due to the one-time tax charge in the fourth quarter. Reported and as adjusted 2016 results included approximately $11 million of additional pre-tax expense associated with the early retirement of the Company’s 8.25% unsecured senior notes in the second quarter.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Summary\n“Fourth quarter 2017 results were consistent with our expectations reflecting normal seasonal demand weakness and higher planned major maintenance expense. As expected, our Trentwood facility continued to experience some inefficiencies during the quarter as the ramp-up of new equipment was completed,” said Jack A. Hockema, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n“For the full year 2017, we achieved record shipments and near record adjusted EBITDA and margin despite headwinds from aerospace supply chain destocking, lower-than-anticipated automotive build rates, competitive price pressure, and construction-related disruptions at our Trentwood facility,” said Mr. Hockema.\nGrowth in overall shipments was driven by strong demand for the Company's general engineering and automotive applications that more than offset tempered demand for aerospace applications due to supply chain destocking. Value added revenue declined from the prior year as a result of the leaner mix and the impact of price pressure on higher value added revenue products. Sales margins were compressed on high value added products as competitive price pressure prevented pass through of the increasing contained metal costs. Favorable scrap raw material prices and the Company's initiatives to achieve more efficient raw material utilization partially offset the impact from reduced sales margins.\n\"Despite the inefficiencies at our Trentwood facility due to construction-related project work, overall manufacturing cost efficiency continued to improve as strong performance across the manufacturing platform more than offset Trentwood inefficiencies. Considering the extent of construction-related disruption at Trentwood during the year, our 2017 manufacturing efficiency improvement was a significant accomplishment, particularly given the step-change and record level we achieved in 2016,\" stated Mr. Hockema.\nDuring the year the Company continued to execute on its capital investment program to further enhance quality and efficiency, expand capacity, and sustain strong competitive manufacturing capabilities. The $76 million capital spending in 2017 was primarily focused on modernizing the hot line and light gauge heat treat plate equipment at its Trentwood facility. \"The 2017 project work around the hot line and thin gauge heat treat plate equipment led to significant construction-related downtime but will also have a very positive impact on quality, cost and capacity in the future. Additional capital investments will be made as we complete the $150 million five-year modernization program,\" said Mr. Hockema.\nIn addition to investments to support further organic growth, during the year the Company returned approximately $115 million of cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with its capital deployment priorities, the Company has steadily increased its quarterly dividend over the past seven years, increasing it 11% to $0.50 per share in early 2017 and an additional 10% to $0.55 per share in early 2018.\n“Going forward we will continue to invest in organic growth and asset integrity initiatives. In addition, we will seek complementary inorganic growth opportunities to create additional value for our shareholders. Furthermore, we will continue to return cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends and disciplined share repurchases,” said Mr. Hockema.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Consolidated Results (Unaudited)* (In millions of dollars, except shipments, realized price and per share amounts) Twelve Months Ended Quarterly December 31, 4Q17 3Q17 4Q16 2017 2016 Shipments (millions of lbs.) 153 150 152 626 614 Net sales $ 353 $ 333 $ 332 $ 1,398 $ 1,331 Less hedged cost of alloyed metal 1 (159 ) (146 ) (131 ) (611 ) (518 ) Value added revenue $ 194 $ 187 $ 201 $ 786 $ 813 Realized price per pound ($/lb.)

Totals may not sum due to rounding. Fourth Quarter 2017\nNet sales 2017 were $353 million, up approximately 6% from $332 million in the prior year period, reflecting 1% higher shipments and a 5% increase in average selling price. The increase in average selling price reflected an approximately 21% increase in underlying contained metal and a 4% decline in value added revenue per pound.\nDespite 1% higher shipments, value added revenue (net sales less the hedged cost of alloyed metal) of $194 million 2017 was down 4% compared to $201 million in the prior year period due to lower sales margins on non-contract sales and a leaner mix of shipments. Value added revenue for the Company's aerospace/high strength applications declined 8% to $110 million, reflecting a 6% decline in shipments due to continued supply chain destocking. Value added revenue for automotive extrusions increased 10% to $29 million, reflecting a 14% increase in shipments driven by growth of new bumper programs, and value added revenue for general engineering applications declined 2% to $50 million reflecting 4% higher shipments offset by a leaner product mix and competitive pricing pressure.\nConsolidated operating income as reported was $40 million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $45 million in the prior year. The fourth quarter 2017 reflected non-cash, non-run-rate gains of $3 million that included a $5 million mark-to-market gain on commodity hedges. Adjusted for non-cash, non-run-rate items, consolidated operating income of $37 million declined $5 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting a $6 million adverse sales impact as lower sales margins were partially offset by favorable price spreads on scrap raw material. Additionally, $4 million of higher major maintenance and slightly higher depreciation expense were more than offset by favorable overhead and other costs.\nAdjusted consolidated EBITDA of $48 million in the fourth quarter 2017 declined $4 million compared to the prior year period reflecting the adverse sales impact and higher major maintenance expense previously discussed, partially offset by favorable overhead and other costs.\nFull Year 2017\nNet sales for full year 2017 were $1.4 billion, up approximately 5% from $1.3 billion in the prior year period, reflecting 2% higher shipments and a 3% increase in average selling price. The increase in average selling price reflected approximately a 14% increase in underlying contained metal costs and a 5% decline in value added revenue per pound.\nDespite a 2% increase in shipments, value added revenue of $786 million for full year 2017 was down 3% compared to $813 million in the prior year period due to lower margins on non-contract sales and a leaner mix of shipments. Value added revenue for the Company's aerospace/high strength applications declined 8% to $430 million reflecting a 4% decline in shipments due to supply chain destocking and temporary throughput constraints. Value added revenue for automotive extrusions increased 5% to $118 million, reflecting a 9% increase in shipments, and value added revenue for general engineering applications increased 2% to $215 million, driven by a 6% increase in shipments, partially offset by higher contained metal costs that the Company was unable to pass through on certain products due to competitive pricing pressure.\nConsolidated operating income was $151 million for full year 2017 compared to $178 million in the prior year period. Full year 2017 included an $18 million impairment charge to reduce goodwill associated with the January 2011 acquisition of Alexco and a $19 million mark-to-market gain related to commodity hedges. Adjusted for non-cash, non-run-rate items, consolidated operating income of $159 million declined $11 million compared to the prior year period due, in part, to $4 million of higher depreciation expense in 2017.\nAdjusted consolidated EBITDA of $199 million for full year 2017 declined $8 million compared to the record prior year period. A $21 million adverse sales impact reflected lower sales margins, partially offset by favorable price spreads on scrap raw material. Our continued focus on cost efficiency led to $16 million of favorable manufacturing, overhead and other costs, partially offsetting the sales impact and $3 million higher major maintenance expense. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of value added revenue was to 25.3%, nearly equal to the record 25.4% in the prior year period.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nAdjusted EBITDA of $199 million during full year 2017 funded working capital requirements, capital expenditures of approximately $76 million, interest and quarterly dividend payments and contributions totaling $20 million to the Union VEBA and Salaried VEBAs. The Company returned $115 million of cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Company will make a $2.9 million cash contribution to the Salaried VEBA and a $12.8 million cash contribution to the Union VEBA. The $12.8 million payment is the Company's final contribution to the Union VEBA, while the Company's obligation to the Salaried VEBA will continue into the future, with contributions capped at $2.9 million per year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately $235 million and borrowing availability under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility was approximately $292 million.\nAs a result of the tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017, the Company recorded a $37 million non-cash, non-run-rate tax expense, primarily related to revaluing the future tax savings of its net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). The tax reform placed no limitations on the Company’s ability to use its NOLs, which totaled $275 million at year-end 2017. Beginning in 2018, the Company estimates its blended state and federal tax rate to be in the mid-20 percent range and its cash tax rate will continue to be in the low single-digits until its NOLs are fully utilized.\n2018 Outlook\n“As we look to our aerospace/high strength applications, we expect improving demand in 2018 and 2019 as supply chain destocking runs its course in 2018 and as airframe manufacturers continue to ramp-up build rates to address the large 9-year order backlog. In addition, the new defense budget strengthens the demand outlook for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and other military applications. We are very well-positioned in the marketplace and, with supply chain destocking moderating as we proceed through the year, we expect mid-single-digit year-over-year growth in our 2018 shipments for these applications,” said Mr. Hockema. “However, we continue to expect higher contained metal costs and competitive price pressure to continue in 2018.\n“For our automotive extrusion applications, North American build rates are expected to improve 1-2% year-over-year following the 4% decline in builds in 2017. We expect mid-single digit year-over-year growth in 2018 for our automotive shipments and value added revenue.\n“We have generated a 6% compound annual growth rate in both our shipments and value added revenue for general engineering applications over the past three years driven by improving, broad-based industrial demand. We are cautiously optimistic about underlying demand as we look forward. However, as we have previously discussed, we continue to experience price pressure on our high value-added products from both imports and increasing metal costs,\" said Mr. Hockema.\nOverall the Company anticipates mid-single-digit growth in shipments and value added revenue for the full year 2018 with adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-20 percent range as improving cost efficiency and operating leverage counteract sales margin pressure due to rising contained metal costs. Major maintenance costs in 2018 are expected to be similar to 2017. Capital investment over the next three years, from 2018 through 2020, will remain focused on continued improvement in quality and cost efficiency. Total annual spending is expected to be approximately $80 million per year, with sustaining capital reinvestment expected to be equivalent to approximately 75% of annual depreciation expense.\n“As we proceed through 2018 and look longer-term, we anticipate improving results driven by growing demand for our aerospace, automotive extrusions and general engineering applications and continued improvement in underlying manufacturing cost efficiency,” concluded Mr. Hockema.\nConference Call\nKaiser Aluminum Corporation will host a conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018, at 10:00am (Pacific Time); 12:00pm (Central Time); 1:00pm (Eastern Time), to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.
