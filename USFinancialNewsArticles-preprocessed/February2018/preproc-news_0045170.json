    "text": "NEW YORK and SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Union Square Advisors , a technology-focused boutique investment bank, has announced today the release of its inaugural Outlook report .\nWith technology representing one-quarter of the value of all public equity markets, it's increasingly essential for emerging and established organizations to stay attuned to advances in the sector. The Outlook report addresses a myriad of trending issues across tech M&A and capital raising including:\nDrivers for technology M&A and investment : What's driving M&A activity in 2018, including increased corporate confidence and potential tax bill savings. Opportunities in cloud computing and software: Investment in cloud and software will be driven by digital transformation, workplace automation and the convergence of once-discrete network, compute and storage technologies. Co-opetition between the Fab Four: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google will continue to expand in overlapping technology sub-sectors, including: digital media, the cloud, smart home, autonomous vehicles, alternative payments and virtual and augmented reality. The benefits of a \"hybrid\" equity-debt fundraising approach : This combined approach offers the opportunity for firms to raise a targeted amount of capital, with a lower combined cost and less dilution.\n\"This year, we are embarking on the Fourth Industrial Revolution, particularly as firms shift from technology transformation to optimization,\" said Carter McClelland, Chairman and Co-Founder of Union Square Advisors. \"This report highlights our team's insights amidst this transformation and touches on the convergence, connectivity, security and software changes happening across the technology sector.\"\nThe 2018 Outlook report is introduced on the heels of Union Square Advisors' tenth anniversary.
