    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 5:42 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Only Kane can answer questions on Spurs future - Pochettino Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Harry Kane is happy at Tottenham Hotspur but only the England striker himself can answer questions regarding his long-term commitment to the Premier League club, manager Mauricio Pochettino said. \nKane has excelled at his boyhood club in recent seasons and scored his 100th Premier League goal in the 2-2 draw at Liverpool on Sunday, but the forward has made it clear that winning trophies was his priority. \nThe 24-year-old signed a deal to remain at Tottenham until 2022 but former England international team mate Wayne Rooney told Sky Sports on Monday that Kane could contemplate his future if fifth-placed Tottenham do not start winning trophies. \nAsked about Kane’s long-term future, Pochettino said: “That is a question for him, not me. Of course, he wants to score goals and win titles but I cannot say anything more about this.” \nKane has attracted interest from major European clubs in recent seasons, with Real Madrid’s former president Ramon Calderon stating in October that he expected the Spanish club to try to sign the forward. \n“He is so happy here and he loves Tottenham but this is a personal question, regarding what he thinks and how he feels. I cannot answer for him,” Pochettino added.

I am worried. It’s a sport that we love, a passionate sport that people love to watch around the world,” the Argentine added. \n“We will be pushing that sport into a very rigid structure with VAR, with being focused too much on the small actions like this,” he added. \nTottenham host north London rivals Arsenal in a league match at Wembley on Saturday.
