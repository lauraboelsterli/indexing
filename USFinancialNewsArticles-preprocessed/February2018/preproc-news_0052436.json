    "text": "Joel Embiid had 28 points and 14 rebounds to lead six Philadelphia 76ers players in double figures in a 116-105 victory over the Orlando Magic on Saturday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.\nEmbiid recorded his 22nd game of at least 20 points and 10 rebounds.\nBen Simmons added 17 points, JJ Redick contributed 16 and Marco Belinelli had 15 for the Sixers, who won their seventh in a row.\nRobert Covington also scored 12 points, and Dario Saric had 11.\nThe Sixers also won 10 straight at home for the first time since 2002-03 in coach Larry Brown’s final season.\nAaron Gordon led the Magic with 20 points while Evan Fournier added 16 and Nikola Vucevic had 15. Mario Hezonja also had 13.\nPhiladelphia was cruising and even received a rare 3-pointer from Trevor Booker to give it a 95-75 lead early in the fourth. It was only Booker’s fifth trey all season and just his second as a member of the Sixers.\nThe 20-point lead was more than enough for the Sixers to hold on, though it wasn’t always pretty down the stretch.\nOrlando did manage to get within 11 at 108-97 with 3:22 left following a 13-2 run.\nHezonja hit a pair of free throws with 2:15 remaining and suddenly the lead was sliced to 108-99.\nBelinelli came back with a clutch jumper to put Philadelphia back up 110-99.\nTimothe Luwawu-Cabarrot also added a big basket for a 112-101 advantage with 1:01 left.\nThe Sixers held an 87-71 lead after the third when T.J. McConnell’s layup landed through the net at the buzzer.\nBelinelli’s nifty driving layup gave the Sixers a 51-33 lead with 3:46 left in the first half. Covington followed with his fourth 3-pointer and a commanding 54-33 advantage.\nOn the Sixers’ next possession, Simmons dropped in a right-handed hook to cap a 10-0 run and push their lead to 56-33.\nThe Sixers led 58-40 at halftime thanks in large part to Embiid’s 19 points and eight rebounds.\nOrlando held an early nine-point lead before the Sixers’ surge began.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
