We launched growth initiatives, resolved the uncertainties related to clearing, secured the first significant acquisitions since our IPO, delivered the first components of Optiq® and became MIFID II compliant,. As a consequence, we are publishing today a strong set of results, showing the strength and growth profile of a profoundly transformed Euronext.\nOur confidence is strong for the next two years. Core business revenue should grow in line with forecasts, and we will continue our cost control discipline to ensure the 61% to 63% EBITDA margin target is reached in 2019, excluding clearing activities. FastMatch and the Irish Stock Exchange at closing will further contribute to our 2019 performance. To reflect our active management of priorities, we now forecast €55m revenue at a 50% EBITDA margin for Agility for Growth initiatives in 2019. We will continue to deploy our capital through pertinent acquisitions and keep a 50% dividend pay-out ratio, showing our continued commitment to provide value creation to our shareholders.”\n1 Unless stated otherwise, percentages compare 2017 data to 2016 data\n2 Definition in appendix\n3 Swap without cash settlement.

This translated into improved trading volumes on both cash and derivatives markets, with derivatives also benefiting from The Order Machine (TOM) ceasing activities in the Netherlands in June 2017.\nAs a consequence, Euronext consolidated revenue increased by +7.2% in 2017, to €532.3 million, mainly driven by volume growth, the positive impact of Agility for Growth initiatives (€9.8 million), and by the acquisition of FastMatch in August 2017, which diversified Euronext’s top line with spot FX trading revenue (€7.2 million).\nOperational expenses excluding Depreciation & Amortisation increased by +10.3% to €234.5 million due to ongoing IT projects (including the development of our new trading platform, Optiq®, and compliance with MiFID II), the deployment of Agility for Growth initiatives, and incorporation of newly acquired businesses.\nAt the end of 2017, €10.9 million of cumulated cost savings had been achieved since 1 April 2016, down compared to the end of 2016 (€15.6 million), mainly due to the projects costs previously mentioned.\nDuring 2017, Agility for Growth initiatives generated €9.8 million of revenue and €11.0 million of costs, with the established initiatives funding the ramp-up of the earlier stage ones.\nEBITDA growth for the year was robust at +4.9%, to €297.8 million, representing a margin of 55.9%, down 1.2 points compared to 2016 due to the items presented above.\nExcluding the impact of the consolidation of FastMatch from mid-August 2017, Euronext consolidated revenue would have amounted to €525.1 million in 2017, up +5.8%, and EBITDA margin would have reached 56.3%, down 0.9 points compared to 2016.\nDepreciation and Amortisation increased by +12.2% in 2017, to €16.9 million, resulting from the impact of new acquisitions, with additional D&A and PPA 5 for €2.4 million starting from Q4 2017.\nOperating profit before exceptional items was €280.8 million, a +4.5% increase compared to 2016.\n€14.8 million of exceptional costs were booked in 2017 compared to €10.0 million of exceptional costs in 2016. As a reminder, these costs were primarily related to the €5.0m break-up fee in Q3 2017 for the termination of the agreement on derivatives clearing with ICE following the conclusion of an agreement with LCH SA. Other major exceptional costs included advisory costs, write-off of intangible assets and restructuring costs.\nNet financing expenses for 2017 were €3.6 million compared to net financing expenses of €0.8 million in 2016.\nResults from equity investment amounted to €48.6 million in 2017, of which €40.6 million are related to the capital gain resulting from the swap of Euronext’s 2.3% stake in LCH Group for an 11.1% stake in LCH SA on 29 December 2017 (refer to “Highlights of the period”).\nIncome tax for the full year 2017 was €68.9 million, representing an effective tax rate for the year of 22.1% (2016: €67.0 million and 25.4%). Income tax was impacted in 2017 by the non-recurring release of tax provisions for €20.4 million in Q4 2017 (€16.3 million in 2016 and €13.9 million in 2015).\nShare of non-controlling interests mainly relating to FastMatch (90% owned), iBabs (60% owned) and Company Webcast (51% owned) amounted to €0.9 million in 2017.\nAs a result, the net profit share of the Group for 2017 increased significantly by +22.5%, to €241.3 million. This represents an EPS of €3.47 basic and €3.45 fully diluted in 2017, compared to €2.83 basic and €2.82 fully diluted in 2016. The number of shares used for the basic calculation was 69,580,344 and for the fully diluted calculation was 69,908,523.\nAdjusted 6 EPS is up 4.8% in 2017, at €3.09, compared to €2.95 in 2016.\nAs of 31 December 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €187.8m, and €164.7m of outstanding long-term debt.\n1 Purchase Price Allocation\n2 Definition in appendix\n2017 business highlights\nListing\nIn €m, unless stated otherwise 2017 2016 % change Listing revenue 84.2 68.7 +22.6% Annual fees 32.6 29.8 +9.4% Follow-ons 21.5 19.7 +9.1% IPOs 7.8 8.1 -3.7% Corporate Services 9.1 0.5 n/a Others 6.4 5.7 +12.1% Bond fees 6.8 4.9 +38.0% Money raised 323,855 304,069 +6.5% Listing revenue was €84.2 million in 2017, an increase of +22.6% compared to 2016, confirming the growing use of equity financing on capital markets. This solid performance was driven by a continuing strong increase in follow-on activity and the positive impact of the Corporate Services initiative, part of the “Agility for Growth” strategic plan.\nPrimary market activity was slightly impacted by uncertainties around the political environment in Europe during the first quarter. However, 2017 saw the return of large capitalisations to Euronext’s markets with listings such as ALD and VolkerWessels. During the year 2017, 26 new listings, including 16 SME deals, were completed, compared to 28 listings in 2016. This translated into €3.4bn raised in 2017, a decrease from €3.7bn last year.\nIn 2017, Euronext continued to be the venue of choice for Tech SMEs with 13 new listings. In particular, 3 Tech companies from the first TechShare cohort listed on Euronext during the year. Euronext also successfully launched its European Tech SME initiative in four new countries outside of Euronext’s markets 7 to assist tech companies in developing their business on a greater scale through capital markets.\nSecondary markets recorded a very strong year on the back of strong M&A environment, confirming the use of capital market financing. This trend contributed to the strong increase in follow-on activity and in a record year with €57.9bn of secondary equity issues, compared to €56.4bn in 2016.\nIn total, €323.9bn in equity and debt were raised on our markets in 2017, compared to €304.1bn in 2016.\nCorporate Services, an Agility for Growth initiative, expanded its offering in 2017 and generated €9.1 million revenue, mainly due to the good performance of 2017 acquisitions, namely iBabs and Company Webcast, and to the commercial effort deployed this year.\n1 Definition in appendix\n2 Press release available on www.euronext.com\nTrading\nIn €m, unless stated otherwise 2017 2016 % change Trading revenue 237.9 220.8 +7.7% Cash trading 190.3 180.7 +5.3% ADV Cash market 7,478 7,012 +6.7% Derivatives trading 40.3 40.1 +0.6% ADV Derivatives market (in lots) 550,106 491,214 +12.0% Number of trading days 255 257 Spot FX trading 7.2 - n/a ADV spot FX Market (in USDm)\n18,420 12,732 +44.7% Number of trading days 258 259 Cash trading\nAverage daily volume for cash trading increased by +6.7% to €7.5 billion compared to 2016, benefiting from i/a better trading environment, despite very low volatility, with an improved macro environment in Europe at the end of the year, ii/reduced political uncertainty across Europe and iii/ improved corporate earnings across the Eurozone. In this environment of rising volume, revenue increased by +5.3% in 2017, to a total of €190.3 million. Yield remained stable over the year averaging 0.50 bps, at a comparable level to 2016.\nEuronext continuously strengthened its cash trading market share throughout the year, averaging 64.4% in 2017 and reaching 67.1% in Q4 2017. This significant increase of +3.5 points compared to 2016 reflects the successful onboarding of additional participants to the new non-member proprietary fee scheme Omega, as well as the completed onboarding of all Euronext’s retail brokers to the Best of Book service which attracted additional retail flow to Euronext markets. In addition, the implementation of further optimisation within the SLP programme attracted incremental volumes in 2017.\nThe average daily transaction value of ETFs was €473 million over 2017 and was down (-14.6%) compared to 2016, mainly due to lower volatility. 74 new ETF products were listed over 2017, bringing the total number of ETFs listed on Euronext to 804 at end of 2017.\nDerivatives trading\nDerivatives trading revenue remained almost stable in 2017, at €40.3 million, compared to €40.1 million in 2016. Individual equity derivatives achieved a +24.0% increase on average daily volume to 276,483 contracts, while the average daily volume on equity index derivatives was up +3.5% to 221,922 contracts. As a reminder, TOM, the former competitor of Euronext on the Dutch market, ceased operations in June 2017. Because of this exceptional circumstance, a non-recurring migration of open-interest from TOM to Euronext took place in June at marginal rates and impacted the average yield for 2017.\nCommodity products recorded declining average daily volumes in 2017, down -3.6% to 51,629 contracts. Despite a low-volatility market, the activity saw a recovery from mid-year in an improved competitive landscape, partially offsetting a weak start to the year.\nYield on derivatives averaged 0.29 bps over 2017, a decreased from 0.32 bps in 2016, due to the special Dutch circumstances stated above.\nSpot FX trading\nThe average daily volume on the FastMatch spot foreign exchange market (of which Euronext owns 90% of the capital since August 2017) was $18.4 billion in 2017, up +44.7% compared to 2016. Spot FX trading generated €7.2 million of revenue in 2017, for 4.6 months of consolidation after the acquisition of FastMatch in mid-August 2017.\nMarket data & indices\nMarket data and indices organic performance remained robust, while revenue was down -1.0% to €104.7 million over the year, as a result of higher contractual audit findings in the second and third quarters of 2016. In 2017, Euronext onboarded 34 new data vendors, bringing the total number of vendors to 500, while 65 new clients for non-displayed policies were signed up.\nPost-trade\nClearing\nClearing revenue increased by +6.5%, to €51.1 million in 2017, reflecting stronger derivatives trading activity as well as higher treasury and other clearing income. As a reminder, the new contract for the clearing of financial derivatives products will come into force on 1 January 2019.\nSettlement & Custody\nRevenue from Interbolsa in Portugal increased by +4.7%, to €20.6 million in 2017, driven by an increase of settlement, public debt and equities under custody during the year.\nMarket solutions & other\nRevenue from Market Solutions increased by +1.4% in 2017, to €33.5 million. The business continued to benefit from MiFID II projects and related work for commercial technology clients. 2017 saw the signing of the first commercial agreements for the deployment of Optiq® and the first milestones in delivery projects in the Middle East, North Africa and Brazil.\nCorporate highlights of 2017, since publication of Q3 2017 results on 8 November 2017\nEuronext become minority shareholder of LCH SA\nOn 8 August 2017, Euronext initially announced the signing of the binding term sheet of the renewal of its agreement with LCH SA on the continued provision of derivatives and commodities clearing services for a period of 10 years. On 1 November 2017, Euronext announced the signing of the renewal of this agreement.\nThe new long-term agreement covers the clearing of financial and commodity derivatives for a period of 10 years, providing continuity of clearing services for members, and avoiding the cost and disruption of migration at a time where clients are working on MiFID2 implementation and Brexit planning. Euronext and LCH SA will work together to develop new products for the benefit of clearing members and market participants, and will focus on providing a lower cost service for members.\nOn 29 December, Euronext announced the completion of the swap of its 2.3% stake in LCH Group for an 11.1% stake in LCH SA. LCH SA is a leading multi-asset CCP, based in the Eurozone, with substantial growth opportunities in the fixed income and CDS businesses. This transaction strengthens the long-standing relationship between Euronext and LCH SA, and cement the strategic future of LCH SA.\nFollowing completion of the share swap, Euronext remains on the Board of LCH SA. Euronext has also nominated one representative to LCH SA Audit Committee and continues to be represented at LCH SA Risk Committee. A new Consultative Committee dedicated to Euronext derivatives business has been created.\nThe parties have agreed that Euronext will have certain minority protection rights connected with its new shareholding in LCH SA. Euronext will have a pre-emption right in circumstances where LCH Group decides to sell more than 50% of the shares of LCH SA. The pre-emption right involves a right of first offer and subject to certain conditions, a matching right. In addition, LCH Group has a pre-emption right over a transfer of shares by Euronext and the ability to buy back Euronext's shares in certain circumstances where the derivatives agreement is terminated.\nIn addition the agreement provides a comparable revenue sharing mechanism delivering a continued clearing income stream for Euronext. Euronext recorded at closing on 29 December 2017 a gross capital gain following the share swap of €40.6 million.\nOverall this represents a long term, sustainable continuity of clearing services for Euronext and its clients.\nExpanding Euronext’s federal model and creation of a leading global player in debt and fund listings– Acquisition of the Irish Stock Exchange\nOn 29 November 2017, Euronext announced the acquisition of 100% of the shares and voting rights of the Irish Stock Exchange (“ISE”), Ireland’s incumbent stock exchange operator and a leading global debt and fund listing venue, for €137m 1 .\nThis transaction is subject to regulatory approval and closing is expected in March 2018.\nHeadquartered in Dublin, ISE is Ireland’s incumbent stock exchange operator and a global leader in the listing of debt and funds securities. ISE is the first pool of liquidity for Irish equities (51 listed companies, c. €122 billion total domestic equity market capitalisation ), the first debt listing venue globally (30,000+ securities and listings from 90 countries) and the first fund listing venue globally (5,242 Investment Funds Securities and 227 ETFs).\nISE generated revenue of €29.4m, EBITDA of €9.6m and a net income of €8.0m in 2016. For the first 9 months of 2017, ISE generated €24.2m of revenue, up +13.3% compared to the same period in 2016, and an EBITDA of €8.5m, up +22.4% compared to the same period in 2016.\nThe transaction brings together two highly complementary businesses with significant growth opportunities and expands Euronext’s federal model to a new attractive European country. It creates a leading global player in debt and fund listings, combining the listing expertise of ISE with the traded markets expertise of Euronext.\nEuronext will benefit from ISE’s leading global positions in debt and fund listings as well as its unique product and listing expertise. The acquisition will also enhance Euronext’s growth outlook thanks to ISE’s embedded core businesses’ growth, complemented by the additional strategic growth plans for ISE, which will be reinforced with the full support of Euronext.\nThe acquisition of ISE by Euronext, combined with Ireland’s very competitive economic environment, will further strengthen Ireland’s position as a strong European anchor to take advantage of Brexit opportunities. This transaction will also develop the Irish capital markets ecosystem within a European context and as part of Euronext’s core mission to power the real economy.\nISE is at the centre of Ireland’s highly competitive financial ecosystem. The country provides a recognized finance-friendly environment, with a highly educated workforce, and a business-oriented mind-set, as well as an attractive economy within the Eurozone, with forecast GDP growth of c.3.8% 2017e-18e. Ireland is in a strong position to seize opportunities arising from Brexit since it is both close to the UK business culture and strongly rooted inside the Eurozone.\nDublin will have a strong group-wide position within Euronext’s highly inclusive federal governance structure, notably as the global centre of excellence for all Euronext’s group-wide activities in the listing of debt, funds and ETF securities.\nISE will then benefit from a strong European anchor to support and develop the Irish listed companies’ ecosystem within a European context and as part of Euronext’s core mission to power the real economy.\nEuronext will provide ISE with its traded markets expertise, large customer base, state-of-the-art proprietary technology and widespread distribution channels, as well as a full suite of pre and post listing services to ISE equity issuers.\nThe combination will increase liquidity and efficiency for issuers, members and listing customers through the integration of ISE members to Euronext’s trading platform. ISE’s additional incremental growth opportunities include:\nLeverage the unique complementarity of the Irish market to the UK to deliver Brexit solutions Focus on ETF as an asset class. Combine ISE network, issuer/listing expertise with Euronext pan EU trading platform and innovation capability to deliver pan EU ETF Trading hub Develop an Irish agricultural commodity business by leveraging Euronext’s expertise Provide ISE trading members access to global FX markets through Euronext’s high-efficiency platform FastMatch Combine ISE’s global position in debt listing with Euronext Synapse as a catalyst for future fixed income innovation Increased efficiency thanks to integration of ISE within Euronext\nThe transaction is financially compelling for Euronext’s shareholders with recurring EPS accretion in the first year and return on capital employed above Euronext’s cost of capital within year three.\nThe integration of ISE within Euronext is expected to generate run-rate pre-tax operating cost synergies of €6m per annum, to be fully delivered in 2020, primarily driven by i/ the migration to Optiq®, Euronext’s new state-of-the-art proprietary trading platform, ii/ the aggregation of a Pan-European offering on market data by migrating ISE’s current offering onto Euronext’s platform and iii/ ISE benefiting from using Euronext’s support functions.\nAs part of the integration, total costs of c.€9m will be incurred in the first years of implementation, with full integration expected by 2020.\nThis acquisition is part of Euronext’s strategy to actively leverage its balance sheet, while retaining financial flexibility, to capture value accretive opportunities and accelerate growth and strengthen its revenue profile.\nEuronext is to pay for 100 % of ISE’s shares €137 million of enterprise value on a debt free, cash free basis, and excluding existing regulatory capital requirements (estimated at €21.8m). The transaction will be fully funded by debt.\nDeirdre Somers, CEO of ISE, will join Euronext’s Managing Board with group-wide responsibility for Debt, Funds & ETFs listing and Padraic O’Connor, Chairman (Non-Executive) of ISE will join Euronext’s Supervisory Board, both appointments pending all relevant shareholder and regulatory approvals.\nIn addition, ISE’s regulator, the Central Bank of Ireland, is expected to join Euronext’s College of Regulators.\n1 Enterprise value on a debt-free cash-free basis and excluding existing regulatory capital requirements (estimated at €21.8m)\nCorporate highlights since 31 December 2017\nAcquisition of InsiderLog\nOn 17 January 2018, Euronext announced the acquisition of 80% of the capital of InsiderLog, a Stockholm-based leading player in the field of insider list management, for a cash consideration of €5.8 million.\nInsiderLog automates the management of insider lists in a way that both saves time and ensures compliance with the requirements of the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR). MAR requires every listed company, their advisors and listed bond issuers to create and manage insider lists for all market sensitive projects. InsiderLog supports compliance officers with this responsibility, from the creation of insider lists, to the management of related information collection workflows, including the reporting to regulators in a standardised format. In addition to insider lists as such, InsiderLog also manages the administration of Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibilities (PDMR) and the closed period before each financial report.\nThe acquisition of InsiderLog fits within Euronext’s Agility for Growth strategic plan, announced in May 2016, aiming to create more value for issuers, notably through the development of a complete Corporate Services franchise. This transaction further strengthens Euronext’s value proposition for listed companies by addressing a strong need from issuers. This solution will be integrated into the Euronext Corporate Services offering, alongside existing services such as Euronext’s webcasting platform, investor relationship management tool and innovative board portal solution.\nDeparture of Lee Hodgkinson in early April 2018\nOn 25 January 2018, Euronext, announced that Lee Hodgkinson, Head of Markets and Global Sales of Euronext and CEO of Euronext London Ltd, has decided to pursue a new professional project.\nLee Hodgkinson, after more than 9 years at Euronext, will leave the company in early April 2018 and will serve as CEO of OSTC, a London-based proprietary trading firm which operates from 14 offices around the world. Lee Hodgkinson will actively participate in the transition process during his notice period.\nJanuary 2018 volumes\nOn 5 February 2018, Euronext announced its trading volumes for January 2018.\nCash trading\nIn January 2018, the average daily transaction value on the Euronext cash order book stood at €7,773 million, up +20.4% compared to January 2017 and flat from the previous month.\nThe average daily transaction value on ETFs order book 2 was €286 million, up +16.9% compared to January 2017 and up +5.6% from the previous month.

Based on the previous presentation to be abandoned, activity is €359 million, down -19.7% compared to January 2016 and down -36.7% compared to the previous month.\n2017 main milestones\nIn 2017, Euronext reached major milestones:\nSecuring of clearing environment: In August 2017, signature of a 10-year agreement for the clearing of financial derivatives with LCH SA and acquisition of a 11.1% minority stake (non-cash) (see above).

The acquisitions of FastMatch and of the Irish Stock Exchange 1 in 2017, not included in the initial targets, have led the management to allocate resources to highly value creating projects. As a result of these and of the delays related to the on-boarding of clients due to other focus of the industry, the management has also decided to refocus the Agility for Growth initiatives to the most promising projects among those announced in May 2016:\nthe Chequers collateral management is cancelled, following client feedbacks, while the inventory management platform is continued, the specialist content provider on agricultural commodities is postponed, following the lack of acquisition opportunities that matches Euronext criteria, the MTF for ETF opportunity is delayed to H2 2018.\nAs a result, the 2019 incremental revenue contribution of Agility for Growth initiatives is refined to €55m (vs. €70m in May 2016), while core business revenue 2019 targets are unchanged and 2019 revenue will also benefit from the full-year contribution of FastMatch and of the Irish Stock Exchange 1 .\nGiven the recent developments and the current outlook information on risks and opportunities Euronext has, the table below sums up the main 2019 targets:\n2019 targets Core business revenue Excluding Clearing, FastMatch, ISE (after closing)\n+2.0% CAGR 15-19 (unchanged)\nCore business costs savings €22m costs gross savings between 1 April 2016 and 2019 (unchanged)\nCore business costs reduction expected to start in H2 2018, after the delivery of IT projects\nEBITDA margin 61 to 63% of EBITDA margin excluding clearing (unchanged), FastMatch and Irish Stock Exchange Agility for Growth initiatives +€55m revenue between 2015 and 2019 (vs. €70m in May 2016)\nAt 50% EBITDA margin (unchanged)\nAcquisition criteria ROCE>WACC in year 3 (unchanged) Dividend policy 50% of reported net income, with a floor at €1.42 per share (unchanged) 1 The closing of the Irish Stock Exchange acquisition is expected for March 2018\nAgenda\nA conference call and a webcast will be held today at 8.30am CET (Paris time):\nWebsite : www.euronext.com/en/investors\nTo connect to the conference call, please dial:\nUK Toll Number: +44 3333000804 / UK Toll-Free Number: 08003589473 FR Toll Number: +33 170750711 / FR Toll-Free Number: 0800946608 NL Toll Number: +31 207095189 / NL Toll-Free Number: 08004050000 BE Toll Number: +32 24035814 / BE Toll-Free Number: 080049532 US Toll Number: +1 6319131422 / US Toll-Free Number: +1 855 85 70686 PT Toll Number: +351 210609105 / PT Toll-Free Number: 800209235\nPIN CODE: 02811600#\nLive Webcast:\nA live audio webcast and replay after the call will be available via this link and on Euronext Investor Relations website.\nFinancial calendar\nQ1 2018 results: Tuesday 15 May 2018 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders: Tuesday 15 May 2018 Q2 2018 results: Friday 3 August 2018 Q3 2018 results: Monday 12 November 2018\nAbout Euronext\nEuronext is the leading pan-European exchange in the Eurozone with nearly 1,300 listed issuers worth close to €3.6 trillion in market capitalisation as of end December 2017, an unmatched blue chip franchise consisting of 24 issuers in the Morningstar® Eurozone 50 Index℠ and a strong diverse domestic and international client base.
