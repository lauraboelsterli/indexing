Phillips said, \"2017 was a remarkable year, marked by robust contract awards, solid organic revenue growth, increased profits, strong cash flow and prudent capital deployment. ManTech's continued success in 2017 was driven by our talented employees' steadfast focus on our customers' important national and homeland security missions.

Revenues for the year were $1.72 billion, up 7% compared to 2016. Revenue growth was driven by a combination of organic expansion from recent contract awards and acquisitions.\nOperating income was $25.7 million for the quarter, up 21% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fiscal year, operating income was $98.2 million, up 8% compared to 2016. Operating margin was up compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and remained consistent year over year.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income was $68.4 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.73 for the quarter. For the year, net income was $114.1 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.91.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a reduction to its income tax expense of approximately $51 million from the re-measurement of our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Adjusted net income, which excludes the re-measurement caused by the Tax Act, was $17.8 million for the quarter, up 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and was $63.5 million for the full year, up 13% compared to 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.45 for the quarter, up 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and was $1.62 for the full year, up 10% compared to 2016.\nCash Management and Capital Deployment\nThree months ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, (In Millions Except Per Share Amounts)\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income $68.4 $13.7 $114.1 $56.4 Cash Flow from Operations $37.7 $12.6 $153.0 $95.8 Operating Cash Flow Multiple of Net Income 0.6x 0.9x 1.3x 1.7x Capital Expenditures $28.0 $3.4 $38.9 $10.4 Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) 61 73 Cash and Cash Equivalents, End of Period $9.5 $64.9 Current and Long Term Debt, End of Period $31.0 $— Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $38 million. For the year, cash flow from operations totaled $153 million. Days sales outstanding (DSO) were 61 days, an improvement of 12 days compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDuring the quarter, the Company paid $8.2 million, or $0.21 per share, as part of its regular cash dividend program to its common stockholders of record as of December 8, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $9.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $31 million of outstanding borrowings on its $500 million revolving-credit facility, which provides the Company with ample financial capacity to pursue acquisitions and issue dividends while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nThe Company has increased the amount of its quarterly cash dividend from $0.21 to $0.25 per share. The Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 to be paid on March 23, 2018 to all common stockholders of record as of March 9, 2018, as part of its regular quarterly cash dividend program. Based on the average of recent trading prices the new annual yield is approximately 1.9%. Future declarations of dividends and their record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of ManTech's Board of Directors.\nContract Awards\nContract awards (bookings) totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion for the year, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 2.4 in both periods. In 2017, approximately 50% of the awards were for new business. Book-to-bill ratios for both the quarter and the fiscal year reflect an improving awards environment and strong market positioning for ManTech. Proposal activity remains robust and the Company expects contract awards to continue at a healthy pace in 2018. Large, single award contracts contributing to the quarterly bookings include:\nVehicle Engineering Maintenance and Operations Support (VEMOS) for the Army. ManTech was awarded a 5-year contract totaling $847 million to provide a wide range of sustainment support services, which includes operational engineering and logistics support globally for approximately 25,000 vehicles including the Army's Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles or MRAPs.\nIntelligence Analysis Support for the Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM). ManTech was awarded a 5-year contract totaling $133 million to provide intelligence analysis services in support of counterintelligence and counterterrorism missions.\nAdditional contract awards in the quarter include several extensions to existing contracts and new contracts from various customers.\nForward Guidance\nThe Company expects to achieve revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share in 2018 as specified in the table below.\nMeasure Fiscal 2018 Guidance Revenue (billion) $1.88B - $1.95B Net Income (million) $78.6M - $82.3M Diluted Earnings per Share $1.96 - $2.05 The guidance is supported by a backlog of business at the end of the fiscal year of $7.1 billion, including $1.4 billion of funded backlog, as well as a strong pipeline of new opportunities and improving government funding levels.\nManTech Chief Financial Officer Judith L. Bjornaas said, “I am pleased to end the fiscal year with strong operating performance, record bookings, organic growth and strong cash flow. We feel confident forecasting robust growth for fiscal year 2018 based on the momentum of our current programs and recent bookings. In 2018, we will continue to focus our capital deployment on acquisitions to support long-term business growth and we are increasing our current cash dividend to provide a steady return to our shareholders.”\nConference Call\nManTech executive management will hold a conference call on February 21, 2018, at 5 p.m. Eastern to discuss the financial results and outlook and answer questions.

Words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” or “estimate,” or the negative of these terms or words of similar import, are intended to identify .\nThese are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes we anticipate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results we anticipate include, but are not limited to, the following: failure to maintain our relationship with the U.S. government, or failure to compete effectively for new contract awards or to retain existing U.S. government contracts; inability to recruit and retain sufficient number of employees with specialized skill sets or necessary security clearances who are in great demand and limited supply; adverse changes in U.S. government spending for programs we support, whether due to changing mission priorities, socio-economic policies that reduce the contracts that we may bid on, cost reduction and efficiency initiatives by our customers, or other federal budget constraints generally; issues relating to competing effectively for awards procured through the competitive bidding process, including the adverse impact of delay caused by competitors’ protests of contracts awards received by us; failure to obtain option awards, task orders or funding under contracts; failure to realize the full amount of our backlog or adverse changes in the timing of receipt of revenues under contracts included in backlog; renegotiation, modification or termination of our contracts, or failure to perform in conformity with contract terms or our expectations; disruption of our business or damage to our reputation resulting from security breaches in customer systems, internal systems or services failures (including as a result of cyber or other security threats), or employee or subcontractor misconduct; failure to successfully integrate acquired companies or businesses into our operations or to realize any accretive or synergistic effects from such acquisitions; increased exposure to risks associated with conducting business internationally; adverse changes in business conditions that may cause our investments in recorded goodwill to become impaired; non-compliance with, or adverse changes in, complex U.S. government laws, procurement regulations or processes; and adverse results of U.S. government audits or other investigations of our government contracts.
