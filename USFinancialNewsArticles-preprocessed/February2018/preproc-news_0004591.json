Highlights include strong postpaid phone gains, record-low fourth-quarter postpaid phone churn and DIRECTV NOW surpassing 1 million subscribers.\n“The impact of tax reform and regulatory rationalization will be substantial and positive for the U.S. economy and AT&T,” said Randall Stephenson, AT&T Chairman and CEO. “Our FirstNet win and the opt-in by 100 percent of all states and territories will enable us to put the industry’s most robust spectrum assets to work in building a best-in-class nationwide network for public safety and first responders. On the Time Warner front, we look forward to presenting our case in court and closing the deal.”\nConsolidated Financial Results\nAT&T’s consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter totaled $41.7 billion versus$41.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to declines in legacy wireline services, wireless service revenues and domestic video, which were mostly offset by growth in wireless equipment and International. Compared with results for the fourth quarter of 2016, operating expenses were $41.3 billion versus $37.6 billion primarily due to a write-off of certain network assets and higher wireless equipment costs; operating income was $0.4 billion versus $4.2 billion; and operating income margin was 0.9% versus 10.2%. When adjusting for the write-off of certain network assets, non-cash actuarial loss on benefit plans, amortization, merger- and integration-related expenses and other items, operating income was $6.9 billion versus $7.3 billion in the year-ago quarter and operating income margin was 16.5%, versus 17.5% in the year-ago quarter.\nFourth-quarter net income attributable to AT&T was $19.0 billion, or $3.08 per diluted share, and reflects the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, compared to $2.4 billion, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for the ($3.16) benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities, $0.41 write-off of certain network assets and natural disaster impacts, $0.19 non-cash actuarial loss on benefit plans from the annual remeasurement process and $0.26 of costs for amortization, merger- and integration-related expenses and other items, earnings per diluted share was $0.78 compared to an adjusted $0.66 in the year-ago quarter. (The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share includes $0.13 impact of the new tax law on the fourth-quarter 2017.)\nCash from operating activities was $9.9 billion in the fourth quarter, and capital expenditures were $5.1 billion. Free cash flow — cash from operating activities minus capital expenditures — was $4.8 billion for the quarter.\nFull-Year Results\nFor full-year 2017, compared with 2016 results, AT&T’s consolidated revenues totaled $160.5 billion versus $163.8 billion, primarily due to declines in legacy wireline services and wireless service revenues, which were partially offset by growth in International and strategic business services. Operating expenses were $139.6 billion compared with$139.4 billion. Excluding a $2.9 billion write-off of certain network assets, operating expenses decreased due to cost efficiencies. Operating income was $20.9 billion versus $24.3 billion; and operating income margin was 13.0% versus 14.9%. Net income attributable to AT&T reflects the impact of the new tax law and was $29.5 billion versus $13.0 billion; and earnings per diluted share was $4.76, compared with $2.10. With adjustments for both years, operating income was $31.8 billion versus $31.8 billion; operating income margin was 19.8% versus 19.4%; and earnings per diluted share totaled $3.05, compared with $2.84, an increase of 7.4%. (The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share includes $0.13 impact of the new tax law on the fourth-quarter 2017.)\nAT&T’s full-year cash from operating activities was $39.2 billion versus $39.3 billion in 2016. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled $21.6 billion versus $22.4 billion in 2016. Full-year free cash flow was $17.6 billion compared to $16.9 billion in 2016. The company’s free cash flow dividend payout ratio for the full year was 68%. 2\n2018 Outlook 1\nOn a standalone basis, including impacts of tax reform and the new ASC 606 revenue recognition standard, AT&T expects in 2018:\nAdjusted EPS in the $3.50 range Free cash flow of about $21 billion Capital expenditures approaching $25 billion; $23 billion net of expected FirstNet reimbursements and inclusive of $1 billion incremental tax reform investment\n1 Adjustments include a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss, merger-related interest expense, merger integration and amortization costs and other adjustments. We expect the mark-to-market adjustment which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be the largest of these items. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between forecasted adjusted diluted EPS and reported diluted EPS without unreasonable effort.\n2 Free cash flow dividend payout ratio is dividends divided by free cash flow\n*About AT&T\nAT&T Inc. ( NYSE:T ) is a holding company. AT&T products and services are provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&T Inc. under the AT&T brand and not by AT&T Inc.

A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update and revise statements contained in this news release based on new information or otherwise.\nThis news release may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available on the company’s website at https://investors.att.com .\nDiscussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nWe believe the following measures are relevant and useful information to investors as they are part of AT&T’s internal management reporting and planning processes and are important metrics that management uses to evaluate the operating performance of AT&T and its segments. Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing performance with that of many of our competitors.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is defined as cash from operations minus Capital expenditures. Free cash flow after dividends is defined as cash from operations minus Capital expenditures and dividends. Free cash flow dividend payout ratio is defined as the percentage of dividends paid to free cash flow. We believe these metrics provide useful information to our investors because management views free cash flow as an important indicator of how much cash is generated by routine business operations, including Capital expenditures, and makes decisions based on it. Management also views free cash flow as a measure of cash available to pay debt and return cash to shareowners.\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Dividend Payout Ratio Dollars in millions Three Months Ended Twelve 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,877 $ 10,142 $ 39,151 $ 39,344 Less: Capital expenditures (5,076 ) (6,456 ) (21,550 ) (22,408 ) Free Cash Flow 4,801 3,686 17,601 16,936 Less: Dividends paid (3,008 ) (2,947 ) (12,038 ) (11,797 ) Free Cash Flow after Dividends $ 1,793 $ 739 $ 5,563 $ 5,139 Free Cash Flow Dividend Payout Ratio 62.7 % 80.0 % 68.4 % 69.7 % EBITDA\nOur calculation of EBITDA, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For AT&T, EBITDA excludes other income (expense) – net, and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates, as these do not reflect the operating results of our subscriber base or operations that are not under our control. Equity in net income (loss) of affiliates represents the proportionate share of the net income (loss) of affiliates in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control. Because we do not control these entities, management excludes these results when evaluating the performance of our primary operations. EBITDA also excludes interest expense and the provision for income taxes. Excluding these items eliminates the expenses associated with our capital and tax structures. Finally, EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments. EBITDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA is not presented as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations, as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nEBITDA service margin is calculated as EBITDA divided by service revenues.\nWhen discussing our segment results, EBITDA excludes equity in net income (loss) of affiliates, and depreciation and amortization from segment contribution. For our supplemental presentation of our combined domestic wireless operations (AT&T Mobility) and our supplemental presentation of the Mexico Wireless and Latin America operations of our International segment, EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization from operating income.\nThese measures are used by management as a gauge of our success in acquiring, retaining and servicing subscribers because we believe these measures reflect AT&T’s ability to generate and grow subscriber revenues while providing a high level of customer service in a cost-effective manner. Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing segment performance with that of many of its competitors. The financial and operating metrics which affect EBITDA include the key revenue and expense drivers for which segment managers are responsible and upon which we evaluate their performance. Management uses Mexico Wireless EBITDA in evaluating profitability trends after our two Mexico wireless acquisitions in 2015, and our investments in building a nationwide LTE network by end of 2018. Management uses Latin America EBITDA in evaluating the ability of our Latin America operations to generate cash to finance its own operations.\nWe believe EBITDA Service Margin (EBITDA as a percentage of service revenues) to be a more relevant measure than EBITDA Margin (EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue) for our Consumer Mobility segment operating margin and our supplemental AT&T Mobility operating margin. We also use wireless service revenues to calculate margin to facilitate comparison, both internally and externally with our wireless competitors, as they calculate their margins using wireless service revenues as well.\nThere are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and EBITDA service margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, these performance measures do not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, tax expense and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates. Management compensates for these limitations by carefully analyzing how its competitors present performance measures that are similar in nature to EBITDA as we present it, and considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with its analysis of net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and EBITDA service margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA, EBITDA Margin and EBITDA Service Margin Dollars in millions Three Months Ended Twelve 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income $ 19,136 $ 2,515 $ 29,847 $ 13,333 Additions: Income Tax (Benefit) Expense (20,419 ) 676 (14,708 ) 6,479 Interest Expense 1,926 1,221 6,300 4,910 Equity in Net (Income) Loss of Affiliates (20 ) (41 ) 128 (98 ) Other (Income) Expense - Net (264 ) (123 ) (618 ) (277 ) Depreciation and amortization 6,071 6,129 24,387 25,847 EBITDA 6,430 10,377 45,336 50,194 Total Operating Revenues 41,676 41,841 160,546 163,786 Service Revenues 36,225 37,369 145,597 148,884 EBITDA Margin 15.4 % 24.8 % 28.2 % 30.6 % EBITDA Service Margin 17.8 % 27.8 % 31.1 % 33.7 % Segment EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and EBITDA Service Margin Dollars in millions Three Months Ended Twelve 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Business Solutions Segment Segment Contribution $ 3,828 $ 4,023 $ 17,150 $ 16,826 Additions: Equity in Net (Income) Loss of Affiliates 1 - 1 - Depreciation and amortization 2,354 2,264 9,326 9,832 EBITDA 6,183 6,287 26,477 26,658 Total Segment Operating Revenues 18,390 18,033 69,406 70,988 Segment Operating Income Margin 20.8 % 22.3 % 24.7 % 23.7 % EBITDA Margin 33.6 % 34.9 % 38.1 % 37.6 % Entertainment Group Segment Segment Contribution $ 1,063 $ 1,370 $ 5,625 $ 6,104 Additions: Equity in Net (Income) Loss of Affiliates 7 (8 ) 30 (9 ) Depreciation and amortization 1,367 1,381 5,623 5,862 EBITDA 2,437 2,743 11,278 11,957 Total Segment Operating Revenues 12,745 13,206 50,698 51,295 Segment Operating Income Margin 8.4 % 10.3 % 11.2 % 11.9 % EBITDA Margin 19.1 % 20.8 % 22.2 % 23.3 % Consumer Mobility Segment Segment Contribution $ 2,020 $ 2,185 $ 9,079 $ 9,825 Additions: Depreciation and amortization 886 918 3,507 3,716 EBITDA 2,906 3,103 12,586 13,541 Total Segment Operating Revenues 8,273 8,419 31,552 33,200 Service Revenues 6,409 6,731 26,053 27,536 Segment Operating Income Margin 24.4 % 26.0 % 28.8 % 29.6 % EBITDA Margin 35.1 % 36.9 % 39.9 % 40.8 % EBITDA Service Margin 45.3 % 46.1 % 48.3 % 49.2 % International Segment Segment Contribution $ (9 ) $ (240 ) $ (266 ) $ (661 ) Additions: Equity in Net (Income) of Affiliates (25 ) (28 ) (87 ) (52 ) Depreciation and amortization 313 298 1,218 1,166 EBITDA 279 30 865 453 Total Segment Operating Revenues 2,215 1,909 8,269 7,283 Segment Operating Income Margin -1.5 % -14.0 % -4.3 % -9.8 % EBITDA Margin 12.6 % 1.6 % 10.5 % 6.2 % Supplemental AT&T Mobility EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and EBITDA Service Margin Dollars in millions Three Months Ended Twelve 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 AT&T Mobility Operating Income $ 4,253 $ 4,638 $ 20,067 $ 20,643 Add: Depreciation and amortization 2,028 2,048 8,027 8,292 EBITDA 6,281 6,686 28,094 28,935 Total Operating Revenues 19,228 18,750 71,349 72,821 Service Revenues 14,342 14,713 57,955 59,386 Operating Income Margin 22.1 % 24.7 % 28.1 % 28.3 % EBITDA Margin 32.7 % 35.7 % 39.4 % 39.7 % EBITDA Service Margin 43.8 % 45.4 % 48.5 % 48.7 % Supplemental Latin America EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Dollars in millions Three Months Ended Twelve 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 International - Latin America Operating Income $ 135 $ 49 $ 435 $ 228 Add: Depreciation and amortization 207 215 849 835 EBITDA 342 264 1,284 1,063 Total Operating Revenues 1,391 1,261 5,456 4,910 Operating Income Margin 9.7 % 3.9 % 8.0 % 4.6 % EBITDA Margin 24.6 % 20.9 % 23.5 % 21.6 % Supplemental Mexico EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Dollars in millions Three Months Ended Twelve 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 International - Mexico Operating Income (Loss) $ (169 ) $ (317 ) $ (788 ) $ (941 ) Add: Depreciation and amortization 106 83 369 331 EBITDA (63 ) (234 ) (419 ) (610 ) Total Operating Revenues 824 648 2,813 2,373 Operating Income Margin -20.5 % -48.9 % -28.0 % -39.7 % EBITDA Margin -7.6 % -36.1 % -14.9 % -25.7 % Adjusting Items\nAdjusting items include revenues and costs we consider nonoperational in nature, such as items arising from asset acquisitions or dispositions. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often significant impact on our fourth-quarter results, unless earlier remeasurement is required (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.) Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income.\nThe tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude can drive a change in the effective tax rate, reflect the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 38% for transactions prior to tax reform and 25% for transactions after tax reform. Certain foreign operations with losses, where such losses are not realizable for tax purposes, are not tax effected, resulting in no tax impact for Venezuelan devaluation. For years prior to 2017, adjustments related to Mexico operations were taxed at the 30% marginal rate for Mexico.\nAdjusting Items Dollars in millions Three Months Ended Twelve 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating Revenues Natural disaster revenue credits $ 154 $ 10 $ 243 $ 23 Adjustments to Operating Revenues 154 10 243 23 Operating Expenses DIRECTV and other video merger integration costs 95 259 412 754 Mexico merger integration costs 19 78 172 309 Time Warner and other merger costs 63 47 214 47 Wireless merger integration costs - 1 - 93 Actuarial (gain) loss 1,517 1,024 1,258 1,024 Asset abandonments and impairments 2,914 361 2,914 361 Employee separation costs 177 30 445 344 Tax reform special bonus 220 - 220 - Natural disaster costs 265 27 384 44 (Gain) loss on transfer of wireless spectrum - - (181 ) (714 ) Venezuela devaluation - - 98 - Adjustments to Operations and Support Expenses 5,270 1,827 5,936 2,262 Amortization of intangible assets 1,100 1,228 4,608 5,177 Impairments 33 29 33 29 Adjustments to Operating Expenses 6,403 3,084 10,577 7,468 Other Merger-related interest and fees 1 432 - 1,104 16 Debt exchange costs, (gain) loss on sale of assets, impairments and other adjustments\n161 28 382 32 Adjustments to Income Before Income Taxes 7,150 3,122 12,306 7,539 Tax impact of adjustments 1,908 1,097 3,625 2,618 Tax reform 19,455 - 19,455 - Tax-related items - 359 (146 ) 359 Adjustments to Net Income $ (14,213 ) $ 1,666 $ (10,628 ) $ 4,562 1 Includes interest expense incurred on debt issued and interest income earned on cash held prior to the close of merger transactions, and fees to exchange DIRECTV notes.\nAdjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA service margin and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses and income tax expense certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs. Management believes that these measures provide relevant and useful information to investors and other users of our financial data in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends.\nAdjusted Operating Revenues, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA service margin and Adjusted diluted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
