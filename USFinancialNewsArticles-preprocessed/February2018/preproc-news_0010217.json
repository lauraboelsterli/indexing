    "text": "NAIROBI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Two Kenyan television channels shut down by the government over their coverage of the opposition resumed partial broadcasting on Monday although a third channel remained off the air.\nNTV resumed broadcasting on pay-to-view channels, it announced on its Twitter feed, and KTN News resumed on free-to-air terrestrial channels. Citizen television, which was also shut down last week, remained off-air.\nThe three had been shut down after trying to live stream an event held by opposition leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday, where he symbolically inaugurated himself as president.
