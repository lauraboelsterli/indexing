    "text": "February 11, 2018 / 8:15 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago Venezuela army clashes with illegal miners, 18 reported dead Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nGUASIPATI, Venezuela (Reuters) - Soldiers clashed with illegal miners in southern Venezuela on the weekend, killing 18 people in a region notorious for violence and gang rivalries, local media said. \nBolivar state Governor Justo Noguera confirmed a military unit had fought off an attack. “I can’t give numbers because an investigation is under way,” he told reporters. \nLocal newspaper Correo del Caroni reported that 17 men and one woman died in the incident on Saturday morning. \nClashes over illegal mines are common in the remote, mineral-rich area near the border of Guyana, with at least 17 people killed in a gang feud there in 2016. \nThat year, President Nicolas Maduro declared the area a strategic priority, naming it the Mining Arc and declaring war on the hundreds of illegal miners from Venezuela and neighbouring Brazil who try to make a living there. \nLocal media said the army captured guns and explosives during Saturday’s operation.
