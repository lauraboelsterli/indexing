We expect the day-to-day operations of the BancAlliance network to continue without interruption, and look forward to growing the lending services and opportunities available to BancAlliance members in partnership with Congressional.”\nArent Fox LLP and Squire Patton Boggs have served as legal counsel for Congressional.\nMorgan Lewis has served as legal counsel for Alliance Partners and Sandler O ’Neill + Partners, L.P. served as financial advisor.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180202005252/en/\nCongressional Bank\nAnne Balcer, 240-380-1215\nSource: Congressional Bank",
