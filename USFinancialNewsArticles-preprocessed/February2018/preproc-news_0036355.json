    "text": "Viktor Arvidsson scored two goals Monday night as the Nashville Predators moved into a tie for first in the Central Division with a 5-2 win over the Ottawa Senators at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn.\nDefensemen Roman Josi and Ryan Ellis added power-play markers for Nashville, which tied the Jets with 79 points but has a game in hand. Craig Smith also scored for the Predators, and Nashville goalie Pekka Rinne made 36 saves to earn his 30th win of the season.\nJean-Gabriel Pageau and Max McCormick scored goals for Ottawa, which lost its fourth straight road game. Goalie Craig Anderson saved 36 shots in the losing cause.\nJosi initiated the scoring at 9:28 of the first period with the Predators’ second power-play tally in 24 chances, dating back over the past eight games. Moments after former Senator Kyle Turris rang the post with a slapper, Josi ripped a one-timer from above the right circle past Anderson’s glove.\nArvidsson made it 2-0 at 14:32 of the first, finishing off a rush by Nashville’s top line. Filip Forsberg broke into the zone and fed Ryan Johansen, who slipped the puck to Arvidsson near the left post. Arvidsson flicked it into a half-open net.\nPageau got Ottawa on the board with his eighth goal off a rebound at 16:03 of the opening period, only 22 seconds after Nashville’s Colton Sissons went off for interference. Rinne made the initial stop on Mark Stone’s one-timer, but Pageau pounced on the loose puck and lofted it over Rinne.\nEllis restored a two-goal lead for the Predators at 6:34 of the second period with the man advantage. Josi teed up Ellis at the left point, and Ellis rifled a one-timer past Anderson’s blocker for his fourth goal.\nMcCormick notched his second goal, both against Nashville, at 8:05 of the second period. He skated to the top of the left circle after taking a pass from Fredrik Claesson and wired a wrister off the post and into the net.\nArvidsson made it 4-2 at 10:00 of the second thanks to Forsberg, who knocked down Erik Karlsson’s breakout pass and then slid the puck through his legs to Arvidsson. The right winger then slotted a wrister past Anderson’s blocker.\nSmith added insurance for the Predators with his 18th goal at 8:15 of the third period.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
