    "text": "DUARTE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- City of Hope, a world-renowned independent research and treatment center for cancer and diabetes, has announced the appointments of two leaders that will propel the organization forward. Jennifer Parkhurst joins the organization as its chief financial officer and Mark Hulse as its chief digital officer. Both are members of City of Hope’s Enterprise Leadership Team and report directly to the institution’s President and Chief Executive Officer Robert W. Stone .\nIn her new role as City of Hope’s chief financial officer, Parkhurst is leading City of Hope’s financial functions and providing strategic guidance to the entire organization.\nMost recently, Parkhurst served as a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in San Francisco, where she was a leader in the pharma and life sciences operations consulting and strategy practice. She also worked with some of the firm’s largest pharmaceutical clients since 2011.\nParkhurst has more than 25 years of experience advising leading life sciences clients of all stages of commercialization and growth, including companies that are implementing new strategies and transforming their operations. Before joining PwC, Parkhurst was a partner at PRTM Management Consultants in Mountain View, California, and held several management roles at Eli Lilly.\nParkhurst received a bachelor of science in industrial engineering and management sciences from Northwestern University and a master’s degree in business administration in marketing and finance from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n“Jennifer’s knowledge of the health care environment, her keen analytic and strategic skills and her understanding of how to partner research with academic centers are particularly impressive,” Stone said. “She has the right leadership skills to fit well within our service-oriented culture at City of Hope, and is a great addition to our team and a strong partner as we move forward.”\nMark Hulse has joined City of Hope as its first chief digital officer. He is responsible for fostering a digital transformation culture at the institution and expanding its information infrastructure. He oversees a broad range of digital initiatives to support clinical, research, operations and administrative areas, and also leads information technology, informatics and business intelligence departments.\nMost recently, Hulse served as chief executive officer of Theo Executive Group, a health care leadership advisory firm. As senior vice president and chief administrative officer for the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, Hulse led technology and administrative departments for Moffitt and its wholly-owned subsidiary created to advance personalized medicine, M2Gen. Hulse has also served in leadership and clinical roles at Partners Healthcare System Inc. in Boston and Stanford University Medical Center.\nIn 2012, Hulse was recognized by InformationWeek magazine as one of the top 25 chief information officers in health care. Hulse began his health care career as a nurse and has a combined bachelor of science/master of science degree in nursing from Northeastern University.\n“Mark is a gifted leader and collaborator who measures success first and foremost by what the organization accomplishes in service to its mission,” said Stone. “He is a seasoned health care leader with extensive experience in operations and information technology with a strong focus on developing collaborative leadership teams.”\nAbout City of Hope\nCity of Hope is an independent research and treatment center for cancer, diabetes and other life-threatening diseases.
