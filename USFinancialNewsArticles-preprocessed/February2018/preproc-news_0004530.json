    "text": "IRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Power Equipment Group Inc. (OTC: GLPW) (“Global Power” or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. The delay in reporting the Company’s financial results for the first nine months of 2017 was due to the time it took to prepare and audit the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included the restatement of certain prior period financial results and was filed on March 15, 2017 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was filed on September 12, 2017, and to prepare and review the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2017 which were filed on December 19, 2017.\nAs previously reported, during the third quarter of 2017, the Company sold substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of its Mechanical Solutions segment, as well as its manufacturing facility and remaining production equipment in Mexico. These sales were completed in October 2017. Accordingly, this segment has been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.\nCraig Holmes and Tracy Pagliara, Co-Presidents and Co-CEOs of Global Power, commented, “Our Services segment continues to be our best performing business unit. The future is starting to look more promising as we are active on the Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4 nuclear expansion project, and are pursuing additional opportunities that capitalize on our service capabilities while diversifying our revenue.”\nThey added, “In addition, our strategic initiatives continue with a sense of urgency, including the review of strategic alternatives for the Electrical Solutions segment. While the Koontz-Wagner Houston operation experienced a challenging 2017, we believe 2018 is positioned to be a better year overall.”\nConsolidated Results for the Three Months ended September 30, 2017 (compared with the corresponding period in 2016 unless noted otherwise)\nRevenue from continuing operations was $50.6 million compared with $66.0 million, a $15.4 million decline. As discussed below, Services’ revenue declined $8.3 million and Electrical Solutions’ declined $7.1 million. Cost reductions and expense management helped to drive a $0.8 million net decline in operating expenses. These cost reductions resulted in $2.1 million of improvements, or 14.9%, which were partially offset by $1.3 million of incremental severance expense. Interest expense increased $1.9 million, resulting from a weighted average interest rate of 20.3% compared with 9.2% for the 2016 quarter. Loss from continuing operations was $18.4 million, or $(1.04) per share. Net loss was $17.0 million, or $(0.96) per share. At the end of the period, backlog was $173.2 million, of which $118.3 million, or 68.3%, was related to the Services segment.\nBusiness Segment Review for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 (compared with the corresponding period in 2016 unless noted otherwise)\nServices segment:\nServices revenue of $39.0 million was down $8.3 million due primarily to the divestiture of Hetsco, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary (“Hetsco”), in January 2017, which accounted for $6.3 million of the decline. Also, timing of the completion of several fixed-price nuclear projects resulted in a $2.7 million decrease in revenue. Gross profit of $4.8 million declined $1.9 million, essentially all of which was due to the Hetsco divestiture. Gross margin was 12.2% compared with 14.1% for the 2016 quarter. The 2017 period includes $5.1 million of zero margin revenue associated with estimated loss contracts which decreased the gross margin by 180 basis points. Services operating income was $1.4 million, a $0.2 million decrease. Substantially offsetting the lower gross profit was a $1.1 million decrease in operating expenses due to the Hetsco divestiture and a\n$0.7 million decrease in operating expenses resulting from a reorganization within the Services segment.\nElectrical Solutions segment:\nRevenue for the segment was down $7.1 million to $11.6 million, mostly resulting from the closure of the Company’s Chattanooga facility, which led to the loss of a major customer. Gross profit declined $8.5 million to a $5.9 million loss. In addition to the impact of lower revenue, the segment recorded $7.4 million for estimated losses on certain contracts in the third quarter of 2017, of which $7.2 million was attributed to our Houston, Texas facility, compared with $1.0 million for similar losses in the comparable 2016 quarter. Electrical Solutions operating loss increased $8.8 million to $8.6 million due primarily to the decrease in gross profit.\nConsolidated Results for the Nine Months ended September 30, 2017 (compared with the corresponding period in 2016 unless noted otherwise)\nRevenue from continuing operations was $173.9 million compared with $230.4 million, a $56.5 million decline. Gross profit from continuing operations decreased $30.3 million to a loss of $4.0 million. Operating loss from continuing operations was $41.8 million, a $13.1 million decline; however, operating expenses of $37.8 million declined $17.2 million, or 31.3%. Interest expense increased $1.2 million, resulting from a weighted average interest rate of 18.7% compared with 10.5% in the 2016 corresponding period. Loss from continuing operations was $48.2 million, or $(2.74) per share. Net loss was $48.7 million, or $(2.77) per share.\nLiquidity Update\nAs of January 26, 2018, the Company had $17.1 million in cash and equivalents on-hand, including $11.6 million in restricted cash, and had an outstanding gross debt balance of approximately $25.4 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company consumed $19.0 million of cash in operations, including discontinued operations. Since June 2017, the Company’s liquidity has remained very constrained as a result of continued losses, inconsistent cash flows from operations and the inability to borrow additional amounts for short-term working capital needs or issue additional standby letters of credit.\nManagement continues to assess and implement steps in its liquidity plan and is working with lenders to establish a new asset-based revolving line of credit. The additional lending facility, if obtained, will be used to release cash currently restricted as collateral for letters of credit which will be used to reduce long-term debt and provide additional liquidity for operations.\nUpdate on Financial Reporting for 2017\nThe Company expects to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 by the April 2, 2018 filing deadline.\nWebcast and Teleconference\nThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, February 1, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (9:00 a.m. Central). A webcast of the call and an accompanying slide presentation will be available at www.globalpower.com .

It also decreased as a result of completing several non-recurring fixed-price nuclear projects and performing services on a one-time non-nuclear industrial project. These declines were partially offset by additional volume related to a nuclear coatings contract for construction activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\nGLOBAL POWER EQUIPMENT GROUP INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE (UNAUDITED)\nThis press release contains financial measures not derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

Adjusted EBITDA is the sum of our net loss before interest expense, net and income tax (benefit) expense and unusual gains or charges. It also excludes non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization. The Company’s management believes adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of its core operations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes and unusual gains or charges (foreign currency gain, stock-based compensation, restatement expenses, asset disposition costs, loss on sale of business and net assets held for sale, bank restructuring costs and severance costs), which are not always commensurate with the reporting period in which such items are included. Global Power’s credit facility also contains ratios based on EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or as a better measure of liquidity than net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, and therefore, should not be used in isolation from, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180131006139/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nKei Advisors LLC\nDeborah K.
