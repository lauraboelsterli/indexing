Brands. Such statements constitute \"forward-looking statements\", which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve substantial known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the matters set forth in the filings that we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including those set forth in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2017 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended Sep. 30, 2017, which are on file with the SEC and are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://investors.grubhub.com/ . Additional information will be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K that will be filed for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results. Please also note that forward-looking statements represent management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. Except as required by law, we disclaim any intention to, and undertake no obligation to, publicly update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to common stockholders are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude acquisition, restructuring and certain legal costs, income taxes, interest income and expense, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to common stockholders exclude acquisition, restructuring and certain legal costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"U.S. Tax Act\") and other nonrecurring items as well as the income tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments. We use these non-GAAP financial measures as key performance measures because we believe they facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences primarily caused by variations in capital structures, tax positions, the impact of acquisitions and restructuring, the impact of depreciation and amortization expense on our fixed assets and the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to common stockholders are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.\nSee \"Schedule of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation\" below for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to common stockholders.\nGRUBHUB INC.\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share

Recast Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 includes net interest income of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
