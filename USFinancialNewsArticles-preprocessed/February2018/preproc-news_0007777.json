Since Friday, when the selloff in equities began in earnest, the index has gained about 1.1 percent.\nEmerging Asian currencies retreated, with the Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah both slipping around 0.4 percent against the dollar.\nThe U.S. currency was on the back foot as recently as late January, when the dollar index fell to a three-year trough of 88.438, hurt by a range of factors including concerns about U.S. trade protectionism and perceptions of narrowing yield advantage.\nIt caught a break, however, lifted by Friday’s robust U.S. employment report and the punishing sell-off in the recently bullish global equity markets.\n“We are seeing a big rewinding of positions that had been built up since the start of the year, such as euro longs,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\n“The stock market plunge caused by the jump in yields has been the trigger. Investors hurting from the drop in equities are seen trying to limit their losses by selling recently bullish currencies like the euro, which in turn supports the dollar.”\nThe dollar also tends to benefit from its perceived safe-haven status at times of market ructions.\nThe shakeout persisted in Tuesday’s Asian trade, with U.S. S&P futures tumbling 2.5 percent to 4-month lows at one point, while markets in Asia took another battering.\nThat came after the Dow, which rose to a record high late in January, fell 2.5 percent on Friday and plunged 4.6 percent on Monday.\nThe sharp pullback comes amid concerns about higher inflation, sending U.S. 10-year bond yields surging to a four-year top on Monday.\nFriday’s U.S. jobs report was the latest jolt to financial markets, as strong wages growth reinforced the inflation and monetary tightening speculation, with traders betting the Federal Reserve might raise rates at a faster pace than expected this year.\nThe pound touched a two-week low of $1.3937 on Tuesday after dropping more than 1 percent overnight. Sterling, which hit a 1-1/2-year high of $1.4346 late last month, was fetching $1.3957.\nThe Australian dollar touched a three-week low of $0.7855 and was last down 0.1 percent at $0.7870. The Aussie had advanced to over a 2-1/2-year top at $0.8136 on Jan. 26. (Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro; additional reporting by Masayuki Kitano in Singapore Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\n ",
