    "text": "HOUSTON, Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CBTX, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:CBTX), the bank holding company for CommunityBank of Texas N.A., today announced net income of $2.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.6 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and $10.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nThe Company reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $27.6 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, compared to $27.2 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nHighlights\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a charge of $3.9 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") and change of control expenses of $2.5 million ($1.6 million after tax), triggered by our initial public offering.\nLoan growth, excluding loans held for sale, was 20.2% for the quarter (annualized) and 7.3% for the year.\nThe Company completed its previously announced initial public offering of 2,760,000 shares of its common stock to the public at $26.00 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $71.8 million. Our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market on November 8, under the ticker symbol \"CBTX.\"\nCBTX, Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert R. Franklin Jr. commented, “2017 was an outstanding year for our Company. We reported total assets of $3.1 billion, total loans of $2.3 billion, total deposits of $2.6 billion and net income of $27.6 million, each of which are all-time highs for our Company.”\nOperating Results:\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $28.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $25.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $27.3 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the fourth quarter of 2016, was due to increased average loans and securities and increased average yields on federal funds sold and other interest-earning assets. The increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the third quarter of 2017 was due to increased average loans and federal funds sold and other interest-earning assets and the impact of the November repayment of our note payable in the amount of $23.3 million. Net interest income was $107.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $101.5 million for year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income in 2017, as compared to 2016 was due to increased average loans and securities and increased average yields on federal funds sold and other interest-earning assets.\nThe average balance of total interest-earning assets was $2.8 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $99.1 million, compared to the average balance for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and $94.3 million, compared to the average balance for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The increase in the average interest-earnings assets for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017 is primarily due to increases in average loans and federal funds sold. The increase in the average interest-earnings assets for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, is primarily due to increases in average loans and average securities. The average balance of interest-earning assets was $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $88.8 million, compared to the average for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to increases in average loans and average securities, partially offset by a decrease in average federal funds sold.\nThe yield on interest-earning assets was 4.29% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 4.11% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 4.32% for the third quarter of 2017. The yield on interest-earning assets was 4.30% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 4.19% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase from the prior year is primarily due to an increase in the yield on investments and federal funds sold.\nThe cost of interest-bearing liabilities, including borrowings, was 0.56% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 0.57% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 0.60% for the third quarter of 2017. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities, including borrowings, was 0.58% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 0.56% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe net interest margin was 3.98% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 3.78% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 3.98% for the third quarter of 2017. The net interest margin was 3.97% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.87% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProvision (Recapture) for Loan Losses\nProvision for loan loss was $1.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a provision for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $650,000 and a recapture of $1.7 million for the third quarter of 2017. The recapture in the third quarter of 2017 is primarily the result of pay-offs of certain classified and problem loans, which resulted in a decrease in their related allowance for loan losses. Provision for loan loss was a recapture of $338,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a provision of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The recapture in the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of pay-offs of certain classified and problem loans, which resulted in a decrease in their related allowance for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $24.8 million, or 1.07% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, compared to $25.0 million, or 1.16% of total loans, at December 31, 2016 and $23.8 million, or 1.08% of total loans, at September 30, 2017. The lower balance at September 30, 2017 is primarily the result of the recaptures mentioned above.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, $4.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2017. These fluctuations are primarily due to net gains recorded on sales of assets recorded in the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 resulting from sales of branches in those periods. Noninterest income was $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 9.8%. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in deposit account service charges due to a reduction of non-sufficient and overdraft charges incurred by our deposit customers and a decrease in other income due to income from our SBIC investment in 2016.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased $3.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased $3.0 million, as compared to the third quarter of 2017. The increase in noninterest expense compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017 is due primarily to a $2.5 million charge for change of control payments to certain employees triggered by our initial public offering, which is reflected in salaries and employee benefits and increased professional and director fees. Noninterest expense increased $4.8 million during 2017, as compared to 2016 due to the change of control payments previously mentioned, increased professional and director fees and increased advertising due to our branding campaign in 2017, partially offset by decreased occupancy costs due to sales of branches in 2016 and 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a deferred tax asset impairment of $3.9 million related to the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Income tax expense was $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $4.5 million, due to deferred tax asset impairment previously mentioned above and true-ups and return to provision adjustments booked in 2017.\nAs a result of the Tax Act passed in December 2017, the Company was required to recalculate its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and lost deductions on these assets and liabilities. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 including the impact of the Tax Act was 76.3% and would have been approximately 29.7% without the impact of the Tax Act. The effective tax rate for 2017 including the impact of the Tax Act was 37.4% and would have been approximately 28.6% without the impact of the Tax Act. The effective tax rates were 30.5% for the fourth quarter of 2016, 28.1% for the third quarter of 2017 and 30.7% for 2016.\nBalance Sheet Highlights :\nLoans\nLoans were $2.3 billion at December 31, 2017, $2.1 billion at December 31, 2016 and $2.2 billion at September 30, 2017. The increases from the prior year and linked quarter are primarily due to organic growth.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets were $8.4 million, or 0.27% of total assets, at December 31, 2017, $8.1 million, or 0.27% of total assets, at December 31, 2016 and $9.7 million, or 0.33% of total assets at September 30, 2017.\nNonperforming loans were $7.6 million, or 0.33% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, $6.2 million, or 0.29% of total loans, at December 31, 2016 and $8.6 million, or 0.39% of total loans, at September 30, 2017.\nAnnualized net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans were 0.00% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.50% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and (0.04)% for the third quarter of 2017. The recoveries in the third quarter of 2017 are primarily the result of payoffs of certain classified and problem loans.\nDeposits and Borrowings\nTotal deposits were $2.6 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2016 and $2.6 billion at September 30, 2017. The increase from the prior year is primarily due to organic growth.\nTotal borrowings (excluding junior subordinated debentures) were $1.5 million at December 31, 2017, $30.0 million at December 31, 2016 and $26.6 million at September 30, 2017. The decrease in borrowings at December 31, 2017 is due to scheduled payments and our fourth quarter repayment in full of the outstanding balance of our note payable.\nOn December 13, 2017, we entered into a loan agreement providing for a $30 million revolving line of credit and from that date through December 31, 2017, we made no borrowings under that agreement.\nCapital\nAt December 31, 2017, we were well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. At December 31, 2017, our ratio of total shareholders’ equity to total assets was 14.48% and our tangible equity to total tangible assets was 11.98%. At December 31, 2016, our ratio of total shareholders’ equity to total assets was 12.12% and our tangible equity to total tangible assets was 9.39%. Tangible equity to total tangible assets is a non‑GAAP financial measure. See the table captioned “Non‑GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation.”\nIn November 2017, we completed our initial public offering of our common stock issuing 2,760,000 common shares at $26.00 per share and net proceeds of $64.5 million, which is the primary cause of the increase in these ratios.\nAbout CBTX, Inc.\nCBTX, Inc. is the bank holding company for CommunityBank of Texas, N.A., a $3.1 billion asset bank, offering commercial banking solutions to local small and mid-sized businesses and professionals in Houston, Beaumont and surrounding communities in southeast Texas.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNon‑GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share data and percentages)\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, we also evaluate our performance based on certain additional non‑GAAP financial measures. We classify a financial measure as being a non‑GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are not included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non‑GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non‑GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the way we calculate the non‑GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.\nWe calculate (1) tangible equity as total shareholders’ equity, less goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, and (2) tangible book value per share as tangible equity divided by shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the relevant period. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible book value per share is book value per share. We calculate tangible assets as total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible equity to tangible assets is total shareholders’ equity to total assets. We believe that tangible book value per share and tangible equity to tangible assets are measures that are important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in book value per share and total shareholders’ equity to total assets, exclusive of change in intangible assets.\nThe following tables reconcile, as of the dates set forth below, total shareholders’ equity to tangible equity, total assets to tangible assets and presents book value per share, tangible book value per share, tangible equity to tangible assets and shareholders’ equity to total assets:\n12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 Tangible Equity Total shareholders’ equity $ 446,214 $ 381,121 $ 371,964 $ 363,643 $ 357,637 Adjustments: Goodwill 80,950 80,950 80,950 80,950 80,950 Other intangibles 6,770 7,031 7,298 7,513 7,791 Tangible equity $ 358,494 $ 293,140 $ 283,716 $ 275,180 $ 268,896 Tangible Assets Total assets $ 3,081,083 $ 2,989,838 $ 2,940,877 $ 2,914,548 $ 2,951,522 Adjustments: Goodwill 80,950 80,950 80,950 80,950 80,950 Other intangibles 6,770 7,031 7,298 7,513 7,791 Tangible assets $ 2,993,363 $ 2,901,857 $ 2,852,629 $ 2,826,085 $ 2,862,781 Common shares outstanding 24,833 22,063 22,063 22,062 22,062 Book value per share $ 17.97 $ 17.27 $ 16.86 $ 16.48 $ 16.21 Tangible book value per share $ 14.44 $ 13.29 $ 12.86 $ 12.47 $ 12.19 Total shareholders’ equity to total assets 14.48 % 12.75 % 12.65 % 12.48 % 12.12 % Tangible equity to tangible assets 11.98 % 10.10 % 9.95 % 9.74 % 9.39 % Investor Relations: James L.
