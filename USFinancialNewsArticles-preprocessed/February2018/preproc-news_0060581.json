Q4 2017 End of Period Meeting Subscribers were up 13.4% and End of Period Online Subscribers were up 29.3% versus the prior year period. Total Paid Weeks in Q4 2017 were up 19.1% versus the prior year period, driven by growth in all major geographic markets. Q4 2017 Meeting Paid Weeks increased 10.2% and Online Paid Weeks increased 26.4% versus the prior year period. Revenues in Q4 2017 were $312.5 million. On a constant currency basis, Q4 2017 revenues increased 14.1% versus the prior year period. Service Revenues in Q4 2017 were $264.0 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues increased 16.5% versus the prior year period. This increase was driven by growth in all major geographic markets. Product Sales and Other in Q4 2017 were $48.5 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues increased 2.3% versus the prior year period, with growth in product sales partially offset by declines in licensing. Operating Income in Q4 2017 was $49.5 million. Adjusted Operating Income in Q4 2017, which excluded the $13.3 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Company's Brazil operations, was $62.8 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income would have increased 30.2% versus the prior year period. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by operating leverage on higher revenues in the quarter versus the prior year period. Income Tax in Q4 2017 was a benefit of $54.7 million, which reflected a one-time $56.6 million net tax benefit principally due to a remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities under the new U.S. tax law. In the prior year period, income tax expense was $4.2 million. Net Income in Q4 2017 was $63.0 million compared to $13.3 million in the prior year period. Earnings per fully diluted share (EPS) in Q4 2017 was $0.91 compared to $0.20 in the prior year period. Certain items affect year-over-year comparability. The following items in the aggregate positively impacted Q4 2017 EPS by $0.54: $0.82 per fully diluted share arising from the one-time net tax benefit principally due to a remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities under the new U.S. tax law. ($0.19) per fully diluted share arising from the goodwill impairment charge related to the Company's Brazil operations. ($0.09) per fully diluted share arising from the negative net impact associated with the Company's Q4 2017 refinancing of $1.9 billion of debt. Q4 2016 results include out-of-period adjustments which benefited EPS by $0.02 per fully diluted share.\nFull Year 2017 Consolidated Results\n% Change\n% Change\nAdjusted for\nConstant\nCurrency (1)\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n(in millions except percentages and per share amounts)\nService Revenues, net\n$1,081.7\n$949.1\n14.0%\n13.7%\nProduct Sales and Other, net\n225.2\n215.8\n4.4%\n4.7%\nRevenues, net\n$1,306.9\n$1,164.9\n12.2%\n12.1%\nOperating Income\n$267.3\n$200.8\n33.1%\n32.5%\nAdjustments\nGoodwill Impairment\n13.3\n-\nAdjusted Operating Income (1)\n$280.6\n$200.8\n39.8%\n39.0%\nNet Income*\n$163.5\n$67.7\n141.5%\n140.4%\nEPS\n$2.40\n$1.03\n133.2%\n132.1%\nTotal Paid Weeks\n181.5\n155.1\n17.1%\nN/A\nMeeting (2) Paid Weeks\n76.4\n69.6\n9.7%\nN/A\nOnline (3) Paid Weeks\n105.2\n85.5\n23.1%\nN/A\nEnd of Period Subscribers (4)\n3.2\n2.6\n22.6%\nN/A\nMeeting Subscribers\n1.3\n1.1\n13.4%\nN/A\nOnline Subscribers\n2.0\n1.5\n29.3%\nN/A\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" attached to this release for further detail on adjustments to GAAP financial measures.\n(2) \"Meetings\" refers to providing access to combined meetings and digital offerings to the Company's commitment plan subscribers (including Total Access subscribers), as well as access to meetings to the Company's \"pay-as-you-go\" members and other meetings members.\n(3) \"Online\" refers to Weight Watchers Online, Weight Watchers OnlinePlus, Personal Coaching and other digital subscription products.\n(4) \"Subscribers\" refers to meetings members and Online subscribers who participate in recurring billing programs.\n*Except in the case of the financials attached to this release, \"Net Income\" refers to Net Income attributable to Weight Watchers International, Inc.\nFull Year 2017 Business and Financial Highlights\nTotal Paid Weeks in fiscal 2017 were up 17.1% versus the prior year, driven by growth in all major geographic markets.

On a constant currency basis, fiscal 2017 revenues increased 12.1% versus the prior year. Service Revenues in fiscal 2017 were $1,081.7 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues increased 13.7% versus the prior year. This increase was driven by growth in all major geographic markets.

Adjusted Operating Income in fiscal 2017, which excluded the $13.3 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Company's Brazil operations, was $280.6 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income would have increased 39.0% versus the prior year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by operating leverage on higher revenues in the year versus the prior year. Income Tax in fiscal 2017 was a benefit of $18.2 million, which reflected a one-time $56.6 million net tax benefit principally due to a remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities under the new U.S. tax law. In the prior year, income tax expense was $16.6 million. Net Income in fiscal 2017 was $163.5 million compared to $67.7 million in the prior year. EPS in fiscal 2017 was $2.40 compared to $1.03 in the prior year. Certain items affect year-over-year comparability. The following items in the aggregate positively impacted full year fiscal 2017 EPS by $0.75: $0.83 per fully diluted share arising from the one-time net tax benefit principally due to a remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities under the new U.S. tax law. $0.18 per fully diluted share tax benefit that was offset by $0.01 per fully diluted share of expense, both related to the previously announced cessation of operations of the Company's Spanish subsidiary. $0.03 per fully diluted share arising from the positive impact of the reversal of certain tax reserves. ($0.20) per fully diluted share arising from the goodwill impairment charge related to the Company's Brazil operations. ($0.08) per fully diluted share arising from the negative net impact associated with the Company's $1.9 billion refinancing of debt in Q4 2017 and the Company's debt prepayment in Q2 2017. Full year fiscal 2016 results benefitted from a lower tax rate, largely driven by the net tax incentives primarily related to prior-year technology investments. The net impact of these items positively impacted fiscal 2016 EPS by $0.18 per fully diluted share.\nOther Items\nCash balance as of December 30, 2017 was $83.1 million, which included $25 million of borrowings on the Company's $150 million revolving credit facility. During Q4 2017, the Company completed the refinancing of its debt, extending its maturities while maintaining a flexible and prepayable capital structure.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 Guidance\nThe Company is providing its full year fiscal 2018 revenue guidance of approaching $1.55 billion and earnings guidance of between $2.40 and $2.70 per fully diluted share.

Operating income and operating income margin are discussed in this release both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and, with respect to the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017, as adjusted (on a non-GAAP basis), to exclude the impairment charge for the Company's goodwill related to its Brazil operations. The Company also presents in the attachments to this release the non-GAAP financial measures earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (\"EBITDAS\") and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and goodwill impairment (\"Adjusted EBITDAS\"). In addition, the Company presents certain of its financial results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. In this release and any attachments, the Company calculates constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors' evaluation of the Company's business performance and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Company's business. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" attached to this release and reconciliations, if any, included elsewhere in this release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nAbout Weight Watchers International, Inc.\nWeight Watchers is a global wellness company and the world's leading commercial weight management program.
