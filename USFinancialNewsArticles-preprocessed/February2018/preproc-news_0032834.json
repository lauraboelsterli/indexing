    "text": "BALMA, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nStryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) announced that it has crossed the 95% thresholds in VEXIM (Paris:ALVXM) (FR0011072602 - ALVXM) and intends to file a proposed public buy-out offer followed by a squeeze-out for the outstanding shares of VEXIM, in accordance with French tender offer laws and regulations.\nAfter the acquisition of 92.19% of the share capital and 91.56% of the voting rights of VEXIM following a simplified public tender offer opened from November 16, 2017 to December 6, 2017, Stryker acquired 300,016 additional shares on the market (at a maximum price of EUR 20, i.e., the price paid in the simplified public tender offer) and crossed upwards the 95% thresholds in share capital and voting rights of VEXIM. Stryker now holds indirectly, through its French subsidiary Stryker France MM Holdings SAS, 8,716,415 shares and voting rights of VEXIM, representing 95.48% of the share capital and at least 95.14% of the voting rights.\nAs a result, Stryker intends to file, within the coming weeks, a proposed public buy-out offer for all the outstanding shares it does not own for a price per share of EUR 20, which will be followed automatically by a squeeze-out of all the remaining non-tendered shares. The public buy-out offer followed by a squeeze-out will be subject to the clearance decision of the French stock market authority (the \"AMF\").\nIn accordance with Article 261-1, I and II of the general regulation of the AMF, the board of directors of VEXIM will appoint an independent expert to issue a report regarding the fairness of the financial conditions of the proposed public buy-out offer followed by a squeeze-out.\nThe squeeze-out is expected to occur during Q2 2018.\nThe suspension of trading of VEXIM shares will be maintained until the filing of the proposed offer.\nAbout VEXIM, the innovative back microsurgery specialist\nBased in Balma, near Toulouse (France), VEXIM is a medical device company created in February 2006.
