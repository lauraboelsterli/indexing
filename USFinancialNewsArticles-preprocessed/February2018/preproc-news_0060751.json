    "text": "DANVILLE, Pa., Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Geisinger has named Kevin V. Roberts, MBA, CPA, its new executive vice president and chief financial officer. Roberts will oversee all financial activities of the integrated health care delivery system and will serve on Geisinger's executive leadership team.\nRoberts succeeds Kevin Brennan, CPA, FHFMA, who announced his retirement at the end of 2017 after more than 20 years with the health system. Brennan is Geisinger's longest-serving CFO and has earned Geisinger numerous honors for financial leadership. Brennan will remain at Geisinger through June when he will become Chair of Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA).\nSet to join Geisinger in April, Roberts has extensive and wide-ranging experience in business development and growth, corporate finance, health plans, mergers and acquisitions, financial operations, technology and investment management in large, complex, multi-site healthcare organizations. He joins Geisinger from BJC HealthCare, St. Louis, Missouri, a 15-hospital health system that includes Barnes-Jewish Hospital and St. Louis Children's Hospital and its academic partner, Washington University School of Medicine, where he served as senior vice president and chief financial officer.\nDuring his more than 30 years of professional experience, Roberts has also held executive-level finance positions at University Hospitals Health System and the Cleveland Clinic, both in Cleveland, Ohio, and Proctor Hospital in Peoria, Illinois.\n\"Throughout his career, Kevin Roberts has demonstrated a commitment to delivering the best in patient care combined with financial expertise,\" said David T. Feinberg, M.D., MBA, Geisinger president and CEO. \"We look forward to the contributions he will make as part of our leadership team and we're confident he has the exceptional skills necessary to fill the shoes left by Kevin Brennan.\"\nRoberts earned a bachelor's degree in business with a concentration in accountancy from Eastern Illinois University, Charleston, and a master's degree in business administration from Bradley University, Peoria. He is a certified public accountant.\n\"It's an exciting time to be joining Geisinger, an organization with a 100-plus year legacy of providing exceptional care to the communities it serves,\" Roberts said. \"I look forward to being part of an innovative and forward-thinking team that keeps patients at the center of everything we do.\"\nAbout Geisinger\nGeisinger is an integrated health services organization widely recognized for its early adoptions of the electronic health record and the development of innovative care delivery models such as ProvenHealth Navigator®, ProvenCare® and ProvenExperience®.
