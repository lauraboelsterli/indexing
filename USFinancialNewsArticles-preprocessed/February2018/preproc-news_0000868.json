A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'.\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099 DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nReturn figures provided below are based on the change in the Fund's Net Asset Value per share (\"NAV\"), compared to the annualized distribution rate for this current distribution as a percentage of the NAV on the last day of the month prior to distribution record date.\nAnnualized\nFund\n5-Year\nFiscal YTD\nFiscal YTD\nFiscal YTD\nNAV Return (1)\nNAV Dist Rate\nNAV Return\nNAV Dist Rate\nCHI\n7.78%\n10.02%\n2.85%\n3.34%\nCHY\n7.66%\n9.98%\n3.09%\n3.33%\nCSQ\n14.12%\n7.22%\n9.72%\n2.41%\nCGO\n9.29%\n8.37%\n9.40%\n2.79%\nCHW\n10.40%\n8.63%\n8.09%\n2.88%\nCCD\n5.74%\n9.45%\n3.35%\n3.15%\n1 Since inception for CCD\nNote: NAV returns are as of January 31, 2018 and Distribution Returns include the distribution announced today.\nWhile the NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\nMonthly distributions offer shareholders the opportunity to accumulate more shares in a fund via the automatic dividend reinvestment plan. For example, if a fund's shares are trading at a premium, distributions will be automatically reinvested through the plan at NAV or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater; if shares are trading at a discount, distributions will be reinvested at the market price through an open market purchase program. Thus, the plan offers current shareholders an efficient method of accumulating additional shares with a potential for cost savings. Please see the dividend reinvestment plan for more information.\nImportant Notes about Performance and Risk\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. As with other investments, market price will fluctuate with the market and upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Returns at NAV reflect the deduction of the Fund's management fee, debt leverage costs and other expenses. You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount which is a market price that is below their net asset value.\nAbout Calamos\nCalamos Investments is a diversified global investment firm offering innovative investment strategies including U.S. growth equity, global equity, convertible, fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives.
