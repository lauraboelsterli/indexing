    "text": "0 COMMENTS Publishers are bringing in more money from third-party social media platforms as they focus on those avenues of distribution, but it isn’t growing much as a portion of their overall revenue mix, according to a new report from publishing trade group Digital Content Next.\nRevenue from platforms like Facebook , Apple and YouTube increased 37%, on average, in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period a year earlier, for the companies that participated in the report in both years. The share of total revenue from platform publishing was 16% in the first half of 2017, up from 14% in 2016.\nThe growth has been accompanied by challenges, according to the report. Staffing teams to create major projects — like a show for Facebook Watch, for example — is costly and provides no clear path to monetization. Social-media companies can be fickle and change up their strategies, emphasizing platforms after publishers pour resources into them. A key risk on the horizon is Facebook’s stated plans to reduce the amount of posts in its news feed from publishers.\nAnd many platforms offer programs that are siloed and difficult to scale.\n“The financial benefit of distributing your content in these platforms isn’t yet justified by the results,” said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next.\nAmong social media companies, Facebook was the biggest driver of revenue for publishers, according to the study. In the first half of 2016, the social giant provided an average of about $600,000 for publishers that participated in the study. By the first half of 2018, publishers were making an average of $1.5 million from Facebook, according to the report.\nBranded advertising on Facebook and syndication fees from other companies were the two of the biggest drivers of growth from 2016 to 2017. Both increased by about 90%, according to the report. Revenue from over-the-top video companies like Roku, Apple News, Hulu and YouTube TV represented about 54% of distributed revenue in the second half of 2017, according to the report.\nThe report indicates that publishers that have placed big bets on social media would be wise to avoid over-reliance any one platform, Mr. Kint said. He also echoed calls from media executives such as NBC News chairman Andy Lack and Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of Wall Street Journal-parent News Corp., for Google and Facebook to pay publishers the equivalent of cable TV carriage fees for their content.\n“Over the course of the last year, we’ve had significant questions globally about whether or not platforms like Facebook and YouTube are ultimately good for society or harmful,” Mr. Kint said. “Advertisers have asked the same questions. And this data challenges whether or not they’re even economically good for publishers.”\nDigital Content Next represents 75 premium content publishers, including The New York Times, ABC, Vox Media and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp. The publishers that participated in the report included The New York Times, Slate, USA Today, Financial Times, ESPN and Bloomberg.\nNot all companies are equally equipped to share in the riches. TV companies, which have a hefty supply of video content, have been more successful than their print competitors in a marketplace hungry for visuals. Print and purely digital publications have made much of their money by syndicating content on traditional syndication partners like MSN, AOL and Yahoo .\nAlthough publishers have faced headwinds in their quest to make money from audiences on social media and elsewhere, the report lists a few pointers to help in the search for revenue. Companies that leave negotiations to top executives see more success, for example, as do publishers that focus on building products that are aligned with their core businesses.",
