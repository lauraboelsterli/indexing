    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Former Sammons Financial Group (SFG) Chairman and CEO John C. \"Jack\" Watson passed away on January 24, 2018.\nWatson joined Midland National Life Insurance Company , a subsidiary of Sammons Enterprises, Inc. , in 1992 as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Four years later, Sammons Financial Holdings (later renamed Sammons Financial Group) was established to hold Sammons Enterprises’ investments in insurance companies, naming Watson the first Chairman and CEO. He retired in 2000 after serving eight years at the company.\n“Jack had a huge impact on the company,” said Mike Masterson, former SFG Chairman and CEO, and currently on the board of directors for Midland National and North American Company for Life and Health. “He was responsible for changing the culture and helped set the stage for the significant growth the company has experienced over the last 20 years. Noting the influence Watson had on future leadership, Masterson stated, “Jack also created opportunities for me and a number of senior executives like John Craig (former Midland National president and CEO) and Steve Horvat (former SFG senior vice president and General Counsel). I will always be grateful for everything Jack did for me and for Sammons Financial Group.”\nDuring his tenure, Midland National commemorated $50 billion of life insurance in force, as well as its 90th anniversary in 1996. Under his leadership from 1992 through 2000, Midland National increased life insurance in force from $42.3 billion to $69.3 billion; assets increased from $1.4 billion to $4.1 billion.
