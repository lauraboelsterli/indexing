    "text": "TONTITOWN, Ark., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTSI) today reported net income of $31,561,483, or diluted earnings per share of $5.00 ($5.07 basic) for the fourth quarter of 2017, and net income of $38,899,707, or diluted earnings per share of $6.08 ($6.14 basic) for the year ended December 31, 2017. These results compare to net income of $722,842, or diluted and basic earnings per share of $0.11 for the fourth quarter of 2016, and net income of $11,100,901, or diluted earnings per share of $1.67 ($1.68 basic) for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the non-cash income tax benefit recognized as a result of the tax reform law enacted during the fourth quarter of this year, earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were $0.28 and $1.43, respectively.\nOperating revenues, including revenue from fuel surcharges, were $110,889,221 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $108,354,047 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating revenues, including revenue from fuel surcharges, were $437,838,467 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $432,852,284 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nDaniel H. Cushman, President of the Company, commented, “During the fourth quarter 2017 it became evident that shippers were beginning to have concerns about potential shortages in truck capacity. These concerns translated into higher demand for our services, which in turn translates into higher rates received for those services. We expect that this trend will continue, which should allow us opportunities throughout 2018 to increase those rates with existing customers that were previously pressured below what we consider to be acceptable operating levels, and to add new business at significantly better rates than we have seen in recent years. We did not finish 2017 as strong as we would have liked as weaker December results offset significantly improved results achieved during October and November. December was particularly difficult due to automotive plant shutdowns and shortfalls in peak freight commitments as some customers fell considerably short of hitting their capacity needs targets. This shortfall left us scrambling to find acceptable replacement freight for that reserved capacity and while freight was plentiful, with such short notice it was difficult to find destinations and rates which were both desirable and network friendly.\n“The prospect of improving freight rates afforded us the opportunity to address a much needed pay increase for our professional drivers. Late in the fourth quarter, we gave a pay increase to our drivers which we believe was an absolute necessity to remain competitive in the current driver market. Historically, our driver model has been, in a large part, to hire and train new student drivers. This model served us well for many years as the pipeline of new student drivers helped to keep our trucks manned. In the past, some of our larger competitors would not hire a driver with less than one year of experience, which meant competition for our new drivers was somewhat limited. Due to heightened competition brought on by an increasingly large industry shortfall of qualified drivers, this experience requirement by our competitors has over time decreased to nine months, then to six months, and now for many it’s down to three months. This has substantially increased competition for our new drivers and puts a tremendous amount of pressure on our driver retention success rate at the three month mark. Our retention levels after the first three months had started to deteriorate prior to this pay increase, but since implementation, we have seen positive trends in both recruitment and retention of both student and experienced drivers.\n“Throughout most of 2017, we were challenged by downward rate pressure from a majority of our customer base. It was commonplace for customers to request significant rate decreases. If an agreement could not be reached regarding reduced rates, customers pulled their freight and awarded it to a new low bidder. This process played out over and over throughout most of 2017 and resulted in us losing several of our dedicated lanes to lower rate competitors. Replacement freight was often not available, or had to be discounted to win, or was turned down due to unrealistically low rates, which resulted in a reduction in our fleet size as we adjusted to our volume of profitable freight. For 2018, our equipment purchase plans include restoring this lost ground plus adding capacity for additional growth, and is evidenced by our recent order of 725 new trucks and 1,000 new trailers. We expect to finish 2018 with a company-owned truck fleet in excess of 20% larger from where we finished 2017. We have been awarded multiple dedicated opportunities with target start dates in the first quarter of 2018, at rates that support an improved margin, and that will be attractive to driver’s seeking stable lanes. While this dedicated freight is at a discount to current spot market rates and the commitments will somewhat limit our ability to take advantage of the increasingly high rates seen in the current spot market environment, it is long-term and consistent, allowing better utilization, driver retention and a better opportunity for sustainable growth.”\nP.A.M.
