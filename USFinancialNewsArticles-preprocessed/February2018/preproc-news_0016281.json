    "text": "CHANDLER, Ariz., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n(NASDAQ:MCHP) – Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP solutions, today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 36.30 cents per share. The dividend is payable on March 6, 2018 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2018. Microchip initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 and has increased its dividend 55 times since its inception.\n“Microchip’s financial results in the December quarter produced record high cash flow from operations of $365 million,” said Steve Sanghi, Chief Executive Officer. “Our Board of Directors is pleased to declare an increase in our quarterly dividend to a record 36.30 cents per share, which continues to reflect our ongoing commitment to returning value to our stockholders.”\nCautionary Statement:\nThe statement contained in this release relating to our ongoing commitment to returning value to our stockholders is a forward-looking statement made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This statement involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to: actual cash flows generated from and used in the operation of our business; actual or projected levels of capital expenditures; our balance of cash and investments; changes in the tax rates that our stockholders pay on our dividends or other changes in U.S. tax laws including the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017; our available borrowings under our credit agreement; the impact of any significant acquisitions we may make; our ability to realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions, changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers; the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy short- term orders from our inventory; changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and our ability to effectively manage our production levels; our ability to control the level of operating expenses relative to our level of revenues; competitive developments including pricing pressures; the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter; the level of sell-through of our products through distribution; changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality; costs and outcome of any current or future tax audit or any litigation or other matters involving intellectual property, customers or other issues; disruptions in our business or the businesses of our customers or suppliers due to natural disasters (including any floods in Thailand), terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, worldwide oil prices and supply, public health concerns or disruptions in the transportation system; and general economic, industry or political conditions in the United States or internationally.\nFor a detailed discussion of these and other risk factors, please refer to Microchip's filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
