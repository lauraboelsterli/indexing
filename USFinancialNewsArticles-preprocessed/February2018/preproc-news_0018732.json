    "text": "HOUSTON, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: APC) today announced 2017 fourth‑quarter results, reporting net income attributable to common stockholders of $976 million, or $1.80 per share (diluted). These results include certain items typically excluded by the investment community in published estimates. In total, these items increased net income by $870 million, or $1.62 per share (diluted), on an after-tax basis. (1) Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.4 billion.\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, Anadarko reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $456 million, or $0.85 per share (diluted). Full-year 2017 net cash provided by operating activities totaled $4.0 billion.\n2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nFurther improved oil sales-volume product mix to 53 percent, with liquids increasing to 67 percent, contributing to a 67-percent improvement in margins per barrel (2) Achieved production exit rates totaling more than 150,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) combined from the Delaware and DJ basins Closed more than $4.0 billion of asset divestitures Announced $2.5 billion share repurchase program and, by year end, repurchased 21.9 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion (average price of $48.33 per share) Achieved completion of the Legal and Contractual Framework and commenced resettlement for the Mozambique LNG project\n\"Given the significant volatility the energy sector faced in 2017, we continued to focus on capital efficiency throughout the year by investing upstream capital within discretionary cash flow, while materially improving margins per barrel – an approach that produced very encouraging results as we concluded the year,\" said Al Walker, Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO. \"These operational efficiencies, an improving market environment, and strong momentum provide an exciting backdrop to 2018. Our capital-investment program this year is well positioned to deliver attractive cash returns that produce healthy production growth. As we have stated previously, we will complement this capital-efficient investment plan with additional share buybacks, increases to our dividend yield, and improvements to our credit metrics, as market conditions permit, rather than materially increasing our capital expenditures to pursue greater production volume.\"\nSALES VOLUMES AND PROVED RESERVES\nAnadarko's full-year sales volumes of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) totaled 245 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), or an average of 672,000 BOE per day. Fourth-quarter 2017 sales volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs averaged approximately 637,000 BOE per day.\nIn 2017, Anadarko organically added 244 million BOE of proved reserves before the effects of price revisions. Anadarko's costs incurred were $4.1 billion. The company's oil and natural gas exploration and development costs were $4.2 billion. (2) The company estimates its proved reserves at year-end 2017 totaled 1.44 billion BOE, with 78 percent of its reserves categorized as proved developed. At year-end 2017, Anadarko's proved reserves were comprised of 63 percent liquids and 37 percent natural gas.\nOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nBy year-end 2017, oil sales volumes in the Delaware Basin of West Texas surpassed 50,000 BOPD, representing a 69-percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. The company also made significant progress toward full development mode as it successfully concluded its drilling program to capture 70‑percent operatorship across its 240,000-net-acre position.\nIn the DJ Basin of northeast Colorado, Anadarko achieved record sales volumes of more than 254,000 BOE per day. Oil sales volumes surpassed 100,000 BOPD in December, driving an increase of almost 20 percent over the previous quarter. In addition, the company's new completion design implemented in 2017 increased its estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) to 690,000 BOE per well in the contiguous core, representing an increase of more than 20-percent over the previous type curve.\nGulf of Mexico sales volumes averaged 143,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter, representing a 35-percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Oil sales volumes for the quarter averaged 120,000 BOPD, a 48-percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2016, while also reflecting the impact of Hurricane Nate and the prolonged shutdown at the third-party-operated Enchilada platform.\nAnadarko's international and frontier operations averaged 94,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter of 2017, representing an 18-percent decrease relative to the fourth quarter of 2016, which was largely driven by statutory maintenance on the El Merk facility in Algeria and the timing and size of tanker liftings. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, the company made meaningful progress with its Mozambique LNG project by beginning the resettlement process to prepare the onshore location for the future LNG park.\nOPERATIONS REPORT\nFor additional details on Anadarko's fourth-quarter 2017 operations and exploration program, please refer to the comprehensive Operations Report available at www.anadarko.com .\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nDuring the year, Anadarko generated $4.0 billion of net cash provided by operating activities while investing $3.8 billion on upstream exploration and development activities. (3) The company ended 2017 with $4.6 billion of cash on hand and closed asset divestitures totaling more than $4.0 billion during the year. Subsequent to year end, Anadarko divested its non-operated interest in its Alaska assets for approximately $400 million. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.\nDuring the fourth quarter, approximately $1.1 billion of the company's previously announced $2.5 billion share-repurchase program was executed under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement and through open-market purchases. In February 2018, Anadarko completed a repurchase of 8.5 million shares for $500 million (average price of $58.82 per share) under an additional ASR agreement. To date, the company has completed $1.6 billion of repurchases under the program, totaling 30.4 million shares at an average price of $51.27 per share.\nSubsequent to year end, the company amended both its $3.0 billion, five-year credit facility to extend the maturity date to January 2022 and its $2.0 billion, 364-day credit facility to extend the maturity date to January 2019.\n2018 CAPITAL PROGRAM AND SALES-VOLUME GUIDANCE\nAnadarko's 2018 guidance has been adjusted from its November 2017 news release for the divestiture of its Alaska assets and anticipated production impacts related to non-operated downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. The company expects full-year capital investments in the range of $4.1 to $4.5 billion, not including capital investments made by Western Gas Partners, LP (NYSE: WES).\n2018 Capital (a)\n($ Million)\n2018 Total\nSales Volume (b)\n(Million BOE)\n2018 Oil\nSales Volume (b)\n(Thousand BOPD)\nNovember 2017 Guidance\n$4,200 - $4,600\n245 - 255\n385 - 405\nAdjustment\n(100)\n(7) (c)\n(16) (d)\nNew Guidance\n$4,100 - $4,500\n238 - 248\n370 - 390\nNote: All amounts are approximate.\n(a) Does not include WES capital investments.\n(b) See the accompanying table for a reconciliation of divestiture-adjusted sales volume.\n(c) Includes Alaska divestiture (4 million BOE) and GOM, primarily driven by non-operated downtime.\n(d) Includes Alaska divestiture (11 thousand BOPD) and GOM, primarily driven by non-operated downtime.\nCONFERENCE CALL TOMORROW AT 8 A.M.

This non-GAAP information should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures.\nManagement uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate operating and financial performance and believes the measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the impact of certain noncash and/or other items that management does not consider to be indicative of the Company's performance from period to period. Management also believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors to evaluate and compare the Company's operating and financial performance across periods, as well as facilitating comparisons to others in the Company's industry.\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2017\nBefore\nAfter\nPer Share\nmillions except per-share amounts\nTax\nTax\n(diluted)\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP)\n$\n976\n$\n1.80\nAdjustments for certain items affecting comparability\nTotal gains (losses) on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives*\n$\n(168)\n(105)\n(0.20)\nGains (losses) on divestitures, net\n(141)\n(83)\n(0.15)\nImpairments\nProducing properties\n(25)\n(16)\n(0.03)\nExploration assets\n(24)\n(15)\n(0.03)\nEarly termination of rig\n(39)\n(25)\n(0.05)\nChange in uncertain tax positions\n(56)\n(0.10)\nImpact of tax reform legislation\n1,170\n2.18\nCertain items affecting comparability\n$\n(397)\n870\n1.62\nAdjusted net income (loss) (Non-GAAP)\n$\n106\n$\n0.18\n*\nIncludes $(171) million related to commodity derivatives, $(1) million related to interest-rate derivatives, and $4 million related to gathering, processing, and marketing sales.\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2016\nBefore\nAfter\nPer Share\nmillions except per-share amounts\nTax\nTax\n(diluted)\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP)\n$\n(515)\n$\n(0.94)\nAdjustments for certain items affecting comparability\nTotal gains (losses) on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives*\n$\n304\n193\n0.35\nGains (losses) on divestitures, net\n(241)\n(155)\n(0.28)\nImpairments\nProducing and general properties\n(166)\n(101)\n(0.18)\nExploration assets\n(149)\n(115)\n(0.21)\nRestructuring charges\n(26)\n(16)\n(0.03)\nEarly termination of rig\n(49)\n(32)\n(0.06)\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n(31)\n(20)\n(0.04)\nEnvironmental reserves\n21\n13\n0.03\nChange in uncertain tax positions\n(10)\n(0.02)\nCertain items affecting comparability\n$\n(337)\n(243)\n(0.44)\nAdjusted net income (loss) (Non-GAAP)\n$\n(272)\n$\n(0.50)\n*\nIncludes $(179) million related to commodity derivatives and $483 million related to interest-rate derivatives.\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) provides information useful in assessing the Company's operating and financial performance across periods.\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\nmillions\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP)\n$\n(456)\n$\n(3,071)\nInterest expense\n932\n890\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(1,477)\n(1,021)\nDD&A\n4,279\n4,301\nExploration expense\n2,541\n946\n(Gains) losses on divestitures, net\n(674)\n757\nImpairments\n408\n227\nTotal (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives\n156\n559\nRestructuring charges\n21\n389\nOther operating expense\n—\n1\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n2\n155\nCertain other nonoperating items\n—\n(58)\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) (Non-GAAP)\n$\n5,732\n$\n4,075\nTotal barrels of oil equivalent (BOE)\n245\n290\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDAX (Margin) per BOE\n$\n23.40\n$\n14.05\nManagement believes oil and natural gas exploration and development costs is a more accurate reflection of the expenditures incurred during the current year excluding certain obligations to be paid in future periods.\nmillions\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nCosts incurred (GAAP)*\n$\n4,093\nAsset retirement obligation liabilities incurred\n(5)\nCash expenditures for asset retirement obligations\n131\nOil and natural gas exploration and development costs (Non-GAAP)\n$\n4,219\n*\nIncludes $499 million of unproved property acquisitions.\nManagement uses net debt to determine the Company's outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. Management believes that using net debt in the capitalization ratio is useful to investors in determining the Company's leverage since the Company could choose to use its cash and cash equivalents to retire debt.
