Analysts had on average expected earnings of 58 Canadian cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. \nCore earnings for the quarter were C$1.2 billion ($955 million), compared with C$1.3 billion the year before. \nInsurance sales fell by 3 percent during the period to C$1 billion. The company generated net flows of C$3.7 billion in its wealth and asset management businesses, down from C$6.1 billion the year before, mainly due to lower net flows in institutional asset management. \nManulife announced a quarterly dividend of 22 Canadian cents, up 7 percent on the previous quarter. $1 = 1.2561 Canadian dollars Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Tom Brown and Leslie Adler",
