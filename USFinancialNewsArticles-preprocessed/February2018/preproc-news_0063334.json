Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFourth Quarter Net Revenue by Product Category (in thousands) Q4 2017\nNet Revenue Q4 2016\nNet Revenue (1) Change Core Brands (2) $ 404,688 $ 400,321 1.1 % Allied Brands (3) 41,097 42,686 -3.7 % Branded 445,785 443,007 0.6 % Partner Brand 69,255 70,829 -2.2 % Other 36,517 42,327 -13.7 % Total $ 551,557 $ 556,163 -0.8 % (1) Includes net revenue results from continuing operations only.\n(2) The Company's Core Brands include: Snyder's of Hanover ® , Lance ® , Kettle Brand ® , KETTLE ® Chips, Cape Cod ® , Snack Factory ® Pretzel Crisps ® , Pop Secret ® , Emerald ® and Late July ® .\n(3) The Company's Allied Brands include: Krunchers! ® , Tom's ® , Archway ® , Jays ® , Stella D'oro ® , Eatsmart Snacks™, O-Ke-Doke ® and Metcalfe’s skinny ® Total net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $551.6 million, a decrease of 0.8% compared to $556.2 million from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Branded net revenue increased 0.6% as a result of a 1.1% increase in the Company’s Core Brands partially offset by a 3.7% decrease in Allied Brands. The Core Brand net revenue increase was led by growth in Late July ® , Cape Cod ® , KETTLE ® Chips, Lance ® , Snyder’s of Hanover ® , and Snack Factory ® Pretzel Crisps ® , partially offset by a decline in Pop Secret ® , Emerald ® , and Kettle Brand ® . In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2017, net revenue from the Partner Brand category decreased 2.2% while net revenue from the Other category declined 13.7%, each compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $46.0 million, as compared to GAAP operating income of $44.3 million from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income from continuing operations and excluding special items affecting comparability, in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $54.8 million, or 9.9% as a percentage of net revenue, as compared to $52.1 million from continuing operations, or 9.4% as a percentage of net revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating margin expansion was the result of lower general and administrative expenses, and supply chain productivity and cost initiatives. These were partially offset by higher promotional trade spend, higher service and distribution costs primarily related to trucking capacity, as well as continued higher than normal manufacturing costs due to the ramping up of Emerald ® production capacity in Charlotte, NC that was previously located in the Stockton, CA manufacturing facility.\nNet interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.2 million compared to $9.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding special items, the effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to 37.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, excluding special items, was primarily due to the impact of adopting new accounting guidance, which resulted in excess tax benefits for certain share-based payments, which were previously included in equity.\nGAAP net income attributable to Snyder’s-Lance from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $188.8 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $18.7 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The significant increase in GAAP net income was primarily due to a non-recurring, non-cash gain of $162.4 million as the result of the impact of the Income Tax Reform Act enacted in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”). Net income attributable to Snyder’s-Lance from continuing operations, excluding special items, for the fourth quarter of 2017, was $32.7 million, as compared to $26.4 million, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, excluding special items, was $0.33 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.27, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $78.5 million, or 14.2% of net revenue, as compared to adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $77.1 million, or 13.9% of net revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined herein under “Use and Definition of Non-GAAP Measures,” and is reconciled to net income in the tables that accompany this release.\nFull-Year 2017 Results\nFull-Year Net Revenue by Product Category (in thousands) 2017\nNet Revenue 2016\nNet Revenue (1) Change Core Brands (2) $ 1,613,682 $ 1,478,601 9.1 % Allied Brands (3) 163,393 159,695 2.3 % Branded 1,777,075 1,638,296 8.5 % Partner Brand 291,580 300,436 -2.9 % Other 158,182 170,495 -7.2 % Total $ 2,226,837 $ 2,109,227 5.6 % (1) Includes net revenue results from continuing operations only.\n(2) The Company's Core Brands include: Snyder's of Hanover ® , Lance ® , Kettle Brand ® , KETTLE ® Chips, Cape Cod ® , Snack Factory ® Pretzel Crisps ® , Pop Secret ® , Emerald ® and Late July ® .\n(3) The Company's Allied Brands include: Krunchers! ® , Tom's ® , Archway ® , Jays ® , Stella D'oro ® , Eatsmart Snacks™, O-Ke-Doke ® and Metcalfe’s skinny ® Total net revenue for the full-year 2017 was 2,226.8 million, an increase of 5.6% compared to $2,109.2 million from continuing operations in 2016.

These expenses were primarily related to $104.7 million in non-cash impairment charges reflecting the write-downs of the Company’s European reporting unit goodwill, and the Company’s KETTLE ® Chips trademark in the United Kingdom and Pop Secret ® trademark. Operating income from continuing operations and excluding special items affecting comparability, for the full-year 2017 was $195.7 million, or 8.8% as a percentage of net revenue, as compared to $189.5 million from continuing operations, or 9.0% as a percentage of net revenue, in 2016.\nNet interest expense for the full-year 2017 was $38.8 million compared to $32.6 million in 2016.

The non-GAAP measures and related comparisons should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, our GAAP disclosure, as well as other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful for providing increased transparency and assisting investors in understanding our ongoing operating performance.\nOperating Income and Gross Profit, Excluding Special Items\nOperating income and gross profit, excluding special items, are provided because Snyder’s-Lance believes it is useful information for understanding our results by improving the comparability of our results. Additionally, operating income and gross profit, excluding special items, provide transparent and useful information to management, investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating and assessing the Company’s primary operating results after removing the impact of unusual, non-operational or restructuring or transaction related activities that affect comparability. Operating income and gross profit, excluding special items, are two measures management uses for planning and budgeting, monitoring and evaluating financial and operating results, and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends.\nNet Income, Earnings per Share and Effective Income Tax Rate, Excluding Special Items\nNet income, earnings per share, and the effective income tax rate, excluding special items, are metrics provided to present the reader with the after-tax impact of operating income, excluding special items, in order to improve the comparability and understanding of the related GAAP measures. Net income, earnings per share, and the effective income tax rate, excluding special items, provide transparent and useful information to management, investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating and assessing our primary operating results after removing the impact of unusual, non-operational or restructuring or transaction related activities that affect comparability. Net income, earnings per share, and the effective income tax rate, excluding special items, are measures management uses for planning and budgeting, monitoring and evaluating financial and operating results.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nSnyder’s-Lance defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), further adjusted to exclude restructuring or transaction related expenses, and other non-cash or non-operating items as well as any other unusual items that impact the comparability of our financial information.\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA as a key metric in the evaluation of underlying Company performance, in making financial, operating and planning decisions. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it increases transparency and assists investors in understanding the underlying performance of the Company and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. Additionally, Snyder’s-Lance believes adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present an adjusted EBITDA measure when reporting their results. The Company has historically reported adjusted EBITDA to analysts and investors and believes that its continued inclusion provides consistency in financial reporting and enables analysts and investors to perform meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. While EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.\nCautionary Information about Forward Looking Statements\nIn this press release, we make statements which may be forward-looking within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which represent our current judgment about possible future events. The statements include projections regarding future revenues, earnings and other results.
