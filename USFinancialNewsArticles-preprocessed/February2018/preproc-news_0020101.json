    "text": "RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRSN), a global leader in domain names and internet security, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nFourth Quarter GAAP Financial Results\nVeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Verisign”) reported revenue of $296 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 3.2 percent from the same quarter in 2016. Verisign reported net income of $103 million and diluted earnings per share (diluted “EPS”) of $0.83 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $106 million and diluted EPS of $0.84 for the same quarter in 2016. The operating margin was 59.7 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 59.0 percent for the same quarter in 2016.\nFourth Quarter Non-GAAP Financial Results\nVerisign reported, on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $119 million and diluted EPS of $0.96 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $115 million and diluted EPS of $0.92 for the same quarter in 2016. The non-GAAP operating margin was 64.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 63.9 percent for the same quarter in 2016. A table reconciling the GAAP to the non-GAAP results (which excludes items described below) is appended to this release.\n2017 GAAP Financial Results\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, Verisign reported revenue of $1.17 billion, up 2.0 percent from $1.14 billion in 2016. Verisign reported net income of $457 million and diluted EPS of $3.68 in 2017, compared to net income of $441 million and diluted EPS of $3.42 in 2016. The operating margin for 2017 was 60.7 percent compared to 60.1 percent in 2016.\n2017 Non-GAAP Financial Results\nVerisign reported, on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $492 million and diluted EPS of $3.96 for 2017, compared to net income of $465 million and diluted EPS of $3.61 for 2016. The non-GAAP operating margin for 2017 was 65.3 percent compared to 64.5 percent for 2016.\nImpact of Tax Legislation\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted on Dec. 22, 2017. Fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP financial results include a net $9 million tax expense increase resulting from the Tax Act. This increase is comprised of a provisional income tax expense of $196 million consisting of one-time U.S. taxes on accumulated foreign earnings triggered by the Tax Act and related foreign withholding taxes, both net of resulting previously unrecognized foreign tax credits, offset by an income tax benefit of $187 million resulting from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities from 35 percent to the 21 percent U.S. federal income tax rate in the Tax Act. The provisional income tax expense on accumulated foreign earnings reflects our current best estimate, which may be adjusted over the course of 2018. By early second quarter of 2018, Verisign intends to repatriate approximately $1.1 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries, net of withholding taxes, based on current exchange rates.\n“2017 was another solid year for Verisign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues; we generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders; and we renewed the .net registry agreement for another six years, until 2023. We protected, grew and managed the business in 2017,” said Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nFinancial Highlights\nVerisign ended 2017 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.4 billion, an increase of $617 million from year-end 2016. Cash flow from operations was $199 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $703 million for the full year 2017 compared with $205 million for the same quarter in 2016 and $693 million for the full year 2016. Deferred revenues on Dec. 31, 2017, totaled $999 million, an increase of $24 million from year-end 2016. During the fourth quarter, Verisign repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for $145 million. During the full year 2017, Verisign repurchased 6.3 million shares of its common stock for $593 million. Effective Feb. 8, 2018, the Board of directors approved an additional authorization for share repurchases of approximately $586 million of common stock, which brings the total amount to $1.0 billion authorized and available under Verisign’s share repurchase program, which has no expiration. For purposes of calculating diluted EPS, the fourth quarter diluted share count included 25.2 million shares related to subordinated convertible debentures, compared with 20.6 million shares for the same quarter in 2016. These represent diluted shares and not shares that have been issued.\nBusiness Highlights\nVerisign ended the fourth quarter with 146.4 million .com and .net domain name registrations in the domain name base, a 2.9 percent increase from the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, and a net increase of 0.57 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter, Verisign processed 9.0 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net, as compared to 8.8 million for the same quarter in 2016. The final .com and .net renewal rate for the third quarter of 2017 was 74.4 percent compared with 73.0 percent for the same quarter in 2016. Renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA\nVerisign provides quarterly and annual financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Along with this information, management typically discloses and discusses certain non-GAAP financial information in quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls and during investor conferences and related events. This non-GAAP financial information does not include the following types of financial measures that are included in GAAP: stock-based compensation, unrealized gain/loss on the contingent interest derivative on the subordinated convertible debentures, and non-cash interest expense. Non-GAAP net income is decreased by amounts accrued, if any, during the period for contingent interest payable resulting from upside or downside triggers related to the subordinated convertible debentures and is adjusted for an income tax rate of 25 starting from the second quarter of 2017, and 26 percent for other periods presented herein, both of which differ from the GAAP income tax rate.\nOn a quarterly basis, Verisign also provides Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in accordance with the terms of the indentures governing Verisign’s senior notes. Adjusted EBITDA refers to net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, unrealized gain / loss on the contingent interest derivative on the subordinated convertible debentures and unrealized gain / loss on hedging agreements and gain on the sale of a business.\nManagement believes that this non-GAAP financial data supplements the GAAP financial data by providing investors with additional information that allows them to have a clearer picture of Verisign’s operations and financial performance and the comparability of Verisign’s operating results from period to period. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe tables appended to this release include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial information to the comparable financial information reported in accordance with GAAP for the given periods.\nToday’s Conference Call\nVerisign will host a live conference call today at 4:30 p.m. (EST) to review the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. The call will be accessible by direct dial at (888) 676-VRSN (U.S.) or (323) 794-2149 (international), conference ID: Verisign.
