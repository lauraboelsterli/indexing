    "text": "DOHA, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Qatar’s central bank has warned banks and other financial institutions not to trade in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, according to financial sources and a circular seen by Reuters.\nThe central bank said it “politely requested banks and exchange houses in the country not to deal in any way with this currency, or exchange it with another currency, or open accounts to deal with it, or send or receive any money transfers for the purpose of buying or selling this currency.”\nThe central bank will impose penalties under existing legislation in the event of any violation of the circular, it added.
