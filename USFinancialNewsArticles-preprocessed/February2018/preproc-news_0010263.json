He was 12 of 14 from the foul line.\nThompson Jr. made a layup with 5.9 seconds remaining to trim the deficit to 73-70 before Sueing made one of two free throws to ice it.\nThe Bears, who trailed by 10 points in the first half, took a 41-30 lead early in the second half on a McNeill 3-pointer before the Beavers chipped away, taking a 57-56 lead on Seth Berger’s tip-in with 6:47 remaining\nMcNeill hit a 3-pointer on the Bears’ next possession, and Cal never trailed again.\nTinkle, who also had four rebounds, was 10-of-10 from the free throw line in a foul-littered game. Tinkle has scored in double figures in 25 straight games.\nThe teams were called for 51 personal fouls, 29 on Oregon State.\nThe Beavers made 21-of-28 free throws. Cal was 29-of-39.\nLee had six points and McNeill had four on Cal’s 14-0 run over a five-minute span late in the first half for a 32-24 lead. Nick Hamilton’s 3-pointer gave Cal its first lead at 26-24 in that stretch.\nThe Beavers had one field goal in the final 8:10 of the first half as the Bears took their first halftime lead in conference play at 36-28.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
