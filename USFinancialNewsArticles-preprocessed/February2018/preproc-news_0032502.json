Dauch. \"We achieved another year of record sales and profitability while increasing our scale and accelerating business diversification through the acquisition of MPG. As we look ahead to 2018, we expect another year of outstanding financial results, further integration and synergy attainment and exceptional support of our customers on numerous product launches.\"\nAAM's fourth quarter and full year 2017 results reflect the impact of the acquisition of Metaldyne Performance Group Inc. (MPG) that was completed on April 6, 2017.\nAAM's sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $1.73 billion as compared to $946.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. AAM's sales for full year 2017 increased to a record $6.27 billion as compared to $3.95 billion for full year 2016. Non-GM sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.01 billion as compared to $323.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GM sales for full year 2017 were a record of $3.33 billion as compared to $1.29 billion for full year of 2016.\nAAM's net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $106.3 million, or $0.93 per share. This compares to net income of $46.9 million, or $0.59 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. For full year 2017, AAM's net income was $337.1 million, or $3.21 per share. This compares to net income of $240.7 million, or $3.06 per share for full year 2016.\nAAM defines Adjusted earnings per share to be diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs, debt refinancing and redemption costs, and non-recurring items, including the tax effect thereon. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.89 compared to $0.78 in the fourth quarter of 2016. For full year 2017, AAM's Adjusted earnings per share was $3.75 compared to $3.30 in 2016.\nAAM defines EBITDA to be earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs, debt refinancing and redemption costs, and non-recurring items. In the fourth quarter of 2017, AAM's Adjusted EBITDA was $295.7 million, or 17.1% of sales, as compared to $148.2 million, or 15.7% of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2016. For full year 2017, AAM's Adjusted EBITDA was $1,102.7 million, or 17.6% of sales, as compared to $619.4 million, or 15.7% of sales, for full year 2016.\nAAM defines free cash flow to be net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures net of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and government grants. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow excluding the impact of cash payments for restructuring and acquisition-related costs, settlements of pre-existing accounts payable balances with acquired entities, and interest payments upon the settlement of acquired company debt. AAM's Adjusted free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $50.9 million as compared to $62.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. AAM's Adjusted free cash flow for full year 2017 was $340.9 million as compared to $198.6 million for full year 2016.\nAAM's Full Year 2018 Outlook\nAAM is confirming its full year 2018 financial outlook:\nAAM is targeting sales of approximately $7 billion in 2018. This sales projection is based on the anticipated launch schedule of programs in AAM's new and incremental business backlog and the assumption that the U.S. Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate of sales (\"SAAR\") will be in the range of 16.8 million to 17 million light vehicle units in 2018. AAM is targeting an Adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 17.5% to 18.0% of sales in 2018. AAM is targeting Adjusted free cash flow of approximately 5% of sales in 2018.\nFourth Quarter and Full-year 2017 Conference Call Information\nA conference call to review AAM's fourth quarter and full year 2017 results is scheduled today at 10:00 a.m. ET. Interested participants may listen to the live conference call by logging onto AAM's investor web site at http://investor.aam.com or calling (855) 681-2072 from the United States or (973) 200-3383 from outside the United States. A replay will be available from 1:00 p.m. ET on February 16, 2018 until 11:59 p.m. ET February 23, 2018 by dialing (855) 859-2056 from the United States or (404) 537-3406 from outside the United States. When prompted, callers should enter conference reservation number 87956027.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) included within this press release, AAM has provided certain information, which includes non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted earnings per share and Adjusted free cash flow. Such information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is included in the attached supplemental data.\nCertain of the forward-looking financial measures included in this earnings release are provided on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward-looking financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is not practical given the difficulty of projecting event driven transactional and other non-core operating items in future periods. The magnitude of these items, however, may be significant.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to management, investors, and banking institutions in their analysis of the Company's business and operating performance. Management also uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not and should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by AAM may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nCompany Description\nAAM is a premier, global leader in design, engineering, validation and manufacturing of driveline, metal forming, powertrain, and casting products for automotive, commercial and industrial markets.\nHeadquartered in Detroit, AAM has over 25,000 associates operating at more than 90 facilities in 17 countries to support our customers on global and regional platforms with a focus on quality, operational excellence and technology leadership.
