    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as sales slumped in its international refining business, sending shares down nearly 2 percent.\nThe miss in profit comes the same day that rival Exxon Mobil Corp reported lower-than-estimated earnings, also due to trouble in its refining arm, fueling concerns a weak spot could be emerging in the industry just as oil prices rise.\nChevron posted fourth-quarter net income of $3.1 billion, or $1.64 per share, compared with $415 million, or 22 cents per share, a year ago. Chevron recorded a $2 billion noncash benefit in the period related to the recent U.S. tax overhaul.\nExcluding the tax change and other one-time items, Chevron earned 72 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nProduction rose 3 percent to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Its international refining division recorded a 77 percent drop in profit due to lower margins on gasoline and other products.\nMike Wirth became Chevronâ€™s chairman and chief executive officer on Thursday, replacing the retiring John Watson.\nThe company is slated to hold a conference call with investors on Friday morning.\nChevron boosted its quarterly dividend this week by 4 percent.\nShares fell 1.8 percent to $123.25 in early trading.\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ",
