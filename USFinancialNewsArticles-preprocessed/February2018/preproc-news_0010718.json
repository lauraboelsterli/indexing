    "text": "SAN DIEGO (AP) â€” The Navy's newest warship has been commissioned in San Diego.\nGuests including Nebraska billionaire Warren Buffett were on hand Saturday as the USS Omaha was officially crewed at its new home port.\nBuffett's daughter, Susie Buffett, gave the traditional order: \"Man our ship and bring her to life.\"\nU.S. Navy Secretary Richard Spencer also attended.\nThe $440 million Omaha is a littoral combat ship designed for combat operations close to shore.\nThe 218-foot-long vessel has an aluminum skin, high-tech computer capabilities and can reach a speed of 40 knots.\nThe ship is the fourth to carry the Omaha name since 1869. The last vessel was an attack submarine that was decommissioned in 1995.",
