Additionally, people with type 2 diabetes are two to four times more likely to have cardiovascular disease than those without diabetes. 4 Type 2 diabetes is a life-long condition once diagnosed, but can be managed through a combination of lifestyle modifications like eating healthy, physical activity and oral and/or injectable medications as prescribed by a physician. 5\nAbout Novo Nordisk\nNovo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with more than 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care.
