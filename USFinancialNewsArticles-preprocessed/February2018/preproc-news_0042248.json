The contest supports the Foundation's mission to treat and cure pediatric cancer. The winner will present his or her idea to more than 3,000 attendees from across the globe at the conference on April 23, 2018 at Lincoln Center in New York City.\nSponsored by GLG (Gerson Lehrman Group), the world's leading professional membership for on-demand, one-on-one learning, the contest will kick off on March 13, 2018 and is open to any individual with an investment idea for a marketable security (long or short) with a market capitalization above $1 billion. The submission deadline is 12 p.m. EST on April 5, 2018. A panel of the world's most elite investors, chaired by Larry Robbins and including William Ackman, Joel Greenblatt, David Einhorn and Seth Klarman will select the winner based on the judges' determination of the most compelling investment thesis with a one-year horizon.\n\"The Sohn Investment Idea Contest is the only platform of its kind,\" said Lance Laifer, co-founder of the Sohn Conference Foundation. \"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for both professionals and students, regardless of industry, to present their idea on the Sohn stage alongside the most esteemed investors. We look forward to receiving this year's submissions and reviewing these fresh perspectives on the market.\"\nThe conference is famous for featuring a number of prominent investors, including Larry Robbins, Founder, Portfolio Manager and CEO, Glenview Capital Management LLC. Robbins is a longtime speaker at the conference. At the 2017 Sohn Conference, Robbins surprised attendees by announcing on stage that he was donating $1 million to the Foundation in his father's memory. His generous donation funded The Sheldon Robbins Adolescent and Young Adult Clinical Trials Initiative, which will provide unprecedented access to innovative precision medicine by linking pediatric patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to new drug therapies.\n\"The Sohn Investment Idea Contest winner's presentation always brings an exciting new perspective to the conference's elite roster of speakers,\" said Larry Robbins. \"The contest not only provides an unparalleled opportunity for anyone with an investment idea, but also supports the Foundation's mission to treat and cure pediatric cancer, which our firm is proud to have supported for the past 15 years.\"\n\"GLG has been committed to accelerating medical breakthroughs by connecting professionals to expertise since our very first projects nearly 20 years ago,\" said GLG CEO Alexander Saint-Amand. \"We are long-time supporters of Sohn, and we are proud to continue to support the Sohn Investment Idea Contest and the Sohn Conference Foundation's lifesaving efforts in the fight against cancer.\"\nDylan Adelman, an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania – The Wharton School, won last year's idea contest in New York, beating hundreds of others, including professionals. Adelman pitched a long bet on eBay, stating the stock is undervalued due to a misunderstood relationship between eBay and its merchant of record, PayPal.\nFor more details or to enter the contest, please visit www.sohnconference.org/contest .
