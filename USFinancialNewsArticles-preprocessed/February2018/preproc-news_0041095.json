It cut then missed its own guidance in 2017 and cancelled its annual dividend while mulling asset sales to pay debts.\nUnderlying net profit after tax for the 6 months to Dec. 31 fell 25 percent to A$68.6 million.\nIt lowered guidance that it had re-affirmed in October, cutting expected annual underlying net profit to between A$125 million to A$135 million, from a range of A$140 million to A$150 million.\nFewer-than-expected customers signed on to its retail gas and electricity business. It restated average NBN margin-per-customer figures from a year ago, revising them downward by roughly a fifth and expecting them to be much lower than copper-wire margins in the future.\n“It’s a bit of a mea culpa in terms of our previous reporting,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Wratten said, explaining the company had not been using consistent methodology to calculate the numbers.\n“There’s no industry standard in regards to that, that I’ve been able to find.”\nThe company said it expected to sell its New Zealand business by June. The business reported A$182.6 million in revenue for the half. ($1 = 1.2641 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Tom Westbrook in Sydney.
