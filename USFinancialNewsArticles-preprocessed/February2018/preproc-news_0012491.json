We are in a dialogue stage. It is not a formal process with a list of questions and answers. We will accept anybody who wants to talk to us.” \nUnlike some other sports organisations there is no official rotation system by region for the Olympics. \nSwitzerland’s Sion and Stockholm have also expressed interest in the Games as well as cities from Austria and the United States and Canada among others. \nAfter a newly-introduced dialogue phase the IOC session in October will invite specific candidates to bid, with a decision to be taken in 2019. \nThe bid process has been overhauled after a string of cities pulled out in previous bids, fearful of the Games’ cost, size and environmental impact.
