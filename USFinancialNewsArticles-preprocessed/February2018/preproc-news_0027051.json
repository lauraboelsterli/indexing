People want to see if it would confirm the recent trend of strong inflation and strong growth.\" Economists expect a 0.3 percent rise in inflation in January and a core figure of 0.2 percent, according to a Reuters poll. Investors started to worry more about inflation after a prolonged period of stagnant price gains, spooked by robust wage increases of 2.9 percent in the January U.S. jobs report, and its impact on borrowing costs. That caused sharp volatility in the stock market. U.S. 10-year yields, which move inversely to prices, have risen about 43 basis points so far this year. U.S. 30-year yields are on similar path, climbing 38 basis points in 2018. Part of the run-up, however, was not all due to events in the United States, analysts said. TD's Goldberg said global central banks such as the European Central Bank and Bank of England have started to normalize their monetary policies, pushing yields higher. That has spilled over to the U.S. Treasury market. \"There is a global re-pricing of the quantitative easing trade,\" Goldberg said. In late-morning trading, U.S. 10-year yields fell to 2.842 percent from 2.855 percent late on Monday. U.S. 10-year yields hit 2.902 percent on Monday, the highest since January 2014. U.S. 30-year bond yields fell to 3.129 percent, from Monday's 3.136 percent. The yield on the maturity touched an 11-month peak of 3.139 percent on Monday.
