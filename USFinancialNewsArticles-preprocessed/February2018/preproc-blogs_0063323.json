    "text": "Published: Feb 27, 2018 8:48 a.m. ET Share \nPresident to hand reins to former schoolmate, party loyalist Liu He Reuters Liu He is expected to be named vice premier in charge of a wide swath of the economy—the financial system and the industrial sector—at the annual meeting of China’s legislature that starts next week. \nBy Lingling Wei \nBEIJING—In his first term, President Xi Jinping took control of China’s economy. In the second, he is putting in charge a trusted ally he has known since middle school. \nProposed constitutional changes, made public Sunday, that would allow Mr. Xi to stay in power indefinitely would also shift more influence to his inner circle. Few are more central than Mr. Xi’s behind-the-scenes economic steward, Liu He, who will be named vice premier in charge of a wide swath of the economy—the financial system and the industrial sector—at the annual meeting of China’s legislature that starts next week, according to officials involved in policy-making. \nLiu’s broad remit will include oversight of regulators including the central bank. “He will be the superregulator,” said a senior official close to the leadership. \nBut first, Liu is going to Washington . Part of his mission on the trip, which starts Tuesday, is to get the Trump administration to restart trade talks with Beijing, according to people familiar with the matter. \nAt home, Liu, 66 years old, will face the challenge of shaking up the country’s financial sector while keeping Beijing’s pledge to invite in more foreign capital. At stake is the long-term health of the Chinese economy. Xi has set a goal of having financial risks under control within three years.",
