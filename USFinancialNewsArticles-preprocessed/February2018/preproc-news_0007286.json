    "text": "* Sets Frankfurt stock market listing for Feb. 15\n* To sell 7 mln new shares, 13.35 mln existing shares\n* Sets placement price at 21.50-25.50 euros per share\n* To have market cap of 795-943 mln euros (Adds free float, plans for proceeds, CEO comment)\nFRANKFURT, Feb 2 (Reuters) - German residential property developer Instone Real Estate Group has set its flotation on the Frankfurt stock exchange for February 15 and said it could reach a market value of almost 950 million euros ($1.2 billion).\nThe placement will be Germany’s second stock market listing of 2018, which is expected to be a blockbuster year for initial public offerings (IPOs). Drugmaker Dermapharm plans to list on February 9.\nThe placement will comprise 7 million new shares from a capital increase and 13.35 million shares from fund holdings by ActivumSG Capital Management at a price of 21.50 to 25.50 euros each, the company said on Friday.\nUp to 3.05 million shares from ActivumSG have also been earmarked for over-allotments.\nThat will give the company a market capitalisation of between 795 million euros and 943 million euros, Instone said.\nSome 55 percent of shares in Instone will be freely traded following the listing, a spokesman said, rising to 63 percent if the over-allotment option is fully used.\nInstone said it plans to use around 55 million euros of the net proceeds from the placement of new shares to repay a shareholder loan and the remainder will go toward the acquisition and development of new residential projects.\n“With expected around 100 million euros in net proceeds at the mid-point of the price range, we will be able to acquire new land plots and work towards reaching our target sales volume of 900 million euros to 1 billion euros by 2021,” Instone Chief Executive Kruno Crepulja said in a statement.\nDeutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are organising the flotation with the help of Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas and Unicredit.\nInstone was formed by a merger of peer GRK and Formart, part of German builder Hochtief, which specialist real estate investor Activum bought in 2014 for about 300 million euros.
