    "text": "MIRAMAR, Fla., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nGAAP net income for the fourth quarter 2017 was $250.3 million ($3.63 per diluted share). GAAP net income for the fourth quarter 2017 included a one-time non-cash $199.3 million tax credit 1 . Excluding the one-time tax credit and special items 2 , net income for the fourth quarter 2017 was $50.4 million ($0.73 per diluted share) 3 .\nGAAP net income for the full year 2017 was $420.6 million ($6.06 per diluted share) which included the one-time tax credit 1 . Excluding the one-time tax credit and special items 2 , net income for the full year 2017 was $230.8 million ($3.33 per diluted share) 3 .\nGAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter 2017 was 13.9 percent, or 13.4 percent excluding special items 2 .\nGAAP operating margin for the full year 2017 was 14.7 percent, or 15.2 percent excluding special items 2 .\nSpirit ended 2017 with unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $901.8 million.\n“I want to thank the Spirit family for their contributions throughout 2017. Together, we overcame several major operational challenges while still delivering a record on-time performance,\" said Robert Fornaro, Spirit’s Chief Executive Officer. “Looking ahead to 2018, we are focused on finalizing a deal with our pilots union, improving upon our operational reliability, continuing to enhance our guest experience, and delivering earnings growth for our shareholders.”\nRevenue Performance\nFor the fourth quarter 2017, Spirit's total operating revenue was $667.0 million, an increase of 15.3 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2016, driven by a 10.4 percent increase in flight volume.\nTotal revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) for the fourth quarter 2017 decreased 1.8 percent compared to the same period last year, driven by a 2.2 percent decrease in operating yields.\nOn a per passenger flight segment basis, total revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 increased 1.1 percent year over year to $109.34 driven by non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment increasing 3.8 percent to $53.91, partially offset by ticket revenue per passenger flight segment decreasing 1.4 percent to $55.43.\nCost Performance\nFor the fourth quarter 2017, total GAAP operating expense, including special items credit of $3.0 million 2 , increased 16.5 percent, or $81.4 million, year over year to $574.5 million. Adjusted operating expense for the fourth quarter 2017 increased 19.2 percent, or $93.1 million to $577.5 million 4 . The year-over-year increase in both GAAP and adjusted operating expense was primarily driven by an increase in flight volume; higher other operating expense, partially driven by increased ground handling rates; higher depreciation and amortization expense; and higher fuel rates.\nAircraft fuel expense increased in the fourth quarter 2017 by 38.5 percent, or $48.7 million, compared to the same period last year, due to a 20.1 percent increase in the cost of fuel per gallon and a 15.5 percent increase in fuel gallons consumed.\nSpirit reported fourth quarter 2017 cost per available seat mile (\"ASM\"), excluding special items and fuel (“Adjusted CASM ex-fuel”), of 5.20 cents 4 , a decrease of 4.4 percent compared to the same period last year. The decrease year over year was primarily driven by lower aircraft rent and salaries, wages, and benefits per ASM, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization per ASM.\n“For the full year 2017, our team delivered an adjusted CASM ex-fuel of 5.51 cents, up 1.1 percent year over year. This was an admirable performance considering the hurricanes and other disruptions this year,” said Ted Christie, Spirit’s President and Chief Financial Officer. “Should the tentative agreement with our pilots be ratified, we will gain tools that will allow us to further improve our operational reliability and drive efficiencies, which gives us confidence that we will be able to maintain or grow our relative cost advantage.”\nLabor\nSpirit and its pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, reached a tentative agreement in January 2018 with the assistance of the National Mediation Board. The tentative agreement is subject to ratification.\nFleet\nSpirit took delivery of four new A321ceo aircraft and two new A320ceo aircraft and returned one leased A321ceo aircraft during the fourth quarter 2017, ending the quarter with 112 aircraft in its fleet.\nShare Repurchase\nDuring the fourth quarter and full year 2017, Spirit returned approximately $45 million to shareholders by repurchasing 1.2 million shares under our share repurchase program.\nRecent New Service Announcements\nColumbus, Ohio - Orlando (02/15/2018)\nColumbus, Ohio - Fort Lauderdale (02/15/2018)\nColumbus, Ohio - Las Vegas (02/15/2018)\nColumbus, Ohio - Fort Myers (02/15/2018)**\nColumbus, Ohio - Tampa (02/16/2018 )**\nRichmond - Orlando (03/15/2018)\nRichmond - Fort Lauderdale (03/15/2018)\nBaltimore - Montego Bay (03/22/2018)\nBaltimore - Denver (03/22/2018)\nColumbus, Ohio - New Orleans (03/22/2018)*\nFort Lauderdale - Guayaquil, Ecuador (03/22/2018)\nColumbus, Ohio - Myrtle Beach (03/23/2018)*\nFort Lauderdale - Cap-Haïtien, Haiti (04/12/2018)\nFort Lauderdale - Seattle (04/12/2018)*\nMinneapolis - Myrtle Beach (04/12/2018)*\nOrlando - Las Vegas (04/12/2018)\nTampa - Los Angeles (04/12/2018)\nTampa - Las Vegas (04/12/2018)\nSeattle - Chicago (04/12/2018)*\nSeattle - Dallas/Ft.

Because of these limitations, determinations of the Company's operating performance excluding unrealized gains and losses or special items should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nSpecial Items (unaudited) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating special items include the following: Supplemental rent credit (1) (4,086 ) — (4,086 ) — Loss on disposal of assets 1,054 3,021 4,168 4,187 Special charges — 5,580 12,629 37,189 Total operating special items $ (3,032 ) $ 8,601 $ 12,711 $ 41,376\nReconciliation of Adjusted Operating Expense to GAAP Operating Expense (unaudited) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, (in thousands, except CASM data in cents) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total operating expenses, as reported $ 574,461 $ 493,040 $ 2,258,875 $ 1,878,295 Less operating special items (1) (3,032 ) 8,601 12,711 41,376 Adjusted operating expenses, non-GAAP (2) 577,493 484,439 2,246,164 1,836,919 Less: Economic fuel expense 175,205 126,535 615,581 447,553 Adjusted operating expenses excluding fuel, non-GAAP (3) $ 402,288 $ 357,904 $ 1,630,583 $ 1,389,366 Available seat miles 7,741,030 6,585,018 29,592,819 25,494,645 CASM (cents) 7.42 7.49 7.63 7.37 Adjusted CASM (cents) (2) 7.46 7.36 7.59 7.21 Adjusted CASM ex-fuel (cents) (3) 5.20 5.44 5.51 5.45 (1) Supplemental rent adjustment for liability accrued in prior years related to certain maintenance reserves and return conditions that are no longer probable.\n(2) Excludes operating special items.\n(3) Excludes operating special items and economic fuel expense.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Pre-Tax Income, and Adjusted Operating Income to GAAP Net Income (unaudited) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, (in thousands, except per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income, as reported $ 250,338 $ 48,493 $ 420,606 $ 264,879 Add: Provision (benefit) for income taxes (167,344 ) 29,214 (66,954 ) 154,581 Income before income taxes, as reported 82,994 77,707 353,652 419,460 Pre-tax margin 12.4 % 13.4 % 13.4 % 18.1 % Add operating special items (1) $ (3,032 ) $ 8,601 $ 12,711 $ 41,376 Adjusted income before income taxes, non-GAAP (2) 79,962 86,308 366,363 460,836 Adjusted pre-tax margin, non-GAAP (2) 12.0 % 14.9 % 13.8 % 19.8 % Add: Total other (income) expense 9,552 7,604 35,139 24,201 Adjusted operating income, non-GAAP(2) 89,514 93,912 401,502 485,037 Adjusted operating margin, non-GAAP(2) 13.4 % 16.2 % 15.2 % 20.9 % Provision for adjusted income taxes 29,586 32,448 135,554 169,829 Adjusted net income, non-GAAP (2) $ 50,376 $ 53,860 $ 230,809 $ 291,007 Weighted average shares, diluted 68,901 69,551 69,377 70,508 Adjusted net income per share, diluted (2) $ 0.73 $ 0.77 $ 3.33 $ 4.13 Total operating revenues $ 667,007 $ 578,351 $ 2,647,666 $ 2,321,956 (1) See \"Special Items\" for more details.\n(2) Excludes operating special items.\nThe Company tracks a non-GAAP calculation of Return on Invested Capital \"ROIC\", as a way of measuring our efficiency in delivering returns and in allocating capital. We calculate ROIC as Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP), divided by Total Invested Capital (non-GAAP), on a pre-tax and after-tax basis, expressed as a percentage.\nBecause a substantial portion of our aircraft fleet is held under operating leases, which do not appear on the balance sheet, a GAAP-based calculation of our total capital deployed may be considered understated (which would have the effect of overstating ROIC, if calculated solely using GAAP line items). Accordingly, we adjust our total capital, the denominator of the ROIC measurement, by capitalizing operating leases at a multiple of seven times our aircraft rent expense, a measure used commonly in the airline industry and by analysts.\nTo calculate Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP), we add back aircraft rent to GAAP operating income, consistent with the adjustment to total capital discussed above. In order to remove the effects of non-recurring gains and losses that may affect GAAP operating income, we also exclude special items from Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP). We present Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP) on a pre-tax basis and present Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP) on an after-tax basis, using our effective tax rate for the period.\nCalculation of Return on Invested Capital, non-GAAP (unaudited) Twelve Months Ended (in thousands) December 31, 2017 Operating income $ 388,791 Add operating special items (1) 12,711 Adjustment for aircraft rent 205,852 Adjusted operating income, non-GAAP 607,354 Tax (37%) 224,721 Adjusted operating income, after-tax, non-GAAP $ 382,633 Invested capital: Total debt $ 1,502,928 Book equity 1,777,081 Less: Unrestricted cash, cash equivalents & short-term investments 901,786 Add: Capitalized aircraft operating leases (7x Aircraft Rent) 1,440,964 Total invested capital, non-GAAP $ 3,819,187 Return on invested capital (ROIC), pre-tax, non-GAAP 15.9 % Return on invested capital (ROIC), after-tax, non-GAAP 10.0 % (1) See \"Special Items\" for more details.\nInvestor Relations Contact :\nDeAnne Gabel\nInvestorRelations@spirit.com\n(954) 447-7920\nMedia Contact:\nStephen Schuler\nStephen.Schuler@spirit.com\n(954) 364-0231\nSource:Spirit Airlines, Inc.",
