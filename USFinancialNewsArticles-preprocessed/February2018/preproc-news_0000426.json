    "text": "DAKAR (Reuters) - Education is the sole response to the global rise of religious and political extremism, French President Emmanuel Macron told a conference in Senegal on Friday where he pledged 200 million euros ($248 million) to support an international education fund. \nMacron was attending a financing conference of the Global Partnership for Education, which seeks to ensure access to classrooms for 870 million children in 65 developing countries. \n“The risk of terrorism that we have lived through ... that convinces children that their future is war ... the risk of seeing actual human bombs continue to deploy in our societies, there’s only one answer,” he said. \nFrance has been a target of militant violence, including attacks in Paris in 2015 that killed more than 130 people, and is engaged in the fight against Islamist fighters in Africa. \nIt has deployed troops as part of a regional operation in West Africa’s arid Sahel band. Paris is also supporting a new multinational force created by regional governments to take on Islamist groups, some of whom are linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, operating in the area. \n\n(From L) Chad's President Idriss Deby Itno, French President Emmanuel Macron and Senegalese president Macky Sall attend the \"GPE Financing Conference, an Investment in the Future\" organised by the Global Partnership for Education in Dakar, Senegal, February 2, 2018.

Retreat. Hatred of others. A revival of nationalism and everything we have survived and thought we’d vanquished during the 20th century,” he said. \nThe Partnership is seeking $3.1 billion in financing to fund its activities over the coming three years. \nReporting by and Sofia Christensen; Additional reporting and writing by Joe Bavier; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ",
