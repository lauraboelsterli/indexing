Preliminary and unaudited revenue for fourth quarter 2017 is expected to be $15.5 million, or approximately 17% growth compared to the same period in 2016. Cogentix Medical also expects similar top line growth in fiscal year 2018 as it achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPreliminary and unaudited full-year 2017 revenue is expected to be $56.3 million, reflecting growth of approximately 9% over full-year 2016.

The center is based in Israel and will focus on developing next generation products that enhance the company's ability to transform the practice of urology.
