    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ICIX —a longtime leader helping retailers and consumer goods manufacturers ensure product safety in their supply chains—is pleased to announce that its founder, Matt Smith, has joined the Board of Directors of the nonprofit International Consumer Product Health and Safety Organization (ICPHSO).\n\"It's an honor to join the Board and be part of such a world-class, influential organization,\" says Smith. \"We've come a long way in 25 years, and product safety and compliance are now a central part of many companies' efforts to earn and retain consumer trust in the safety of the products they buy. That wasn't always the case when I started working in this field.\"\nSmith—who now serves as Chief Strategy Officer at ICIX—founded the company in 2004, and the company now hosts a network of more than 48,000 companies on the ICIX cloud platform, which automates much of the work of tracking product tests, certifications and other compliance information. By streamlining compliance and trading partner collaboration, making it easy to identify and handle exceptions when they arise, ICIX reduces the risk of unsafe products, promotes consumer trust and boosts efficiency.\nSmith will lead an expert panel discussion on the changing roles of chief compliance officers (CCOs) and other safety professionals, titled \"From Silenced to Strategic: What the Last 25 Years Tell Us About What Lies Ahead.\" Smith's panel will draw upon the deep expertise of former Commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) Joe Mohorovic; Lisa Bate, Chief Executive of Bureau Veritas; and Jay Howell, Walmart's Senior Director of Product Safety and Compliance. It is scheduled for 8:15 a.m. on Friday, February 23 at the ICPHSO annual meeting and Silver Jubilee, held in the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress Hotel in Orlando, Florida.\nAbout ICIX\nICIX solutions help companies safeguard consumers, protect brands, and build trust - all while improving margins. Its applications and the ICIX retail cloud network bring unparalleled visibility and efficiency to the extended supply chain for product safety, compliance and corporate social responsibility. ICIX helps the retail industry's leading companies collaborate across trading partner networks to achieve Active Transparency™. More than 48,000 businesses are active members of the ICIX network, including leading retailers and manufacturers, their trading partners, and more than 50 testing, inspection and certification companies.\nFor more information about the company and its portfolio of products, visit www.icix.com .\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/icix-founder-matt-smith-joins-icphso-board-leads-panel-at-icphso-silver-jubilee-300600857.html\nSOURCE ICIX",
