    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Exterran Corporation (NYSE:EXTN) (“Exterran” or the “Company”) today announced net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $2.1 million, or $0.06 per share, on revenue of $337.7 million. This compares to net income from continuing operations of $1.2 million, or $0.03 per share, on revenue of $314.5 million for the third quarter of 2017 and net loss from continuing operations of $20.6 million, or $0.59 per share, on revenue of $200.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.7 million. This compares to net income of $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 and net loss of $26.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAndrew Way, Exterran’s President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “Our solid fourth quarter results capped what was an excellent year for Exterran. For the quarter, we experienced revenue growth across all three segments. Contract operations benefited from contractual recoveries on projects in Latin America. Aftermarket services experienced increased demand for services and part sales, primarily in Latin America. Our product sales segment continued the quarterly trend of improved revenue and gross margin percentages due to increasing productivity resulting from internal initiatives launched earlier in 2017, as well as an improved product mix.\n“During the quarter, we added more than $45 million combined of project extensions and new projects to our contract operations backlog. Also, as expected, fourth quarter 2017 product bookings of $113.0 million were lower than each of the prior three quarters as this was a transitory period for many customers who spent most of their midstream capital budgets in prior periods and took the opportunity to absorb new capacity into their operations. In total, we sold more than three billion standard cubic feet per day of gas processing capacity during 2017. Inquiries so far in 2018 would indicate a higher first quarter 2018 bookings than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“In 2017, we delivered solid financial performance, growth in new orders and backlog, improved liquidity and enhanced operational efficiencies during a period when many in our industry were still recovering from the multi-year decline in energy prices. Our financial performance combined with our ongoing focus on cash and working capital management allowed us to fund our operations and capital expenditures primarily through internally generated cash flows. Working capital as a percentage of revenue, excluding discontinued operations, improved to 10.5% in 2017 from 26.7% in 2016, a remarkable accomplishment in a period of growth and investment. This helped us achieve a cash balance of $49.1 million with long-term debt of $368.5 million as of December 31, 2017.”\nEBITDA, as adjusted, was $50.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared with EBITDA, as adjusted, of $44.8 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $31.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluded from EBITDA, as adjusted, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a pre-tax expense of $5.7 million in non-cash long-lived impairment charges primarily related to certain assets within our product sales business that we expect to sell or otherwise dispose of within the next twelve months. See table below for reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $44.5 million, or 13% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared with $42.9 million, or 14% of revenue in the third quarter of 2017 and $39.5 million, or 20% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAs part of the Company’s previously communicated strategic planning initiatives, in the first quarter of 2016 the Company announced its intent to exit the Belleli EPC business. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reached mechanical completion on all remaining contracts and as such has presented current and reclassified prior period financial results as discontinuing operations in its statements of operations. Furthermore, as part of the Company’s plan to optimize its business structure and the product and service solutions it offers to customers, in the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company classified certain assets within its product sales business line as assets held for sale in its balance sheet.\nThe Company’s provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a net provisional benefit of $5.6 million resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted into U.S. law on December 22, 2017, and a benefit of $3.1 million related to tax legislation enacted into law in Argentina in 2017.\nContract Operations Segment\nContract operations revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $95.3 million, a 3% increase from third quarter 2017 revenue of $92.6 million and a 2% increase from fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $93.9 million.\nContract operations gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $61.1 million, a 4% increase from third quarter 2017 gross margin of $58.9 million and relatively flat from fourth quarter 2016 gross margin of $61.2 million. Gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 64%, as compared with 64% in the third quarter of 2017 and 65% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe sequential revenue and gross margin increase were primarily due to renewals and contractual recoveries on existing projects, primarily in Latin America.\nAftermarket Services Segment\nAftermarket services revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $30.5 million, a 2% increase from third quarter 2017 revenue of $29.8 million and a 5% increase from fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $29.1 million.\nAftermarket services gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.1 million, a 2% increase from third quarter 2017 gross margin of $7.9 million and a 12% increase from fourth quarter 2016 gross margin of $7.2 million. Gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 26%, as compared with 26% in the third quarter of 2017 and 25% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe sequential increase in aftermarket services revenue and gross margin was primarily due to an increase in operations and maintenance services in Latin America.\nProduct Sales Segment\nProduct sales revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $211.9 million, a 10% increase from third quarter 2017 revenue of $192.1 million, and a 173% increase from fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $77.7 million.\nProduct sales gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $24.5 million, a 20% increase from third quarter 2017 gross margin of $20.5 million and an 891% increase from fourth quarter 2016 gross margin of $2.5 million. Gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 12% as compared with 11% in the third quarter of 2017 and 3% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe sequential increase in revenue and gross margin was primarily due to an increase in sales of processing and treating plants and compression equipment, primarily in North America. The sequential gross margin percentage was higher due to productivity and product mix.\nProduct sales backlog was $461.0 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $559.9 million at September 30, 2017 and $306.2 million at December 31, 2016. Product sales bookings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $113.0 million, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 53%. This compares to bookings of $245.5 million for the third quarter of 2017 and bookings of $230.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call at 10 a.m. Central Time on Tuesday, February 27, 2018.

performance of each of the Company’s segments based on gross margin. Total gross margin, a non-GAAP measure, is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary measure used by our management to evaluate the results of revenue and cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), which are key components of our operations. Management believes total gross margin is important supplemental information for investors because it focuses on the current performance of our operations and excludes the impact of the prior historical costs of the assets acquired or constructed that are utilized in those operations, the indirect costs associated with our SG&A activities, the impact of our financing methods, restatement related charges (recoveries), restructuring and other charges and income taxes. In addition, the inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense may not accurately reflect the costs required to maintain and replenish the operational usage of our assets and therefore may not portray the costs from current operating activity. (2) Management believes EBITDA, as adjusted, is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (interest expense from outstanding debt), asset base (depreciation and amortization), our subsidiaries’ capital structure (non-cash gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on intercompany obligations), tax consequences, impairment charges, restatement related charges (recoveries), restructuring and other charges, expensed acquisition costs and other items. Management uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as supplemental measures to review current period operating performance, comparability measures and performance measures for period to period comparisons. In addition, the Company's compensation committee has used EBITDA, as adjusted, in evaluating the performance of the Company and management and in evaluating certain components of executive compensation, including performance-based annual incentive programs. (3) The tax impacts of adjustments were based on the Company’s statutory tax rates applicable to each item in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. Using statutory tax rates for presentation of the non-GAAP measures allows a consistent basis for investors to understand financial performance of the Company across historical periods. The overall effective tax rate on adjustments was impacted by the inability to recognize tax benefits from charges in jurisdictions that are in cumulative loss positions. (4) Management believes adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations and diluted adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations per common share provide useful information to investors because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare our core operating results from period to period by removing the impact of impairment charges, restructuring and other charges, restatement related charges (recoveries), expensed acquisition costs and other items not appropriately reflective of our core business. (5) Diluted adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations per common share, was computed using the two-class method to determine the net income (loss) per share for each class of common stock and participating security (restricted stock and certain of our stock settled restricted stock units) according to participation rights in undistributed earnings.
