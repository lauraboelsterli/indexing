    "text": "Published: Feb 10, 2018 9:38 a.m. ET Share Reuters The memo created by House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes and committee staff was released a week before the Democrats’ response failed to get the White House go-ahead. \nBy Byron Tau \nWASHINGTON—The White House denied Friday a request to release a Democratic memo that aimed to rebut GOP allegations regarding the investigation of a onetime associate of President Donald Trump, sending it back for revisions due to national-security concerns. \n“Although the president is inclined to declassify the February 5th memorandum, because the memorandum contains numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages, he is unable to do so at this time,” White House counsel Donald McGahn wrote to the House Intelligence Committee on Friday night. \nSee: Trump claims Nunes memo ‘totally vindicates’ him in Mueller probe The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2018 \nMcGahn wrote that the Justice Department stood ready to work with the Democrats on the committee on a revised and further redacted version of their memo, given “the public interest in transparency.” \nDemocrats on the panel expressed frustration with the president’s decision but said they were willing to re-examine the memo to address the concerns raised by law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. \n“We will be reviewing the recommended redactions from the DOJ and FBI, which these agencies shared with the White House, and look forward to conferring with the agencies to determine how we can properly inform the American people about the misleading attack on law enforcement by the GOP and address any concerns over sources and methods,” said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee.",
