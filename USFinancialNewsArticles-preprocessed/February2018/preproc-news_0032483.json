    "text": "4Q 2017 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.29, including estimated tax impacts of $0.60 per diluted share\n4Q 2017 C&I adjusted EPS of $1.06\nEVANSVILLE, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OneMain Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: OMF) today reported pretax income of $187 million and net income of $39 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $29 million and $27 million, respectively, in the prior year quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 included approximately $81 million of additional tax expense, primarily reflecting the re-measurement of our deferred tax asset due to tax reform. Earnings per diluted share were $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.20 in the prior year quarter.\nNet income was $183 million for the full year of 2017, which included the aforementioned additional tax expense due to tax reform, compared to net income attributable to OneMain Holdings, Inc. of $215 million in the prior year. Earnings per diluted share were $1.35 for the full year of 2017, compared to $1.59 in the prior year.\n“We delivered a very strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2017,” said Jay Levine, President and CEO of OneMain Holdings, Inc. “The fundamentals of our business remained strong, highlighted by steady receivables growth, a greater mix of secured lending, improved credit performance, and lower tangible leverage. We look forward to building on this strong foundation in 2018.”\nConsumer and Insurance Segment (“C&I”) (1)\nC&I generated adjusted pretax income of $229 million and adjusted net income of $144 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $175 million and $108 million, respectively, in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.06 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.80 in the prior year quarter.\nC&I generated adjusted net income of $480 million for the full year of 2017, compared to $486 million in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $3.54 for the full year of 2017, compared to $3.60 in the prior year.\nOriginations totaled $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 34% from $2.3 billion in the prior year quarter. The percentage of secured originations was 44% in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the prior year.\nEnding net finance receivables reached $14.8 billion at December 31, 2017, up 10% from $13.5 billion in the prior year. Average net finance receivables reached $14.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 8% from $13.5 billion in the prior year quarter.\nSecured receivables represented 43% of ending net finance receivables at December 31, 2017, up from 36% in the prior year.\nInterest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $875 million, up from $821 million in the prior year quarter, largely reflecting the impact of higher average receivables.\nYield was 23.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from 24.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of a larger proportion of Direct Auto loans in the portfolio, which carry lower average interest rates but higher expected unit profitability.\nProvision for loan losses was $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $242 million in the prior year quarter.\nThe 30-89 day delinquency ratio was 2.4% at December 31, 2017, consistent with 2.4% at September 30, 2017, and up from 2.3% at December 31, 2016.\nThe 90+ day delinquency ratio was 2.3% at December 31, 2017, up seasonally from 2.1% at September 30, 2017, and down from 2.6% at December 31, 2016.\nThe net charge-off ratio was 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with 6.4% in the third quarter of 2017, and down from 7.5% in the prior year quarter.\nAcquisitions and Servicing Segment (“A&S”) (1)\nA&S broke even in the fourth quarter of 2017 on an adjusted pretax income basis, compared to $2 million in adjusted pretax income in the prior year quarter.\nOther (1)\nBeginning in 2017, management no longer views or manages our real estate assets as a separate operating segment. Therefore, we now include Real Estate, which was previously presented as a distinct reporting segment, in “Other.” During the fourth quarter of 2017, Other generated an adjusted pretax loss of $7 million, compared to an adjusted pretax loss of $7 million in the prior year quarter.\n(1) Reported on a non-GAAP basis. Refer to the required reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures at the end of this press release.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $987 million of cash and cash equivalents, which included $242 million of cash and cash equivalents held at our regulated insurance subsidiaries or for other operating activities that is unavailable for general corporate purposes. We had undrawn revolving conduit facilities of $5.1 billion and long-term debt of $15.1 billion at December 31, 2017.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report the operating results of Consumer and Insurance, Acquisitions and Servicing, and Other using the Segment Accounting Basis, which (i) reflects our allocation methodologies for certain costs, primarily interest expense, loan loss reserves, and acquisition costs, to reflect the manner in which we assess our business results and (ii) excludes the impact of applying purchase accounting (eliminates premiums/discounts on our finance receivables and long-term debt at acquisition, as well as the amortization/accretion in future periods). Consumer and Insurance adjusted pretax income (loss), Consumer and Insurance adjusted net income (loss), Consumer and Insurance adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share, Acquisitions and Servicing adjusted pretax income (loss), and Other adjusted pretax income (loss) are key performance measures used by management in evaluating the performance of our business. Consumer and Insurance adjusted pretax income (loss), Acquisitions and Servicing adjusted pretax income (loss), and Other adjusted pretax income (loss) represents income (loss) before income taxes on a Segment Accounting Basis and excludes acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses, net gain (loss) on sale of personal and real estate loans, net gain on sale of SpringCastle interests, SpringCastle transaction costs, losses resulting from repurchases and repayments of debt, debt refinance costs, net loss on liquidation of our United Kingdom subsidiary, and income attributable to non-controlling interests. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in assessing the profitability of our segments and uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our operating performance and as a performance goal under the company’s executive compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, income (loss) before income taxes, net income, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call & Webcast Information\nOneMain management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss our fourth quarter 2017 results and other general matters at 8:00 am Eastern Time on Thursday, February 15, 2018. Both the call and webcast are open to the general public.
