    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday it was up to China to decide whether to do away with presidential term limits after the country’s ruling Communist Party made a proposal on Sunday that would allow President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely.\n“That’s a decision for China to make about what’s best for their country,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said at a press briefing.\nSanders said President Donald Trump supported having term limits in the United States. “But that’s a decision that would be up to China,” she said.\nReporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
