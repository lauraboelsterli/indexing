    "text": "~ Announces Initiation of Quarterly Cash Dividend ~\nLONG ISLAND CITY, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Steve Madden (Nasdaq:SHOO), a leading designer and marketer of fashion footwear and accessories for women, men and children, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 and provided initial fiscal year 2018 sales and EPS guidance.\nAmounts referred to as “Adjusted” exclude the items that are described under the heading “Non-GAAP Adjustments.”\nFor the Fourth Quarter 2017:\nNet sales increased 8.3% to $364.4 million compared to $336.4 million in the same period of 2016. Gross margin was 38.4%. Adjusted gross margin was 38.1% as compared to 38.7% in the same period last year, a decrease of 60 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 30.3%. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 29.0% as compared to 27.4% of sales in the same period of 2016. Operating income totaled $31.7 million, or 8.7% of net sales. Adjusted operating income was $36.3 million, or 10.0% of net sales, compared with operating income of $39.6 million, or 11.8% of net sales, in the same period of 2016. Net income was $24.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $27.5 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $28.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the prior year's fourth quarter.\nEdward Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased to have achieved Adjusted diluted EPS at the high end of our guidance range for the fourth quarter of 2017. The solid performance in Q4 capped a strong year for the Company, with double-digit percentage growth in both net sales and Adjusted diluted EPS driven by the outstanding performance of our flagship Steve Madden brand in the wholesale channel.\n\"In addition, we are also pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has just approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend, reflecting our confidence in the Company’s long-term prospects and cash flow generation as well as our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders. The dividend complements continued investments in our brands, acquisitions and share repurchases.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Segment Results\nNet sales for the wholesale business increased 10.6% to $278.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the results of Schwartz & Benjamin, acquired in January 2017, wholesale net sales increased 2.5% to $257.9 million from $251.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, as an increase in the wholesale footwear business was partially offset by a decline in wholesale accessories. Gross margin in the wholesale business was 30.6%. Adjusted gross margin in the wholesale business was 31.0% compared to 31.4% in last year’s fourth quarter, driven by the inclusion of the lower-margin Schwartz & Benjamin business.\nRetail net sales in the fourth quarter increased 1.5% to $86.2 million compared to $84.9 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Same store sales decreased 5.1% in the quarter compared to a 1.1% same store sales increase in the fourth quarter of 2016. Retail gross margin increased to 60.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to 60.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior year.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company opened one full price store and one outlet store in the U.S. as well as two full price stores in international markets. The Company ended the quarter with 206 company-operated retail locations, including four Internet stores. In addition, during the fourth quarter, the Company opened six concessions in Asia and ended the quarter with 38 company-operated concessions in international markets.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 23.2%. On an Adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.9% compared to 28.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior year, due primarily to the impact of the year-over-year benefit resulting from the exercising and vesting of share based awards.\nFull Year Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, net sales increased 10.5% to $1.55 billion from $1.40 billion in the prior year.\nNet income was $117.9 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. On an Adjusted basis, net income was $129.3 million, or $2.24 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $120.9 million, or $2.03 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 639,162 shares of the Company’s common stock for approximately $26.2 million, which includes shares acquired through the net settlement of employee stock awards.\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents, and current and non-current marketable securities totaled $274.8 million.\nInitiation of Quarterly Cash Dividend\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend, the first quarterly dividend since the Company went public in December 1993. The initial quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share is payable on March 29, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 12, 2018.\nThe declaration and payment of future dividends, as well as the amount thereof, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon, among other things, the company's financial position, results of operations, cash flow and other factors. There can be no assurance that the Company will declare and pay dividends in future periods.\nCompany Outlook\nFor fiscal year 2018, the Company expects net sales will increase 5% to 7% over net sales in 2017. The Company expects diluted EPS for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of $2.60 to $2.67.\nNon-GAAP Adjustments\nAmounts referred to as “Adjusted” exclude the items below.\nFor the fourth quarter 2017:\n$1.1 million pre-tax ($0.7 million after-tax) non-cash benefit associated with the purchase accounting fair value adjustment of inventory acquired in the Schwartz & Benjamin acquisition, included in cost of sales. $11.8 million pre-tax ($7.5 million after-tax) expense in connection with a provision for legal and early lease termination charges, included in operating expenses. $10.2 million pre-tax ($6.4 million after-tax) benefit in connection with a post-closing amendment to the equity purchase agreement relating to the Schwartz & Benjamin acquisition, included in operating expenses. $2.4 million pre-tax ($1.5 million after-tax) expense in connection with the integration of the Schwartz & Benjamin acquisition and the related restructuring, included in operating expenses. $2.7 million pre-tax ($1.7 million after-tax) non-cash expense associated with the impairment of the preferred interest investment in Brian Atwood Italia Holding LLC, included in operating expenses. $2.0 million pre-tax ($1.7 million after-tax) benefit related to an adjustment to estimated bad debt expense associated with the Payless ShoeSource bankruptcy, included in operating expenses. $1.0 million pre-tax ($0.6 million after-tax) non-cash expense associated with the impairment of the Wild Pair trademark. $0.5 million tax expense resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act transition tax and audit adjustments.\nFor the fiscal year 2017:\n$0.6 million pre-tax ($0.4 million after-tax) non-cash expense associated with the purchase accounting fair value adjustment of inventory acquired in the Schwartz & Benjamin acquisition, included in cost of sales. $11.8 million pre-tax ($7.5 million after-tax) expense in connection with a provision for legal and early lease termination charges, included in operating expenses. $10.2 million pre-tax ($6.4 million after-tax) benefit in connection with a post-closing amendment to the equity purchase agreement relating to the Schwartz & Benjamin acquisition, included in operating expenses. $3.6 million pre-tax ($2.3 million after-tax) expense in connection with the integration of the Schwartz & Benjamin acquisition and the related restructuring, included in operating expenses. $2.7 million pre-tax ($1.7 million after-tax) non-cash expense associated with the impairment of the preferred interest investment in Brian Atwood Italia Holding LLC, included in operating expenses. $5.5 million pre-tax ($4.8 million after-tax) bad debt expense associated with the Payless ShoeSource bankruptcy, included in operating expenses. $1.0 million pre-tax ($0.6 million after-tax) non-cash expense associated with the impairment of the Wild Pair trademark. $0.5 million tax expense resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act transition tax and audit adjustments.\nReconciliations of amounts on a GAAP basis to Adjusted amounts are presented in the Non-GAAP Reconciliation tables at the end of this release and identify and quantify all excluded items.\nConference Call Information\nInterested stockholders are invited to listen to the fourth quarter earnings conference call scheduled for today, February 27, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
