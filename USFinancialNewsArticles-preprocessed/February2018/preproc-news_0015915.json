    "text": "February 8, 2018 / 12:28 PM / in 2 hours Cardinal Health beats profit estimates on acquisition, raises forecast Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Cardinal Health ( CAH.N ) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as its purchase of Medtronic Plc’s ( MDT.N ) patient recovery business started to pay off, and the drug distributor raised its fiscal 2018 adjusted profit forecast. \nThe company’s medical unit, which absorbed the Medtronic business, posted a 19 percent jump in quarterly revenue to $4 billion as it sold more branded medical and surgical products. \nHowever, quarterly profit in Cardinal’s largest business, the pharmaceuticals unit that distributes generic and branded drugs, fell 4 percent to $514 million, hurt partly by the performance of its generic drug program. \nA steep decline in prices of generic drugs has hurt the pharmaceutical supply chain in the past few quarters but rivals McKesson Corp ( MCK.N ) and AmerisourceBergen Corp ( ABC.N ) have said that prices have started to stabilize. \nNet earnings attributable to the company rose to $1.05 billion, or $3.33 per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, from $324 million, or $1.02 per share, a year ago. \nThe Dublin, Ohio-based company recorded a $736 million benefit from income taxes, and said its board had authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. \nThe company also raised its 2018 earnings outlook to $5.25-$5.50 per share from $4.85-$5.10 per share. \nAnalysts expect fiscal 2018 earnings of $5.14 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nExcluding items, the company earned $1.51 per share in the quarter. \nAnalysts on average had estimated second-quarter earnings of $1.15 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nRevenue rose to $35.19 billion from $33.15 billion.
