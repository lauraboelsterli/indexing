    "text": "HOUSTON, - Western Gas Partners, LP (NYSE: WES) (\"WES\" or the \"Partnership\") and Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (NYSE: WGP) (\"WGP\") today announced fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 financial and operating results.\nWESTERN GAS PARTNERS, LP\nNet income (loss) available to limited partners for 2017 totaled $221.3 million, or $1.30 per common unit (diluted), with full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $1.1 billion and full-year 2017 Distributable cash flow (1) of $929.0 million. Net income (loss) available to limited partners for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $67.7 million, or $0.39 per common unit (diluted), with fourth-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $273.3 million and fourth-quarter 2017 Distributable cash flow (1) of $233.4 million.\nWES paid a quarterly distribution of $0.920 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2017. This distribution represented a 2% increase over the prior quarter's distribution and a 7% increase over the fourth-quarter 2016 distribution of $0.860 per unit. The full-year 2017 distribution of $3.590 per unit represented a 7% increase over the full-year 2016 distribution of $3.350 per unit. The fourth-quarter 2017 Coverage ratio (1) of 1.08 times was based on the quarterly distribution of $0.920 per unit. The Partnership's Coverage ratio (1) for full-year 2017 was 1.13 times.\n(1) Please see the tables at the end of this release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures and calculation of the Coverage ratio.\n\"Our impressive quarterly results were driven by strong volumetric growth in both the Delaware and DJ Basins where producer activity remains robust. In the Delaware Basin, we are pleased to report that Ramsey VI came online at the end of the quarter, just as the rest of the Ramsey facility was nearing capacity,\" said Chief Executive Officer, Benjamin Fink. \"We still plan to execute our over $1 billion 2018 capital program without the need for additional equity, as we expect strong volumetric growth in the second half of the year once critical infrastructure is placed into service.\"\nTotal throughput attributable to WES for natural gas assets for the fourth quarter of 2017 averaged 3.5 Bcf/d, which was 1% above the prior quarter. Total throughput attributable to WES for natural gas assets for the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately 3% above the prior quarter when adjusted for the non-cash impact of a one-time prior period volumetric adjustment. Additionally, total throughput attributable to WES for natural gas assets for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 14% below the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to the impact of the DBJV-for-Marcellus asset exchange that closed in March 2017. Total throughput for crude, NGL and produced water assets for the fourth quarter of 2017 averaged 240 MBbls/d, which was 15% above the prior quarter and 33% above the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor full-year 2017, total throughput attributable to WES for natural gas assets averaged 3.6 Bcf/d, which was 9% below the prior-year average. For full-year 2017, total throughput for crude, NGL and produced water assets averaged 201 MBbls/d, which was 9% above the prior-year average.\nCapital expenditures attributable to WES, including equity investments but excluding acquisitions, totaled $253.0 million on a cash basis and $291.6 million on an accrual basis during the fourth quarter of 2017, with maintenance capital expenditures on a cash basis of $16.6 million. For full-year 2017, capital expenditures attributable to WES, including equity investments but excluding acquisitions, totaled $666.9 million on a cash basis and $792.0 million on an accrual basis, with maintenance capital expenditures on a cash basis of $49.7 million.\nOn February 15, 2018, WES amended its senior unsecured revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date from February 2020 to February 2023 and expand the borrowing capacity from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.\nWESTERN GAS EQUITY PARTNERS, LP\nWGP indirectly owns the entire general partner interest in WES, 100% of the incentive distribution rights in WES and 50,132,046 WES common units. Net income (loss) available to limited partners for 2017 totaled $376.6 million, or $1.72 per common unit (diluted). Net income (loss) available to limited partners for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $99.5 million, or $0.45 per common unit (diluted).\nWGP previously declared a quarterly distribution of $0.54875 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2017. This distribution represented a 2% increase over the prior quarter's distribution and a 19% increase over the fourth-quarter 2016 distribution of $0.46250 per unit. The full-year 2017 distribution of $2.10500 per unit represented a 19% increase over the full-year 2016 distribution of $1.76750 per unit. WGP received distributions from WES of $122.3 million attributable to the fourth quarter and will pay $120.1 million in distributions for the same period.\nOn February 15, 2018, WGP amended its senior secured revolving credit facility by reducing total commitments from $250.0 million to $35.0 million.\nCONFERENCE CALL TOMORROW AT 8 A.M. CST\nWES and WGP will host a joint conference call on Friday, February 16, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Central Standard Time (9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time) to discuss fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results.

A replay of the conference call will also be available on the website for two weeks following the call.\nWestern Gas Partners, LP (\"WES\") is a growth-oriented Delaware master limited partnership formed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation to acquire, own, develop and operate midstream assets.

In addition, in its capacity as a processor of natural gas, WES also buys and sells natural gas, NGLs or condensate under certain of its contracts.\nWestern Gas Equity Partners, LP (\"WGP\") is a Delaware master limited partnership formed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation to own the following types of interests in WES: (i) the general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in WES, both owned through WGP's 100% ownership of WES's general partner, and (ii) a significant limited partner interest in WES.\nFor more information about Western Gas Partners, LP and Western Gas Equity Partners, LP, please visit www.westerngas.com .\nThis news release contains . WES and WGP's management believes that their expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. No assurance, however, can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this news release. These factors include the ability to meet financial guidance or distribution growth expectations; the ability to safely and efficiently operate WES's assets; the supply of, demand for, and price of oil, natural gas, NGLs and related products or services; the ability to meet projected in-service dates for capital growth projects; construction costs or capital expenditures exceeding estimated or budgeted costs or expenditures; and the other factors described in the \"Risk Factors\" sections of WES's and WGP's most recent Forms 10-K and Forms 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in their other public filings and press releases.

VandenBrand\nDirector, Investor Relations\njon.vandenbrand@anadarko.com\n832.636.6000\nWestern Gas Partners, LP Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nBelow are reconciliations of (i) net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (GAAP) to WES's Distributable cash flow (non-GAAP), (ii) net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (GAAP) and net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") (non-GAAP), and (iii) operating income (loss) (GAAP) to Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (\"Adjusted gross margin\") (non-GAAP), as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management believes that WES's Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin, and Coverage ratio are widely accepted financial indicators of WES's financial performance compared to other publicly traded partnerships and are useful in assessing its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin and Coverage ratio, as defined by WES, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, WES's Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin and Coverage ratio should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP and other applicable performance measures, such as operating income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities.\nWestern Gas Partners, LP Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures, continued\nDistributable Cash Flow\nWES defines Distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA, plus interest income and the net settlement amounts from the sale and/or purchase of natural gas, condensate and NGLs under WES's commodity price swap agreements to the extent such amounts are not recognized as Adjusted EBITDA, less net cash paid (or to be paid) for interest expense (including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs originally paid in cash, offset by non-cash capitalized interest), maintenance capital expenditures, Series A Preferred unit distributions and income taxes.\nThree
