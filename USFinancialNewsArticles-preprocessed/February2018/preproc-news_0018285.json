    "text": "Updated 18 Mins Ago CNBC.com \nSen. Rand Paul was blocking the Senate's move to quickly pass approve its massive budget deal Thursday with only hours until government funding lapses. \nFor the Senate to hold a vote on the spending package Thursday, all senators must agree. The Kentucky Republican held out as he sought a vote on an amendment to maintain budget caps. \n\"All Senator Rand Paul is asking for is a 15-minute vote on his amendment to restore the budget caps. He is ready to proceed at any time,\" Paul spokesman Sergio Gor said in a statement. \nPaul, a fiscal conservative, opposes the boost to military and domestic spending proposed by bipartisan Senate leaders. The bill before the Senate would set up a roughly $300 billion increase in the budget caps over two years. show chapters 4 Hours Ago | 01:50 \nWhen the Senate gets to a vote, the measure appears to have enough support to pass. \n\"I think it will all work out. But it's up in the air,\" said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, according to Politico . \nIf the Senate approves the proposal, the House would then have to pass it before midnight Thursday and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature. \nIn the House, both fiscal conservatives and liberals who sought a deal to protect young immigrants from deportation threatened the plan's passage. On Thursday morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he believed his chamber had enough support to approve it .",
