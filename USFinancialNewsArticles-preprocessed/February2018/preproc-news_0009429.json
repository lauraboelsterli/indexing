    "text": "BERLIN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) were haggling on Friday over labour rights after securing a flurry of agreements on less contentious issues in their talks on forming a new coalition government.\nThe two camps aim to finalise a deal for four more years of a “grand coalition” by the end of the weekend or early next week, some four months after an inconclusive national election plunged Germany into unaccustomed political uncertainty.\nThe parties have agreed to some eye-catching measures, including a 50 percent tax write-down for fleet electric cars and a 12 billion euro public investment programme to improve sluggish data networks, documents seen by Reuters showed.\nBut in the field of labour rights, where the beleaguered SPD wants to signal to its members that it has set its distinctive stamp on the deal, long lines of text highlighted in yellow showed that the parties had still reached no consensus.\nThe SPD wants to secure a right for employees in larger companies to move seamlessly back and forth between full- and part-time work if they have to care for children or elderly parents. The conservatives, and much of German business, oppose what they see as a costly measure.\nThe centre-left SPD has sagged even further in opinion polls since suffering its worst result of the postwar era in the Sept. 24 election.\nMany SPD activists, who must ratify any coalition deal in a postal ballot, would prefer to see their party reinvent itself in opposition rather than join another coalition with Merkel after serving as junior partner in one from 2013 to 2017.\nFor Merkel, another loveless ‘grand coalition’ is her best chance of securing a fourth term after the failure of earlier talks with two smaller parties late last year.\nHer conservative bloc and the SPD have already agreed terms in other areas. Germany’s booming economy has allowed them to agree an extra 11 billion euros for education, and compromise deals have been reached on migration and healthcare policy.\nSome of the accords are noticeably less ambitious than those reached in the previous talks with the two smaller parties. Then, negotiators agreed to spend 20 billion euros over a longer period on building a better national broadband network. Privatisations are also now off the agenda.\nWriting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
