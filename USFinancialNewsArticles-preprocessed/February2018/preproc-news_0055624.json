Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company's operations.\nThe White Paper on FFO approved by NAREIT in April 2002, as revised in 2011, defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and items classified by GAAP as extraordinary, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairment writedowns, and after comparable adjustments for the Company's portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures. The Company computes FFO consistent with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company.\nThe Company believes that excluding the effect of extraordinary items, real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance, can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs, even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders. However, FFO may not be helpful when comparing the Company to non-REITs.\nFFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. FFO is not a measurement of the Company's liquidity, nor is FFO indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. These measurements do not reflect cash expenditures for long-term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred. FFO may include funds that may not be available for management's discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, and other commitments and uncertainties. To compensate for this, management considers the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or the evaluation of the Company's operating performance.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations\nThe Company presents adjusted FFO (including adjusted FFO per share/unit), which adjusts for certain additional items including straight-line accrued rent, deferred revenue recognition, stock based compensation expense, non-real estate depreciation and debt extinguishment costs and certain other items. The Company excludes these items as it believes it allows for meaningful comparisons with other REITs and between periods and is more indicative of the ongoing performance of its assets. As with FFO, the Company's calculation of adjusted FFO may be different from similar adjusted measures calculated by other REITs.\nAgree Realty Corporation\nReconciliation of Net Debt to Recurring EBITDA\n($ in thousands, except share and per-share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nNet Income\n$ 16,671\nInterest expense, net\n4,924\nDepreciation of real estate assets\n5,221\nAmortization of leasing costs\n43\nAmortization of lease intangibles\n3,534\nDeferred tax expense (benefit)\n(230)\nNon-real estate depreciation\n(2)\nEBITDA\n$ 30,161\nRun-Rate Impact of Investment and Disposition Activity\n$ 1,203\n(Gain) loss on sale of assets, net\n(4,148)\nOther income\n(347)\nRecurring EBITDA\n$ 26,869\nAnnualized Recurring EBITDA\n$ 107,476\nTotal Debt\n$ 522,399\nCash, cash equivalents and cash held in escrows\n(58,782)\nNet Debt\n$ 463,617\nNet Debt to Recurring EBITDA\n4.3x\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRecurring EBITDA\nThe Company considers the non-GAAP measure of recurring EBITDA to be a key supplemental measure of the Company's performance and should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income or loss as a measure of the Company's operating performance. The Company considers recurring EBITDA a key supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance because it represents the Company's earnings run rate for the period presented and because it is widely followed by industry analysts, lenders and investors. Our recurring EBITDA may not be comparable to recurring EBITDA reported by other companies that have a different interpretation of the definition of recurring EBITDA. Our ratio of net debt to recurring EBITDA, which is used by the Company as a measure of leverage, is calculated by taking recurring EBITDA and dividing it by our net debt per the consolidated balance sheet.\nAny differences are a result of rounding.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agree-realty-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300602977.html\nSOURCE Agree Realty Corporation",
