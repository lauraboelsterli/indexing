    "text": "SEOUL, Feb 28 (Reuters) - South Korea’s finance minister on Wednesday said the government will consider preparing a supplementary budget to create jobs and boost economic growth.\n“We won’t rule out the possibility of an extra budget,” Kim Dong-yeon said at a parliament session when a lawmaker asked if the government’s push to add jobs will mean increased fiscal expenditure.\nIn 2017, South Korea’s Moon Jae-in government budgeted extra spending of 11 trillion won ($10.20 billion)as soon as he took office, mainly to create social service jobs and offer subsidies for maternity leave.\n$1 = 1,078.8000 won Reporting by Cynthia Kim Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ",
