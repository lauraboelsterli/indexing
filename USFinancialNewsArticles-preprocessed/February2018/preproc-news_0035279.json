    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Deutsche Asset Management 1 (Deutsche AM) announced that, effective February 13, 2018, it has reduced the net expense ratios for two high dividend yield equity Xtrackers exchange-traded funds (ETFs):\nETF Ticker\n(NYSE Arca)\nNew Gross & Net Expense Ratio\nOld Gross & Net Expense Ratio\nXtrackers MSCI All World ex-US High Dividend Yield Equity ETF HDAW 0.20% 0.45% Xtrackers MSCI EAFE High Dividend Yield Equity ETF HDEF 0.20% 0.45% In addition to the fee reduction, HDAW and HDEF will begin to track the unhedged version of their respective indices. HDAW seeks to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI ACWI ex USA High Dividend Yield Index. HDEF seeks to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI EAFE High Dividend Yield Index.\n“Driven by historically low bond yields, some investors are looking for alternatives to income-oriented investments. With interest rates globally currently at low levels, equities paying higher dividend rates could be an attractive option to meet ongoing income requirements within portfolios,” said Fiona Bassett, Global Co-Head of Passive Asset Management. “Relatively high equity market dividends, especially in today’s low rate environment, suggest our suite of dividend-focused ETFs can act as cost-effective supplements or alternatives to income strategies.”\nFor more information about the Deutsche AM ETFs available in the US, visit: www.Xtrackers.com .\nDeutsche Asset Management\nWith USD 842.4 billion of assets under management (as of December 31, 2017), Deutsche AM is one of the world’s leading investment management organizations.

This and other important information can be found in the Fund’s prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 1-855-DBX-ETFS (1-855-329-3837) or by viewing or downloading a prospectus at www.Xtrackers.com .

Stocks may decline in value. Foreign investing involves greater and different risks than investing in US companies, including currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive company information, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards. Emerging markets tend to be more volatile and less liquid than the markets of more mature economies, and generally have less diverse and less mature economic structures and less stable political systems than those of developed countries. Funds investing in a single industry, country or in a limited geographic region generally are more volatile than more diversified funds. Dividends are not guaranteed. If the dividend-paying stocks held by a fund reduce or stop paying dividends, a fund’s ability to generate income may be adversely affected. This fund is non-diversified and can take larger positions in fewer issues, increasing its potential risk. Performance of a fund may diverge from that of an Underlying Index due to operating expenses, transaction costs, cash flows, use of sampling strategies or operational inefficiencies. An investment in any fund should be considered only as a supplement to a complete investment program for those investors willing to accept the risks associated with that fund. Please read the prospectus for more information.\nHDEF RISKS: Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Stocks may decline in value.

The index also applies quality screens and reviews 12-month past performance to omit stocks with potentially deteriorating fundamentals that could force them to cut or reduce dividends.\nThe MSCI EAFE High Dividend Yield Index is based on MSCI EAFE, its parent index, and includes large and mid cap representation across Developed Markets countries around the world, excluding the US and Canada. The index is designed to reflect the performance of equities in the parent index (excluding REITs) with higher dividend income and quality characteristics than average dividend yields that are both sustainable and persistent.
