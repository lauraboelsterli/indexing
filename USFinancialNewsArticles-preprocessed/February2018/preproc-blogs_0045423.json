    "text": "Dozens of teenaged survivors of the second-deadliest public school shooting in U.S. history marched on Florida 's capital on Wednesday to ask lawmakers to ban sales of assault rifles of the sort used to kill 17 students and educators last week.\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, became the latest school targeted by a gunman using a semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifle, stirring the nation's long-running debate about gun rights and public safety.\nDressed in jeans and T-shirts and carrying signs with the slogan \"#Neveragain,\" survivors of the Feb. 14 mass shooting met with lawmakers in Tallahassee, to ask for stricter controls on gun sales.\nInvestigators said the assault was carried out by 19-year-old former student Nikolas Cruz, who purchased an AR-15 nearly a year ago. Police have charged Cruz, who had been kicked out of Douglas for disciplinary problems, with 17 counts of premeditated murder.\nJonathan Newton | The Washington Post | Getty Images Jose Iglesias, 17, gets a kiss from his mother, Carmen and a hug from his sister, Francesca as he boarded a bus for Tallahassee to protest to the Florida politicians about the seventeen students and teachers were killed on Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the second-deadliest shooting at a U.S. public school. \"We want to see some common sense gun laws so this will never happen again,\" said Rachel Padnis, a 16-year-old sophomore from the school near Fort Lauderdale.\nPresident Donald Trump , a strong supporter of gun rights, was due to meet later Wednesday with parents, students and teachers who have been victims of gun violence, including those affected by the Valentine's Day shooting in Florida.\nThe White House meeting comes a day after Trump said his administration would take steps to ban bump stocks, an accessory that enables a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute. A spokeswoman said the administration was open to the idea of setting national age limits on sales of assault rifles.\nThe state Senate on Wednesday postponed discussion on a proposed gun control bill, with Senate President Joe Negron, a Republican, saying the chamber will take up other measures. The legislative session wraps up on March 9, leaving lawmakers little time to act.\nBefore that move, dozens of students packed into a meeting room and peppered Negron with questions about why civilians should have continued access to assault rifles.\nNegron declined to say whether he would support any specific gun control measures, saying, \"That's an issue we're going to look at as we work to develop legislation.\"\nTrump talks\nTrump, a strong supporter of gun rights, was scheduled to host a \"listening session\" with high school students and teachers at the White House on Wednesday.\nTrump's support for any tightening of gun laws would mark a change for a Republican who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association gun lobby during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe NRA opposes an outright ban on bump stocks but has said it would be open to restrictions on the devices.\nUnder pressure after Parkland, the deadliest-ever shooting at a U.S. high school, Trump on Tuesday directed the Justice Department to quickly complete a proposed rule that would treat \"bump stocks\" as machine guns, which could effectively outlaw them in the United States.\nLast October, a retired real estate investor and high-stakes gambler used multiple assault rifles equipped with bump stocks to kill 58 people at a Las Vegas outdoor concert, the deadliest attack by a single gunman in U.S. history. Bump stocks have not played a prominent role in other recent U.S. mass shootings.\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday urged Trump to back legislation, instead of a regulation, on bump stocks, noting that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has questioned whether it has the authority to ban bump stocks.\n\"The only way to close this loophole permanently is legislation,\" Schumer said.\nLater this week, Trump will meet with local and state officials, and plans to talk with governors about the issue.\nTrump generally favors a Senate bill on background checks, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday.\nCalls for national student walkouts and marches in the coming months have gained steam on social media, including the \"March for Our Lives\" on March 24 in Washington, spearheaded by Douglas students.\nHundreds of students walked out of their high school in Davie, Florida, about 16 miles (26 km)south of Parkland, in a move to show support for the student activists, local TV images showed.\nThe NRA has agreed to participate in a televised town hall on guns to be broadcast by CNN later Wednesday, the news network said. NRA officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nGun violence on public school and college campuses has become so commonplace in the United States in the last several years that administrators regularly stage drills to train students and staff in the event of a mass shooting.",
