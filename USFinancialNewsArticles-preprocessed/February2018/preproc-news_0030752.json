    "text": "NEW YORK/TORONTO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc, Canadaâ€™s biggest pipeline operator, plans to accelerate its divestment program by selling assets valued at about C$8 billion ($6.4 billion) in 2018, more than two times its initial sale target, according to people familiar with the situation.\nUnder pressure from both investors and rating agencies, the Calgary, Alberta-based firm wants to ramp up the sale of non-core assets from the previous C$3 billion it forecast in November, the people said on condition of anonymity because the process is private.
