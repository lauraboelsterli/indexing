Earnings estimate: Loss of 16 cents per share, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Global daily active users (DAUs) estimate: 184.2 million, per FactSet and StreetAccount estimate Average revenue per user (ARPU) estimate: $1.36, per FactSet and StreetAccount estimate Snap announced during its last quarterly earnings in November it was redesigning its app to attract new users and usher in new ways to monetize its app. It began slowly rolling out changes in November 2017 . Recently it announced would allow users to share some content across Twitter and Facebook , a first for the app which was initially built around disappearing messages. \nGBH Insights chief strategy officer Daniel Ives said in a note the redesign should help especially with the onboarding of older users who are a key advertising target adding advertisers are overall positive on the company indicating sales and pricing should increase. However. he acknowledged Snap faces many issues, including ARPUs that are below industry averages and competition from other social networks like Instagram , Facebook and Twitter . Instagram Stories, Facebook's Snapchat competitor, announced 300 million daily active users in November, although some reports have indicated users spend more time on Snap than on its rival .",
