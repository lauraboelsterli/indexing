    "text": "Miles Wood’s goal at 1:24 of the third period gave the visiting New Jersey Devils a 4-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning at Amalie Arena on Saturday night.\nWood’s 16th goal of the season gave the Devils an insurmountable 4-2 lead. He one-timed Stefan Noesen’s pass from behind the net before Tampa Bay goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy could react.\nDevils goaltender Eddie Lack stopped 48 of 51 shots for only his second win in the NHL this season. Lack appeared in just his sixth game with the Devils after beginning the campaign with Calgary before a trade. He has also spent time in the minors with Calgary and New Jersey’s farm teams.\nLack preserved the win after Steven Stamkos pulled Tampa Bay within a goal again during a power play at 5:15 of the final frame -- only 12 seconds after Kyle Palmieri was penalized for tripping.\nWood was penalized for boarding Vladislav Namestnikov 4:54 into the second period. The hit sparked a ruckus that led to offsetting roughing penalties to Wood and the Lightning’s Andrej Sustr.\nBen Lovejoy led the Devils with a goal and an assist while Nico Hischier and Pavel Zacha also tallied for the victors, who were outshot 51-28.\nChris Kunitz and Brayden Point supplied Tampa Bay’s other goals. Vasilevskiy recorded 24 saves, as the Lightning suffered their second loss in three games.\nThe Devils were blanked on three power plays, while the Lightning scored on two of six man-advantage opportunities.\nLovejoy opened the scoring for the Devils 2:59 into the game as he fooled Vasilevskiy with a quick shot from the side boards following a turnover. Kunitz drew the Lightning even at 12:41 of the first period on a one-timer off Ryan Callahan’s pass from the corner.\nPoint sent the Lightning ahead 2-1 during a power play at 2:47 of the second period, tapping in a loose puck after Yanni Gourde’s shot squeezed through Lack’s legs.\nHischier created a 2-2 tie only 26 seconds later as he elected to shoot on a 2-on-1 with Taylor Hall. Just over three minutes later, Zacha gave New Jersey the lead again with a shorthanded marker after taking a long pass from Sami Vatanen, who recorded two assists.\nWood then became the game’s hero -- thanks largely to Lack.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
