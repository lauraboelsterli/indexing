    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The innovative late development-stage pharmaceutical startup, Bridge Therapeutics®, has named David H. Bergstrom, Ph.D. as its new Chief Operating Officer effective immediately.\nDr. Bergstrom has more than 30 years of new product development and commercialization experience in the pharmaceutical industry. He has overseen and been intimately involved in moving new products from the research phase to eventual successful commercial production. He has also launched products across numerous therapeutic areas and dosage form delivery technologies.\nBridge Therapeutics , based in Birmingham, Alabama, is aggressively researching chronic pain medications to help reduce the impact of the opioid epidemic. The company is currently pursuing FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of a patented drug combination for the treatment of chronic pain in opioid-experienced patients.\nDr. Bergstrom earned his Ph.D., M.S. and B.S. degrees in Pharmaceutics, Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Pharmacy from the University of Utah, The University of Michigan and Ferris State University, respectively.\n\"I'm excited to put my extensive experience in large, small, semi-virtual and contract development companies to work with Bridge Therapeutics,\" said Dr. Bergstrom. \"Bridge Therapeutics is well-positioned to have an immediate impact in the chronic pain drug industry. The pharma startup already has the technology and resources to curb this opioid epidemic with better alternative treatments.\"\nBridge Therapeutics is working to bring BT-205 and other investigational new drug candidates to millions of patients who suffer from chronic pain by providing a safer alternative to current opioid pain medications. The investigational drug, BT-205, is a unique combination of two synergistic chronic pain drugs—the partial-agonist opioid buprenorphine and the NSAID meloxicam—delivered in a state-of-the-art sublingual formulation. This dosing and delivery method is commercially advantageous over current chronic pain alternatives.\nRoughly 70 million Americans consume opioids monthly and more than 17 million Americans take them daily, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse . An estimated 2.1 million people in the United States suffer from substance abuse disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. BT-205 has the potential to address this growing epidemic as a viable drug alternative for those already taking opioids.\n\"The Bridge Therapeutics board is looking forward to working closely with Dr. Bergstrom,\" said Greg Sullivan, M.D., and Chief Scientific Officer at Bridge Therapeutics. \"With his experience and knowledge of the pharma industry, we know he can jump in on day one and make a difference.\"\nPRESS CONTACT: Mark Macias\nEMAIL: mmm@maciaspr.com\nPHONE: 646-770-0541\nAbout Bridge Therapeutics®\nBridge Therapeutics® is an innovative development-stage specialty pharmaceutical company pursuing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approvals of a patented (U.S. Patent #8410092) drug combination, BT-205, for the treatment of chronic pain in opioid-experienced patients. The investigational drug BT-205 is a unique combination of two synergistic chronic pain drugs—the partial-agonist opioid buprenorphine and the NSAID meloxicam—delivered in a state-of-the-art sublingual formulation. The dosing and delivery method will be a commercial advantage over the current alternatives. Bridge Therapeutics' goal is to make the BT-205 compound and other investigational new drug candidates available to millions of patients in which addictive and potentially dangerous full-agonist opioids such as oxycodone and morphine are ineffective and/or unsatisfactory.
