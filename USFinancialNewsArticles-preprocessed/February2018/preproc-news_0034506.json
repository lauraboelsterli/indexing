    "text": "NEWTON, Mass., Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynasil Corporation of America (NASDAQ: DYSL), a developer and manufacturer of optics and photonics products, optical detection and analysis technology and components for the homeland security, medical and industrial markets, today announced revenue of $9.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\n\"Revenue for our Optics segment showed a 12% increase for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period last year,\" said CEO Peter Sulick. \"Unfortunately this was offset by an approximately equivalent revenue decrease in our Research segment. Additionally, we were impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December, 2017. While we continue to analyze the Act, along with our tax accountants, the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the foreign earnings and profit tax from our Hilger UK based subsidiary have resulted in our need to adjust the deferred tax asset of $2.7 million which we recognized in our 1st quarter 2017 by approximately $0.7 million, which has been recognized as tax expense during this quarter.\"\n\"We released two recent public announcements which we would like to call to your attention,\" continued Mr. Sulick. \"One, we are entering a new line of business for our optics segment â€“ High Efficiency Anti-Reflective (HEAR) and Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coatings on infrared materials. We are investing in both personnel, space and capital for this opportunity, which we believe offers substantial revenue growth for us over the next 3-5 years. This startup operational cost is reflected in a portion of the growth of our operating costs for the quarter over the prior year. Second, after extensive testing and data development, our biomedical subsidiary, Xcede Technologies, filed for a First-In-Human clinical trial of our developmental hemostatic patch. This is a significant milestone along the course of the growth in the value of this asset. The trial will be conducted in the Netherlands by a team of experienced surgeons, well versed in hemostasis trials. We anticipate the trial beginning in the calendar second quarter. This is a significant milestone for this development effort. Increased cost for the pretrial activities represent the remaining growth in our G&A costs.\"\n\"One final note,\" added Mr. Sulick, \"we are also investing in a prototype line at our Optometrics subsidiary to do optical assembly for certain of our existing customers. As many of you know, we are largely a component supplier. This is an opportunity to offer a higher level of service incorporating our components into frames or even end products for certain customers desirous of subcontracting out work. We anticipate this line being operational during our third quarter and are engaged in seeking revenue opportunities now for this effort.\"\nCertain key metrics by segment for the current quarter and the same quarter last year are presented below:\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nOptics\nContract\nResearch\nBiomedical\nTotal\nRevenue\n$ 4,942,000\n$ 4,247,000\n$ -\n$ 9,189,000\nGross profit\n1,724,000\n1,851,000\n-\n3,575,000\nGM %\n35%\n44%\n-\n39%\nOperating expenses\n1,576,000\n1,723,000\n445,000\n3,744,000\nOperating income (loss)\n$ 148,000\n$ 128,000\n$ (445,000)\n$ (169,000)\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\nOptics\nContract\nResearch\nBiomedical\nTotal\nRevenue\n$ 4,405,000\n$ 4,738,000\n$ -\n$ 9,143,000\nGross profit\n1,574,000\n1,951,000\n-\n3,525,000\nGM %\n36%\n41%\n-\n39%\nOperating expenses\n1,328,000\n1,740,000\n381,000\n3,449,000\nOperating income (loss)\n$ 246,000\n$ 211,000\n$ (381,000)\n$ 76,000\nNet income (loss) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was a loss of $0.8 million, or ($0.05) in basic earnings per share, compared with income of $2.8 million, or $0.17 in basic earnings per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Dynasil recognized a deferred tax asset and a tax related gain of $2.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 which represented virtually all of the income recognition for that quarter. A portion of that asset was adjusted downward for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 due to the new US Federal tax act, resulting in a recognized expense of $0.7 million.\nUpcoming Investor Presentation\nIn lieu of a first quarter conference call, Dynasil will provide listen-only audio access to their Annual Stockholders Meeting starting at 10:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, February 22, 2018.
