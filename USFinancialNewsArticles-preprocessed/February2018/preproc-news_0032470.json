It added to those losses on Thursday, with the index hitting a two-week low of 88.585.\n“We can’t find any convincing fundamental arguments for the dollar’s weakness; it’s more sentiment-driven,” said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt. “I would expect a dollar correction (higher) in the medium term.”\nSome analysts suggested mounting worries over twin deficits in the United States, amid a government spending splurge and large corporate tax cuts, as a reason for dollar weakness.\nThe U.S. national debt has topped $20 trillion, while the 2019 fiscal deficit is projected at near $1 trillion, including deficit-financed tax cuts and two-year spending caps that Congress passed last week.\n“The story I hear most frequently from people is it’s the re-emergence of the twin deficits,” said RBC Capital Markets head of currency strategy Adam Cole, in London, of the dollar’s persistent weakness. “There seem to be concerns on the U.S. fiscal position and what that implies for the current account.”\nCole said news events that would normally be seen as buying opportunities for the dollar, such as Wednesday’s inflation data, were only having temporarily positive effects.\nAnother reason given for the dollar’s falls after Wednesday’s data was that U.S. consumer price growth was seen as a gauge for global inflationary pressures and that, as such, stronger growth would suggest a faster pace of monetary tightening from other central banks.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar skidded as much as 0.8 percent to 106.18 yen, its lowest since November 2016. That marked a drop of 3.8 percent from its early February peak near 110.50 yen.\nThe euro briefly climbed back above $1.25 for the first time in two weeks, trading up as much as half a percent on the day , before easing back to just below that level.
