    "text": "February 14, 2018 / 4:07 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Pegas trading platform keen to introduce temperature products Reuters Staff 2 Min Read FRANKFURT, Feb 14 (Reuters) - European gas trading platform Pegas said it is developing temperature products, which if approved could go live next year and help energy operators hedge weather risks. * “A final plan will be presented to the exchange’s top management in the third quarter,” Sirko Beidatsch, a natural gas expert at Pegas, said. “There is a lot of interest from traders and utilities.” * Utilities and their customers were seeking more standardisation and transparency in a market so far dominated by reinsurers, Beidatsch said. * Pegas, operated by French energy bourse Powernext which is a subsidiary of Deutsche Boerse’s EEX Group, presented plans during an energy trade fair in Essen last week for two purely temperature-based futures contracts and for two tailored to gas buyers and consumers, he said. * The latter entail one physically delivered volume hedge, which tracks the difference between temperatures and standardised gas consumer contracts, and a financial swap contract that would reflect the difference between temperatures and gas prices. * Pegas offers spot and futures for major European gas hubs as well as trading location spread and time spread products for much of continental Europe and Britain. * Weather conditions influence gas prices heavily and hence the likely income and losses for, for example, municipalities delivering heat to households and industry. * Details are available at: here (Reporting by Vera Eckert, editing by Susan Fenton)",
