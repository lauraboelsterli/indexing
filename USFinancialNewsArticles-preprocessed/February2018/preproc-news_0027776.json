    "text": "SARATOGA, Calif., Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- UPWARD, the global network for executive women, announces the acquisition of the Hipower Executive Leadership Program into its operations to enhance its offerings.\n\"Since its inception in 2012, the Hipower Executive Women's Leadership Program, has executed this year-long series for executive women in the San Francisco Bay Area and has established a reputation for being a premiere leadership organization for professional women. We're thrilled to add this program to our existing portfolio of UPWARD events,\" said Lisa Lambert, Founder/Chair and CEO of UPWARD.\n\"We're excited to become part of the programming offered by UPWARD. Executive women all over the United States and the world have drawn inspiration and have advanced their careers. UPWARD and Hipower have highly complimentary missions and we look forward to growing Hipower throughout UPWARD's many global chapters,\" said Mona Sabet, Founder of the Hipower program.\nFor the 2018 programming year, UPWARD will manage the Hipower Signature Program in Palo Alto and San Francisco, and will manage events for its alumni network . UPWARD will look to expand the Hipower program to its global chapters over time as part of its overall growth strategy.\nThe Hipower Executive Leadership Program challenges today's female leaders to discover their identity beyond their titles and organizations. An intimate group of selected candidates will form a cohort \"ring\" and will participate in a series of six workshops led by distinguished faculty and brand experts, concluded with a group off-site retreat. Ring members that have completed the program are also invited back to be part of the alumni network.\nAbout UPWARD\nUPWARD—Uniting Professional Women Accelerating Relationships and Development—is a global collaborative organization of like-minded, executive level, female professionals who come together to discuss the challenges women face and to identify creative solutions to overcome them. It's a supportive place where members can build trusted relationships, share ideas, learn new skills, and grow in their career. UPWARD provides a collection of programs for their members including mentoring clinics, workshops, topical discussions, Table of 10's, small groups and their inspiring annual dinner, featuring today's women leaders from diverse backgrounds and across multiple industries. www.upwardwomen.org\nAbout Hipower\nHipower is a tribe of women leaders laser-focused on accelerating one another's success. We use our platforms to drive the change we want to see in our society. We push each other, showcase each other's platforms, and use hard work and creativity to realize our visions. We thrive on our deep bonds with each other and within our communities. Each year, Hipower invites a small group of demonstrated women leaders to form a \"ring.\" Our premise is that a twelve-month commitment builds trust and the capacity to explore new boundaries as each participant answers the question, \"What do you want to be known for?\"\nContact: Charlene Pons, PR Contact\n190134@email4pr.com\n(408) 590-3356\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/upward-announces-acquisition-of-hipower-to-expand-breadth-of-offerings-for-professional-business-women-300597007.html\nSOURCE UPWARD",
