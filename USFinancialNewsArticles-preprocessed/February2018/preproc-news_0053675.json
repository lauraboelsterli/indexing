    "text": "Company Issues 2018 Guidance\nBRENTWOOD, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LifePoint Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: LPNT) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nThe following highlights the Company’s results of operations as presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017:\nSame-hospital revenues totaled $1,490.3 million, a decrease of 5.2% compared to the same period last year; Net loss totaled $27.0 million; Diluted loss per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders was $0.70; and Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $178.2 million, an increase of $75.7 million, or 73.9%, compared to the same period last year.\nIncluded in the Company’s results of operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, were the following non-operational adjustments:\n$72.6 million increase recorded to the provision for doubtful accounts, or $1.15 loss per diluted share, as a result of a change in the Company’s accounting estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable identified by the Company’s management during the process of installing new systems and developing enhanced analytical procedures in order to centralize, standardize and refine its estimation processes to more precisely estimate the collectability of accounts receivable at a more detailed and disaggregated level; $4.8 million in severance costs, or $0.08 loss per diluted share, associated with a reduction in force at the Company’s corporate headquarters; $43.2 million aggregate impairment charges, or $0.69 loss per diluted share, to write-down the carrying values of certain long-lived assets at two of the Company’s hospitals; and $18.0 million decrease in the provision for income taxes, or $0.45 earnings per diluted share, related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the Company’s deferred tax positions.\nWhen adjusted to exclude the four non-operational adjustments listed above, highlights of the Company’s normalized results of operations on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, were as follows:\nNormalized same-hospital revenues totaled $1,562.9 million, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the same period last year; Normalized net income totaled $31.3 million; Normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders were $0.77; and Normalized EBITDA totaled $181.9 million.\nAdditional information regarding normalized net income, normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders, Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA, including uses by management and others, and a reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures of financial performance, is set forth under the section titled “Unaudited Supplemental Information.”\nA supplemental presentation providing additional commentary on the Company’s normalized results of operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, can be found on the Company’s website at www.lifepointhealth.net/investor-relations .\nFor the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s normalized same-hospital revenues decreased $9.6 million, or 0.6%, to $1,562.9 million, compared to $1,572.5 million for the same period last year. The decrease in the Company’s normalized same-hospital revenues was primarily attributable to the transfer of its home health and hospice service lines to In-Home Healthcare Partnership (“IHHP”), a joint venture with LHC Group, Inc., which the Company does not consolidate. When adjusted to exclude the impact of the transfer of its home health and hospice service lines to IHHP, the Company’s normalized same-hospital revenues increased $6.4 million, or 0.4%, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period last year.\nWhen adjusted to exclude the four aforementioned fourth quarter 2017 non-operational adjustments, normalized net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $31.3 million, compared to net income of $46.6 million for the same period last year, and normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $0.77, compared to diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders of $1.07 for the same period last year.\nNormalized EBITDA for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $181.9 million, or 11.6% of normalized revenues, compared to $196.8 million, or 12.3% of revenues, for the same period last year. This decrease was primarily the result of the recognition of $8.8 million less in Medicare and Medicaid electronic health record (“EHR”) incentive payments during the current quarter compared to the same period last year.\nFull Year 2017\nThe following highlights the Company’s results of operations as presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nSame-hospital revenues totaled $5,941.3 million, a decrease of 0.8% compared to the prior year; Net income totaled $112.9 million; Diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders were $2.51; and Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $471.6 million, an increase of $36.4 million, or 8.4%, compared to the prior year.\nIn addition to the four aforementioned fourth quarter 2017 non-operational adjustments, the Company’s results of operations for the full years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, included the following additional non-operational adjustments:\n$28.8 million in aggregate net gains, or $0.35 earnings per diluted share, recognized throughout the first three quarters of 2017, related to the transfer of the Company’s home health agencies and hospices to IHHP; $18.0 million gain, or $0.28 earnings per diluted share, recognized in the first quarter of 2017, related to the settlement of a contingent liability previously established in connection with a prior hospital acquisition; $12.7 million net impairment loss, or $0.32 loss per diluted share, recognized in the third quarter of 2017, for the write-off of allocated goodwill, partially offset by gains on the sale of property, equipment and certain other assets, in connection with the disposal of Rockdale Medical Center (“Rockdale”) located in Conyers, Georgia, effective October 1, 2017; $24.7 million in charges for cardiology-related lawsuits, or $0.36 loss per diluted share, recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016; $22.0 million in debt transaction costs, or $0.32 loss per diluted share, recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016; and $1.2 million impairment loss, or $0.02 loss per diluted share, for the write-off of certain capital assets during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWhen adjusted to exclude all full year 2017 non-operational adjustments, highlights of the Company’s normalized results of operations on a non-GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2017, were as follows:\nNormalized same-hospital revenues totaled $6,013.9 million, an increase of 0.4% compared to the prior year; Normalized net income totaled $158.6 million; Normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders were $3.63; and Normalized EBITDA totaled $745.7 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s normalized same-hospital revenues increased $21.7 million, or 0.4%, to $6,013.9 million, compared to $5,992.2 million for the prior year. When adjusted to exclude the impact of the transfer of its home health and hospice service lines to IHHP, the Company’s normalized same-hospital revenues increased $71.8 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year.\nWhen adjusted to exclude all non-operational adjustments impacting the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, normalized net income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $158.6 million and $161.8 million, respectively, and normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were $3.63 and $3.52, respectively.\nNormalized EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $745.7 million compared to $746.5 million for the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of the recognition of $19.2 million less in Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments for the current year compared to the prior year, partially offset by effective cost management.\nCommenting on the results, William F. Carpenter III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LifePoint Health, said, “In 2017, we continued to focus on our strategic priorities and took a number of steps to support LifePoint Health’s position as a leader in the delivery of healthcare. Our fourth quarter financial performance, on a normalized basis, was in line with our expectations. Looking ahead to 2018, we are focused on driving margin improvement across all hospitals, particularly in those recently acquired where we have significant opportunity, maintaining our operating discipline and effectively managing costs and utilizing our financial strength to return capital to shareholders.”\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company also issued the following estimated guidance for 2018:\nRevenues $6.35 - $6.43 billion Same-hospital Revenue Growth 1.4% to 2.7% Adjusted EBITDA $725 - $765 million Diluted EPS $4.00 - $4.53 Capital Expenditures $475 - $500 million The Company’s 2018 guidance contains a number of assumptions, including:\nSame-hospital revenue growth excludes the 2017 results of Rockdale. Diluted EPS includes an estimated benefit of $0.69 to $0.78 earnings per diluted share as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 2018 guidance excludes, if applicable, the estimated impact of items that are non-operational in nature, including items such as, but not limited to, gains or losses on early debt retirements, impairments of long-lived assets, impairments of goodwill, changes as a result of the adoption of new accounting standards and share repurchases. 2018 guidance excludes the estimated impact of future acquisitions or disposals, if applicable. 2018 guidance is subject to certain risks, including those as set forth in the Company’s “Important Legal Information.”\nA listen-only simulcast, as well as a 30-day replay, of LifePoint Health’s fourth quarter and year-end 2017 conference call will be available on line at www.lifepointhealth.net/investor-relations today, Friday, February 23, 2018, beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nLifePoint Health (NASDAQ: LPNT) is a leading healthcare company dedicated to Making Communities Healthier®.

(2) Management and investors use equivalent admissions as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. The Company computes equivalent admissions by multiplying admissions (inpatient volumes) by the Outpatient factor. The equivalent admissions computation “equates” outpatient revenue to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. (3) Normalized revenues per equivalent admission excludes the impact of the $72.6 million increase recorded to the provision for doubtful accounts during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of a change in accounting estimate. (4) The sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue divided by gross inpatient revenue. (5) Same-hospital information includes the results of the Company’s health support center and the same 71 hospitals operated during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the same 69 hospitals operated during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Same-hospital information excludes the Company’s hospitals that have previously been disposed.\nLIFEPOINT HEALTH, INC.\nUNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs certain non-recurring gains or losses that are non-operational in nature and that it does not consider relevant in assessing its ongoing operating performance. When significant, LifePoint’s management and Board of Directors typically exclude these gains or losses when evaluating the Company’s operating performance and in certain instances when evaluating performance for incentive compensation purposes. Additionally, the Company believes that some investors and equity analysts exclude these or similar items when evaluating the Company’s current or future operating performance and in making informed investment decisions regarding the Company. Accordingly, the Company provides normalized net income and normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measures of net (loss) income and diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders, respectively. Normalized net income and normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders should not be considered measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and the items excluded from normalized net income and normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Normalized net income and normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net (loss) income or diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income to normalized net income (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income $ (27.0 ) $ 46.6 $ 112.9 $ 131.8 Adjustments (net of income taxes): Change in accounting estimate 46.0 – 46.0 – Severance costs 3.0 – 3.0 – Impairments of long-lived assets 27.3 – 27.3 0.8 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (18.0 ) – (18.0 ) – Gains on home health partnership transaction – – (14.4 ) – Gain on settlement of contingent liability – – (11.4 ) – Loss on disposal of hospital – – 13.2 – Cardiology-related lawsuits – – – 15.5 Debt transaction costs – – – 13.7 Normalized net income $ 31.3 $ 46.6 $ 158.6 $ 161.8 The following table reconciles diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income to normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders:\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders $ (0.70 ) $ 1.07 $ 2.51 $ 2.82 Adjustments (net of income taxes): Change in accounting estimate 1.15 – 1.13 – Severance costs 0.08 – 0.07 – Impairments of long-lived assets 0.69 – 0.67 0.02 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (0.45 ) – (0.44 ) – Gains on home health partnership transaction – – (0.35 ) – Gain on settlement of contingent liability – – (0.28 ) – Loss on disposal of hospital – – 0.32 – Cardiology-related lawsuits – – – 0.36 Debt transaction costs – – – 0.32 Normalized diluted earnings per share attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc. stockholders\n$ 0.77 $ 1.07 $ 3.63 $ 3.52\nLIFEPOINT HEALTH, INC.\nUNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (Continued)\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as earnings before depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; other non-operating losses, net; (benefit) provision for income taxes; and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests (when applicable for the periods presented). Additionally, Normalized EBITDA excludes the impact of the $72.6 million increase recorded to the provision for doubtful accounts during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of a change in the Company’s accounting estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable, $4.8 million in severance costs recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017, and $24.7 million in charges related to cardiology-related lawsuits recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016. LifePoint’s management and Board of Directors use Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes. LifePoint’s credit facilities use Adjusted EBITDA, subject to further permitted adjustments, for certain financial covenants. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA are measures of performance used by some investors, equity analysts, rating agencies and lenders to make informed decisions as to, among other things, the Company’s ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. In addition, multiples of current or projected Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA are used by some investors and equity analysts to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA should not be considered as measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income to Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA (in millions):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 % of % of % of % of Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Net (loss) income $ (27.0 ) (1.8 )% $ 46.6 2.9 % $ 112.9 1.8 % $ 131.8 2.1 % Less:\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests\n(0.5 ) – (2.7 ) (0.2 ) (10.5 ) (0.2 ) (9.9 ) (0.2 ) Net (loss) income attributable to LifePoint Health, Inc.
