    "text": "GANGNEUNG, South Korea, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson scored the winner in the shootout as the United States beat Canada 3-2 on Thursday to win their first gold medal in women’s Olympic ice hockey since 1998 and snap a streak of four consecutive golds for their arch-rivals.\nThe U.S. prevailed 3-2 in the shootout after the teams were tied 2-2 after regulation and a 20-minute overtime period.\nIt was a classic grudge match between the long-time rivals who are only two countries to have won gold in women’s ice hockey since it debuted at the Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in 1998.
