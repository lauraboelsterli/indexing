    "text": "BEIJING, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A blaze raged through a 20-storey office block in Zhengzhou, capital of Chinaâ€™s central province of Henan, on Thursday, sending heavy smoke into the sky above the city, state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nNo casualties had been reported, it said.\nSmoke and flames engulfed the entire eastern side of the building, CCTV said, with rescuers concerned that the blaze could spread to the rest of the block.\nFirefighters were battling the flames. CCTV footage showed the blaze first broke out on the 17th floor when insulation materials caught fire, the broadcaster said.\nThe cause of the fire was under investigation.
