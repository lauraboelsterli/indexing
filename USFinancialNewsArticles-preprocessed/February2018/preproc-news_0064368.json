    "text": " 52 a.m. ET Share \nLower court can consider constitutionality of indefinite detentions Getty Images The U.S. Supreme Court split along ideological lines. \nBy Jess Bravin \nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out a lower-court decision affording bail hearings to thousands of noncitizens held in federal lockups while they appeal deportation orders. \nVoting 5-3 along ideological lines, the justices found that the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had stretched the reading of federal immigration law when it ruled that the noncitizens are entitled to seek bail every six months. \nThe decision, by Justice Samuel Alito, didn’t completely end the case, however. It allows the San Francisco-based appellate court to consider whether the Constitution’s prohibition on arbitrary detention requires that the aliens have some opportunity to seek parole while their cases, which can take years to resolve, move through the courts. \nAhilan Arulanantham, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who argued the aliens’ case, said he was ready to argue that the no-bail policy is unconstitutional. “The Trump administration is trying to expand immigration detention to record-breaking levels as part of its crackdown on immigrant communities. We have shown through this case that when immigrants get a fair hearing, judges often release them based on their individual circumstances,” he said.",
