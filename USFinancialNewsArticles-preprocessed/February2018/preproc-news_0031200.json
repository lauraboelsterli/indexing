    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla., Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Phoenix Tower International (\"PTI\") via its subsidiary Phoenix Tower FWI, S.A.S. announces that it has closed its transaction with Digicel Antilles Francaises Guyane (\"Digicel\") to acquire the ownership or management rights relating to 215 wireless communication tower sites from Digicel. This latest transaction solidifies PTI's position as the premier tower company in the Caribbean. Terms of the transaction remain confidential between the parties.\n\"PTI is enthused to continue to work closely with Digicel and was uniquely positioned to execute this transaction given our existing presence in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.
