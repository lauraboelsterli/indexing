    "text": "CNBC.com Amy Langfield | CNBC A new Siemens-built Amtrak Cities Sprinter locomotive passes work crews in Hamilton, N.J., where a new substation and catenary system will support future high-speed rail. \nAn Amtrak train traveling in South Carolina collided with a CSX freight train on Sunday, killing two people and injuring at least 70. \nThe train with 139 passengers and eight crew members was traveling between New York and Miami when it hit the other train and derailed near Columbia, South Carolina, Amtrak officials said. \n\"Amtrak Train 91, operating between New York and Miami, came in contact with a CSX freight train at around 2:35 am in Cayce, South Carolina,\" Amtrak said in a statement to media. \n\"Local authorities are on the scene responding.\" \nThe derailment happened near Charleston Highway and Pine Ridge Road. \nLexington Country's Sheriff Department confirmed the deaths and injuries. TWEET \nThe department then confirmed that all the passengers were off the train. \nLater on Sunday during a press conference, Harrison Cahill, the public information officer for the County of Lexington, confirmed that two people were dead, but said at least 70 had been transported to hospitals for injuries. These injuries ranged from small scratches to broken bones. \nCahill also said that around 5,000 gallons of fuel had been spilled and is being secured. \nA reporter from local news network wis10 tweeted pictures of the crash.",
