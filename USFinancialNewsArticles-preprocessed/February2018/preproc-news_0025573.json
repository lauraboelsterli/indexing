In peripheral markets, the only major index that fell into the red by the close was the Athens Stock Exchange.\nStocks received a boost after markets in the States rallied during their morning trade.\nTDC in the spotlight, commodities soar Chemicals was one of the top performing sectors Monday, closing up 1.56 percent — after several rating upgrades boosted sector sentiment. Polymer solutions firm Victrex rose over 3 percent, following an upgrade from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Umicore jumped over 6 percent after Credit Suisse and Citigroup raised their price target on the stock.\nElsewhere, Delivery Hero popped 4.69 percent, following a target price increase from J.P. Morgan. LVMH rose 3 percent, after Societe Generale upgraded its rating to \"buy\" from \"hold.\"\nShares of Danish operator TDC soared 13.4 percent, making it the STOXX 600's top performer, after confirming that a consortium — made up of three Danish pension funds and Macquarie Infrastructure & Real Assets (MIRA) — had decided to initiate a takeover offer. TDC's chairman stated Monday that after reviewing their options, its board of directors recommended shareholders accept the offer.\nBasic resources and energy stocks also jumped, on the back of a strong uptick in commodity prices, as global markets showed signs of steadying. London-listed miners, including Anglo American , BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto , rose 2 percent each or more, as some metal prices ticked higher.\nshow chapters Market correction came three months late, strategist says 13 Hours Ago | 01:11 On the other hand, the French firm Ses dropped to the bottom of the index, off 11.18 percent, after announcing management changes.\nOn the earnings front, Heineken pared some of its losses, but closed down 0.88 percent, after the brewer lowered its margin growth target for 2018.\nIn other corporate news, Apollo has joined forces with a Dutch pension fund to buy part of Akzo Nobel 's business, the Financial Times reported.

On Monday, U.S. markets built upon Friday's gains, with the Dow up more than 250 points around Europe's close, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also posting strong gains.\nInternational Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde told CNBC over the weekend that \"there's been a market correction of anywhere between 6 to 9 percent\" and she described it as \"a welcome correction.\"\nLooking to politics, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday that the \"painful\" concessions made to her coalition party do not mean that her power has diminished ahead of her fourth term as leader.\nAround Europe's close, the White House budget called for $3 trillion in deficit reduction, which involved $1.7 trillion in mandatory spending cuts. In addition, the plan also proposed cutting down the discretionary spending by 2 percent a year after 2019.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
