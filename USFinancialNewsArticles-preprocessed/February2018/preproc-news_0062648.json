    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jones Energy, Inc. (NYSE:JONE) (“Jones Energy” or “the Company”) today announced financial and operating results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nBone 2H Meramec well achieved peak IP30 rate of 1,255 Boe/d which is 287 Boe/d per 1,000’ of lateral (67% oil, 2-stream). This well set a new Company record for highest peak IP30 oil rate (835 Bbls/d) achieved in the Merge.\nTwo Meramec wells on recent Gamble pad achieved average peak to-date rate of 226 Boe/d per 1,000’ of lateral (65% oil, 2-stream) which is 50% above type curve expectations.\nProduction for the full year 2017 of 7.8 MMBoe (21,332 MBoe/d).\nNet income for the fourth quarter 2017 of $41.6 million, or $0.51 per share. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss 1 of $28.8 million, or a loss of $0.33 per share.\nNet loss for the full year 2017 of $178.8 million and EBITDAX for the full year 2017 of $186.4 million 1 .\nJones Energy Founder, Chairman, and CEO, Jonny Jones commented, “2017 was a pivotal year for Jones Energy as we transitioned our focus to the Merge. During the fourth quarter, we had continued strong well results from the Merge, with production reaching roughly a quarter of total Company-wide production. Operationally, I could not be more pleased with our recent results. In particular, our Rosewood, Bone, and Gamble pads continue to meet or exceed type curves. During the fourth quarter, we also made significant progress with our lending group, receiving covenant relief and much-needed flexibility. We further increased flexibility with our successful senior secured first lien offering a few weeks ago. It is our strategic objective in 2018 to continue to exercise capital discipline and reduce cash flow outspend while enhancing the value of our assets.”\nFinancial Results\nTotal operating revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $54.5 million as compared to $39.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the full year 2017, operating revenues were $188.6 million as compared to $127.8 million for the full year 2016. Total revenues including current period settlements of matured derivative contracts were $255.4 million for the full year 2017 as compared to $251.1 million for the full year 2016.\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $60.8 million as compared to $62.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the full year 2017, operating expenses were $405.4 million, which includes impairment chages of $149.6 million. Omitting the 2017 full year impairment charges, total operating expenses would have been $255.7 million as compared to total operating expenses of $232.1 million for the full year 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $41.6 million, or $0.51 per share attributable to common shareholders, compared to fourth quarter of 2016 net loss of $52.2 million, or net loss of $0.49 per share attributable to common shareholders. For the full year 2017 the Company reported a net loss of $178.8 million, or a net loss of $1.51 per share compared to full year 2016 net loss of $84.8 million, or a net loss of $1.04 per share attributable to common shareholders.\nExcluding, on a tax-adjusted basis, certain items that the Company does not view as indicative of its ongoing financial performance, and adjusting for non-controlling interest, the Company had an adjusted net loss 2 for the fourth quarter 2017 of $28.8 million, or an adjusted net loss per share of $0.33, as compared to adjusted net loss of $5.3 million, or adjusted net loss per share of $0.06 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted net loss for the full year 2017 was $31.1 million, or an adjusted net loss per share of $0.42 attributable to common shareholders as compared to adjusted net loss of $15.5 million, or adjusted net loss per share of $0.19 attributable to common shareholders for the full year 2016.\nEarnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and exploration expense (“EBITDAX”) for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 was $37.7 million and $186.4 million, respectively 3 . This compares to fourth quarter and full year 2016 EBITDAX of $43.8 million and $188.0 million, respectively.\nFull year 2017 lease operating expense (“LOE”) was $36.6 million compared to the Company’s full year 2016 LOE of $32.6 million. Fourth quarter 2017 LOE of $8.9 million was approximately 4% higher than fourth quarter 2016 LOE of $8.6 million. On a dollar per Boe basis, full year 2017 LOE was $4.71 per Boe compared to full year 2016 LOE which was $4.64 per boe. Fourth quarter 2017 LOE of $4.59 per Boe was approximately 6% lower than fourth quarter 2016 LOE of $4.87.\nImpact of Recent Tax Reform\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which included among its provisions, a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The lower tax rate led to a remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, and resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of $17.2 million during the fourth quarter. The amount of the estimated liability under the Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) has also been reduced and is now recorded on the Company’s balance sheet at $61.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and the Company recognized a $59.5 million benefit in other income related to the reduction in the TRA liability in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the enacted tax legislation.\nOperating Results\nEastern Anadarko (Merge)\nThe Company is pleased to announce that its four-well Gamble pad has recently been placed on production. The pad is located in southern Canadian County, OK near the Company’s previously announced Garrett well. While the Gamble wells have not yet reached peak rates, two of the Meramec wells on the pad have achieved an average peak to-date rate of 226 Boe/d per 1,000’ of lateral (65% oil, 2-stream), which is 50% above Company expectations. Furthermore, the Company’s Bone 2H Meramec well that previously achieved a peak IP24 rate of 1,474 Boe/d, which is 337 Boe/d per 1,000’ of lateral (69% oil, 2-stream), has now achieved a peak IP30 rate for both its oil and gas streams of 1,255 Boe/d, which is 287 Boe/d per 1,000’ of lateral (67% oil, 2-stream). To-date the Company’s combined average of all eight of its Meramec wells that have achieved peak IP30 rates is 229 Boe/d per 1,000’ of lateral (47% oil, 2-stream). The Company has three Gen-3 Woodford wells that have reached peak IP30 rates, which have achieved a combined average of 153 Boe/d per 1,000’ of lateral (43% oil, 2-stream).\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company drilled a total of six wells and completed a total of 10 wells in the Merge as it continued with a two-rig program. The Company drilled its fastest well to-date in the Merge during the quarter, drilling a single section lateral in 8.3 days, surpassing its previous record which was set earlier in the fourth quarter of 9.2 days from Spud to TD. The Company exited the year with 17 wells producing and 12 wells in various stages of drilling and completion.\nWestern Anadarko (Cleveland)\nDuring October 2017, the Company drilled one well in the Cleveland and then released its last remaining rig in the Western Anadarko. The Company completed and placed online six wells that had been carried into the quarter.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Production\nAs previously reported, Jones Energy produced 1,951 MBoe, or 21,207 Boe/d during the fourth quarter of 2017 with total liquids volumes representing 59% of production. Merge production continued to increase quarter-over-quarter, representing approximately 24% of total Company production for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to approximately 17% of total Company production for the third quarter of 2017, excluding volumes related to the Arkoma divestiture in the third quarter. Quarter-over-quarter oil volumes also continued to increase. Oil production for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 29.3% of total volumes as compared to 24.6% for the third quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 4.7%.\nA breakout of fourth quarter production is shown in the table below.\nThree months ended December 31, 2017: Oil\n(MBbls) Natural Gas\n(MMcf) NGLs\n(MBbls) Total\n(MBoe) % of\nTotal Cleveland 426 3,210 417 1,378 71 % Merge 138 1,110 136 459 24 % Other 8 443 32 114 6 % Total 572 4,763 585 1,951 100 % For the full year 2017, Jones Energy produced 21,332 Boe/d with total liquids volumes of 56%.

The Company drilled 41 gross (38.3 net) wells in the Cleveland formation and 27 gross (17.4 net) wells in the Merge.\nCapital Expenditures for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017\nJones Energy previously disclosed total fourth quarter 2017 capital expenditures of $63.3 million, with $57.3 million, or 91%, related to drilling and completing operated wells.

EBITDAX is not a measure of net income as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Management believes EBITDAX is useful because it allows them to more effectively evaluate the Company’s operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period and against its peers without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. The Company excludes the items listed above from net income in arriving at EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within its industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. EBITDAX has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of the Company’s liquidity. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets. The Company’s presentation of EBITDAX should not be construed as an inference that its results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP. The Company’s computations of EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to EBITDAX for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Reconciliation of net income to EBITDAX Net income (loss) $ 41,633 $ (52,244 ) $ (178,823 ) $ (84,805 ) Interest expense 13,270 12,730 51,651 53,127 Exploration expense 2,507 5,436 14,145 6,673 Income taxes (47,960 ) (15,552 ) (50,667 ) (23,786 ) Depreciation and depletion 39,881 37,481 167,224 153,930 Impairment of oil and natural gas properties 1,632 — 149,648 — Accretion of ARO liability 240 350 960 1,263 Change in TRA liability (43,661 ) (362 ) (59,492 ) (784 ) Other non-cash charges 152 (25 ) 2,044 1,202 Stock compensation expense 558 2,156 6,260 7,425 Deferred and other non-cash compensation expense (127 ) 190 208 804 Net (gain) loss on derivative contracts 29,293 32,495 17,985 51,264 Current period settlements of matured derivative contracts 706 21,630 66,851 123,249 Amortization of deferred revenue (437 ) (556 ) (1,854 ) (2,384 ) (Gain) loss on sale of assets (4 ) 54 127 (14 ) (Gain) on debt extinguishment — — — (99,530 ) Financing expenses and other loan fees 25 23 97 321 EBITDAX $ 37,708 $ 43,806 $ 186,364 $ 187,955\nJones Energy, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations\nAdjusted net loss is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company defines Adjusted net loss as net income (loss) excluding the impact of certain non-cash items including gains or losses on commodity derivative instruments not yet settled, impairment of oil and gas properties, non-cash compensation expense, and the other items described below. The Company believes adjusted net loss is useful to investors because it provides readers with a more meaningful measure of its profitability before recording certain items for which the timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, this measure is provided in addition to, not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The Company believes adjusted net loss per share is useful to investors because it provides readers with a more meaningful measure of its profitability before recording certain items for which the timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, this measure is provided in addition to, not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
