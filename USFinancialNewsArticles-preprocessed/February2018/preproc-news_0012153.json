In cases where violations are found, the Disciplinary and Ethics Commission (Commission) may impose discipline ranging from a private censure or public letter of admonition to the suspension or revocation of an individual's right to use the CFP® marks. CFP Board's Disciplinary Rules and Procedures (Disciplinary Rules) set forth the process for investigating matters and imposing discipline where violations have been found.\nThe Commission meets at least three times a year to provide a fair, unbiased review of any matter in which a CFP® professional is alleged to have committed violations of the Standards.\nThe Commission functions in accordance with the Disciplinary Rules and reviews all matters on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the details specific to an individual case. While CFP Board has attempted to capture the details relevant to each decision, the summary nature of these releases may omit certain details affecting the decision. Accordingly, the decisions and/or rationale described in the releases may not apply to other cases reviewed by the Commission or reflect the Commission's future interpretation or application of the Standards.\nSTATE\nNAME\nLOCATION\nDISCIPLINE\nCalifornia\nAsh Narayan\nIrvine\nAdministrative Revocation\nColorado\nBrian D.

Havermann, CFP® (Arvada): In August 2017, CFP Board's Disciplinary and Ethics Commission (Commission) issued an order in which Mr. Havermann received a Letter of Admonition. The Commission issued its order after determining that Mr. Havermann: 1) failed to act with the duty of care of a fiduciary when he charged clients an unreasonable investment advisory fee because he valued assets under management that he purchased at a discount at the audited price of the asset; 2) failed to disclose or otherwise omitted facts where that disclosure was necessary to avoid misleading clients when he failed to disclose the risks involved with Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and non-traded REITS in his Form ADV Part 2; and 3) failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements when he failed to comply with Colorado statutes and regulations, which resulted in a Stipulation and Consent Order with the State of Colorado. The Commission determined that Mr. Havermann's conduct violated Rules 1.4, 2.1, and 4.3 of CFP Board's Rules of Conduct and provided grounds for discipline pursuant to Articles 3(A) and 3(D) of CFP Board's Disciplinary Rules and Procedures. Accordingly, the Commission admonished Mr. Havermann with regard to the above-mentioned conduct.\nCONNECTICUT\nGregory W.

In the settlement agreement, Mr. Ostrofsky consented to CFP Board's finding that he communicated misleading information to clients or prospective clients when he repeatedly represented his compensation method as \"fee-only\" on CFP Board's Find a CFP® Professional search tool. Mr. Ostrofsky's use of fee-only was misleading because he was registered with a broker-dealer, licensed, appointed and otherwise eligible to receive insurance commissions, and he collected commissions from the sale of annuities, insurance products, sale of equities, mutual funds, and other types of securities. Mr. Ostrofsky also consented to CFP Board's finding that he communicated false or misleading information to clients or prospective clients when he: 1) stated that he operated without any conflicts of interest; 2) suggested that he was not paid through commissions; and 3) stated that all advisors who earn commissions (a) do not act in the client's best interests, (b) make recommendations based on their own personal enrichment, and (c) fail to disclose to clients all relevant facts. CFP Board determined that Mr. Ostrofsky's conduct violated Rule 2.1 of CFP Board's Rules of Conduct and provided grounds for discipline pursuant to Article 3(A) of CFP Board's Disciplinary Rules and Procedures. Accordingly, the Commission admonished Mr. Ostrofsky with regard to the above-mentioned conduct and required Mr. Ostrofsky to take the remedial action of removing any language from his or his firm's website that would indicate an advisor that solely or primarily earns fees does not have conflicts of interest.\nMISSOURI\nMichael L. Bohannon, CFP® (Sikeston): In January 2018, CFP Board's Disciplinary and Ethics Commission (Commission) entered into a settlement agreement with Mr. Bohannon in which he received a Letter of Admonition and was required to complete 20 hours of remedial education.

At the time he completed the questionnaire, Mr. Bohannon was engaged in outside business activities that his firm had declined to approve. CFP Board determined Mr. Bohannon's conduct violated Rules 5.1 and 6.5 of CFP Board's Rules of Conduct and provided grounds for discipline pursuant to Articles 3(A) and 3(D) of CFP Board's Disciplinary Rules and Procedures.
