The Company’s lead product candidate, omadacycline, is a new, once-daily oral and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic being developed for the treatment of serious community-acquired bacterial infections, including community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), and urinary tract infections. Omadacycline has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation and Fast Track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the target indications of ABSSSI, CABP, uUTI and cUTI. Paratek has completed Phase 3 development activities for omadacycline in CABP and ABSSSI and has completed its New Drug Applications to the U.S. FDA and is preparing a marketing authorization in the European Union. Paratek has licensed rights for omadacycline to Zai Lab for the greater China region, and retains all remaining global rights.\nUnder a research agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense, omadacycline also is being studied against pathogenic agents causing infectious diseases of public health and biodefense importance, including plague and anthrax.\nParatek's second Phase 3 product candidate, Seysara™ (sarecycline), is being developed by Allergan in the U.S. as a new once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of acne. Allergan has completed Phase 3 development activities for Seysara and its new drug application was accepted for review by the U.S. FDA in December 2017. Paratek retains all ex-U.S. rights to sarecycline.\nRecognizing the serious threat of bacterial infections, Paratek is dedicated to providing solutions that enable positive outcomes and lead to better patient stories.\nFor more information, visit www.ParatekPharma.com or follow @ParatekPharma on Twitter.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements including statements related to our overall strategy, product candidates, clinical studies, prospects, potential and expected results, including statements about the timing of advancing omadacycline and otherwise preparing for clinical studies, the timing of enrollment in our clinical studies and our reporting of the results of such studies, the potential for omadacycline to serve as an empiric monotherapy treatment option for patients suffering from ABSSSI, CABP, UTI, and other bacterial infections when resistance is of concern, the prospect of omadacycline providing broad-spectrum activity, and our ability to obtain regulatory approval of omadacycline.
