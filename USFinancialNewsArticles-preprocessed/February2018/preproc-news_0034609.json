    "text": "  in 43 minutes Insurer Lancashire warns of tough year ahead, swings to loss Reuters Staff 1 Min Read Feb 15 (Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Lancashire Holdings Ltd forecast that 2018 would be another challenging year for the industry, and swung to a full-year loss as it weathered the costliest year ever for insurers and reinsurers due to natural catastrophes. The company, which writes policies for heavy-duty assets such as oil rigs, ships and aircraft, reported a pretax loss of $72.9 million for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2017. It had reported a pretax profit of $150.4 million a year ago. The insurer’s gross written premiums fell about 6.7 percent to $591.6 million in the period, and its combined ratio deteriorated to 124.9 percent from 76.5 percent last year. “I expect 2018 to be another challenging year for our industry, but I am confident... that the Lancashire Group has the appropriate business model, talent and access to capital to maximise underwriting opportunities to benefit our shareholders,” CEO Alex Maloney said.
