    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- L Brands, Inc. (NYSE:LB) reported net sales of $1.040 billion for the five-week period ended Feb. 3, 2018, compared to sales of $805.2 million for the four-week period ended Jan. 28, 2017. The fifth week in January 2018 represented approximately $150 million in sales and $0.07 in earnings per share. The company reported comparable sales for the five weeks ended Feb. 3, 2018, increased 7 percent compared to the five weeks ended Feb. 4, 2017.\nNet sales were $4.823 billion for the 14-week fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, 2018, compared to $4.489 billion for the 13 weeks ended Jan. 28, 2017. Comparable sales for the 14-week fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, 2018, increased 2 percent compared to the 14 weeks ended Feb. 4, 2017.\nNet sales were $12.632 billion for the 53-week year ended Feb. 3, 2018, compared to $12.574 billion for the 52 weeks ended Jan. 28, 2017. Comparable sales for the 53 weeks ended Feb. 3, 2018, decreased 3 percent compared to the 53 weeks ended Feb. 4, 2017. For the 53 weeks ended Feb. 3, 2018, the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of about 3 percentage points and 5 percentage points to total company and Victoria’s Secret comparable sales, respectively.\nBefore the effect of any significant items, including the impact of tax reform legislation, the company expects to report fourth quarter earnings per share of about $2.05, compared to its previous guidance of about $2.00. The increase versus the previous guidance relates to a lower projected tax rate of about 34 percent (which does not include any impact from tax reform legislation), compared to guidance of 36.5 percent.\nTo hear further commentary provided on L Brands’ prerecorded January sales message, call 1-866-639-7583 or log onto www.LB.com for an audio replay.
