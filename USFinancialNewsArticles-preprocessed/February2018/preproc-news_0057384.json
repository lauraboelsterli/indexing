    "text": "5 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The nation’s top telecommunications regulator on Monday laid out his plan for accelerating the development of 5G wireless service in the U.S. through market-oriented approaches.\nFederal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, in a speech to the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, said he would aim to auction two chunks of the airwaves for next-generation wireless service this fall, as the U.S. seeks to win an emerging global race to roll out the technology.\nTo carry out his plan, Mr. Pai said, the agency needs quick action from Congress to remove a bureaucratic barrier that could hinder the planned fall auctions. He has said big banks are no longer willing to hold pre-auction payments from carriers because of the banks’ capitalization and collateralization requirements. So the FCC is seeking a change from Congress to allow the Treasury Department to hold the prepayments.\nCongress must act by May 13 for the fall auctions to take place on schedule, Mr. Pai said.\nThe competition to develop next-generation wireless service is expected to be crucial because 5G is eventually expected to support large new markets, including autonomous vehicles as well as the so-called Internet of Things. The 5G service will rely extensively on mid- and high-band portions of the airwaves that previously have been regarded as ill-suited for wireless.\nMr. Pai’s speech suggested he wants to reassure officials and investors that the U.S. remains a powerful force in the race to 5G.\nA leaked government memo on 5G recently suggested some U.S. officials fear the U.S. is falling behind China in developing the potentially-lucrative technology. The memo noted that China has used extensive government intervention to aid its telecommunications firms in developing 5G technologies.\nMr. Pai was among officials in Washington who criticized the memo’s recommendations for greater U.S. government intervention in 5G. But administration officials say they are still examining how to ensure U.S. success in 5G.\nFCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, also has been ramping up pressure over the FCC’s auction schedule, noting at last week’s FCC meeting that other nations are moving at “warp speed” to auction 5G spectrum. She tweeted last week that it’s “time -- past time -- for the @FCC to schedule its next spectrum auction.”\nMr. Pai, a Republican, said in his speech that he wants the U.S. “to be the best country for innovating and investing in 5G networks.”\nHe added that “government’s role is not to command and control, but to enable and encourage.”\nHouse Republicans cheered Mr. Pai’s remarks. In a statement, House Commerce Chairman Greg Walden (R., Ore.) and subcommittee chairman Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) said the race to 5G “is a sprint, not a marathon, and the proposed spectrum auctions will help ensure the United States remains at the forefront of this emerging technology.”\nThe U.S. also faces other challenges in rolling out 5G, including finding ways to cut through red tape that sometimes slows the construction of telecommunications infrastructure. Those bottlenecks could be especially acute for 5G service that relies on the high-band spectrum Mr. Pai wishes to auction. That is because it will require thousands of new small antennas to pick up phone signals.\nThe government also is stepping up efforts to speed 5G development in some mid-band spectrum that doesn’t require so much physical infrastructure. The Commerce Department’s telecommunications office announced Monday that it would study some mid-band spectrum for 5G.\nAnd Mr. Pai said the FCC in coming months would propose steps to make more mid-band spectrum available for commercial use and would move forward by year’s end on new unlicensed uses in other bands.\nWrite to John D.
