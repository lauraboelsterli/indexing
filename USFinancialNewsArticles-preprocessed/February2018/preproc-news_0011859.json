(www.evertonfc.com) \nThe 26-year-old, who joined City from Porto in 2014 and spent most of last season on loan in Valencia, has made nine league appearances this season, including five from the bench. \nHe is Everton’s third signing of the January window, following the arrivals of winger Theo Walcott from Arsenal and striker Cenk Tosun from Besiktas.
