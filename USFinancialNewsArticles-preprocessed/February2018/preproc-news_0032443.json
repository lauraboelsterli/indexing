    "text": " 00 AM / Updated 32 minutes ago Russian opposition leader Navalny says access to his website being blocked Reuters Staff 1 Min Read MOSCOW (Reuters) - Opposition leader Alexei Navalny said on Thursday that Internet providers in Russia had started blocking access to his website on the orders of the countryâ€™s communications watchdog. Navalny said on social media that Roscomnadzor, the regulator, had said last week it would block access to his site based on a court order obtained by billionaire Oleg Deripaska unless certain material was removed from it. Deripaska has accused Navalny of spreading lies about him. Reporting by Polina Devitt; Writing by Denis Pinchuk; Editing by Andrew Osborn",
