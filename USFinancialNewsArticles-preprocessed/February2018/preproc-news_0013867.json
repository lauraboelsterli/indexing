It appears another partial outage began around 12:40 pm and our IT team is working to resolve the issue now. This partial outage has no impact on flight operations,” Spirit spokesman Stephen Schuler said. \nThe carrier said on Twitter it was waiving boarding pass fees at the airport while passengers are unable to print tickets from the website. \nSpirit’s pricing model keeps ticket prices low but charges fees for such services as boarding pass printing, luggage and other add-ons. \n“@SpiritAirlines #trying to book a ticket.. website is down ... please hire some good engineers,” user @AjKumar28 wrote on Twitter. \nSpirit shares edged up 0.3 percent to $40.58 in afternoon trading.
