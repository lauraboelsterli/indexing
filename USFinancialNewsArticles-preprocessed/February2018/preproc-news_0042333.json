    "text": "In Staten Island, You're Either a Hustler or You're Getting Hustled\nWatch Preview Here\nENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J. — February 22, 2018 — CNBC today announced the network's new primetime original series, \"Staten Island Hustle,\" will debut Wednesday, April 11 th at 10PM ET/PT. The six episode entrepreneurial series follows a group of animated friends and businessmen from Staten Island who have yet to come up with an idea or product too far-fetched for them to invest in. Without MBAs (or even college degrees) these men prove that grit, ingenuity, and imagination may be the real key to success. Of course, it helps that somebody's always \"got a guy\" with the right connection or a good hook-up.\n\"Our shows celebrate the hustle – plain and simple. No matter who you are, what you do, or where you're from, it's the drive to succeed that counts,\" said Jim Ackerman, EVP, Primetime Alternative Programming, CNBC. \"No one embodies that drive better than these five guys who are all about hatching plans and having fun while they're at it.\"\nEvery week, these born hustlers meet to discuss what big ideas they are cooking up. They all have different skills and different day jobs but, together, they're looking to strike it rich. Whether it's hustling, bartering or negotiating, these fellas always figure out a way to get the deal done.\nMeet the \"Staten Island Hustle\" Crew:\nUNCLE DOM DETORE – \"THE BOSS\"\nUncle Dom Detore, \"The Boss,\" is a commercial/residential building contractor based out of Staten Island. He's constantly overseeing construction projects all over New York and New Jersey and negotiating deals in the 7-9 figure range. Through his business, Dom knows a lot of people in New York and has 'got a guy' for just about anything. Dom, along with his wife Janine, live on Staten Island with their seven children, including Dom's oldest daughter Jeannie who has managed to turn her own hustle into a thriving fashion business.\nBIG RON MONTANA – \"THE HUSTLER\"\nBig Ron Montana earned the nickname \"The Hustler\" as he is by far the biggest hustler of the crew. What he lacks in business degrees, he makes up for in street smarts and drive. Ron is known for his loyalty and demands every deal be fair, letting everyone know if he doesn't think something adds up.\nADOLFO LACOLA – \"THE PROFESSOR\"\nAdolfo LaCola, \"The Professor,\" is the intellectual in the group and the only one with a college degree. Adolfo earned respect in the hip hop community as co-owner of Ghostface Killah's record label, Starks Enterprises. He currently spends a lot of time in Los Angeles as well as New York with multiple business ventures on each coast, and is proud to be on the cutting edge of emerging markets.\nMIKE PALMER – \"THE NEGOTIATOR\"\nMike Palmer, also known as \"Moose,\" owns an auto repair and collision shop and is friends with everyone on the island. As the charmer and salesman of the group, Mike has a way of diffusing hostile situations and ultimately getting compromises and closing deals. Mike manages the groups' business relationships and serves as the voice of reason.\nTONY D. – \"MR. WALL STREET\"\nTony D. is a Wall Street veteran with over 30 years of experience. He mentors and teaches a lecture series on investing, and is credited with training over eighteen thousand financial advisors. Tony focuses on whether or not the numbers make sense, takes care of the legal work, patents, contracts, professional business plans and often helps secure funding for many of their projects.\nProduced by Left Hook Media and Endemol Shine North America.
