    "text": "National Weather Service: No East Coast tsunami warning Published 1 Hour Ago Updated 4 Mins Ago The Associated Press \nSome people on the East Coast got a push alert on their phones about a tsunami warning, but the National Weather Service says it was just a test. \nMeteorologist Hendricus Lulofs said there was a glitch Tuesday during a routine test. That meant some people received what looked like an actual warning on their phones. He says the National Weather Service is trying to sort what happened. National Weather Service tweet \nOfficials said it appeared to be an issue with the popular Accuweather app. Accuweather didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. \nJeremy DaRos, of Portland, Maine, says the push from Accuweather made him \"jump,\" because he lives a stone's throw from the water. He said that after clicking on the push notification for details he realized it was just a test.",
