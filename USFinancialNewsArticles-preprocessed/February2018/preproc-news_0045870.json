    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Stream Realty Partners today announced it has expanded the Houston industrial leasing team with the hire of Bryan O'Hair as Vice President. With one of the largest industrial portfolios in the city, Stream continues to drive growth across all aspects of the industrial platform, including leasing, property management and principle activities. Bryan will join the team, led by Managing Director Matteson Hamilton, and primarily focus on leasing and identifying new opportunities both on the service and principal side of the business.\n\"Stream's Houston industrial group started in 2006 with one client â€“ and in 2018, we have truly grown this platform to unsurpassable measures through hard work and an entrepreneurial mindset,\" said Hamilton. \"We are extremely proud of what we have accomplished and see Bryan's position playing an instrumental role in our team's continued growth, as it feels like we have just scratched the surface in Houston.\"\nBryan brings a unique background to Stream with 11 years of real estate experience, most recently in asset management for USAA Real Estate Company in San Antonio where he oversaw 15 million square feet across 12 markets in North America. Prior to USAA, he worked for Prologis in Houston, where he negotiated and closed approximately 400 industrial lease transactions totaling over 10 million square feet.\n\"I couldn't be more excited to join a best-in-class industrial team and take advantage of the entrepreneurial platform Stream affords,\" said O'Hair. \"It's a unique opportunity that allows me to increase my transaction experience and find new business opportunities for the team.\"\nIn the most recent Stream quarterly report, the overall Houston industrial market is recorded at 4.8 percent vacant, signaling a very healthy market going into 2018. \"Due to a dramatic shift in leasing fundamentals, it's been a time of extreme growth for industrial in Houston,\" said Justin Robinson, Managing Partner at Stream. \"Our expanded industrial leasing team is a direct reflection of our commitment to clients and providing exceptional service.\"\nWith over 120 million square feet of assignments across the nation and over $2.4 billion in real estate transactions annually, Stream is considered one of the most active investors and developers in the country.
