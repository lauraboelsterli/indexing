(Nasdaq:CRUS), a leader in high performance, low-power ICs for audio and voice signal processing applications, today posted on its website at http://investor.cirrus.com the quarterly Shareholder Letter that contains the complete financial results for the third quarter fiscal year 2018, which ended Dec. 30, 2017, as well as the company’s current business outlook.\n“Unanticipated weakness in smartphone demand that materialized in late December drove our Q3 results below expectations and further impacted our Q4 guidance,” said Jason Rhode, president and chief executive officer. “Despite these near-term challenges, our design position remains strong at our top customers and our wide range of new and existing products are expected to drive exciting opportunities in audio and voice applications across the smartphone, digital headset and smart home markets over the next several years.”\nReported Financial Results – Third Quarter FY18\nRevenue of $482.7 million; GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 48.7 percent and 48.8 percent, respectively; GAAP operating expenses of $131.6 million and non-GAAP operating expenses of $107.9 million; and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.52 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.59. Results include an additional week as approximately every 6 years our financial results are comprised of 53 weeks versus the typical 52 weeks.\nA reconciliation of the non-GAAP charges is included in the tables accompanying this press release.\nBusiness Outlook – Fourth Quarter FY18\nRevenue is expected to range between $300 million and $340 million; GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 48 percent and 50 percent; and Combined GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to range between $130 million and $136 million, which includes approximately $13 million in share-based compensation and $13 million in amortization of acquired intangibles.\nShare Repurchase Authorization\nThe company also announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $200 million of the company's common stock, in addition to the $60.2 million remaining from the Board’s previous share repurchase authorization in October 2015. The repurchases will be funded from working capital and anticipated cash from operations and may occur from time to time depending on a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions and other corporate considerations. The share repurchase program is designed to comply with all applicable securities laws and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.\nCirrus Logic will host a live Q&A session at 5 p.m. EST today to answer questions related to its financial results and business outlook.
