    "text": "Published: Feb 21, 2018 7:15 a.m. ET Share \nAttorney general’s office had claimed the company dumped PFC from 1950 until the early 2000s, in the ground and into Mississippi River \nBy Andrew Tangel \n3M Co. will pay $850 million to settle Minnesota’s lawsuit, claiming the manufacturer contaminated water in the state for at least five decades. \nThe deal reached by the company and state’s attorney general was announced hours after a trial over the suit was slated to begin Tuesday. \nMinnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson had accused 3M MMM, -0.68% of contaminating the state’s water supply by dumping millions of pounds of waste into the ground and water from the production of fluorochemicals, or PFCs, that the company used in its Scotchgard product for protecting furniture and carpets from stains. \nThe attorney general’s office claimed the company dumped PFC from 1950 until the early 2000s, in the ground and into the Mississippi River. The affected areas include those near 3M’s headquarters in St. Paul, Minn. \nThe synthetic substances are considered harmful to humans and wildlife, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency says studies have shown PFCs may affect “growth and development, reproduction, and injure the liver.” ",
