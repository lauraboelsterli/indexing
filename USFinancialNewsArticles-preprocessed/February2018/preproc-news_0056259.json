    "text": "HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish sauna heater maker Harvia has what it takes to become a listed company, its chief executive said on Friday, adding that sales grew and profitability improved last year.\n“Listing is a real option for us, eventually ... in terms of operation, reporting and so forth, we are ready,” CEO Tapio Pajuharju told Reuters by telephone.\n“But there’s no timetable for that, and the owners might have other options in mind as well.”\nPajuharju denied local media reports that Harvia, one of the leading companies in the global sauna market, was due to present a flotation plan on Friday.\nPrivate equity firm Capman, which bought a 72 percent stake in the company in 2014, was not available for a comment.\nHarvia had sales of 50 million euros ($61.5 million) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about 12 million euros in 2016. Pajuharju declined to disclose 2017 figures, but said sales grew and profitability improved.\nFinnish alcoholic drinks company Altia said on Friday it planned to list on the Helsinki bourse next month.\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl, editing by David Evans\n ",
