    "text": "Higher education faces massive changes in President Trump's spending plan released on Monday.\nThe proposal would sharply curtail income-based loan repayment plans, scratch the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and embolden the government to go after students who don't pay their loans. \nChanges to loans would apply to borrowing after July 1, 2019, not including those loans provided to borrowers to finish their current education. \nThe budget would eliminate subsidized loans. Some 5.7 million students had subsidized loans in the 2016-2017 academic year, according to Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert. \nThe budget plan also would narrow the number of income-driven repayment plans — in which people pay back their loans at a rate that takes into consideration their income — from four to just one. Under that option, students' monthly payments would be capped at 12.5 percent. Students generally pay 10 percent of their discretionary income under current income-based repayment plans.\nshow chapters Trump's infrastructure and budget plan 'science fiction': Axios editor      7 Hours Ago | 03:04 However, undergraduate students would have their loans forgiven after 15 years, compared with 20 years now. So they'd be paying more per month, but less overall. Graduate students, meanwhile, would not have their loans forgiven for 30 years.\nGraduate students pay more \"Graduate students would be paying significantly more,\" Kantrowitz said. \nPell Grants would be expanded to cover short-term, training programs. \nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is eliminated in the proposed budget. This program allows former students who fulfill certain public service positions — such as public school teachers or health researchers — to have their loans erased after 10 years of on-time payments. Nearly two-thirds of student loan borrowers who've shown interest in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness earn less than $50,000 a year. \n\"You may have fewer people pursuing degrees in areas that will lead to public service occupations,\" said Kantrowitz. \"You won't have as many prosecutors and pubic defenders. You won't have as many people pursing law enforcement or becoming EMTs, firemen and members of the military.\" \nPeople whose loans fall into delinquency would be subject to more stringent enforcement as the proposal also calls to \"streamline the Department of Education's ability to verify applicants' income data held by the Internal Revenue Service.\" \nSome 30 programs would also lose funding, including the Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants, 21st Century Community Learning Centers and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant programs. \nThe president's proposal is subject to approval by Congress and is likely to be modified by legislators.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nBitcoin, once 'sketchy,' becomes more mainstream \nSome cryptocurrency-backed debit cards dropped from Visa network, leaving users scrambling \nBitcoin is too risky to treat as a 'serious' investment, financial advisers say",
