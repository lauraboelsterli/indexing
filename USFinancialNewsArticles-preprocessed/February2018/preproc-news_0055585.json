    "text": "HOLLYWOOD, Florida, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Several parties are interested in buying Freeport-McMoRan Inc’s cobalt project in the Democratic Republic of Congo but the purchase price would not be very impactful for the miner, Freeport’s chief executive said.\nAs a result, it is looking at other options for the asset, including possibly a joint venture to develop the large cobalt project, CEO Richard Adkerson said, speaking at the BMO Capital Markets Global Metals & Mining Conference in Hollywood, Florida.
