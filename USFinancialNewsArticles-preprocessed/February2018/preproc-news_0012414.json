    "text": "Qualcomm shares fell 2 percent on Monday after KGI Securities said Apple might drop the chipmaker in favor of Intel as the supplier for modem chips in its next generation of iPhones.\nQualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years but the relationship took a bad turn last year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.\n\"There is speculation that Apple might drop Qualcomm altogether for its next generation phones and I think that's part of the reason the stock is down today,\" said Angelo Zino, an analyst from CFRA Research.\nAccording to technology news website 9TO5MAC , KGI said that Intel could meet Apple's technical requirements and offer more competitive prices.\nIntel shares were up 1 percent at $46.66.\nThe report from KGI came as Broadcom sweetened its bid to buy Qualcomm to more than $121 billion from an earlier $103 billion.\nReuters has not seen the note from KGI, whose Ming-Chi Kuo is among the financial world's best known Apple analysts.\nApple could not immediately be reached for comment.",
