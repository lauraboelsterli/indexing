    "text": "BOTHELL, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Seattle Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGEN) today announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 11,538,461 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $52.00 per share. All of the shares are being sold by Seattle Genetics. The gross proceeds to Seattle Genetics from the offering, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, are expected to be approximately $600.0 million. The offering is expected to close on or about February 5, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. In addition, Seattle Genetics has granted the underwriters of the offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,730,769 shares of its common stock solely to cover over-allotments at the public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions.\nSeattle Genetics anticipates using the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the costs of the acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics, Inc. In the event that Seattle Genetics does not consummate such acquisition, Seattle Genetics expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for the ongoing commercialization of ADCETRIS ® (brentuximab vedotin) in the United States and Canada, its research and development efforts designed to further expand the ADCETRIS label and the advancement of its pipeline of product candidates, as well as for general corporate purposes, including working capital.\nBarclays Capital Inc. and J.P.
