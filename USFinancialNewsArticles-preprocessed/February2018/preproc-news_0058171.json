That came below average estimate of 19.50 trillion rupiah, according to 15 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAstra’s overall income was boosted its resources-related subsidiaries, such as PT United Tractors and palm plantation company PT Astra Agro Lestari, both of which benefited from a rebound in commodity prices.\nIncome from its financial businesses also helped Astra’s overall performance as Bank Permata, which 45 percent controlled by Astra, swung to a profit of 748 billion rupiah in 2017, from a loss of 6.5 trillion rupiah a year earlier.\n“After recording an overall good performance in 2017, Astra Group is expected to continue benefiting from improving economic condition and stability in commodity prices, despite rising competition in car market,” Prijono Sugiarto, president director of Astra, said in a statement.
