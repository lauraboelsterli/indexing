    "text": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - Dassault Systemes said on Thursday its new licences revenue for the full-year came in slightly above its own estimates, mainly boosted by strong brands like Solidworks.\nFrench 3D software producer’s annual new licences revenue rose 11 percent, above its 8-10 percent growth forecast. The group’s annual operating margin rose about 32 percent.\nDespite reaching most of its objectives for 2017, the company is still facing currency headwinds. The negative effect from currency is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2018, it said. (Reporting by Manon Jacob; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)\n ",
