The Hang Seng China Enterprises index rose 1.41 percent to 12,572.09.\n** China stock markets will reopen on Thursday after the Lunar New Year holiday. ** The sub-index of the Hang Seng tracking energy shares rose 1.3 percent while the IT sector rose 1.1 percent, the financial sector was 1.11 percent higher and property sector rose 0.36 percent. ** The top gainer on Hang Seng was Want Want China Holdings Ltd up 3.18 percent, while the biggest loser was Wharf Real Estate Investment Co Ltd which was down 0.79 percent. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was firmer by 0.46 percent while Japan’s Nikkei index eased 0.16 percent. ** As of the previous trading session, the Hang Seng index was up 3.19 percent this year, while China’s H-share index was up 5.9 percent.
