    "text": "MAPUTO (Reuters) - The southern hemisphere summer rainy season has killed 50 people in Mozambique since October, the countryâ€™s National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC) said in its latest update on Thursday.\nThis figure includes 17 people killed in the capital Maputo on Monday when a 15-metre pile of garbage collapsed due to heavy rain and buried seven houses.\nElsewhere, torrential rains and winds have caused flooding, including in the gas-rich north of the country, with 7,200 dwellings destroyed and 130,000 people affected.\nLow-lying areas of Mozambique, a tropical African nation with a huge Indian Ocean coastline, are often hit by floods, which in some years in the past have killed hundreds of people.\nMuch of southern Africa including Mozambique is still recovering from a devastating drought two years ago and the dry, compacted soil increases the potential for flooding as rainfall is less easily absorbed into the parched ground.\nReporting by Manuel Mucari; Editing by Ed Stoddard and Toby Chopra\n ",
