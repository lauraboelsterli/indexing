    "text": "February 15, 2018 / 10:49 AM / in 34 minutes FBI was warned about Florida man accused of killing 17 at school Bernie Woodall , Zachary Fagenson 6 Min Read PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation was warned in September about an ominous online comment by the 19-year-old man accused of killing 17 people at his former high school but was unable to locate him, an agent said on Thursday. Authorities said the ex-student, identified as Nikolas Cruz, walked into the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, near Miami, on Wednesday and opened fire with an AR-15-style assault rifle in the second-deadliest shooting at a public school in U.S. history. (For a graphic on Florida school shooting click tmsnrt.rs/2nX8ECo ) Cruz may have left warning signs on social media in the form of a comment on a YouTube video that read “I‘m going to be a professional school shooter.” That comment troubled the person whose video Cruz commented on, Mississippi bail bondsman Ben Bennight, who passed it on to the FBI, according to a video he posted online late Wednesday. “No other information was included with that comment which would indicate a time, location or the true identity of the person who made the comment,” FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Lasky told reporters. Investigators were unable to find the commenter, he added. The FBI is conducting an extensive review of how it handled that tip to see if mistakes were made, a federal law enforcement official told Reuters. Wednesday’s shooting was the 18th in a U.S. school this year, according to gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety. It stirred the long-simmering U.S. debate on the right to bear arms, which is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. President Donald Trump addressed the shooting in a White House speech that emphasized school safety and mental health while avoiding any mention of gun policy. “It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference,” Trump said at the White House. “We must actually make that difference.” Broward County schools superintendent Robert Runcie called for action on gun laws. “Now is the time for this country to have a real conversation on sensible gun control laws,” Runcie told a news conference. Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives criticized the Republican leadership for refusing to take up legislation on tightening background checks for prospective gun buyers. “It’s appalling,” Representative Mike Thompson told reporters. “Thirty people every day are killed by someone using a gun, and the best we can do is say we need more information?” The Republican-controlled Congress last year revoked Obama-era regulations meant to make it harder for those with severe mental illness to pass FBI background checks for guns, saying the rule deprived the mentally ill of their gun rights.

REUTERS/Susan Stocker/Pool At least one member of Trump’s cabinet called for action. “Personally I think the gun violence, it’s a tragedy what we’ve seen yesterday, and I urge Congress to look at these issues,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers. Fifteen people were injured in Wednesday’s shooting, according to local hospital officials. ‘BROKEN HUMAN BEING’ Cruz’s court-appointed lawyer said he had expressed remorse for his crimes. Slideshow (25 Images) “He’s a broken human being,” public defender Melisa McNeill told reporters. “He’s sad, he’s mournful he’s remorseful.” Cruz had done paramilitary training with a white nationalist militia called the Republic of Florida, a leader of the group said. “He had some involvement with the Clearwater Republic of Florida cell at some point,” Jordan Jereb said in a telephone interview. Reuters could not immediately verify the claim. Cruz loved guns and had been expelled from high school for disciplinary reasons, police and former classmates said. Authorities said he marched into the school wearing a gas mask and tossed smoke grenades, as well as pulling a fire alarm that sent students and staff pouring from classrooms as he began his rampage, according to Florida’s two U.S. senators, who were briefed by federal authorities.
