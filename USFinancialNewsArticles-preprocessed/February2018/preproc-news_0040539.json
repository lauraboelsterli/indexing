    "text": "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Sweden’s Hanna Oeberg made all 20 shots to pull off a shock victory in the women’s Olympic 15km individual biathlon on Thursday, holding off Germany’s double Olympic champion Laura Dahlmeier who had to settle for third after a costly early miss.\nOeberg shot clean and skied brilliantly to finish in a time of 41:07.2 minutes, 24.7 seconds ahead of Anastasiya Kuzmina of Slovakia who missed two shots but still managed to add another silver medal to the one she won in Monday’s pursuit race.
