    "text": "Full-year 2017 financial results on target excluding the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Initiating 2018 earnings guidance of $2.10 to $2.25 per diluted share Filed 2019 General Rate Case with the Oregon Public Utility Commission\nPORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR) today reported net income based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $187 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares with $193 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. After adjusting for the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), non-GAAP net income was $204 million, or $2.29 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. GAAP-based net income was $42 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares with $61 million, or 68 cents per diluted share, for the comparable period of 2016. After adjusting for the impacts of the TCJA, non-GAAP net income was $59 million, or 67 cents per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Looking forward, the company is initiating full-year 2018 earnings guidance of $2.10 to $2.25 per diluted share.\n“I’m very proud of our employees’ accomplishments in delivering outstanding service to our growing customer base and in collaborating with our stakeholders and customers on our Integrated Resource Plan,” said Maria Pope, president and CEO. “We are focused on meeting customer expectations for safe, reliable, affordable, clean and secure energy.”\n2017 earnings compared to 2016 earnings\nBefore reflecting the impact of the TCJA, annual earnings per diluted share increased year-over-year. Favorable weather had a positive impact on gross margin. This impact was partially offset by adjustments to net deferred taxes as a result of the TCJA, increased service restoration expenses resulting from unusually high storm activity, and depreciation expense and carrying costs related to previously reported incremental construction costs for Carty. Additionally, annual earnings per diluted share decreased due to lower production tax credit generation, higher depreciation and amortization expenses related to additional investments, and higher employee benefits expenses.\n2018 earnings guidance\nPGE is initiating full-year 2018 earnings guidance of $2.10 to $2.25 per diluted share, which includes the impact of warmer than normal weather in January 2018. Additional assumptions include the following:\nA decline in retail deliveries between 0 and 1 percent, weather adjusted; Average hydro conditions; Wind generation based on five years of historical levels or forecast studies when historical data is not available; Normal thermal plant operations; Operating and maintenance costs between $575 and $595 million; and Depreciation and amortization expense between $365 and $385 million.\nThe guidance provided assumes OPUC approval of the Company’s intended filing of a deferral application to recover the revenue requirement associated with the customer information system replacement project (Customer Touchpoints), which is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2018.\nCompany Updates\n2019 General Rate Case\nOn February 15, 2018, PGE filed a general rate case with a 2019 test year (2019 GRC), which would result in an overall customer price increase of 4.8 percent, after adjusting for the effects of the TCJA, effective in January of 2019.\n“We are respectful of the impact price increases can have on our customers, and we are committed to protecting affordability,” said Pope. “We’re making necessary investments in our grid to maintain the safe and reliable service customers expect, and we’re upgrading our customer service systems to provide better, more secure service.”\nPGE’s grid investments include:\nReplacing or upgrading electrical equipment that poses a reliability risk Equipping substations with technology that will shorten outages Strengthening IT systems to protect against cyber and other potential threats Adding infrastructure to accommodate rapid growth in the region while maintaining reliability for all customers\nThe requested price increase reflects:\nReturn on equity of 9.5 percent Capital structure of 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity Cost of capital of 7.31 percent Rate base of $4.86 billion Annual revenue increase of $86 million, net of customer credits and supplemental tariff updates\nPGE expects the Commission to issue a final order in December 2018, with new prices effective in January of 2019. The specific impact on individual customers’ bills will vary depending on usage and customer class. If the OPUC approves PGE’s request as submitted, typical residential customers using a monthly average of 800 kilowatt-hours of power would see their bill increase by about $6.50 per month.\n2018 General Rate Case\nOn January 1, 2018, new customer prices went into effect pursuant to the OPUC order issued in PGE’s 2018 GRC. The OPUC authorized a $16 million increase in annual revenues, representing an approximate 1 percent overall increase in customer prices. In addition, the order approved a capital structure of 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, a return on equity of 9.5 percent, a cost of capital of 7.35 percent, and a rate base of $4.5 billion.\nThe general rate case filings, as well as copies of the orders, direct testimony, exhibits, and stipulations are available on the OPUC website at www.oregon.gov/puc .\nIntegrated Resource Planning\nIn November 2016, PGE filed an IRP (2016 IRP) with the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC). The 2016 IRP addressed acquisition of additional resources to meet Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements and replace energy and capacity from Boardman, which will cease coal-fired operations at the end of 2020. Further actions identified through 2021 are expected to offset expiring power purchase agreements and integrate variable energy resources, such as wind or solar generation facilities.\nIn August 2017, the OPUC acknowledged PGE’s 2016 IRP and the following primary action plan items:\nMeet additional capacity needs of 561 MW, of which 240 MW must be dispatchable, in 2021; Acquire a total of 135 MWa of cost-effective energy efficiency; Acquire at least 77 MW (winter) and 69 MW (summer) demand response through 2020 and 16 MW of dispatchable standby generation from customers to help manage peak load conditions and other supply contingencies; Submit one or more energy storage proposals, and; Perform voltage reduction and various research and studies related to flexible capacity and curtailment metrics, customer insights, decarbonization, risks associated with Direct Access, treatment of market capacity, accessing resources from Montana, and load forecasting improvements.\nIn December 2017, PGE received acknowledgement from the OPUC of the filed addendum to the 2016 IRP for the procurement of 100 MWa of RPS compliant renewable resources.\nSince issuing the 2016 IRP, PGE has identified a potential benchmark wind resource that could have a nameplate capacity of up to 300 MW that would meet the acknowledged need for renewable resources and qualify for the federal Production Tax Credit. The Company continues to explore this option and should due diligence be completed and agreements reached, the potential benchmark resource would be submitted into the RFP and considered along with other renewable resource proposals. The RFP process will include oversight by an independent evaluator and review by the OPUC.\nIn December 2017, the OPUC approved PGE’s application for waiver of the competitive bidding guidelines for the procurement of capacity. PGE has now finalized bilateral power purchase agreements for a total capacity of 300 MW.\nTax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted and signed into law with an effective date of January 1, 2018. The reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% required the Company to remeasure its existing deferred income tax balances as of December 31, 2017. As a result of the Company’s remeasurement, net deferred tax liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets were reduced by $340 million.\nOf the remeasurement amount, $357 million has been deferred as a regulatory liability and is expected to be refunded to customers over time. The remaining remeasurement amount of $17 million represents a reduction to net deferred tax assets related to other business items, primarily comprised of deferred tax assets related to the Company’s non-qualified employee benefit plans. The Company has recorded a $17 million charge to the results of operations, reflected as an increase in income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the TCJA, PGE expects to incur lower income tax expense in 2018 than what was estimated in setting customer prices in the Company’s 2018 GRC. In addition to the effects of the 2017 remeasurement of deferred income taxes, PGE has proposed to defer and refund the 2018 expected net benefits of the TCJA under a deferral application filed with the OPUC on December 29, 2017. If approved as requested, any refund to customers of the net benefits associated with the TCJA in 2018 would be subject to an earnings test and limited by the Company’s previously authorized regulated return on equity.\nThe impact of the TCJA may differ from these amounts due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made; federal tax regulations, guidance or orders that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, and OPUC; and actions the Company may take as a result of the TCJA.\n2017 Annual Operating Results\nEarnings Reconciliation of 2016 to 2017 ($ in millions, except EPS) Pre-Tax Income Net Income * Diluted EPS *** Reported 2016 $243 $193 $2.16 Revenue Electric retail price change (5) (3) (0.04) Electric retail volume change 71 43 0.48 Change in decoupling deferral 10 6 0.07 Electric wholesale price and volume change 2 1 0.02 Other Items 8 5 0.06 Change in Revenue 86 52 0.59 Power Cost Change in average power cost 38 23 0.25 Change purchased power and generation (13) (8) (0.09) Change in Power Costs 25 15 0.16 O&M Generation, transmission, distribution (23) (14) (0.15) Administrative and general (17) (10) (0.11) Change in O&M (40) (24) (0.26) Other Items Depreciation & amortization (24) (15) (0.16) AFDC Equity** (9) (9) (0.10) Other Items (8) (5) (0.06) Production Tax Credits (7) (0.08) Tax Reform: Net Deferred Tax Asset Remeasurement (17) (0.19) Adjustment for effective vs statutory tax rate 3 0.04 Change in Other Items (41) (50) (0.55) Reported 2017 $273 $187 $2.10 Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 ($ in millions, except EPS) GAAP-based as reported for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 $187 $2.10 Exclusion of Tax Reform Remeasurement 17 0.19 Non-GAAP adjusted earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 $204 $2.29 GAAP-based as reported for 31, 2017 $42 $0.48 Exclusion of Tax Reform Remeasurement 17 0.19 Non-GAAP adjusted earnings for 31, 2017 $59 $0.67 * After tax adjustments based on PGE’s statutory tax rate of 39.5% ** Statutory tax rate does not apply to AFDC equity *** Some values may not foot due to rounding Revenues increased $86 million, or 4.5%, in 2017 compared with 2016 as a result of the items discussed below.\nTotal retail revenues increased $77 million, or 4.3%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to the net effect of:\nA $71 million increase due to a 3.9% increase in retail energy deliveries consisting of a 7.2% increase in residential deliveries, a 2.8% increase in industrial deliveries, and a 1.3% increase in commercial deliveries. Considerably cooler temperatures in the first half of 2017 than experienced in 2016 combined with warmer temperatures in the summer cooling season in 2017, both drove deliveries higher in 2017 than in 2016. A $10 million increase resulting from the Decoupling mechanism, as an estimated $13 million collection was recorded in 2017; and A $5 million increase, directly offset in Depreciation and amortization expense, related to the accelerated cost recovery of Colstrip, partially offset by A $5 million reduction as a result of overall price changes, which includes a $55 million reduction in revenues attributable to lower NVPC, as filed in the 2017 AUT; and A $3 million decrease due to higher customer credits related to the USDOE settlement in connection with operation of the ISFSI at the former Trojan nuclear power plant site. Such credits are directly offset in Depreciation and amortization expense.\nTotal heating degree-days in 2017 were above the 15-year average and considerably greater than total heating degree-days in 2016. Total cooling degree-days in 2017 exceeded the 15-year average by 49% and were considerably higher than 2016. The following table presents the number of heating and cooling degree-days in 2017 and 2016, along with the 15-year averages, reflecting that weather had a considerable influence on comparative energy deliveries:\nHeating Degree-Days Cooling Degree-Days 2017 2016 15-Year\nAverage\n2017 2016 15-Year\nAverage\n1st quarter 2,171 1,585 1,867 — — — 2nd quarter 686 403 689 129 154 70 3rd quarter 78 78 78 571 394 399 4th quarter 1,623 1,486 1,599 — — 2 Total 4,558 3,552 4,233 700 548 471 Increase (decrease) from the 15-year average 8 % (16 )% 49 % 16 % On a weather-adjusted basis, total retail energy deliveries in 2017 were 0.6% below 2016 levels. PGE projects that retail energy deliveries for 2018 will be nearly comparable to slightly lower than 2017 weather-adjusted levels, reflecting the closure of a large paper customer in late 2017 as well as continued energy efficiency and conservation efforts.\nWholesale revenues result from sales of electricity to utilities and power marketers made in the Company’s efforts to secure reasonably priced power for its retail customers, manage risk, and administer its current long-term wholesale contracts. Such sales can vary significantly from year to year as a result of economic conditions, power and fuel prices, hydro and wind availability, and customer demand.\nIn 2017, the $2 million, or 2%, increase in wholesale revenues from 2016 consisted of a $7 million increase that resulted as a 7% increase in average prices was received when the Company sold power into the wholesale market, partially offset by a $5 million decrease related to 5% less wholesale sales volume.\nOther operating revenues increased $7 million, or 19%, in 2017 from 2016, as the sale of excess natural gas not used to fuel the Company’s generating facilities accounted for the majority of the increase.\nActual NVPC , which consists of Purchased power and fuel expense net of Wholesale revenues, decreased $27 million in 2017 compared with 2016. The decrease attributable to changes in Purchased power and fuel expense was the result of a 6% decline in the average variable power cost per MWh, offset slightly by a 2% increase in total system load. The decrease in actual NVPC was also driven by a 7% increase in the average price per MWh of wholesale power sales, offset slightly by a 5% decrease in the volume of wholesale energy deliveries as a greater portion of its system load was used to meet retail load requirements, largely due to the effects of weather.\nFor 2017, actual NVPC, as calculated for regulatory purposes under the PCAM, was $15 million above the 2017 baseline NVPC. In 2016, NVPC was $10 million below the anticipated baseline.\nGeneration, transmission, and distribution expense increased $23 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared with 2016. The increase was driven by the combination of $10 million in higher costs due to the addition of Carty, $8 million higher service restoration and storm costs, $3 million higher plant maintenance expenses, and $2 million higher information technology expenses.\nAdministrative and other expense increased $17 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to $12 million higher overall labor and employee benefit expenses and $3 million higher legal costs attributable to Carty.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in 2017 increased $24 million, or 7%, compared with 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $26 million higher expense resulting from capital additions, offset by a $3 million reduction in expense due to higher amortization credits in 2017 of the regulatory liability for the ISFSI spent fuel settlement. The overall impact resulting from the amortization of the regulatory assets and liabilities is directly offset by corresponding reductions in retail revenues.\nTaxes other than income taxes expense increased $4 million, or 3%, in 2017 compared with 2016, driven by $2 million higher Oregon property taxes and $2 million higher payroll taxes.\nInterest expense increased $8 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared with 2016 due to a $4 million decrease in the credits for the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction (primarily due to the Carty plant being placed in service in 2016) and increased expense of $3 million resulting from a 5% increase in the average balance of debt outstanding.\nOther income, net was $17 million in 2017 compared to $22 million in 2016, with the decrease primarily due to lower allowance for equity funds used during construction, which resulted from Carty being placed in service during 2016.\nIncome tax expense increased $36 million, or 72%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The change relates to a $13 million increase due to higher pre-tax income and $7 million due to lower production tax credits. Additionally, income tax expense increased $17 million due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes pursuant to the change in corporate tax rates in the TCJA.\nFourth Quarter 2017 earnings call and web cast — Feb. 16, 2018\nPGE will host a conference call with financial analysts and investors on Friday, Feb. 16, 2018, at 11 a.m. ET.
