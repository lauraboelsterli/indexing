    "text": "BEAVERTON, Ore., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ: DMRC), inventor of the Intuitive Computing Platform™ featuring Digimarc Barcode, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $4.9 million compared to $5.2 million in the same quarter a year-ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower license revenue reflecting the impact of the $3.5 million upfront license fee we realized in the third quarter of 2017 whereby we waived any future royalty obligations from this licensee in one of the licensed fields of use.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $11.5 million compared to $9.0 million in the same quarter a year-ago. The increase was primarily due to higher investment in sales, marketing, and engineering as the company continues to address important opportunities in market development and delivery of Digimarc Discover and Digimarc Barcode.\nOperating loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $8.7 million compared to an operating loss of $5.9 million in the same quarter a year-ago. The higher operating loss was primarily due to higher operating expenses.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $8.4 million or $(0.76) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $5.8 million or $(0.57) per diluted share in the same quarter a year-ago.\nAt quarter-end, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $67.7 million, compared to $60.9 million at September 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to $12.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock in a registered direct offering completed during the quarter, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the full year 2017 totaled $25.2 million compared to $21.8 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher license revenue driven by a one-time $3.5 million license fee from an existing licensee. In exchange for the upfront license fee, we waived any future royalty obligations from this licensee in one of the licensed fields of use.\nOperating expenses for the full year 2017 totaled $43.2 million compared to $35.2 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher investment in sales, marketing, and engineering.\nOperating loss for the full year 2017 totaled $26.6 million compared to an operating loss of $21.9 million in 2016. The higher operating loss was primarily due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher license revenue.\nNet loss for the full year 2017 totaled $25.8 million or $(2.44) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $21.7 million or $(2.36) per diluted share in 2016.\nConference Call\nDigimarc will hold a conference call later today (Wednesday, February 21, 2018) to discuss these results, as well as provide an update on market conditions and execution of strategy. Chairman and CEO Bruce Davis and CFO Charles Beck will host the call starting at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time).
