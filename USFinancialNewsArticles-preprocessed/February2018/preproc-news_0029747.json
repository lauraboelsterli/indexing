    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cowen Inc. (NASDAQ: COWN) (“Cowen” or “the Company”) today announced its operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating Highlights\nInvestment banking revenue of $223.6 million on a GAAP and economic income basis in 2017, increased 68% year over year and was led by strong performance in equity financings. In addition, we made important strides towards improving revenue diversification in both product and sector. Advisory revenue of $41.8 million represented a 56% year over year increase. Annual brokerage revenue of $293.6 million and $312.8 million on a GAAP and economic income basis, respectively, represented a three-fold increase since 2012. In November 2017 the investment management division successfully launched a private healthcare strategy, an internally developed capability that leverages Cowen's longstanding strength in healthcare. As of January 1, 2018, assets under management were $11.0 billion. The $0.5 billion increase from January 1, 2017 was primarily due to subscriptions in private funds and real estate. On an economic income basis, the compensation to revenue ratio declined to 58% from 64% due to a shift in business mix as a result of the Convergex acquisition. Book value per share was $21.82 as of December 31, 2017, compared to $25.11 as of December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per share was $18.77 as of December 31, 2017 compared to $21.88 as of December 31, 2016. The per share decline is primarily due to a reduction in the value of our net deferred tax assets and shares issued in conjunction with the Convergex acquisition. In December 2017, the Company completed a full repurchase of its 8.25% senior notes due 2021 and repurchased a significant portion of its 3% convertible senior notes due 2019 and replaced them with 7.35% senior notes due 2027 and 3% convertible senior notes due 2022. On February 13th Cowen's Board of Directors approved a $23.6 million increase in the Company's share repurchase program. With this increase, the total amount available for repurchase under the program is $25.0 million.\nFinancial Highlights\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share\ninformation)\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, Sept. 30, Dec. 31, 2017 2016 % 2017 % 2017 2016 % GAAP: Revenue $ 204.5 $ 122.3 67% $ 178.8 14% $ 658.8 $ 471.6 40% Net income (loss) attributable to Cowen\ncommon stockholders\n$ (77.7 ) $ (3.6 ) NM $ 3.0 NM $ (67.7 ) $ (26.1 ) NM Earnings (loss) per share (diluted) $ (2.51 ) $ (0.13 ) NM $ 0.09 NM $ (2.29 ) $ (0.97 ) NM Economic Income (non-GAAP): Economic income revenue $ 183.0 $ 128.1 43% $ 182.6 —% $ 666.2 $ 467.6 42% Economic income (loss) attributable to Cowen $ (9.4 ) $ (12.9 ) (27)% $ 8.3 NM $ 15.8 $ (28.7 ) NM Economic income per share (diluted) $ (0.30 ) $ (0.48 ) NM $ 0.26 NM $ 0.54 $ (1.07 ) NM Note: Amounts may not add due to rounding.

For the quarter, revenue was $204.5 million compared to $122.3 million in the prior year period. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $67.7 million, or $(2.29) per diluted common share in 2017, and compared to a net loss of $26.1 million, or $(0.97) per diluted common share, in 2016. For the quarter, we reported a net loss of $77.7 million or $(2.51) per diluted common share. Our GAAP results were adversely impacted by certain one-time charges in the fourth quarter: Reduction in the value of net deferred tax assets of $46.6 million, a non-cash charge, as a result of a re-measurement of our deferred tax asset resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Certain other amounts related to debt of $14.7 million are related to the redemption of our 8.25% senior notes due 2021 and partial redemption of 3% convertible notes due 2019 plus certain other costs related to our newly issued debt. Transaction-related and other costs of $16.0 million.\nEconomic Income (Non-GAAP)\nIn 2017 revenue was $666.2 million, a 42% increase from the prior year. For the quarter, revenue increased $54.9 million to $183.0 million compared to $128.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Economic income of $15.8 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, was a $44.6 million improvement from 2016. For the quarter, we incurred a loss $9.4 million or $(0.30) per diluted share. Excluding additional one-time costs associated with severance and our CEO transition, economic income was $23.0 million or $0.78 per diluted share for the full year 2017 and a loss of $3.5 million or $(0.11) per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2017.\nJeffrey M. Solomon Chief Executive Officer of Cowen said, \"A primary goal of 2017 was to take definitive steps to make the firm more sustainable over the long term. We completed a transformative acquisition that positions us well for the new post-MiFID II environment. We experienced positive returns on prior operating investments in certain areas and made meaningful progress in our multi-year goal of diversifying our revenue streams. We are working on integration, cost containment, improved capital allocation and other initiatives in order to improve our return on equity in 2018 and beyond.\"\nGAAP Financial Review\nSummary GAAP Financial Information\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share\ninformation)\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, Sept. 30, Dec. 31, 2017 2016 % 2017 % 2017 2016 % Revenue $ 204.5 $ 122.3 67 % $ 178.8 14 % $ 658.8 $ 471.6 40 % Net income (loss) attributable to Cowen\n$ (76.0 ) $ (1.9 ) NM $ 4.7 NM $ (60.9 ) $ (19.3 ) NM Preferred stock dividends $ 1.7 $ 1.7 — % $ 1.7 — % $ 6.8 $ 6.8 — % Net income (loss) attributable to Cowen\ncommon stockholders\n$ (77.7 ) $ (3.6 ) NM $ 3.0 NM $ (67.7 ) $ (26.1 ) NM Earnings (loss) per share (diluted) $(2.51) $(0.13) NM $0.09 NM $ (2.29 ) $ (0.97 ) NM Note: Amounts may not add due to rounding. NM indicates not meaningful. Full Year Commentary\nRevenue was $658.8 million, a 39.7% increase from $471.6 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Convergex in June 2017 and strong performance in investment banking.\nEmployee compensation and benefits expense increased $94.0 million from the prior year to $404.1 million. The increase was primarily due to a $187.2 million increase in revenue and a $61.7 million increase in other income (loss), which resulted in a higher compensation and benefits accrual, and increased headcount from the Convergex acquisition.\nInterest and dividend expense increased $31.6 million year over year to $60.9 million. This was primarily attributable to securities finance activities during the second half of the year from the June 2017 acquisition of Convergex, an increase in the number of investments sold short and an increase in margin balances during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nReinsurance-related expense was $30.5 million, a $0.6 million increase from the year ago period. This increase was predominantly due to higher than expected claims that resulted from severe weather events in the US in the third and fourth quarters of 2017.\nOperating, general, administrative and other expenses increased $71.6 million year over year to $227.7 million. The increase is primarily related to higher floor brokerage and trade execution costs, due to higher brokerage revenue, and increased marketing and business development expenses, legal and other professional fees and increased occupancy costs, which are mostly related to the acquisition of Convergex during June 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $13.1 million compared to $12.7 million in 2016. The increase was primarily related to an increase in tangible and intangible assets related to recent acquisitions.\nRestructuring costs were $8.8 million in 2017. In conjunction with the integration of the acquired businesses of Convergex, the Company evaluated the combined broker-dealer businesses and operations and incurred integration and restructuring costs which primarily related to exit and disposal costs, discontinuation of redundant technology services and severance costs.\nOther income increased $61.7 million to $105.8 million from $44.1 million in the prior year. The increase primarily related to an increase in performance of the Company's own invested capital and the bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of Convergex during June 2017 partially offset by costs associated with extinguishing debt.\nIncome tax expense was $44.1 million compared to an income tax benefit of $19.1 million in the prior year. This change was primarily attributable to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets based on the lower corporate federal rate under The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, and operating results.\nIncome (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests increased $16.9 million to $23.8 million from the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of losses incurred by one of our consolidated funds in the prior year.\nFourth Quarter Commentary\nRevenue was $204.5 million compared to $122.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Convergex in June 2017 and strong performance in investment banking.\nEmployee compensation and benefits expense increased $29.3 million from the prior year period to $122.0 million. The increase was primarily due to $82.2 million higher revenue, partially offset by a $46.4 million decline in other income (loss), which resulted in a higher compensation and benefits accrual, and increased headcount from the Convergex acquisition.\nInterest and dividend expense was $22.8 million compared to $7.4 million in the prior year period. This was primarily attributable to securities finance activities during the second half of the year from the June 2017 acquisition of Convergex, an increase in the number of investments sold short and an increase in margin balances during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nReinsurance-related expense of $9.9 million increased $0.9 million from the year ago period. This increase was predominantly due to higher than expected claims that resulted from severe weather events in the US in the third and fourth quarters of 2017.\nOperating, general, administrative and other expenses increased $31.3 million year over year to $71.7 million. The increase was primarily related to higher floor brokerage and trade execution costs, due to higher brokerage revenue, and increased marketing and business development expenses, legal and other professional fees and increased occupancy costs, which were mostly related to the acquisition of Convergex in June 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses of $3.5 million increased $0.4 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily related to an increase in tangible and intangible assets related to recent acquisitions.\nOther income was a loss of $18.5 million compared to income of $27.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in net gains (losses) on investments and loss on debt extinguishment and costs associated with extinguishing debt.\nIncome tax expense was $40.6 million compared to an income tax benefit of $12.5 million in the prior year quarter. This change was primarily attributable to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets based on the lower corporate federal rate under The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, and operating results.\nIncome (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests decreased by $21.0 million to $11.6 million from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily the result of gains incurred by one of our consolidated funds in the prior year period.\nTaxes\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, will have a significant impact on the federal tax code, including a corporate federal rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective in 2018. As a result of the new tax law, we were required to re-measure our deferred tax assets based on this lower enacted rate, resulting in the recognition of a tax charge of $46.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, while the corporate alternative minimum tax is repealed, certain corporate tax deductions are repealed or amended. For example, corporate tax deductions for public company executive compensation in excess of $1 million will no longer be allowed. Also, the new tax law provides additional limitations on the deductibility of interest expenses.\nCapital\nSelect Balance Sheet Data\n(Amounts in millions, except per share information)\nDec. 31, Dec. 31, 2017 2016 Cowen Inc. stockholders' equity $748.0 $772.7 Common equity (CE) $646.7 $671.3 Tangible common equity (TCE) $556.1 $584.9 Book value per share (CE/CSO) $21.82 $25.11 Tangible book value per share (TCE/CSO) $18.77 $21.88 Common shares outstanding (CSO) 29.6 26.7 Reconciliation of GAAP Cowen Inc. stockholders' equity to tangible common equity: Cowen Inc. stockholders' equity $748.0 $772.7 Less: Preferred stock 101.3 101.3 Common equity (CE) $646.7 $671.3 Less: Goodwill & intangibles 90.6 86.4 Tangible common equity (TCE) $556.1 $584.9 Note: Amounts may not add due to rounding.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company’s reported GAAP results, provide useful information to investors regarding its performance and overall results of operations. These metrics are an integral part of the Company’s internal reporting to measure the performance of its businesses and the overall effectiveness of senior management. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other public companies, and are not identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements or public filings.\nEconomic Income (Loss)\nEconomic Income (Loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other public companies. Cowen uses Economic Income (Loss) as a measure of its operating performance, not as a measure of liquidity. Economic Income (Loss) should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income, operating cash flows, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. As a result of the adjustments made to arrive at Economic Income (Loss) described below, Economic Income (Loss) has limitations in that it does not take into account certain items included or excluded under GAAP, including its consolidated funds. Economic Income (Loss) is considered by management as a supplemental measure to the GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of its performance as management measures it.\nIn general, Economic Income (Loss) is a pre-tax measure that (i) eliminates the impact of consolidation for consolidated funds and excludes (ii) goodwill and intangible impairment (iii) certain other transaction-related adjustments and/or reorganization expenses (iv) the bargain purchase gain which resulted from the Convergex Group acquisition (v) certain costs associated with debt and (vi) preferred stock dividends. In addition, Economic Income (Loss) revenues include investment income that represents the income the Company has earned in investing its own capital, including realized and unrealized gains and losses, interest and dividends, net of associated investment related expenses. For US GAAP purposes, these items are included in each of their respective line items. Economic Income (Loss) revenues also include management fees, incentive income and investment income earned through the Company's investment as a general partner in certain real estate entities and the Company's investment in the activist business. For US GAAP purposes, all of these items are recorded in other income (loss). In addition, Economic Income (Loss) expenses are reduced by reimbursement from affiliates, which for US GAAP purposes is presented gross as part of revenue.\nCowen Inc.
