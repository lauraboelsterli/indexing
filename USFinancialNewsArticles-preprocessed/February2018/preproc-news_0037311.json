    "text": "Dewayne Dedmon converted a three-point play that gave Atlanta a late lead and then knocked down a clutch 3-pointer to help the Hawks beat the visiting Detroit Pistons 118-115 in a Sunday matinee at Philips Arena.\nAtlanta was down 107-104 with 2:24 play, but mounted an 8-0 run, fueled by Dedmon, to take the lead. Dedmon grabbed an offensive rebound, hit a layup and made the ensuing free throw that put the Hawks in front. He followed with a 3-pointer from the right wing as the shot clock was winding down on Atlanta’s next possession that put the Hawks up 112-107.\nDennis Schroder scored 23 points and went 6-for-6 from the foul line in the final seconds to seal the win for Atlanta.\nDedmon finished with 20 points and 13 rebounds, and Ersan Ilyasova scored 19 points for the Hawks, who snapped a two-game losing streak.\nAndre Drummond scored 25 points and grabbed 15 rebounds, and Reggie Bullock added 20 points for the Pistons, who have dropped two straight.\nBlake Griffin had his worst game with the Pistons, hitting just seven of 21 shots and picking up a technical foul late in the first half after hitting Schroder in the back of the head with the ball during a stoppage in play.\nThe game was tight throughout. Bullock scored 18 of his points in the first half, including a last-second layup that gave the Pistons a 56-55 lead at intermission.\nThe Hawks took an 82-80 lead into the fourth quarter. Detroit’s Anthony Tolliver hit a 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter that gave the Pistons their biggest lead at that point at 92-87. Atlanta wouldn’t go away, though.\nSchroder converted a three-point play to trim the Detroit lead to 101-100 with 4:25 to play and setting up Dedmon’s heroics.\nThe Pistons return home to host New Orleans on Monday, before the Hawks come to town Wednesday for the two teams’ fourth meeting of the regular season.\nThe Hawks open a three-game road trip at Milwaukee on Tuesday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
