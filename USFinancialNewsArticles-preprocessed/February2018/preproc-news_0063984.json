Steinhoff said in a statement it was ”working hard to uncover the truth and to prosecute wrongdoing’ at the firm, and was cooperating with regulators. The retailer also said after the amounting scandal became public, working capital, especially in its businesses outside South Africa “had dried up.” ($1 = 0.8203 euros) (Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg Editing by James Macharia)",
