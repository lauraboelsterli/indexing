GLOBAL TOP NEWS •U.S. congressional leaders forge budget deal that adds to deficit U.S. Senate leaders, in a rare display of bipartisanship, reached a two-year budget deal on Wednesday to raise government spending by almost $300 billion, attempting to curb Washington's fiscal policy squabbling but also widening the federal deficit. •Tesla sticks by Model 3 target, warns spending could rise in 2018 Tesla Inc said on Wednesday it was sticking with Chief Executive Elon Musk's revised production targets for its Model 3 electric sedan, but posted its worst-ever quarterly loss, and warned that spending would increase slightly this year. •North Korea says no plans to meet U.S. officials at Olympics; Washington seeks more sanctions North Korea has no intention of meeting U.S officials during the Winter Olympics that start on Friday, the KCNA news agency reported, dampening hopes the Games will help resolve a tense standoff over the North's nuclear weapons programme. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) •The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,521.00, trading up 0.7 percent from its previous close. •The rupee will likely open flat to lower against the dollar, tracking losses in most Asian peers, following a strong overnight rally in the greenback that helped it post its best one-day gain in over three months. •Indian sovereign bonds are likely to open higher as the nation’s Monetary Policy Committee didn’t hint at any immediate interest rate increase. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.50 percent-7.56 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks ran out of steam on Wednesday after an early surge, in a sign that investors are still spooked by the market's recent retreat and wary more fallout is to come. • Asian shares flirted with six-week lows as U.S. bond yields crept up towards four-year highs as investors fretted that low borrowing costs enjoyed by companies for many years may be endangered by the threat of rising inflation. • The dollar was off recent lows against major rivals, benefiting from the euro's weakness and higher U.S. yields but capped by concerns about recent equity market volatility. • U.S. Treasury prices dropped on Wednesday after the Treasury Department sold new 10-year notes to soft demand and the U.S. Senate reached a budget deal, boosting expectations of stronger economic growth. • Oil prices eased, taking Brent crude to a 2018 low, as soaring U.S. output uncermined OPEC's efforts to tighten markets and prop up prices. • Gold prices held on to losses from the previous session, after the precious metal fell to four-week lows on a firmer dollar amid expectations of more U.S. interest rate hikes.
