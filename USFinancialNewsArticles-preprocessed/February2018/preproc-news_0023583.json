    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CrowdStrike® Inc., the leader in cloud-delivered endpoint protection, announced today that CRN ®, a brand of The Channel Company , has named Matthew Polly, vice president of Worldwide Business Development and Channels of CrowdStrike, to its prestigious list of 2018 Channel Chiefs. The executives on this annual list represent top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their organization through channel partners.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding channel partner programs.\nUnder Polly’s leadership, CrowdStrike has significantly grown its global partner footprint with new channel resellers, major system integrators (SIs), and technology alliances. The company launched a new partner portal, and expanded enablement options to help partners develop their CrowdStrike practices and ensure world-class customer support. CrowdStrike has expanded rapidly into the EMEA and APAC regions, heavily investing in its channel and partner ecosystem with key wins in the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Australia, India, and Singapore. Polly joined CrowdStrike in June 2017 to lead its rapidly growing partner program and drive joint go-to-market capabilities for CrowdStrike’s robust partner ecosystem.\nThrough CrowdStrike’s platform-first approach, partners receive an open framework for the development and deployment of next-generation antivirus (AV), endpoint detection and response (EDR), security hygiene, vulnerability management, managed hunting, all delivered from a native cloud architecture. CrowdStrike continues to expand its Elevate Partner Program — an elite ecosystem of technology and solution providers, system integrators, and managed service providers that deliver the most revolutionary endpoint protection platform on the market.\n“The executives on CRN’s 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,” said Robert Faletra, Executive Chairman of The Channel Company. “These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief’s impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.”\n“I am thrilled to be named to CRN’s 2018 Channel Chiefs list. This phenomenal group of individuals are committed to successful partner programs and driving value for security customers,” said Matthew Polly, vice president of Worldwide Business Development and Channels. “At CrowdStrike, we are committed to expanding and supporting our global partner ecosystem to protect customers and stop breaches.”\nThis year, CrowdStrike was positioned the highest for ability to execute and furthest to the right for completeness of vision in the Visionaries quadrant of the 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms .
