During the year a total of 72.6 million tonnes of material was mined, including 26.2 million tonnes of ore and 46.4 million tonnes of waste for a strip ratio of 1.77:1. High equipment mechanical availability was maintained during the quarter which helped contribute to the above average mining rates of 198,900 tonnes per day moved, well above our 2017 mining guidance rate of 180,000 tonnes per day moved. Mining costs per tonne during the year was $1.69 per tonne moved.\nDuring the year the mill processed a total of 14.1 million tonnes of ore grading 0.32% copper to produce 75.8 million pounds of copper, 23,600 ounces of gold, and 277,000 ounces of silver. Mill recoveries were 77.2% for the year while mill operating time was 90.3%. Mill throughput increased during the second half of the year as planned, after the replacement of the SAG bull gear. The mill achieved an average throughput rate of 38,600 tpd for the 2017 year.\nDuring the year, the Company completed a total of thirteen shipments of copper concentrate containing approximately 73.9 million pounds of copper, 23,800 ounces of gold, and 264,800 ounces of silver which generated $304 million in revenue net of treatment and refining charges and pricing adjustments. Gold and silver revenues accounted for about 14% of gross revenues during the year.\nThe Company currently has 461 operating employees engaged at the mine site and continues to maintain an excellent safety record.\nListed below is a summarized balance sheet and income statement as well as details for our conference call schedule:\nSummarized Balance Sheet\nDecember 31,\n2017\n$\nDecember 31,\n2016\n$\nAssets\nCash\n45,133\n31,409\nAccounts Receivable and prepaids\n29,314\n26,048\nInventory\n68,135\n48,465\nProperty, plant and equipment\n414,041\n463,080\nOther Assets\n111,326\n78,788\n667,949\n647,790\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\n92,056\n84,060\nAmounts payable to related parties\n43,633\n22,653\nElectricity deferral\n-\n15,385\nProvisions\n6,521\n6,312\nInterest rate swap liability\n2,081\n4,088\nLong-term debt\n258,373\n319,759\n402,664\n452,257\nEquity\nShare capital\n195,670\n194,208\nContributed surplus\n15,724\n14,773\nDeficit\n(25,693)\n(73,656)\nNon-controlling interest\n79,584\n60,208\nTotal equity\n265,285\n195,533\n667,949\n647,790\nSummarized Income Statement\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(CDN$)\n2017\n$\n2016\n$\n2017\n$\n2016\n$\nRevenues\n85,687\n84,523\n304,080\n277,996\nCost of sales 4\n(65,674)\n(68,687)\n(244,985)\n(258,330)\nGross profit\n20,013\n15,836\n59,095\n19,666\nOther income and expenses\nGeneral and administration\n(1,131)\n(1,150)\n(6,757)\n(5,594)\nProperty investigation\n-\n(338)\n(35)\n(338)\nShare based compensation\n(1,030)\n(184)\n(2,152)\n(810)\nOperating income\n17,852\n14,164\n50,151\n12,924\nPricing adjustments on concentrate and metal sales\n(4,404)\n(3,134)\n(10,691)\n(11,041)\nFinance income\n(41)\n56\n319\n199\nFinance expense\n(3,368)\n(3,418)\n(13,070)\n(12,642)\nCurrent resource tax expense\n(621)\n(578)\n(1,879)\n(1,157)\nDeferred income and resource tax recovery\n10,956\n-\n10,956\n-\nAdjusted earnings 5 (loss)\n20,374\n7,090\n35,786\n(11,717)\nPricing adjustments on concentrate and metal sales\n4,404\n3,134\n10,691\n11,041\nUnrealized gain (loss) on interest rate swap\n610\n2,580\n(87)\n(91)\nUnrealized (loss) gain on foreign exchange\n(1,871)\n(9,923)\n20,949\n13,007\nLoss on sale of fixed asset\n-\n-\n-\n(643)\nNet income and comprehensive income for the period\n23,517\n2,881\n67,339\n11,597\nNet income and comprehensive income attributable to:\nShareholders of the company\n16,479\n2,098\n47,963\n7,723\nNon-controlling interest\n7,059\n783\n19,376\n3,874\n23,538\n2,881\n67,339\n11,597\nIncome per share\n0.12\n0.01\n0.36\n0.06\nAdjusted earnings (loss) per share\n0.15\n0.06\n0.27\n(0.09)",
