Its next closest contender was Cruise, owned by General Motors Co, at 1,214 miles on average between disengagements. \nAutonomous vehicles are still in the research and development stage and are being tested on public roads, especially in California where most companies competing in the space have tech hubs in Silicon Valley. California law requires that self-driving cars have a person in the driver’s seat who can take over control when needed. \nWaymo, for example, drove 352,545 miles in the state during the period with only 63 disengagements. Cruise vehicles drove about a third less, at 127,516 miles, and had 105 disengagements. \nThe third best performance came from Nissan Motor Co, which drove 5,007 miles and had 24 disengagements, meaning that its vehicles had disengagements on average every 208 miles. \nThe numbers fall off sharply after Nissan, with Baidu Inc at an average rate of every 41 miles, chipmaker Nvidia Corp at 4.6 miles on average, and Mercedes, with disengagements every 1.3 miles on average. \nFord Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, BMW, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc said they conducted no autonomous driving testing on California’s roads during the time period.
