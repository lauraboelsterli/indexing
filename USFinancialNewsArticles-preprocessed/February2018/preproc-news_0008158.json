    "text": "Feb 2 (Reuters) - Speculators' net bearish bets on U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures rose to their highest in nearly 11 months in earlier this week when 10-year yield was on its way to hit a four-year peak, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 215,600 contracts on 30 Jan 2018, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data. This was the highest level of speculative net shorts in 10-year T-note futures since 298,514 on March 7, 2017. A week earlier, speculators held 117,877 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures.
