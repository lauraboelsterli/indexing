The distribution is subject to the following ex-dividend, record and payment dates set by the Fund's Board of Trustees.\nFebruary 2018\nDeclaration\nThursday, February 1, 2018\nEx-Dividend\nWednesday, February 14, 2018\nRecord\nThursday, February 15, 2018\nPayment\nWednesday, February 28, 2018\nThis news release is not for tax reporting purposes. The release has been issued to announce the amount and timing of the distributions declared by the Board of Trustees. There is a possibility that distributions may include ordinary income, long-term capital gains or return of capital. The amount of distributable income and the tax characteristics of the distributions are determined at the end of the taxable year. In early 2019, the Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV specifying how the distributions paid by the Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for purposes of reporting the distributions on a shareholder's tax return.\nAbout DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund\nThe DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund (the \"Fund\") is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to seek high total investment return by providing a high level of current income and the potential for capital appreciation. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Investing in the Fund involves the risk of principal loss.\nAbout DoubleLine Capital LP\nDoubleLine Capital LP is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. DoubleLine Capital and its related companies (\"DoubleLine\") managed $118 billion in assets across all vehicles, including open-end mutual fund, closed-end fund, exchange-traded fund, hedge fund, variable annuity, UCITS, collective investment trust and separate account as of the December 31 end of the fourth quarter of 2017.

This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering. There are risks associated with an investment in the Fund.\nTo read about the DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund, please access the Annual Report at www.doublelinefunds.com or call 888.308.3838 to receive a copy. Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. An investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.\nThis document is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale or offer of these securities, in any jurisdiction where such sale or offer is not permitted.\nFund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.\nShares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors' risk of loss. This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering. There are risks associated with investment in the fund.\nInvestments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a great risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Investment strategies may not achieve the desired results due to implementation lag, other timing factors, portfolio management decisions-making, economic or market conditions or other unanticipated factors. In addition, the Fund may invest in other asset classes and investments such as, among others, REITs, credit default swaps, short sales, derivatives and smaller companies which include additional risks. The DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund (the \"Fund\") is a diversified, closed-end management investment company.\nThis material may include statements that constitute \"forward-looking statements\" under the U.S. securities laws.
