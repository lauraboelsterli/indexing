The borrowing cost on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.40 percent in the week ended on Feb. 22, the highest level since April 2014. Last week, 30-year home loan rates had averaged 4.38 percent, the mortgage finance agency said. Reporting by Richard LeongEditing by Chizu Nomiyama",
