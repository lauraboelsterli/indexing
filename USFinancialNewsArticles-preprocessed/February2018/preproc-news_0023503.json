    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 9:16 AM / in 29 minutes China Jan total social financing surges to 3.06 trln yuan Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBEIJING, Feb 12 (Reuters) - China’s total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, surged to 3.06 trillion yuan ($483.55 billion) in January from 1.14 trillion yuan in December, data from the central bank showed on Monday. \nTSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales. \nThe economic barometer has become a gauge of fundraising trends and can provide hints of activity in China’s vast and unregulated shadow banking sector. \nChinese authorities have been trying to clamp down on riskier forms of lending as part of a broader campaign to contain and reduce systemic financial risks.
