Revenue rose 2 percent to $21.6 million. \nThe company, a licensor of signal processing platforms and artificial intelligence processors, was forecast to earn 25 cents a share on revenue of $21.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nCeva forecast revenue of $92 million in 2018, up from $87.5 million, while royalties are expected to rise 10 percent from $44.6 million last year. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $96 million this year. \nCeva said it signed 13 licensing agreements in the final three months of 2017. Among them was a development agreement with a large automotive manufacturer for the next generation of its artificial intelligence processor for use in advanced autonomous driving systems. \nCevaâ€™s shares were up 0.3 percent at $40.50 in early Nasdaq trade. \nIn all of 2017, Ceva forged 45 licensing deals, boosting its licensing revenue growth by 35 percent.
