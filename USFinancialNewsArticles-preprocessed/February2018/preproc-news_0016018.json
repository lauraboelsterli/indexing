    "text": "The Latest Victim of China’s Great Firewall: Cryptocurrency Websites February 5, 2018 \nFeb. 5, 2018 7:13 a.m. ET \nBEIJING—Chinese authorities plan to block websites related to cryptocurrency trading and fundraising, state media reported, in the latest move to tighten controls over what Beijing deems as risky investments. \nRegulators are planning “a list of measures” aimed at cryptocurrency trading, including “dealing with domestic and international websites,” according to a report Monday by Financial News, a publication affiliated with China’s central bank. \nAfter initially appearing to encourage cryptocurrencies, the central bank began clamping down last year, banning bitcoin exchanges and fundraising via cryptocurrencies , though it didn’t prohibit private trading. The new move appears to close off some channels for private trading, which continues via social-messaging apps and foreign websites. ALSO READ The Bitcoin Hoax \nThe Financial News report didn’t say which regulator would lead the charge in the latest tightening. Neither the central bank nor two key internet regulators, the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, responded to requests for comment. \nA report Monday by the government’s news agency, Xinhua, said the central bank “will tighten regulation on domestic investors’ participation in overseas transactions of initial coin offerings and virtual currency as risks are still high in the sector.” It didn’t provide details on the expected measures. \nBitcoin-related websites in China and overseas haven’t seen widespread disruptions lately, although many have been blocked sporadically in the past, according to cryptocurrency investors and entrepreneurs. Local websites also continue to offer some cryptocurrency-related services, such as personal “wallets,” which are encrypted digital accounts used for storing virtual coins. ALSO READ Bitcoin is illegitimate in Egypt: EFSA \nIt isn’t clear how effective such website blockages would be. China maintains an extensive array of filters to block sites deemed objectionable by the government. Many cryptocurrency traders are Internet-savvy and use special software to circumvent the controls. \nPeople in the industry said authorities likely track this activity, and a further clampdown has been expected for months. \n“The government is reacting so fast,” said \nRon Cao, \na venture-capital investor who invested in a Chinese bitcoin exchange before the ban. “That shows the strength of the government. It’s going to be more tight, that’s for sure.” ",
