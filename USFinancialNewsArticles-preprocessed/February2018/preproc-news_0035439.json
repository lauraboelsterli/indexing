    "text": "* U.S. and Chinese demand are main drivers\n* Sales up despite stronger euro exchange rate\nPARIS, Feb 14 (Reuters) - French wine and spirits exports rose to a new record in 2017 due to strong sales to the United States and China, despite a stronger euro exchange rate, the Federation of French Wines and Spirit Exporters (FEVS) said on Wednesday.\nWines and spirits rank second in France for exports, behind aerospace and ahead of perfumes and cosmetics.\n“All French regions benefited from this export windfall,” said Antoine Leccia, FEVS’s new president, who spoke to Reuters by telephone.\nExport sales reached 12.91 billion euros ($15.94 billion), up 8.5 percent on 2016, the federation said in a statement.\nWine sales also rose 6 percent in volume, recording their first increase in five years.\nExports were mainly driven by the United States and China, the first and third biggest markets for French wines and spirits.\nIn the United States, sales rose 9.5 percent and broke the 3 billion euros mark for the first time, boosted by cognac, which accounted for 40 percent of exports in value.\nIn China, where growth of the upper-middle class is driving sales of luxury goods, shipments climbed 24.5 percent, to 1.2 billion euros, mainly due to cognac and Bordeaux wines.\nChinese customers have a better knowledge of products. They buy more upscale bottles, Leccia said.\nAfter a few lean years in China, LVMH, Pernod Ricard and Remy Cointreau have had a rebound in sales of cognac in the country.\nIn total, cognac exports rose by 10.8 percent to 3.07 billion euros in 2017. Wine sales increased 9.6 percent to 8.67 billion euros, including a rise of 7.4 percent to 2.82 billion euros for champagne, FEVS said.\nIn Britain, France’s second biggest export market for wine and spirits, sales rose by 2.7 percent to 1.33 billion euros. Champagne sales to Britain, though, fell about 4-5 percent, hurt by the euro’s rise against the pound after the Brexit vote.\n$1 = 0.8098 euros Reporting by Pascale Denis; writing by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Brian Love and Jane Merriman\n ",
