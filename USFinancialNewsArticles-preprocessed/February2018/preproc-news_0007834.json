    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (“Enterprise”) (NYSE: EPD) today announced that its operating subsidiary, Enterprise Products Operating LLC (“EPO”), has notified its trustee and paying agent to redeem all of the $682.7 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of EPO’s 7.034% Fixed/Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes due 2068 (CUSIP No. 293791AW9) (the “7.034% Subordinated Notes”). Enterprise anticipates that the 7.034% Subordinated Notes will be redeemed on or about March 5, 2018 (the “Redemption Date”), in accordance with the terms of the 7.034% Subordinated Notes, at a price equal to 100% of principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the Redemption Date.\nThe redemption of the 7.034% Subordinated Notes will be financed by proceeds from the offering by EPO of $700 million principal amount of 5.375% Junior Subordinated Notes F due February 15, 2078 (the “5.375% Subordinated Notes”), to be issued by EPO, as announced on February 1, 2018.
