    "text": "CAIRO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Egyptâ€™s core inflation fell to 14.35 percent year-on-year in January from 19.86 percent in December, the central bank said on Thursday.\nInflation jumped after Egypt devalued its currency in November 2016. It reached a record high in July on the back of energy subsidy cuts but has gradually eased since then. (Reporting by Arwa Gaballa; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)\n ",
