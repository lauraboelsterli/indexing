    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cerner Corporation (Nasdaq:CERN) today announced results for the 2017 year that ended December 30, 2017.\nBookings in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.329 billion, which is an all-time high and an increase of 62 percent compared to $1.437 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full-year 2017 bookings were also a record at $6.325 billion, up 16 percent compared to 2016 bookings of $5.446 billion.\nFourth quarter revenue was $1.314 billion, an increase of 4 percent compared to $1.258 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the Company’s guidance range. Full-year 2017 revenue was $5.142 billion, up 7 percent compared to 2016 revenue of $4.796 billion.\nOn a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, fourth quarter 2017 net earnings were $336.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.00. Fourth quarter 2016 GAAP net earnings were $149.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.44. For the full year, 2017 GAAP net earnings were $867.0 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.57. Full year 2016 GAAP net earnings were $636.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.85.\nAdjusted Net Earnings for fourth quarter 2017 were $195.7 million, compared to $206.2 million of Adjusted Net Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) were $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from $0.61 of Adjusted Diluted EPS in the year-ago quarter. Analysts’ consensus estimate for fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.61. For the full year 2017, Adjusted Net Earnings were $804.9 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS was $2.38, compared to full year 2016 Adjusted Net Earnings of $790.4 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $2.30.\nAdjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are not recognized terms under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be substituted for GAAP net earnings or GAAP diluted earnings per share, respectively, as measures of Cerner’s performance, but instead should be utilized as supplemental measures of financial performance in evaluating our business. Please see the accompanying schedule, titled “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results,” where our non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nOther Highlights:\nFourth quarter operating cash flow of $348.9 million and full-year of $1.308 billion. Fourth quarter Free Cash Flow of $185.1 million. For the full year, Free Cash Flow was $671.4 million. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP cash flows from operating activities less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs. Please see the accompanying schedule, titled “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results.” Fourth quarter days sales outstanding of 72 days, up from 69 days in the year-ago period. Total backlog of $17.55 billion, up 10 percent over the year-ago quarter.\n“We finished the year on a mostly positive note, with record bookings and all other key metrics except for earnings in line with our expectations,” said Zane Burke, President. “Our bookings were at record levels across several key areas, including population health, Cerner ITWorksSM, and revenue cycle, and also included strong contributions from outside of the U.S. We believe the strong bookings in the fourth quarter combined with our robust pipeline and strong competitive position sets us up for solid growth in 2018 and beyond.”\nFuture Period Guidance\nCerner currently expects:\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue between $1.315 billion and $1.365 billion. Full year 2018 revenue between $5.450 billion and $5.650 billion. First quarter 2018 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share between $0.57 and $0.59. Full year 2018 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share between $2.57 and $2.73. First quarter 2018 new business bookings between $1.250 billion and $1.450 billion.\nTax Reform\nOur results for the 2017 year that ended December 30, 2017, include our current estimates of the impact of certain U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017. Relevant accounting guidance provides that the impact of such U.S. tax reform may be provisionally recorded, and adjusted during a measurement period of up to one year. The impacts of U.S. tax reform on our income tax balances are complex and wide-reaching, and the enactment date of such U.S. tax reform fell in close proximity to our 2017 fiscal year-end. Accordingly, the adjustments we have made to our deferred and current tax balances are provisional, and it is reasonably possible that our estimates regarding the impact of U.S. tax reform on our current and deferred tax balances might materially change in the near-term due to, among other things, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, changes to assumptions and interpretations that we have made, and actions we may take as a result of U.S. tax reform.\nEarnings Conference Call\nCerner will host an earnings conference call to provide additional detail on the Company’s results and outlook at 3:30 p.m. CT on February 6, 2018.

However, we supplement our GAAP results with certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review and understanding of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to GAAP results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with Cerner's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculations. We provide the measures of Adjusted Operating Earnings, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as such measures are used by management, along with GAAP results, to analyze Cerner's business, make strategic decisions, assess long-term trends on a comparable basis, and for management compensation purposes. We provide the measure of Free Cash Flow as such measure takes into account certain capital expenditures necessary to operate our business. Free Cash Flow is used by management, along with GAAP results, to analyze our earnings quality and overall cash generation of the business. We calculate each of our non-GAAP financial measures as follows: Adjusted Operating Earnings - Consists of GAAP operating earnings adjusted for: (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) Health Services acquisition-related amortization, (iii) acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, (iv) other acquisition-related adjustments, and (v) voluntary separation plan expense. Adjusted Net Earnings - Consists of GAAP net earnings adjusted for: (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) Health Services acquisition-related amortization, (iii) acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, (iv) other acquisition-related adjustments, (v) voluntary separation plan expense, (vi) the income tax effect of the aforementioned items, (vii) share-based compensation permanent tax items, and (viii) impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share - Consists of Adjusted Net Earnings, as defined above, divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, in the applicable period. Free Cash Flow - Consists of cash flows from operating activities, less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs. Adjustments included in the calculations of Adjusted Operating Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings are described below: Share-based compensation expense - Non-cash expense arising from our equity compensation and stock purchase plans available to our associates and directors. We exclude share-based compensation expense as we believe the amount of such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Share-based compensation expense is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows: (In thousands) Three Months Ended Years Ended 2017 2016 2017 2016 Sales and client service $ 13,150 $ 9,944 $ 48,063 $ 40,879 Software development 5,494 4,188 19,196 16,815 General and administrative 6,957 5,327 21,710 22,897 Total share-based compensation expense $ 25,601 $ 19,459 $ 88,969 $ 80,591 Health Services acquisition-related amortization - Non-cash expense consisting of the amortization of customer relationships, acquired technology, and trade name intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. We exclude Health Services acquisition-related amortization as we believe the amount of such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.\" Acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment - Consists of acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments in connection with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. Accounting guidance requires that deferred revenue acquired in a business combination be written-down to an estimate of fulfillment cost, plus a normal profit margin, as a part of the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We add back the amount of the write-down applicable to the period as we believe such amount directly correlates to the underlying performance of our business operations. Other acquisition-related adjustments - Consists of acquisition, employee separation, and other costs associated with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. We exclude other acquisition-related adjustments as they are non-recurring charges, and we believe the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"General and administrative\" expense. Voluntary separation plan expense - Consists of expense associated with our voluntary separation plans available to certain associates for specific time periods in 2016. We exclude voluntary separation plan expense as we believe the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"General and administrative\" expense. Income tax effect of pre-tax adjustments - The GAAP effective income tax rate for the applicable quarterly period adjusted for: (i) impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017, as defined below, and (ii) $40,458 thousand of net excess tax benefits recognized in December 2017 related to a particular significant exercise of stock options; applied to pre-tax adjustments for Adjusted Net Earnings. Share-based compensation permanent tax items - Consists of permanent items impacting the Company's income tax provision related to our share-based compensation arrangements, including net excess tax benefits recognized upon the exercise of stock options. We exclude such items as we believe the amount of such items in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"Income tax benefit (expense).\" Impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017 - Consists of a net benefit recorded to income tax expense (benefit) in connection with certain U.S. income tax reform enacted in December 2017, and certain contemporaneous U.S. tax accounting method changes. We have excluded such amount as it is a non-recurring net income tax benefit, and we believe the amount of such benefit does not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption \"Income tax benefit (expense).\" Cerner's future period guidance in this release includes adjustments for items not indicative of our core operations, which may include without limitation share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, such as integration expenses, and may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments relating to the Company's acquired businesses, and may also be affected by nonrecurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, all of which are excluded in the calculation of non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Earnings, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as described above. The exact amount of these adjustments are not currently determinable, but may be significant. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile this non-GAAP guidance to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nCERNER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (unaudited) (In thousands) 2017 2016 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 370,923 $ 170,861 Short-term investments 434,844 185,588 Receivables, net 1,042,781 944,943 Inventory 15,749 14,740 Prepaid expenses and other 515,930 303,229 Total current assets 2,380,227 1,619,361 Property and equipment, net 1,603,319 1,552,524 Software development costs, net 822,159 719,209 Goodwill 853,005 844,200 Intangible assets, net 479,753 566,047 Long-term investments 196,837 109,374 Other assets 134,011 219,248 Total assets $ 6,469,311 $ 5,629,963 Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 218,996 $ 238,134 Current installments of long-term debt and capital lease obligations 11,585 26,197 Deferred revenue 311,337 311,839 Accrued payroll and tax withholdings 183,770 211,554 Other accrued expenses 63,907 57,677 Total current liabilities 789,595 845,401 Long-term debt and capital lease obligations 515,130 537,552 Deferred income taxes and other liabilities 365,674 306,263 Deferred revenue 13,564 12,800 Total liabilities 1,683,963 1,702,016 Shareholders’ Equity: Common stock 3,592 3,537 Additional paid-in capital 1,380,371 1,230,913 Retained earnings 4,938,866 4,094,327 Treasury stock (1,464,099 ) (1,290,665 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net (73,382 ) (110,165 ) Total shareholders’ equity 4,785,348 3,927,947 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 6,469,311 $ 5,629,963\nCERNER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS For the three and twelve months ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (unaudited) Three Months Ended Years Ended (In thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES: Net earnings $ 336,658 $ 149,691 $ 866,978 $ 636,484 Adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation and amortization 155,482 132,851 580,723 504,236 Share-based compensation expense 23,802 17,640 83,019 74,536 Provision for deferred income taxes 10,742 14,405 47,409 (11,517 ) Changes in assets and liabilities (net of businesses acquired): Receivables, net (13,756 ) 34,559 (32,836 ) 78,258 Inventory (63 ) 4,924 (972 ) (666 ) Prepaid expenses and other (179,461 ) (32,857 ) (191,369 ) (66,658 ) Accounts payable 19,611 6,369 6,960 (13,197 ) Accrued income taxes 16,374 10,680 18,358 64,073 Deferred revenue (15,863 ) 3,335 (3,114 ) 1,555 Other accrued liabilities (4,616 ) (3,658 ) (67,481 ) (21,467 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 348,910 337,939 1,307,675 1,245,637 CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES: Capital purchases (99,711 ) (131,566 ) (362,083 ) (459,427 ) Capitalized software development costs (64,115 ) (64,893 ) (274,148 ) (293,696 ) Purchases of investments (295,038 ) (94,269 ) (632,048 ) (482,078 ) Sales and maturities of investments 54,162 201,799 292,074 463,899 Purchase of other intangibles (7,460 ) (5,250 ) (29,646 ) (18,472 ) Net cash used in investing activities (412,162 ) (94,179 ) (1,005,851 ) (789,774 ) CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES: Proceeds from exercise of stock options 15,017 3,308 76,705 63,794 Payments to taxing authorities in connection with shares directly withheld from associates (3,595 ) — (11,584 ) (38,122 ) Treasury stock purchases (150,045 ) (500,200 ) (173,434 ) (700,275 ) Contingent consideration payments for acquisition of businesses — — (2,671 ) (2,074 ) Net cash used in financing activities (138,623 ) (496,892 ) (110,984 ) (676,677 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (256 ) (7,504 ) 9,222 (10,447 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (202,131 ) (260,636 ) 200,062 (231,261 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 573,054 431,497 170,861 402,122 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 370,923 $ 170,861 $ 370,923 $ 170,861\nSource:Cerner Corporation",
