    "text": "LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Luxoft Holding Inc (NYSE:LXFT), a global IT service provider , today announced results for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThird Quarter FY2018 Highlights\nRevenue of $236.6 million, up 14.3% year-over-year and up 3.8% sequentially Adjusted EBITDA of $40.0 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.9%, compared to $37.5 million and 18.1% in the year-ago quarter GAAP net income of $20.6 million, up 10.9% year-over-year and up 11.4% sequentially Non-GAAP net income of $30.5 million, up 9.0% from $27.9 million in the year-ago quarter and up 8.7% from $28.0 million last quarter Diluted GAAP EPS of $0.60, up 9.1% from $0.55 in the year-ago quarter Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.89, up 8.5% from $0.82 in the year-ago quarter As of December 31, 2017, total number of employees was 13,101; Annual revenue per billable engineer was $85,392, up 4.5% year-over-year and up 3.2% sequentially FY 2018 Guidance revised due to lower revenue from two Fortune 10 healthcare & telecom clients\nNote: Reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures are included at the end of the release.\n“Our third quarter results demonstrate our continued progress in executing our strategic transformation to diversify our revenue streams, expand our presence in attractive end markets and strengthen our global delivery capabilities,” said Dmitry Loschinin, Luxoft’s CEO and President . “We had a number of bright spots this quarter, including consolidated revenue growth of 26.5% year-over-year, excluding the top two accounts, and double-digit revenue growth in each of our three lines of business. Ongoing strong demand for advanced digital and cloud deployments drove 20.4% year-over-year revenue growth in our Digital Enterprise line of business. Financial Services’ revenue increased 12.9% compared to last year, and was up 48.7% excluding the top two accounts. We also continue to experience strong demand in our Automotive line of business as autonomy drives investment in advanced technologies, improving in-vehicle user experiences and increasing the need for connected services and IT infrastructure. On a year-over-year basis, this line of business grew 10.1% in the quarter and 37.5% in the nine-month period and is on track to deliver annual growth of over 40%.”\n“We continue to enhance our global competitive position and market penetration utilizing our expansive and scalable delivery platform. During the quarter, we opened a new delivery center in Berlin, the result of a strategic collaboration, with a major German multinational automotive manufacturer, to attract new talent for next-generation intelligent user experience for cars. We continue to increase our presence in Asia Pacific (APAC) following the opening of the Bangalore office. We expect to quickly ramp our engineer headcount here as we see many attractive opportunities to deliver IT services to financial institutions and other industries in Singapore, Australia, Malaysia and China from nearshore locations.”\nThe Company exhibited solid performance across key global markets. Revenue generated in North America increased 8.4% year-over-year while APAC and Europe revenues grew 114.2% and 22.0% year-over-year, respectively. The success we are having expanding our global presence and growing outside of financial services is meaningfully reducing our client concentration. Our top two accounts amounted to 34.4% of revenue, representing a 6.3 percentage point decrease year over year. On the same basis, the top five accounts amounted to 46.0% of revenue, representing a 7.2 percentage point decrease and the top ten accounts amounted to 57.2% of revenue, a decrease of 6.6 percentage points.\nMr. Loschinin concluded, “Looking ahead, we expect our full-year results to be affected by lower revenue from two large acquired telecom and healthcare clients. This is primarily the result of our de-emphasizing lower-margin, non-core business and strategically aligning our resources with an expanding number of attractive, higher-margin opportunities. While this will impact our revenue generation this fiscal year, we believe these actions position the Company more competitively in the long term. As a result, we currently expect our full-year fiscal 2018 revenue to be in the range of $900-905 million, down approximately 2%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 15.0-15.2%.”\n“Despite this near-term challenge, our confidence in the business remains strong. We see a number of attractive growth opportunities across our verticals, and we are confident we have the right strategy to further build our long-term growth potential and deliver increasing value to shareholders. The entire Luxoft team is focused on driving improved execution and entering fiscal 2019 with momentum across our business as we further implement our revenue diversification and business optimization strategies.”\nOutlook for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2018\nThe Company is revising its full-year outlook and expects:\nRevenue to be in the range of $900 to $905 million, down approximately 2%, from the previous $920 million guidance Adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 15.0-15.2%, down from the previous guidance of 15.5-16.5% Diluted EPS on GAAP basis to be at least $1.53 (unchanged) Diluted EPS on a non-GAAP basis to be in the range from $2.77- $2.85, down from at least $2.85 EPS to be based on an estimated weighted average of 34.4 million diluted shares\nConference Call Information\nThe Company to review the results on Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. ET.

For more information, please visit the website .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in accordance with US GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities as non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); adjusted EBITDA; non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP diluted Earnings per share (EPS) and Free Cash Flow (FCF). EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, where interest includes unwinding of the discount rate for contingent liabilities. Prior year amounts were amended accordingly. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of fair value adjustments to intangible assets and impairment thereof and other acquisitions related costs that may include changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Non-GAAP diluted EPS are calculated as non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average number of diluted shares. Free Cash Flow is calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditure which consists of purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as defined in the cash flow statement.\nWe adjust our non-GAAP financial measures to exclude stock based compensation, because it is a non-cash expense. We also adjust our non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the change in fair value of contingent consideration, because we believe these expenses are not indicative of what we consider to be normal course of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude amortization of purchased intangible assets in order to allow management and investors to evaluate our results from operating activities as if these assets have been developed internally rather than acquired in a business combination. Finally, we adjust our non-GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition-related costs, which comprise payments to consulting firms as well as fees paid upon successful completion of acquisition; as well as certain incentive payments for members of management of the acquired companies as provided for in the acquisition agreements. These payments are based on performance of the acquired businesses and are classified as part of management compensation rather than part of purchase consideration. These costs vary with the size and complexity of each acquisition and are generally inconsistent in amount and frequency, and therefore, we believe that they may not be indicative of the size and volume of future acquisition-related costs.\nWe provide these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they present a better measure of our core business and management uses them internally to evaluate our ongoing performance. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in enhancing and understanding of our operating performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, comparable US GAAP measures. The non-GAAP results and a full reconciliation between US GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the accompanying tables at the end of this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nIn addition to historical information, this release contains \" \" the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
