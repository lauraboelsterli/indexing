    "text": "STEVENSON, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The securities litigation law firm of Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: EKSO) (“Ekso” or the “Company”) securities during the period between March 15, 2017 and December 27, 2017, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors who wish to become proactively involved in the litigation have until March 5, 2018 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff.\nIf you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the class, you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff will direct the litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to accept a settlement for the class in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants claiming the largest loss from investment in Ekso securities during the Class Period. Members of the class will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead plaintiff. No class has yet been certified in the above action.\nThe complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants’ failure to disclose during the Class Period that there was a material weakness in Ekso’s internal control over financial reporting.\nAccording to the complaint, following a December 14, 2017 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing stating that the Company’s internal controls were not effective, and a December 27, 2017 filing of its amended annual and quarterly reports, the value of Ekso shares declined significantly.\nIf you have suffered a loss in excess of $100,000 from investment in Ekso securities purchased on or after March 15, 2017 and held through the revelation of negative information during and/or at the end of the Class Period and would like to learn more about this lawsuit and your ability to participate as a lead plaintiff, without cost or obligation to you, please contact Brower Piven either by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com or by telephone at (410) 415-6616.\nAttorneys at Brower Piven have extensive experience in litigating securities and other class action cases and have been advocating for the rights of shareholders since the 1980s. If you choose to retain counsel, you may retain Brower Piven without financial obligation or cost to you, or you may retain other counsel of your choice. You need take no action at this time to be a member of the class.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180205005923/en/\nBrower Piven, A Professional Corporation\nCharles J.
