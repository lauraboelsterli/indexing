    "text": "Brent Burns, Chris Tierney and Mikkel Boedker each had a goal and an assist as the San Jose Sharks dumped the visiting Vancouver Canucks 4-1 on Thursday night.\nMarcus Sorensen also scored for the Sharks, who posted their third win in four games.\nSan Jose goaltender Martin Jones posted a season-high 43 saves for his 17th victory of the season. After a slow start, the Canucks outshot the Sharks 44-30, but in what has become a recurring theme this season, Vancouver did not get enough timely saves.\nDaniel Sedin scored for the Canucks, who have lost seven of their past eight games. Vancouver netminder Anders Nilsson took the loss while making 26 saves. All goals in the game were scored at even strength.\nBurns, a former Norris Trophy winner as the league’s top defenseman, started the game at forward -- where he has played in the past -- due to the absence of injured winger Tomas Hertl (shoulder). Later in the game, Burns played defense, and he produced the two points from his more familiar rearguard post.\nBoedker opened the scoring for San Jose at 8:41 of the first period as he fired in Danish compatriot Jannik Hansen’s pass from behind the net. Hansen, a former Canuck who has struggled with San Jose since joining the Sharks a year ago at the trade deadline, was united with his boyhood pal Boedker as coach Peter DeBoer revamped his lines due to injuries and inconsistent play.\nThe goal was the second in two games for Boedker.\nLining up at defense on a faceoff, Burns fired in a slap shot from the side boards at 4:57 of the second period.\nSorensen put the Sharks ahead 3-0 at 3:06 of the third period, sending a high shot over Nilsson’s catching glove while the Canucks were caught scrambling on a line change.\nDaniel Sedin brought the Canucks within two goals at 6:43 of the third. He put in a nifty pass on a two-on-one with Thomas Vanek, who signaled a shot but then surprised Jones by dishing the puck off.\nTierney restored San Jose’s three-goal advantage just under six minutes later, putting in a Burns pass from the blue line.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
