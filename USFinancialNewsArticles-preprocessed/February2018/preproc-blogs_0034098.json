Scott Olson—Getty Images By Chris Morris 12:31 PM EST \nOn the heels of Wednesday’s tragic school shooting in Florida, the debate over gun control is starting up again. \nIt’s a contentious issue, and one that many feel is complicated by the heavy spending the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other gun lobby groups invest in political races. And the longer some politicians have been in business, the more money they’ve received from the groups. \nIn the 2016 election, the NRA spent $11,438,118 to support Donald Trump —and another $19,756,346 to oppose Hillary Clinton. That’s over $31 million spent on one presidential race. \nPresidential candidates aren’t the only ones who benefit from the NRA’s largess, though. Here’s a look at the top career recipients of NRA funding, as calculated by the Center for Responsive Politics and the New York Times . Top 5 Senators With the Most Contributions From the NRA \nJohn McCain (R, AZ) – $7.74 million \nRichard Burr (R, NC) – $6.99 million \nRoy Blunt (R, MO) – $4.55 million \nThom Tillis (R, NC) – $4.42 million \nCory Gardner (R, CO) – $3.88 million Top 5 Representatives With the Most Contributions From the NRA \nFrench Hill (R, AR) – $1.09 million \nKen Buck (R, CO) – $800,544 \nDavid Young (R, IA) – $707,662 \nMike Simpson , (R, ID) – $385,731 \nGreg Gianforte (R, MT) – $344,630 SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
