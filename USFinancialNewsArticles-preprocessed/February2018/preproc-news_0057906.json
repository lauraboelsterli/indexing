    "text": "DALLAS & FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Satori Capital, a Dallas/Fort Worth multi-strategy investment firm committed to the principles of conscious capitalism, announced today the purchase of a controlling interest in Zorch International, Inc. Zorch, based in Chicago, Illinois, is an innovative, tech-enabled designer and distributor of branded merchandise and promotional products. Zorch’s differentiated approach to servicing corporate programs is gaining widespread acceptance in the marketplace and has yielded more than 30 percent revenue growth during the last two years.\n“Zorch takes an entirely new approach to branded merchandise fulfillment,” said Satori co-founder Sunny Vanderbeck. “The company has developed a powerful, technology-enabled approach that leverages the capabilities of its supply chain, improving efficiency and reducing costs for its customers. It’s simply a better way to operate, and over the long term, we believe Zorch will dramatically outperform its competitors.”\nZorch uses a powerful technology application and a streamlined service model, significantly reducing the need for bulk inventory and densely staffed fulfillment teams. Zorch’s model also includes high quality, dedicated e-stores for each customer that allow customers to communicate directly with suppliers and create a single source for logos and artwork, both of which dramatically reduce order errors. The e-stores can also integrate with customers’ procurement systems and freight carrier accounts, reducing order and shipping costs.\n“In the branded merchandise industry, every distributor operates the same way – except Zorch,” said company CEO Mike Wolfe. “We have created a transparent, streamlined, single-source solution to help large organizations order more efficiently, protect and promote their brands, and – most importantly – save money.”\nIn addition to the benefits it provides to customers, Zorch also embraces practices and principles that align with the tenets of conscious capitalism. For example, the company provides an engaging culture for its employees, has been named to the Advertising Specialty Institute’s “Best Places to Work” honor roll, and was named a Top 40 distributor during 2017. Zorch also requires that its suppliers meet a stringent set of criteria which include fair labor practices. This philosophical alignment with the stakeholder-centric model that Satori advocates was an important element of the investment decision and will continue to influence the company’s strategic direction as it grows.\nAbout Satori Capital\nSatori Capital is a Texas-based multi-strategy investment firm founded upon the principles of conscious capitalism. Satori’s private equity business partners with leadership teams of companies with $5 million to $25 million of EBITDA that operate with a long-term perspective, commit to their mission or purpose, and create value for all stakeholders.
