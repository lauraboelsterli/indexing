    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- W. P. Carey Inc. (NYSE: WPC), a leading internally-managed net lease REIT specializing in corporate sale-leaseback and build-to-suit financing and the acquisition of single-tenant net lease properties, announced today that it has entered into a new triple net lease agreement with the Astellas Institute for Regenerative Medicine (\"AIRM\") for W. P. Carey's 251,000-square-foot office building in Westborough, MA. As part of the new lease, the existing two-story office building will be converted into a state-of-the-art life sciences facility and serve as AIRM's R&D headquarters. AIRM is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tokyo-based Astellas, a top 20 global pharmaceutical company rated A1 by Moody's.\nThe lease will commence in September 2018 and construction will begin shortly thereafter. Construction conversion costs are expected to total more than $90 million and will be jointly funded by W. P. Carey and AIRM.\nKey Facts\nAttractive lease terms: An 18-year triple net lease with AIRM will commence in September 2018 after the current tenant vacates the property. W. P. Carey has agreed to fund up to $56 million in construction and leasing costs at an attractive incremental yield. High-quality tenant : AIRM is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Tokyo-based Astellas, which is rated A1 by Moody's and is a top 20 global pharmaceutical company. Mission-critical facility : The state-of-the-art life sciences facility will serve as AIRM's R&D headquarters. AIRM plans to invest significant capital into the conversion project, which will house more than 250 employees upon completion. The facility is strategically located within the greater Boston area, home to the largest concentration of life sciences researchers in the U.S.\nManagement Commentary\nW. P. Carey Managing Director Brooks Gordon noted: \"The Astellas transaction demonstrates W. P. Carey's proactive approach to asset management and our ability to invest capital into our existing portfolio at attractive risk-adjusted returns. It also enables us to reposition an asset that was underutilized by the current tenant by identifying and capitalizing on the growing life sciences demand in the greater Boston area. As a result, we will own a state-of-the-art facility that will enable Astellas to pursue its cutting-edge research, while creating substantial value for W. P. Carey's shareholders.\"\nW. P.
