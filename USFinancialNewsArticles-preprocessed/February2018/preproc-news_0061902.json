    "text": "Bill Gates: Cryptocurrency is ‘super risky’ over the long-term February 27, 2018 \nGates isn’t the first big name to speak out against the speculative assets . His close friend Warren Buffett also predicts a disappointing outcome. “In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending ,” the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said. \n“When it happens or how or anything else, I don’t know,” he added in an interview on CNBC’s “ Squawk Box ” from Omaha, Nebraska. “If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it, but I would never short a dime’s worth.” \nLegendary investor Jack Bogle agrees. “Avoid bitcoin like the plague. Did I make myself clear?” said the Vanguard founder in response to an audience question at a Council on Foreign Relations event. ALSO READ Tom Lee sees bitcoin surge by the summer, as cryptocurrency struggles to hold $10000 \nOther investors are less hostile to the idea. Billionaire Mark Cuban says that, once you’ve built up an emergency fund, it’s OK to put up to 10 percent of your savings in high-risk ventures such as bitcoin and ethereum “if you’re a true adventurer.” However, you’ve just “got to pretend you’ve already lost your money,” he told Vanity Fair , adding that it’s like throwing “the Hail Mary.” ",
