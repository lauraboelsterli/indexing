    "text": "Jamal Johnson and Mike Parks Jr. scored 18 points apiece as the Memphis Tigers extended their winning streak to four games with an 83-79 victory over host Connecticut on Sunday.\nRaynere Thornton added 16 points for Memphis (18-11, 9-7 American Athletic Conference). The Tigers shot 27 of 55 from the field, while the Huskies made 29 of 50 shots.\nMemphis suffered a huge setback when league-leading scorer Jeremiah Martin was ruled out for the season with a broken foot. Martin, who averaged 18.9 points per game, suffered the injury during the Tigers’ 91-85 victory over No. 23 Houston on Thursday. He will undergo surgery Tuesday.\nJalen Adams had 25 points and Christian Vital scored 17 for the Huskies (13-16, 6-10).\nThe Tigers won the previous meeting 73-49 on Jan.16 at FedEx Forum. This time, Memphis had a 23-point lead on a free throw by Jimario River midway through the second half before holding off a late rally by the Huskies.\nConnecticut gained some momentum and cut the margin to 66-53 on a 3-pointer by Adams, who was back in the starting lineup after missing the previous game against No. 11 Cincinnati.\nThe Huskies pulled to within 71-61 on a jumper and free throw by Vital. Memphis was rattled and Adams’ 3-pointer cut the margin to 73-64 with 3:06 remaining. Antwoine Anderson (10 points) made a layup and free throw that pulled the Huskies to 81-75 with 11.9 seconds left.\nMemphis had another crucial turnover that led to a layup by Adams that cut the margin to four points. However, Kareem Brewton (12 points) sealed the win with a pair of free throws for Memphis.\nConnecticut was playing at Gampel Pavilion for the first time since Feb. 7. The Huskies fell to 11-4 on their home court this season.\nA 3-pointer by Anderson gave the Huskies a 23-13 lead midway through the opening half. The Tigers missed 10 of their opening 16 shots, were 1 of 7 from beyond the arc and were held scoreless for more than five minutes.\nMemphis adjusted to Connecticut’s zone defense and took a 27-26 lead on a 3-pointer by Malik Rhodes with 5:41 left.\nAnother 3-pointer by Johnson in the final minute increased the margin to 41-31 at the break.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
