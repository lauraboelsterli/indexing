    "text": "RMI names inbound sales innovator Eric Rehm VP of Operations and media expert Grace Shim VP of Media and Emerging Accounts\nATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Leading Atlanta-based digital marketing agency Response Mine Interactive (RMI) is pleased to announce veteran marketers Eric Rehm and Grace Shim are joining its executive team. Both Eric and Grace are key contributors to RMI’s success and have proven track records developing and implementing initiatives that accelerate client company sales velocities.\nEric Rehm joined RMI in 2014 from American Home Shield, where he drove recurring revenue models and managed outsourced call center operations. He used that knowledge to create RMI’s internal call center, which has tripled conversion rates for RMI clients and quickly became a core agency service. Eric is positioned to replicate that success in his new role as VP of Operations where he will take on the responsibility of leading RMI’s creative, development, and information technology teams. He will also maintain oversight over call center operations.\nGrace Shim is in her tenth year at RMI, joining the company in 2008 straight out of the Goizueta Business School at Emory University. Grace has spent her career developing effective strategies to build media portfolios that drive qualified leads while managing RMI’s media team. She brings a unique perspective on connecting directly to audiences from the two years she spent as a professional cellist opening for Bruno Mars and Katy Perry while working remotely. Grace will be responsible for innovation, testing new media channel betas and reaching client media goals in her expanded leadership of RMI’s media operations as VP of Media and Emerging Accounts.\n“The diverse experiences and performance records of experts like Eric Rehm and Grace Shim are key to driving the measurable results that RMI is known for,” said Ken Robbins, CEO of RMI. “Client companies can expect to see amazing results immediately as they assume their new leadership roles.”\nPlease join RMI in congratulating Eric and Grace on their well-deserved promotions.\nAbout Response Mine Interactive\nResponse Mine Interactive (RMI) is a premier digital agency that helps health and wellness clients acquire more customers using direct response digital marketing.
