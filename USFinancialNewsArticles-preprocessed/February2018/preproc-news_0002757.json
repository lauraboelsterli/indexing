    "text": "(Reuters) - Profile of the Philadelphia Eagles, who will play the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday in Minneapolis.\nFounded: 1933. After Philadelphia’s NFL franchise, the Frankford Yellow Jackets, went bankrupt and ceased operation, the NFL granted an expansion franchise to a syndicate headed by former University of Pennsylvania teammates Lud Wray and Bert Bell.\nNFC titles (season): 3 (1980, 2004, 2017).\nSuper Bowl titles: none\nHead coach: Doug Pederson. Became the Eagles coach in 2016 after serving as offensive coordinator with the Kansas City Chiefs and previously as an Eagles assistant. A journeyman quarterback, Pederson played for five NFL teams and won a Super Bowl with the Green Bay Packers for the 1996 season.\nStarting quarterback: Nick Foles. After a knee injury ended Carson Wentz’s season, Foles led the Eagles to their first Super Bowl since the 2004 season with playoff wins over Atlanta and Minnesota. A third-round draft pick in 2012, he became the first NFL quarterback to post a perfect passer rating and throw seven touchdowns in a single game for the Eagles in 2013. He was traded to the St Louis Rams in 2015 and the next year played with the Kansas City Chiefs before returning to Philadelphia in 2017.\nLeading receiver: Zach Ertz. Caught 74 passes for 824 yards and eight touchdowns during regular season.\nLeading rusher: LeGarrette Blount. Rushed 173 times for 766 yards and two touchdowns during the regular season.\nFun Facts\n* The man who became the Eagles’ coach in 1935, Bert Bell, was his own boss. He was the team’s owner. Bell later became commissioner of the NFL.\n* The Eagles lost their first game to the New York Giants 56-0 in 1933 and did not having a winning record until 1943.\n* While never having won a Super Bowl, the Eagles have been NFL champions three times, in 1948-49 and 1960, in the era prior to the Super Bowl, which began in 1967.\n* Philadelphia played in the first televised professional football game, losing 23-14 to the Brooklyn Dodgers on Oct. 22, 1939.\n* The Eagles are worth an estimated $2.65 billion, 10th among the NFL’s 32 teams, according to a September Forbes estimate.\nFamous Eagles of all-time\nReggie White: The Hall of Fame defensive end was truly the “Minister of Defense” in the 1980s and ‘90s. Twice the NFL’s Defensive Player of the Year, White, who played with the Eagles from 1985 to 1992 before joining the Green Bay Packers, was selected to the NFL’s 75th Anniversary All-Time Team, earned All-Pro honors 13 times and finished his career with 198 sacks, the second-most in league history.\nChuck Bednarik: The Hall of Fame linebacker-center was one of the hardest-hitting tacklers to play in the NFL, famously known for flattening New York Giants halfback Frank Gifford in a 1960 game. The NFL’s 75th Anniversary All-Time Team member also was the league’s last full-time two-way player, earning the nickname “Concrete Charlie”. He played for the Eagles from 1949 to 1962, twice helping them win NFL championships. He earned All-Pro honors 10 times.\nSteve Van Buren: Selected to the NFL’s 75th Anniversary All-Time Team, the running back won four league rushing titles, including three straight from 1947 to 1949, and helped the Eagles win NFL titles in 1948-9. When he retired after eight seasons with Philadelphia, Van Buren held the NFL career records for rushing attempts, rushing yards, and rushing touchdowns.\nBrian Dawkins: “Weapon X” played 13 of his 16 NFL seasons with the Eagles, earning All-Pro honors nine times as a safety. He became the first player in NFL history to record a sack, an interception, a forced fumble, and a touchdown reception in a single game against the Houston Texans in 2002.\nDonovan McNabb: The Eagles quarterback for 11 seasons, McNabb led Philadelphia to five NFC championship games. He ended his career as the franchise’s all-time leader in pass attempts, pass completions, passing yards, and passing touchdowns. McNabb led the Eagles to the Super Bowl following the 2004 season, where they lost to the New England Patriots.\nTeam name and colors: The insignia of a U.S. government act inspired the Eagles’ nickname. The Blue Eagle was a symbol used by companies to show compliance with the National Industrial Recovery Act, a part of President Franklin Roosevelt’s “New Deal” program. Colors: Midnight Green, Silver, Black, White.\nMost famous supporter: Actor Bradley Cooper. Not only did he play an Eagles fan in his movie, Silver Linings Playbook, Cooper also has been seen watching games in owner Jeffrey Lurie’s suite. During the 2014 season, Cooper reportedly talked trash to Giants fans and also created a video to fire up fans before a game with the Dallas Cowboys.\n2017 regular season record: 13-3, won NFC East division\nWeek 1 - at Washington, won 30-17\nWeek 2 - at Kansas City, lost 27-20\nWeek 3 - vs. New York Giants, won 27-24\nWeek 4 - at Los Angeles Chargers, won 26-24\nWeek 5 - vs Arizona, won 34-7\nWeek 6 - at Carolina, won 28-23\nWeek 7 - vs Washington, won 34-24\nWeek 8 - vs San Francisco, won 33-10\nWeek 9 - vs Denver, won 51-23\nWeek 10 - bye\nWeek 11 - at Dallas, won 37-9\nWeek 12 - vs Chicago, won 31-3\nWeek 13 - at Seattle, lost 24-10\nWeek 14 - at Los Angeles Rams, won 43-35\nWeek 15 - at New York Giants, won 34-29.\nWeek 16 - vs Oakland, won 19-10.\nWeek 17 - vs Dallas, lost 6-0\nPath to the Super Bowl- First round bye; beat Atlanta 15-10 in divisional round; beat Minnesota 38-7 in NFC Championship.\nReporting by Gene Cherry; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ",
