    "text": "2017 Full Year Highlights\nGAAP EPS of $2.03, up 20%\nAdjusted EPS of $2.71, up 18%\n8 th Consecutive Year of Double-Digit Adjusted EPS Growth\nRevenue and Fee Revenue up 9% and 8%, respectively\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported strong financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“Our fourth-quarter results capped another excellent year for CBRE,” said Bob Sulentic, the company’s president and chief executive officer. “Fee revenue was up 9% in local currency and adjusted earnings per share rose 6%. Our performance significantly exceeded the expectations we discussed on our third-quarter earnings call, and was led by occupier outsourcing and leasing fee revenue growth of 17% and 11%, respectively, in local currency.”\n“Revenue and earnings for 2017 reached all-time highs, and we made important strategic gains across the company,” he added. 2017 marked the 8 th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth for CBRE.\nLooking ahead to 2018, Mr. Sulentic said: “We regard the macro environment as a supportive backdrop for our business, and we continue to operate within an industry poised for long-term growth. This is due to the growing acceptance of outsourced commercial real estate services, the increasing capital allocation to commercial real estate as an institutional asset class, and the continuing consolidation of activity within our industry to the highest-quality, globally diversified market leaders.”\nFor full-year 2018, CBRE expects to achieve adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.00 to $3.15. This represents an increase of 13% at the midpoint of the range with 8% attributable to EBITDA growth and 5% attributable to the combined net effect of a lower expected tax rate due to U.S. corporate tax reform, interest savings and higher depreciation & amortization.\nFull-Year 2017 Results\nRevenue for full-year 2017 totaled $14.2 billion, an increase of 9% (same local currency 1 ). Fee revenue 2 increased 8% (same local currency) to $9.4 billion. On a GAAP basis, net income increased 21% and earnings per diluted share increased 20% to $691.5 million and $2.03 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income 3 rose 19% to $924.5 million, while adjusted earnings per share 3 improved 18% to $2.71 per share. Full-year 2017 adjustments to GAAP net income included a $143.4 million 4 , or $0.42 per share, net charge, attributable to the tax impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). This net charge is primarily comprised of a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, net of a tax benefit from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Absent the non-recurring impact of the tax law changes, GAAP earnings per diluted share would have risen 45% for full-year 2017. Adjustments also included $112.9 million (pre-tax) of non-cash acquisition-related amortization and $27.4 million (pre-tax) of integration and other costs related to acquisitions. These costs were partially offset by $8.5 million (pre-tax) reversal of net carried interest incentive compensation and a net tax benefit of $42.1 million associated with the aforementioned pre-tax adjustments. EBITDA 5 increased 23% (same local currency) to $1.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA 5 increased 10% (9% local currency) to $1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 32 basis points to 18.2%.\nFourth-Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter totaled $4.3 billion, an increase of 13% (11% local currency). Fee revenue increased 11% (9% local currency) to $3.0 billion. On a GAAP basis, net income decreased 36% and earnings per diluted share decreased 37% to $168.4 million and $0.49 per share, respectively. The declines in net income and earnings per diluted share were primarily attributable to the aforementioned impact of the Tax Act. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 rose 7% to $337.9 million, while adjusted earnings per share improved 6% to $0.99 per share. The adjustments to GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $143.4 million, or $0.42 per share, net charge attributable to the aforementioned impacts of the Tax Act. Absent the non-recurring impact of the tax law changes, GAAP earnings per diluted share would have risen 17% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjustments also included $30.4 million (pre-tax) of non-cash acquisition-related amortization and $4.4 million (pre-tax) of net carried interest incentive compensation expense. These costs were partially offset by a net tax benefit of $8.7 million associated with the aforementioned pre-tax adjustments. EBITDA increased 10% (8% local currency) to $577.8 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 2% (1% local currency) to $582.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue decreased 170 basis points to 19.7%. The fourth quarter of 2016 represents a difficult comparison; note that the adjusted EBITDA margins on fee revenue for the fourth quarters of 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 were 17.2%, 16.3%, 19.9%, and 18.7%, respectively, in our regional services businesses. The fourth quarter of 2017 was also negatively impacted by the decline in adjusted EBITDA from Development Services.\nFourth-Quarter 2017 Segment Review\nThe following tables present highlights of CBRE segment performance during the fourth quarter of 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nAmericas EMEA APAC % Change from Q4\n2016\n% Change from Q4\n2016\n% Change from Q4\n2016\nQ4 2017 USD LC Q4 2017 USD LC Q4 2017 USD LC Revenue $ 2,341,276 11 % 12 % $ 1,332,825 17 % 9 % $ 526,603 13 % 11 % Fee revenue 1,688,991 9 % 9 % 780,705 16 % 8 % 349,445 8 % 7 % EBITDA 324,796 13 % 13 % 132,133 36 % 25 % 69,338 2 % 2 % Adjusted EBITDA 324,796 4 % 4 % 132,133 8 % -1 % 69,338 — -1 % Global Investment Management Development Services (6) % Change from Q4\n2016\n% Change from Q4\n2016\nQ4 2017 USD LC Q4 2017 USD LC Revenue $ 103,193 12 % 7 % $ 32,315 60 % 60 % EBITDA 17,038 -29 % -34 % 34,534 -28 % -28 % Adjusted EBITDA 21,402 44 % 36 % 34,534 -28 % -28 % Excluding the impact of all currency movement including hedging activity, adjusted EBITDA growth rates for the fourth quarter of 2017 were: 5% in the Americas, -1% in EMEA, -4% in APAC and 46% in Global Investment Management.\nCBRE produced solid revenue growth in all three of its global regions in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAPAC saw a 13% (11% local currency) revenue increase, supported by solid growth across the region, most notably in Australia, India, Japan and Singapore. In the Americas, revenue increased 11% (12% local currency), with strong growth in Canada, Mexico and the United States. EMEA revenue rose 17% (9% local currency), driven by Spain and the United Kingdom.\nRevenue growth across CBRE’s global business lines was largely organic.\nGlobal occupier outsourcing achieved growth of 19% (17% local currency) in revenue and 20% (17% local currency) in fee revenue. Acquisitions contributed 1% to the revenue growth rate and 2% to the fee revenue growth rate in the quarter. Growth was broad-based across the three global regions, led by India, the United Kingdom and the United States. Leasing revenue rose by double digits, increasing 13% (11% local currency). APAC produced 17% (same local currency) leasing revenue growth, paced by Australia, Greater China and Japan. Americas leasing revenue rose 12% (same local currency), with strong performance in Brazil, Canada and the United States. EMEA leasing revenue rose 12% (3% local currency), led by France. Revenue edged up 1% (down 1% local currency) for the capital markets businesses – property sales and commercial mortgage origination – on a combined basis. Among the capital markets businesses, global property sales revenue was flat (down 2% local currency), consistent with the decline in market volumes globally. EMEA remained robust with sales revenue up 29% (20% local currency). Several countries drove this outcome, including Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. APAC sales revenue fell 7% (down 8% local currency) compared with a very strong fourth quarter of 2016, when sales surged 42% (35% in local currency). Americas sales revenue declined 8% (same local currency), as strong gains in Canada and Mexico were offset by lower activity in the United States, which saw revenue decrease in line with the decline in market volumes. For the full year, CBRE’s U.S. investment sales market share rose 80 basis points to 17.0%, almost double the nearest competitor, according to Real Capital Analytics. The other capital markets business, commercial mortgage origination, saw revenue increase 5% (same local currency). This is on top of the 36% growth achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016. Loan volume growth remained healthy, particularly with conduit lenders due to higher CMBS activity. Recurring revenue from CBRE’s growing loan servicing portfolio increased 31% (30% local currency). At the end of the fourth quarter, the loan servicing portfolio totaled approximately $174 billion, up 20% from year-end 2016. Property management services produced growth of 14% (12% local currency) for revenue and 16% (14% local currency) for fee revenue. Growth was strong worldwide, most notably in APAC. Valuation revenue rose 3% (flat local currency). CBRE’s Global Investment Management business produced adjusted EBITDA growth of 44% (36% local currency) in the fourth quarter. In the Global Investment Management segment, assets under management (AUM) totaled $103.2 billion, up $4.9 billion from the third quarter of 2017. Favorable currency movement added approximately $600 million to AUM during the quarter. As expected, adjusted EBITDA in the Development Services business declined 28% (same local currency) from the year-earlier fourth quarter due to the timing of asset sales, which were significantly higher in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the Development Services segment, projects in process totaled $6.8 billion at year-end 2017, up almost $1.0 billion from the third quarter of 2017. The pipeline decreased $1.6 billion during the quarter, reflecting a higher-than-normal conversion of pipeline deals to in process activity.\nCBRE also announced plans to call its $800 million of 5% bonds due in 2023 in March 2018, which will be funded with cash on hand and borrowings under its credit facility.\nConference Call Details\nThe company’s fourth quarter earnings conference call will be held today (Thursday, February 8, 2018) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Such filings are available publicly and may be obtained on the company’s website at www.cbre.com or upon written request from CBRE’s Investor Relations Department at investorrelations@cbre.com .\nNote – CBRE has not reconciled the (non-GAAP) adjusted earnings per share forward-looking guidance included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to costs related to acquisitions, carried interest incentive compensation and financing costs, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\nThe terms “fee revenue,” “adjusted net income,” “adjusted earnings per share” (or adjusted EPS), “EBITDA” and “adjusted EBITDA,” all of which CBRE uses in this press release, are non-GAAP financial measures under SEC guidelines, and you should refer to the footnotes below as well as the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section in this press release for a further explanation of these measures. We have also included in that section reconciliations of these measures in specific periods to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for those periods.\n1 Local currency percentage change is calculated by comparing current-period results at prior-period exchange rates versus prior-period results.\n2 Fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. Certain adjustments have been made to 2016 fee revenue to conform with current-year presentation.\n3 Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share (or adjusted EPS) exclude the effect of select charges from GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per diluted share as well as adjust the provision for income taxes for such charges. Adjustments during the periods presented included non-cash amortization expense related to certain intangible assets attributable to acquisitions, integration and other costs related to acquisitions, cost-elimination expenses and certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue. Adjustments also included the tax impact of U.S. tax reform.\n4 In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. The net charge related to the Tax Act is based upon our reasonable estimates and interpretation of the Tax Act. We consider certain aspects of this charge to be provisional and the impact may change due to additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Government as well as ongoing analysis of our data and assumptions we have made. Our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act is expected to be completed within the measurement period provided by SAB 118.\n5 EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Amounts shown for adjusted EBITDA further remove (from EBITDA) the impact of certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions and certain cost-elimination expenses.\n6 Revenue in the Development Services segment does not include equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate, net of non-controlling interest. EBITDA includes equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate, net of non-controlling interests, and the associated compensation expense.\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nFOR THE THREE AND TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\n(Dollars in thousands, except share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue: Fee revenue (1) $ 2,954,649 $ 2,655,299 $ 9,389,412 $ 8,725,829 Pass through costs also recognized as revenue 1,381,563 1,168,532 4,820,196 4,345,760 Total revenue 4,336,212 3,823,831 14,209,608 13,071,589 Costs and expenses: Cost of services 2,974,208 2,603,098 9,893,226 9,123,727 Operating, administrative and other 835,151 770,972 2,858,654 2,781,310 Depreciation and amortization 109,100 96,940 406,114 366,927 Total costs and expenses 3,918,459 3,471,010 13,157,994 12,271,964 Gain on disposition of real estate (2) 965 — 19,828 15,862 Operating income 418,718 352,821 1,071,442 815,487 Equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (2) 51,971 80,449 210,207 197,351 Other income (loss) 336 (3,765 ) 9,405 4,688 Interest income 2,886 2,506 9,853 8,051 Interest expense 32,891 35,801 136,814 144,851 Income before provision for income taxes 441,020 396,210 1,164,093 880,726 Provision for income taxes 270,334 131,084 466,147 296,662 Net income 170,686 265,126 697,946 584,064 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (2) 2,286 1,151 6,467 12,091 Net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. $ 168,400 $ 263,975 $ 691,479 $ 571,973 Basic income per share: Net income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. $ 0.50 $ 0.78 $ 2.05 $ 1.71 Weighted average shares outstanding for basic income per share\n338,777,028 336,843,925 337,658,017 335,414,831 Diluted income per share: Net income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. $ 0.49 $ 0.78 $ 2.03 $ 1.69 Weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per share\n341,728,078 338,839,469 340,783,556 338,424,563 EBITDA $ 577,839 $ 525,294 $ 1,690,701 $ 1,372,362 Adjusted EBITDA $ 582,203 $ 568,485 $ 1,709,534 $ 1,561,003 (1) Certain adjustments have been made to 2016 fee revenue to conform with current-year presentation.

Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current-year presentation. This change had no impact on our consolidated results. Additionally, certain adjustments have been made to 2016 fee revenue to conform with current-year presentation. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following measures are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC guidelines:\n(i) Fee revenue (ii) Net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., as adjusted (which we also refer to as “adjusted net income”) (iii) Diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders, as adjusted (which we also refer to as “adjusted earnings per share” or “adjusted EPS”) (iv) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA These measures are not recognized measurements under United States generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP.” When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use them in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nOur management generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. The company believes that these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. The company further uses certain of these measures, and believes that they are useful to investors, for purposes described below.\nWith respect to fee revenue: the company believes that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the financial performance of our Occupier Outsourcing and Property Management business lines and our business generally. Fee revenue excludes costs reimbursable by clients, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business.\nWith respect to adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA: the company believes that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the accounting effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions—and in the case of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA—the effects of financings and income tax and the accounting effects of capital spending. All of these measures may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In the case of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, these measures are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use because they do not consider cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA measures calculated herein may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. The company also uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS as significant components when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.\nNet income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., as adjusted (or adjusted net income), and diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders, as adjusted (or adjusted EPS), are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands, except share data):\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. $ 168,400 $ 263,975 $ 691,479 $ 571,973 Plus / minus: Non-cash amortization expense related to certain intangible assets attributable to acquisitions\n30,419 29,347 112,945 111,105 Carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue\n4,364 (9,032 ) (8,518 ) (15,558 ) Integration and other costs related to acquisitions — 52,223 27,351 125,743 Cost-elimination expenses (1) — — — 78,456 Tax impact of adjusted items (8,680 ) (21,766 ) (42,128 ) (93,181 ) Impact of U.S. tax reform 143,359 — 143,359 — Net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders, as adjusted\n$ 337,862 $ 314,747 $ 924,488 $ 778,538 Diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders, as adjusted\n$ 0.99 $ 0.93 $ 2.71 $ 2.30 Weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per share\n341,728,078 338,839,469 340,783,556 338,424,563 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. $ 168,400 $ 263,975 $ 691,479 $ 571,973 Add: Depreciation and amortization 109,100 96,940 406,114 366,927 Interest expense 32,891 35,801 136,814 144,851 Provision for income taxes 270,334 131,084 466,147 296,662 Less: Interest income 2,886 2,506 9,853 8,051 EBITDA 577,839 525,294 1,690,701 1,372,362 Adjustments: Carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue\n4,364 (9,032 ) (8,518 ) (15,558 ) Integration and other costs related to acquisitions — 52,223 27,351 125,743 Cost-elimination expenses (1) — — — 78,456 Adjusted EBITDA $ 582,203 $ 568,485 $ 1,709,534 $ 1,561,003 (1)\nRepresents cost-elimination expenses relating to a program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and completed in the third quarter of 2016 to reduce the company’s global cost structure after several years of significant revenue and related cost growth.
