Increased annual base rent from tenants other than Sears Holdings to 52.2% of total annual base rent from 36.1% in the prior year period, including all signed leases and net of rent attributable to associated space to be recaptured.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017:\nAnnounced 30 new wholly-owned redevelopment projects with an estimated total cost of $632.0 million, expanded six previously announced projects with an estimated total cost of $96.5 million and substantially completed 14 projects with an estimated total cost of approximately $114.2 million.

Since our inception, we have signed over 4.8 million square feet of new leases and achieved an average re-leasing multiple of 4.1x on space formerly occupied by Sears Holdings, with new rents averaging approximately $18.00 per square foot compared to $4.35 per square foot, on a same space basis. We have completed or commenced 78 projects representing a total capital investment of approximately $1.1 billion at returns ranging from 10-12% on an incremental unlevered basis, well in excess of capitalization rates for stabilized shopping centers. We were also pleased to commence our premier projects in Santa Monica and San Diego (La Jolla), CA and Aventura, FL, the first three in a series of premier and larger scale densification opportunities within our existing portfolio. Finally, during the quarter, we raised capital through a perpetual preferred equity offering and the extension of our existing unsecured term loan facility, resulting in a total of $530 million of gross proceeds raised during 2017 from financings, asset sales and additional joint ventures. As we enter 2018, we remain focused on unlocking the substantial value of our portfolio through intensive redevelopment and by strengthening our position as preferred partners for growing retailers, mixed-use developers and investors.”\nFinancial Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017:\nNet loss attributable to Class A and Class C shareholders was $43.5 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $15.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the prior year period.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s total market capitalization was approximately $3.6 billion. Total market capitalization is calculated as the sum of total debt and the market value of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, assuming conversion of operating partnership units.\nTotal debt to total market capitalization was 37.5% and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 6.5x. The Company deducts both unrestricted and restricted cash from total debt when calculating net debt. Reconciliations of net loss attributable to common shareholders to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, are provided in the tables accompanying this press release.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $241.6 million of unrestricted cash and restricted cash of $175.7 million, the substantial majority of which was held in reserve accounts for redevelopment, re-leasing and operating expenses at the Company’s properties. The Company also had $55.0 million of permitted, but uncommitted, borrowing capacity under its $200.0 million unsecured term loan facility due December 31, 2018.\nSeries A Preferred Shares\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company issued 2,800,000 7.00% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares (the “Series A Preferred Shares”) in a public offering at $25.00 per share. The Company received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $66.7 million after deducting payment of the underwriting discount and offering expenses.\nUnsecured Term Loan\nDuring the fourth quarter, The Company refinanced its existing $200 million unsecured term loan facility with a new $200 million unsecured term loan facility (the “Unsecured Term Loan”). The previous facility was a delayed draw facility with a maturity of December 31, 2017, against which the Company had drawn $85 million against the total capacity of $200 million.\nThe lenders under the previous facility, which are entities controlled by ESL Investments, Inc., have maintained their funding of $85 million in the Unsecured Term Loan, and new, non-affiliated lender committed and funded an additional $60 million for a total of $145 million committed and funded at closing. Maximum total commitments under the Unsecured Term Loan are $200 million and the Company has the right to syndicate the remaining $55 million with existing or new lenders. Existing lenders are not obligated to make all or any portion of the incremental loans.\nDividends\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company’s Board of Trustees declared a first quarter common stock dividend of $0.25 per each Class A and Class C common share. The dividend will be paid on April 12, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 30, 2018. Holders of units in Seritage Growth Properties, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) are entitled to an equal distribution per each Operating Partnership unit held as of March 30, 2018.\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company’s Board of Trustees also declared a preferred stock dividend of $0.593056 per each Series A Preferred Share. The dividend covers the period from, and including, December 14, 2017 to, but excluding, April 15, 2018. The dividend will be paid on April 16, 2018 to holders of record on March 30, 2018.\nSupplemental Report\nA Supplemental Report will be available in the Investors section of the Company’s website, www.seritage.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company makes reference to NOI, Total NOI, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Company FFO which are financial measures that include adjustments to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\nNone of Total NOI, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO or Company FFO, are measures that (i) represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) are indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions; (iii) are alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity; or (iv) should be considered alternatives to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating the Company’s operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the respective GAAP measures we deem most comparable have been provided in the tables accompanying this press release.\nNet Operating Income (\"NOI”), Total NOI and Annualized Total NOI\nNOI is defined as income from property operations less property operating expenses. The Company believes NOI provides useful information regarding Seritage, its financial condition, and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level.\nThe Company also uses Total NOI, which includes its proportional share of unconsolidated properties. This form of presentation offers insights into the financial performance and condition of the Company as a whole given the Company’s ownership of unconsolidated properties that are accounted for under GAAP using the equity method. The Company also considers Total NOI to be a helpful supplemental measure of its operating performance because it excludes from NOI variable items such as termination fee income, as well as non-cash items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles.\nAnnualized Total NOI is an estimate, as of the end of the reporting period, of the annual Total NOI to be generated by the Company’s portfolio including all signed leases and modifications to the Company’s master lease with Sears Holdings with respect to recaptured space. We calculate Annualized Total NOI by adding or subtracting current period adjustments for leases that commenced or expired during the period to Total NOI (as defined) for the period and annualizing, and then adding estimated annual Total NOI attributable to SNO leases and subtracting estimated annual Total NOI attributable to Sears Holdings’ space to be recaptured.\nAnnualized Total NOI is a forward-looking non-GAAP measure for which the Company does not believe it can provide reconciling information to a corresponding forward-looking GAAP measure without unreasonable effort.\nEarnings Before Interest Expense, Income Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income less depreciation, amortization, interest expense and provision for income and other taxes. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries, but may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies. The Company believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding its results of operations because it removes the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between the Company and other equity REITs, retail property owners who are not REITs, and other capital-intensive companies.\nThe Company makes certain adjustments to EBITDA, which it refers to as Adjusted EBITDA, to account for certain non-cash and non-comparable items, such as termination fee income, unrealized loss on interest rate cap, litigation charges, acquisition-related expenses, certain up-front-hiring and personnel costs and gains (or losses) from property sales, that it does not believe are representative of ongoing operating results.\nFunds From Operations (\"FFO\") and Company FFO\nFFO is calculated in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), which defines FFO as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from property sales, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets. The Company considers FFO a helpful supplemental measure of the operating performance for equity REITs and a complement to GAAP measures because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry.\nThe Company makes certain adjustments to FFO, which it refers to as Company FFO, to account for certain non-cash and non-comparable items, such as termination fee income, unrealized loss on interest rate cap, litigation charges, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of deferred financing costs and certain up-front-hiring and personnel costs, that it does not believe are representative of ongoing operating results. The Company previously referred to this metric as Normalized FFO; the definition and calculation remain the same.\nThis document contains forward-looking statements, which are based on the current beliefs and expectations of management and are subject to significant risks, assumptions and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: competition in the real estate and retail industries; our substantial dependence on Sears Holdings; Sears Holdings’ termination and other rights under its master lease with us; risks relating to our recapture and redevelopment activities; contingencies to the commencement of rent under leases; the terms of our indebtedness; restrictions with which we are required to comply in order to maintain REIT status and other legal requirements to which we are subject; and our limited operating history. For additional discussion of these and other applicable risks, assumptions and uncertainties, see the “Risk Factors” and forward-looking statement disclosure contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While we believe that our forecasts and assumptions are reasonable, we caution that actual results may differ materially. We intend the forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time made and do not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available, except as required by law.\nAbout Seritage Growth Properties\nSeritage Growth Properties is a publicly-traded, self-administered and self-managed REIT with 230 wholly-owned properties and 23 joint venture properties totaling over 39 million square feet of space across 49 states and Puerto Rico.
