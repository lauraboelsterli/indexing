    "text": "1 COMMENTS The federal corruption trial of former gubernatorial aide Joseph Percoco has had tense moments in its more than four weeks: The late-night arrest of a witness, teary testimony and a terse, scolding judge.\nOn Thursday, the final day of testimony in the prosecution’s case, the courtroom got some comic relief.\nAndrew Ball, a longtime staffer for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, took the stand to testify that in 2014, Mr. Percoco banished Mr. Ball to a floor of the governor’s New York City office that wasn’t used by senior staff and that was considered undesirable.\nPrevious testimony suggested that Mr. Percoco had done so to appease a patron: businessman Steven Aiello, another defendant, who was allegedly bribing Mr. Percoco for government favors. Mr. Aiello’s son was working in the governor’s administration and had had a personal spat with Mr. Ball, according to previous evidence.\n“My initial reaction was anger and surprise” upon learning of his forced relocation to the 37th floor from the 39th floor, Mr. Ball said. “I did move my desk there,” Mr. Ball conceded. “I kind of protested in my own way by sitting in different places.”\nMr. Percoco and three private executives are on trial for alleged bribery schemes in which the businessmen paid Mr. Percoco more than $300,000 to use his job working for Mr. Cuomo to get their companies government benefits. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing.\nThough Mr. Ball expressed displeasure over the incident, he also proved a lighthearted presence in the courtroom.\nAsked if his duties included sending out thousands of holiday cards each year on behalf of Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Ball paused, then raised his eyebrows. “It is the bane of my existence,” he replied, drawing laughter.\nWhen questioned about who was responsible for giving him a promotion, Mr. Ball answered cheekily: “I believe I was responsible for the promotion.” U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni interjected from her bench with a smile: “Good for you!”\nMr. Ball wasn’t the only one to amuse the courtroom on Thursday. At one point, while questioning a special agent for the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office about a digital chart displayed on a projector, Mr. Percoco’s attorney, Barry Bohrer, unfurled from behind his lectern a hand-drawn poster that he presented as an addendum to the chart.\nMr. Bohrer then affixed it to the front wall of the spectator gallery, before Judge Caproni ordered him to remove it.\n“It’s a lovely piece of art,” she said, perhaps to soften the blow.\nAfter the prosecution rested its case around midday, attorneys for the four defendants each moved for a judgment of acquittal, saying prosecutors had presented evidence that was insufficient for a conviction—a relatively standard legal maneuver.\nThough Judge Caproni didn’t appear particularly persuaded by the defense attorneys’ arguments, she suggested that the government may be vulnerable on one piece of its case: an extortion charge.\n“The biggest issue is whether there is legal basis to convict Joe Percoco on a Hobbs Act violation,” Judge Caproni said, referring to the legal term for the extortion charge that requires prosecutors to prove that an individual was a public official at the time of the alleged crime.\nMr. Percoco had left the state payroll to work as Mr. Cuomo’s campaign manager during a portion of the period when he allegedly accepted payments from executives in exchange for giving them government favors. In an effort to neutralize that issue, prosecutors have presented evidence showing that Mr. Percoco continued to use his government office, phones, assistant and other state resources while he worked for the campaign.\nBut Judge Caproni suggested prosecutors may still be susceptible to an argument that Mr. Percoco was a private citizen. “It is a mystery,” she said, “why the defense is not jumping up and down about it.”\nWrite to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.com",
