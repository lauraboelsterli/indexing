    "text": "SUGAR LAND, Texas, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CVR Refining, LP (NYSE: CVRR), a refiner and marketer of petroleum fuels, today announced net income of $88.8 million on net sales of $5,664.2 million for full year 2017, compared to net income of $15.3 million on net sales of $4,431.3 million for full year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for full year 2017 was $372.6 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $222.8 million for the previous year.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported a net loss of $29.0 million on net sales of $1,516.7 million, compared to a net loss of $10.7 million on net sales of $1,269.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 fourth quarter was $76.4 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $27.7 million for the 2016 fourth quarter.\n\"Stronger crack spreads and record operating rates resulted in overall solid results for CVR Refining in the 2017 full year and fourth quarter,\" said Dave Lamp, chief executive officer. \"The Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery achieved an annual crude oil throughput record of more than 131,000 barrels per day (bpd) and the Wynnewood, Oklahoma, refinery successfully completed its major scheduled plant turnaround in the fourth quarter.\n\"Looking forward, we will continue to focus on safe and reliable operations while increasing shareholder value by implementing self-help initiatives and developing capital improvements that will meaningfully improve our return on capital employed,\" Lamp said.\nConsolidated Operations\nFourth quarter 2017 throughputs of crude oil and all other feedstocks and blendstocks totaled 203,263 bpd. Throughputs of crude oil and all other feedstocks and blendstocks for both refineries totaled 223,266 bpd for the same period in 2016.\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $11.87 in the 2017 fourth quarter, compared to $7.32 during the same period in 2016. Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), including major scheduled turnaround expenses, per crude oil throughput barrel, for the 2017 fourth quarter were $7.78, compared to $4.96 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDistributions\nCVR Refining also announced today a fourth quarter 2017 distribution of 45 cents per common unit. The distribution, as set by the board of CVR Refining GP, LLC, the general partner of CVR Refining, will be paid on March 12, 2018, to unitholders of record on March 5, 2018. CVR Refining's cumulative cash distributions paid or declared for the 2017 full year were $1.39 per common unit.\nCVR Refining is a variable distribution master limited partnership. As a result, its quarterly distributions, if any, will vary from quarter to quarter due to several factors, including, but not limited to, its operating performance, fluctuations in the prices paid for crude oil and other feedstocks, as well as the prices received for finished products, RINs' costs and cash reserves deemed necessary or appropriate by the board of directors of its general partner.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call\nCVR Refining previously announced that it will host its fourth quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call for analysts and investors on Thursday, Feb. 22, at 1 p.m. Eastern. The Earnings Conference Call may also include discussion of the partnership's developments, forward-looking information and other material information about business and financial matters.\nThe Earnings Conference Call will be broadcast live over the Internet at https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1005/24488 . For investors or analysts who want to participate during the call, the dial-in number is (877) 407-8289.\nFor those unable to listen live, the webcast will be archived and available for 14 days at https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1005/24488 . A repeat of the conference call can be accessed by dialing (877) 660-6853, conference ID 13676236.\nThis release serves as a qualified notice to nominees and brokers as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b). Please note that 100 percent of CVR Refining's distributions to foreign investors are attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business.

the United States of America (\"GAAP\") for the applicable periods, CVR Refining, LP (the \"Partnership\") also uses the non-GAAP financial measures noted above, which are reconciled to our GAAP-based results below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP results. The adjustments are provided to enhance an overall understanding of the Partnership's financial performance for the applicable periods and are indicators management believes are relevant and useful for planning and forecasting future periods.\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel is a measurement calculated as the difference between net sales and cost of materials and other. Refining margin is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating our refineries' performance of as a general indication of the amount above our cost of materials and other at which we are able to sell refined products. Each of the components used in this calculation (net sales and cost of materials and other) are taken directly from our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our calculation of refining margin may differ from similar calculations of other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel, we utilize the total dollar figures for refining margin as derived above and divide by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. We believe that refining margin and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance.\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is a measurement calculated as the difference between net sales and cost of materials and other adjusted for FIFO impact. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating our refineries' performance as a general indication of the amount above our cost of materials and other (taking into account the impact of our utilization of FIFO) at which we are able to sell refined products. Our calculation of refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact may differ from calculations of other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Under our FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of our crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO impact when crude oil prices decrease. In order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact, we utilize the total dollar figures for refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact as derived above and divide by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. We believe that refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance.\nThe calculation of refining margin, refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact, refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel (each a non-GAAP financial measure), including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nConsolidated Operating Data\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions)\nNet sales\n$\n1,516.7\n$\n1,269.4\n$\n5,664.2\n$\n4,431.3\nCost of materials and other\n1,281.0\n1,107.5\n4,804.7\n3,759.2\nDirect operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization as reflected below)\n91.5\n94.7\n363.4\n361.9\nMajor schedule turnaround expenses\n43.0\n—\n80.4\n31.5\nDepreciation and amortization\n32.5\n32.6\n129.3\n126.3\nGross profit\n68.7\n34.6\n286.4\n152.4\nAdd:\nDirect operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization as reflected below)\n91.5\n94.7\n363.4\n361.9\nMajor schedule turnaround expenses\n43.0\n—\n80.4\n31.5\nDepreciation and amortization\n32.5\n32.6\n129.3\n126.3\nRefining margin\n235.7\n161.9\n859.5\n672.1\nFIFO impact, favorable\n(30.4)\n(22.4)\n(29.6)\n(52.1)\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact\n$\n205.3\n$\n139.5\n$\n829.9\n$\n620.0\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels per day\n187,996\n207,422\n204,748\n198,042\nDays in the period\n92\n92\n365\n366\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels\n17,295,632\n19,082,824\n74,733,020\n72,483,372\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin\n$\n235.7\n$\n161.9\n$\n859.5\n$\n672.1\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n17.3\n19.1\n74.7\n72.5\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n13.63\n$\n8.49\n$\n11.50\n$\n9.27\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact\n$\n205.3\n$\n139.5\n$\n829.9\n$\n620.0\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n17.3\n19.1\n74.7\n72.5\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n11.87\n$\n7.32\n$\n11.10\n$\n8.55\nCoffeyville Refinery\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels per day\n133,243\n132,351\n131,569\n124,169\nDays in the period\n92\n92\n365\n366\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels\n12,258,356\n12,176,292\n48,022,685\n45,445,854\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin\n$\n181.1\n$\n104.1\n$\n582.0\n$\n435.0\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n12.3\n12.2\n48.0\n45.4\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n14.77\n$\n8.55\n$\n12.12\n$\n9.57\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact\n$\n159.4\n$\n88.7\n$\n561.8\n$\n397.2\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n12.3\n12.2\n48.0\n45.4\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n13.00\n$\n7.29\n$\n11.70\n$\n8.74\nWynnewood Refinery\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels per day\n54,753\n75,071\n73,179\n73,873\nDays in the period\n92\n92\n365\n366\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels\n5,037,276\n6,906,532\n26,710,335\n27,037,518\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin\n$\n53.3\n$\n56.7\n$\n272.4\n$\n232.6\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n5.0\n6.9\n26.7\n27.0\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n10.58\n$\n8.20\n$\n10.20\n$\n8.60\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact\n$\n44.6\n$\n49.7\n$\n263.0\n$\n218.4\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n5.0\n6.9\n26.7\n27.0\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n8.85\n$\n7.19\n$\n9.85\n$\n8.07\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before (i) interest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) FIFO impact, (favorable) unfavorable; (ii) major scheduled turnaround expenses (that many of our competitors capitalize and thereby exclude from their measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA); (iii) (gain) loss on derivatives, net and (iv) current period settlements on derivative contracts.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA because it is the starting point for our determination of available cash for distribution. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) or cash flow from operations. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors to better understand our ability to make distributions to our common unitholders, help investors evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(29.0)\n$\n(10.7)\n$\n88.8\n$\n15.3\nAdd:\nInterest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income\n11.9\n11.6\n46.7\n43.3\nIncome tax expense\n—\n—\n—\n—\nDepreciation and amortization\n33.6\n33.4\n133.1\n129.0\nEBITDA\n16.5\n34.3\n268.6\n187.6\nAdd:\nFIFO impact, favorable\n(30.4)\n(22.4)\n(29.6)\n(52.1)\nMajor scheduled turnaround expenses\n43.0\n—\n80.4\n31.5\nLoss on derivatives, net\n65.0\n14.6\n69.8\n19.4\nCurrent period settlements on derivative contracts(1)\n(17.7)\n1.2\n(16.6)\n36.4\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n76.4\n$\n27.7\n$\n372.6\n$\n222.8\n(1)\nRepresents the portion of gain (loss) on derivatives, net related to contracts that matured during the respective periods and settled with counterparties. There are no premiums paid or received at inception of the derivative contracts and upon settlement, there is no cost recovery associated with these contracts.\nAvailable cash for distribution will generally equal Adjusted EBITDA reduced for cash needed for (i) debt service; (ii) reserves for environmental and maintenance capital expenditures; (iii) reserves for major scheduled turnaround expenses and, to the extent applicable, (iv) reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of our general partner deems necessary or appropriate, if any. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, and other excess cash, at the discretion of the board of directors of our general partner. Actual distributions are set by the board of directors of our general partner. Available cash for distribution is not a recognized term under GAAP. Available cash for distribution should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss) or operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. In addition, available cash for distribution is not presented as, and should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity. Available cash for distribution as reported by the Partnership may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Available cash for distribution for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n(in millions, except per unit data)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n76.4\n$\n372.6\nAdjustments:\nLess:\nCash needs for debt service\n(10.0)\n(40.0)\nReserves for environmental and maintenance capital expenditures\n(25.0)\n(103.1)\nReserves for major scheduled turnaround expenses\n—\n(45.0)\nReserves for future operating needs\n—\n(54.5)\nAdd:\nRelease of previously established cash reserves\n24.2\n74.2\nAvailable cash for distribution\n$\n65.6\n$\n204.2\nDistribution declared, per common unit(1)\n$\n0.45\n$\n1.39\nCommon units outstanding\n147.6\n147.6\n(1)\nThe Partnership announced a cash distribution of 45 cents per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDerivatives Summary. The Partnership enters into commodity swap contracts through crack spread swap agreements with financial counterparties to fix the spread risk between the crude oil the Partnership purchases and the refined products the refineries produce for sale. Through these swaps, the Partnership will sell a fixed differential for the value between the selected refined product benchmark and the benchmark crude oil price, thereby locking in a margin for a portion of the refineries' production. The physical volumes are not exchanged and these contracts are net settled with cash. From time to time, the Partnership holds various NYMEX positions through a third-party clearing house.\nThe table below summarizes our open commodity swap positions as of December 31, 2017. The positions are primarily in the form of crack spread swap agreements with financial counterparties, wherein the Partnership has locked in differentials at the fixed prices noted below. As of December 31, 2017, the open commodity swap positions for 2018 were comprised of approximately 49.4% for 2-1-1 crack swaps, 25.3% for distillate crack swaps and 25.3% for gasoline crack swaps. Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had open forward purchase and sale commitments for 5.8 million barrels of Canadian crude oil priced at fixed differentials that are not considered probable of physical settlement and are accounted for as derivatives at December 31, 2017. The fair value of the outstanding Canadian crude oil contracts at December 31, 2017 was a net unrealized loss of $26.0 million.\nCommodity Swaps\nBarrels\nFixed Price (1)\nFirst Quarter 2018\n7,050,000\n$\n18.66\nSecond Quarter 2018\n3,600,000\n21.19\nThird Quarter 2018\n3,600,000\n19.21\nTotal\n14,250,000\n$\n19.44\n(1)\nWeighted-average price of all positions for period indicated.\nQ1 2018 Outlook .
