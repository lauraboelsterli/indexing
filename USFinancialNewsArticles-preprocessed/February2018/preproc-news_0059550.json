    "text": "Nikkei snaps 3-day rising streak; BOJ's move to cut bond buying hits mood Published 7 Hours Ago Reuters \nTOKYO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average dropped on Wednesday, snapping a three-day winning streak after U.S. shares weakened overnight, while the central bank's decision to trim bond buying worsened sentiment. \nIndex-heavyweight stocks were sold, with Fast Retailing falling 1.5 percent, SoftBank Corp shedding 1.7 percent and Fanuc Corp sliding 1.0 percent. \nThe Nikkei opened 0.4 percent lower, then widened its decline after the Bank of Japan trimmed the amount of super long Japanese government bonds it offered to purchase at its regular debt-buying operation, which lifted the yen slightly. \nBy mid-morning trade, the Nikkei slipped 0.7 percent to 22,244.16. The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 107.09 yen, sliding from 107.43 yen earlier in the day. \nExporters were also battered, with Honda Motor falling 1.4 percent and TDK Corp dropping 1.1 percent. \nAs oil prices extended declines into a second day, the mining sector was hit. Inpex Corp tumbled 3.5 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co slumped 4.0 percent. \nThe broader Topix dropped 0.3 percent to 1,784.81. (Editing by Jacqueline Wong) ",
