Subscription revenue in the Asia-Pacific region grew over 100% for the third quarter in a row as we continue to focus on expansion in international and emerging markets. During the year, we significantly strengthened our cloud capabilities, including multi-cloud support to help our customers execute their cloud transition. As we enter 2018, we believe the success we are experiencing with enterprise adoption demonstrates our ability to capture an increasing share of the big data and cloud integration market.”\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights (in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 Revenue: Total Revenue $ 30,456 $ 41,519 $ 105,984 $ 148,595 Year-over-Year % Change 45% 36% 40% 40% Subscription Revenue $ 25,181 $ 35,164 $ 88,629 $ 125,898 Year-over-Year % Change 43% 40% 41% 42% Year-over-Year % Change - on a constant currency basis 48% 34% 44% 42% IFRS operating margin -21% -26% -25% -19% Non-IFRS operating margin (1) -18% -20% -21% -14% Net loss: IFRS $ (4,543) $ (10,684) $ (24,243) $ (31,208) Non-IFRS (2) $ (3,692) $ (8,138) $ (20,929) $ (22,673) Net loss per share: Net loss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.16) $ (0.37) $ (1.68) $ (1.08) Non-IFRS net loss per share $ (0.13) $ (0.28) $ (1.45) $ (0.78) Shares outstanding used in computing per share amounts - basic and diluted 28,528 29,253 14,464 28,966 (1) Non-IFRS operating margin is calculated as non-IFRS loss from operations divided by total revenue. (2) Non-IFRS financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition related costs and costs related to our follow-on offering and shelf-registration statement.\nA reconciliation of IFRS to non-IFRS financial measures is provided in the financial tables below. An explanation of these measures is also included below, under the heading Non-IFRS Financial Measures.\nRecent Business Highlights\nWe witnessed an extremely strong quarter on the partner front. In the fourth quarter we:\nCollaborated with leading System Integrator Capgemini to embed Talend’s on-demand training courses into their learning system, which will help increase the number of trained Talend consultants in the marketplace Teamed with Amazon and Cognizant on a quick-start solution to streamline the deployment of Cloud Data Lakes on AWS Achieved Microsoft Gold Cloud Competency & Co-Sell Partner Status underscoring Talend’s expertise on the Microsoft Azure platform and the compatibility of our solutions Announced the winners of 2017 Talend Data Masters Awards at Talend Connect user conference. Recipients included AIG, Johnson Controls, Paddy Power-Betfair, and Save the Children UK, each of which is using Talend solutions to innovate in their business\nFinancial Outlook\nTalend’s outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign exchange rates as of January 31, 2018, and is inclusive of the Restlet acquisition which closed on November 8, 2017.\nOur guidance is based on the new IFRS 15 revenue recognition standard that is effective for Talend beginning January 1, 2018 and will be adopted on a modified retrospective approach. See the section titled “New Revenue Recognition Standard Under IFRS 15” below.\nFirst quarter of 2018:\nTotal revenue is expected to be in the range of $45.3 million to $46.3 million. Loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $(10.3) million to $(9.3) million and non-IFRS loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $(5.5) million to $(4.5) million, as we step up our recruiting efforts in sales and marketing. Net loss is expected to be in the range of $(10.6) million to $(9.6) million and non-IFRS net loss is expected to be in the range of $(5.8) million to $(4.8) million. Net loss per basic and diluted share is expected to be in the range of $(0.36) to $(0.33) and non-IFRS net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $(0.20) to $(0.16). Basic and diluted weighted average share count of 29.4 million shares.\nFull year 2018:\nTotal revenue is expected to be in the range of $200.0 million to $202.0 million. Loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $(30.3) million to $(29.3) million and non-IFRS loss from operations is expected to improve slightly and be in the range of $(13.3) million to $(12.3) million. Net loss is expected to be in the range of $(31.3) million to $(30.3) million and non-IFRS net loss is expected to be in the range of $(14.3) million to $(13.3) million. Net loss per basic and diluted share is expected to be in the range of $(1.05) to $(1.01) and non-IFRS net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $(0.48) to $(0.44). Basic and diluted weighted average share count of 29.9 million shares.\nThese statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the section under the heading Forward-Looking Statements below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. An explanation of non-IFRS measures is also included below under the heading Non-IFRS Financial Measures.\nConference Call Information\nTalend will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on February 13, 2018.

International parties should call (719) 457-0820 and enter conference code 2907855.\nNew Revenue Recognition Standard Under IFRS 15\nIn May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes current revenue recognition requirements. The financial information under the heading “Financial Outlook” above is prepared in accordance with IFRS 15.\nThe standard will be effective for Talend for financial periods beginning on January 1, 2018, and provides alternative approaches to adoption. Under the new standard, and only for our on-premise and self-hosted offering, a portion of the subscription revenue arrangement will be recognized upfront for the value associated with the software license element of the arrangement, which Talend believes will be minimal in comparison to the entire arrangement, approximately 10%. The standard will also require that we defer all incremental commission costs to obtain customer contracts, such as sales commissions. Talend will be required to capitalize and amortize sales commissions for initial contracts over a period of benefit that we have determined is approximately five years.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘‘IFRS’’) as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (‘‘IASB’’), this press release and the accompanying tables contain certain non-IFRS financial measures.\nNon-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Talend considers these non-IFRS financial measures to be important because they provide useful indicators of its performance and liquidity measures. These are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the performance of a company. Non-IFRS financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only for understanding the company’s operating performance. The non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, and may be different from non-IFRS financial measures presented by other companies. Please see the reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measure included in this release below.\nNon-IFRS gross profit is calculated by adjusting gross profit to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nNon-IFRS gross margin , expressed as a percentage, is calculated as non-IFRS gross profit divided by total revenue.\nNon-IFRS loss from operations is calculated by adjusting loss from operations to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, acquisition related expense and costs related to follow-on offering and shelf registration statement.\nNon-IFRS operating margin , expressed as a percentage, is calculated as non-IFRS loss from operations divided by total revenue.\nNon-IFRS net loss is calculated by adjusting net loss to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, acquisition related expense and costs related to follow-on offering and shelf registration statement.\nNon-IFRS cost of revenue is calculated by adjusting cost of revenue to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nNon-IFRS operating expenses is calculated by adjusting operating expenses to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, acquisition related expense and costs related to follow-on offering and shelf registration statement.\nNon-IFRS sales and marketing expense is calculated by adjusting sales and marketing expense to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nNon-IFRS research and development expense is calculated by adjusting research and development expense to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nNon-IFRS general and administrative expense is calculated by adjusting general and administrative expense to eliminate the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, acquisition related expense and costs related to follow-on offering and shelf registration statement.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash from (used in) operating activities less cash used in investing activities for acquisition of property and equipment and intangible assets.\nSubscription revenue growth on a constant currency basis represents subscription revenue adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. Subscription revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated by applying the average monthly currency rates for each month in the comparative period to the corresponding month in the current period. We believe the disclosure of subscription revenue in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors considering potential significant fluctuations in currency rates.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
