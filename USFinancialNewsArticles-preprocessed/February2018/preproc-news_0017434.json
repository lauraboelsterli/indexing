    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Oaktree Capital Group, LLC (NYSE: OAK) (“Oaktree”) today announced the pricing of its previously announced public offering of 5,000,000 Class A units at a price to the public of $44.75 per Class A unit. Morgan Stanley will act as the sole bookrunner for the offering. In addition, the sole bookrunner has been granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 Class A units. Oaktree intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to acquire interests in its business from certain of its directors, current and former employees and other investors, including certain senior executives and other members of its senior management. Accordingly, Oaktree will not retain any proceeds from the sale of Class A units in the offering. The offering is expected to close on February 12, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe offering will be made under Oaktree’s effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The offering will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and an accompanying prospectus, copies of which may be obtained by contacting Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC - Attn: Prospectus Department - 180 Varick Street, 2nd Floor - New York, NY 10014.\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which reflect Oaktree’s current views with respect to, among other things, whether the offering will be completed. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release. Except as required by law, Oaktree does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208005411/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nOaktree Capital Group, LLC\nAndrea D.
