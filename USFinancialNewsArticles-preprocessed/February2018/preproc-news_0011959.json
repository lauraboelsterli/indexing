    "text": "DETROIT, Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Huron Capital announced today that it has expanded its team with the hiring of a new partner, Scott Hauncher, and promoted long-time employees James Mahoney and David Reynolds to Senior Partners.\n\"We believe the addition of Scott and promotions of Jim and David reflect the strength of Huron Capital's leadership and team, as well as our need for a deeper bench to lead our expanded investment strategies, capital base and portfolio of companies,\" said Brian Demkowicz, Managing Partner. \"Scott's experience in the private equity industry is a great fit for our focus areas. Likewise, since joining the firm, Jim and David have continuously demonstrated the dedication, knowledge and values important to Huron Capital and the executives and companies with whom we partner.\"\nHauncher brings more than 17 years of investment experience to Huron Capital's team. In his most recent role as partner at private equity firm Superior Capital, he was responsible for sourcing, executing and managing investments across a wide array of industries with a specialization in manufacturing and business services. He received a Bachelor of Science in accounting with honors from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He also received his Master of Business Administration from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.\n\"We have continuously been impressed with David and Jim throughout their more than 10 years with us and are confident in their abilities to help continue growing the firm,\" said Michael Beauregard, Senior Partner. \"We believe Scott will add value to our team with his deep knowledge of the industry, understanding of our investment philosophy and fit within our culture.\"\nMahoney joined Huron Capital over a decade ago and has more than 17 years of private equity experience. He plays a key role with several of the firm's ExecFactor® investment initiatives, such as Sciens Building Solutions, Albireo Energy and Valentus Specialty Chemicals. Prior to joining the firm, Mahoney worked for Conway MacKenzie, Inc. and Robert W. Baird & Co., where he was responsible for the execution of mergers and acquisitions advisory and capital raising transactions focused primarily in the industrial, consumer product and business services sectors. Mahoney holds a Bachelor of Arts in economics and political science from Villanova University and a Master of Business Administration with a concentration in finance and accounting from The University of Chicago. He currently serves on the board for Albireo Energy, Sciens Building Solutions, Valentus Specialty Chemicals and XLerate Group.\nReynolds joined Huron Capital in 2007 and currently serves as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer. He oversees administrative operations for the firm, as well as general and limited partnership accounting, reporting and compliance. Prior to joining the firm, he served as CFO of Printegra Corporation, a former Huron Capital portfolio company. In this role, Reynolds was responsible for all mergers and acquisitions, finance, accounting, credit, and risk management functions and helped lead the company through the Huron Capital-sponsored recapitalization, an aggressive growth period fueled by several acquisitions, and its subsequent sale. Reynolds holds a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from Kenyon College and Master of Business Administration and a Master of Professional Accountancy from Georgia State University. He currently serves on the board of the Midwest Chapter of the Private Equity CFO Association.\n2017 was another active year for Huron Capital, marked by four new platforms and three exits. The firm completed 21 transactions during the year across the firm's three sectors of interest: business services, consumer and specialty industrials aggregating to a total transaction value of over $700 million. Exemplifying its buy-and-build model, Huron Capital's team completed 14 add-on deals in 10 different states, across nine separate platform companies.\nAbout Huron Capital\nBased in Detroit, Huron Capital is an operationally-focused private equity firm with a long history of growing lower middle-market companies through our proprietary ExecFactor® buy-and-build investment model.
