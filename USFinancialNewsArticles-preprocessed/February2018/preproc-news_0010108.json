    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Dallas Business Journal named Chandini Portteus to its list of 40 Under 40. Portteus, the president and CEO of Wipe Out Kids' Cancer, will be recognized with 39 other impressive honorees in a special publication of the Dallas Business Journal and at an awards event on March 20.\nMore than 350 eligible nominations were submitted this year, representing nearly every industry of North Texas. In the end, judges found the most impressive group of 40 individuals under age 40.\nPortteus stood out to judges for her impressive career in the cancer space. She started her work at UT Southwestern Medical Center, then worked at Susan G. Komen. She was named the first Chief Mission Officer and the youngest C-level executive and seated officer in the organization's history. There, she managed an active daily funding portfolio of $300 million in research grants worldwide and led affiliate annual social service programming of more than $100 million annually, mission work in over 30 countries and all public policy efforts.\nAs a crisis and turnaround leader, she was recruited by the Livestrong Foundation to repair the brand through strategic mission efforts, and in nine months was able to increase all fundraising channels and expand cancer services to patients.\nNow as president and CEO of Wipe Out Kids' Cancer, she is leveraging her experience as a growth strategist. In the first six months on the job Portteus had already doubled the annual revenue of the organization, with more expansion planned.\n\"Chandini Portteus is an example of why this year's class of honorees is so impressive,\" said Tracy Merzi, publisher of the Dallas Business Journal. \"Her work with Wipe Out Kids' Cancer to impact pediatric cancer is truly noteworthy.\"\nAbout Wipe Out Kids' Cancer\nWipe Out Kids' Cancer (WOKC) is a Dallas-based non-profit organization founded in 1980 dedicated to raising awareness and funding for pediatric cancer research on a national basis. We have raised millions in the crusade against pediatric cancer and spent over 38 years developing programs to not only fight childhood cancer, but to also provide hope and support to kids and families dealing with cancer. Our mission is to work relentlessly for the day when ALL children are living cancer free.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chandini-portteus-named-as-dbj-2018-40-under-40-honoree-300595133.html\nSOURCE Wipe Out Kids' Cancer",
