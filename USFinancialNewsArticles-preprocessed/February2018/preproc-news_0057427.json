    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said a post-Brexit customs union between Britain and the European Union was possible but would rule out full access to the single market, making reference to the bloc’s relationship with Turkey.\n“It already exists, it’s the relationship the EU has with Turkey. So it’s an option, one with advantages and disadvantages, but it will not allow full access to the single market.”\nBritain’s opposition Labour party on Monday attempted to outflank the government by arguing that Britain should remain in a customs union with the EU, potentially setting up a major test of Prime Minister Theresa May’s fragile parliamentary authority.\nReporting by Michel Rose and Richard Lough; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Ingrid Melander\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
