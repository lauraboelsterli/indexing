    "text": "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Canada’s Mikael Kingsbury demolished the field to win Olympic gold in the men’s moguls at Phoenix Snow Park on Monday four years after finishing as runner-up in Sochi.\nKingsbury has dominated moguls skiing since the last Olympics and lived up to his billing with a flawless final run to score 86.63 points and earn Canada the men’s moguls title for the third Games in a row.\nMatt Graham of Australia clinched the silver and Japan’s Daichi Hara took bronze.\nKingsbury, 25, is the all-time leader in moguls skiing victories and his streak of 13 consecutive World Cup wins is the longest ever, but the Olympic gold was the medal he has craved since losing out to compatriot Alex Bilodeau in 2014.\nEver since he was a child Kingsbury has thought about this title, pinning a picture of the Olympic rings above his bed as a youngster growing up in Quebec.\n“I have dreamed about this day one million times,” Kingsbury told reporters.\n“I dreamed about it again last night. It is unbelievable. I am the Olympic champion and I will be for the rest of my life.”\nFreestyle Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Moguls Final – Phoenix Snow Park – Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 12, 2018 - Mikael Kingsbury of Canada celebrates after winning the gold medal. REUTERS/Mike Blake Japan’s Ikuma Horishima, a double world champion, was the man who ended Kingsbury’s World Cup winning run but he fell during the second final.\nCompatriot Sho Endo, fifth in the world cup rankings, set the highest score of 82.72 in a very high quality first final in which five athletes scored over 80 points.\nSouth Korean hopes were dashed in the second final as Choi Jae Woo crashed out attempting a 1080 but there were no problems for Kingsbury, who scored 82.19.\nSlideshow (8 Images) Hara top-scored in round two with 82.30 but Kingsbury’s superiority showed in the final round and his flawless run earned him 86.63 points.\nGraham was second on 82.57, a result that left the 23-year-old with the biggest smile in Pyeongchang.\nRelated Coverage Freestyle skiing: Moguls Matt rewarded for turning back on sailing “He is an amazing athlete,” Graham said of Kingsbury.\n“With all that he has achieved, all the World Cup victories and world championship victories, a silver medal at the last game and now the cherry on the top with a gold medal, it has now solidified him as the greatest ever.”\nHara’s bronze medal was Japan’s first in moguls skiing and he sprinted round in circles to celebrate his surprise success.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant, editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
