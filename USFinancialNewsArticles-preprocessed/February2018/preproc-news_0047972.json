Qualcomm shares fell 1.2 percent.\nBy 11:05 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.53 percent to trade at 25,097.77.\nThe Nasdaq Composite rose 0.85 percent to 7,295.86 and the S&P 500 was up 0.65 percent at 2,733.83.\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.18 percent gain in the industrial index.\nBoeing gained 1.4 percent after Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said the plane maker will generate about 15 percent of its earnings per share and about 10 percent of its cash for the full year during the first quarter of 2018.\nAmazon rose 1.9 percent, while tech heavyweights such as Facebook, Apple and Alphabet gained between 1 percent and 2.6 percent.\nThe real estate sector, however, came under pressure after data showed U.S. home sales unexpectedly fell in January.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, were slightly below the four-year peak at 2.8932 percent.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of near-term stock market volatility, eased to a session low of 18.38 and below Friday’s close of 19.46.\nA jump in these two gauges to multi-year highs were at the center of the selloff in equities earlier in the month.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,145 to 649. On the Nasdaq, 2,068 issues rose and 686 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D‘Silva)\n ",
