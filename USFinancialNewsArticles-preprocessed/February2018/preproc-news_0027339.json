REUTERS/Maxim Shipenkov/Pool Abbas was Quote: d as saying he wanted an expanded new mediation mechanism to replace the Middle East Quartet.\n“For instance, ‘the quartet’ plus some other countries like the model used to achieve the deal on Iran,” Abbas said, referring to international talks about Tehran’s nuclear program.\nAbbas and his allies were left furious in December when U.S. President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and set in motion the process of moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv.\nReporting by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Andrew Roche\n ",
