    "text": "CALABASAS HILLS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated (NASDAQ: CAKE) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, which ended on January 2, 2018.\nTotal revenues were $571.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to $603.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 included 13 weeks compared to 14 weeks in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Net income and diluted net income per share were $57.7 million and $1.24, respectively, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company recorded a $38.5 million benefit to the income tax provision from a revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to recently enacted tax reform. The Company also recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $9.1 million related to one Cheesecake Factory restaurant and one Grand Lux Cafe. Excluding these items, net income and diluted net income per share were $24.7 million and $0.53, respectively, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nComparable restaurant sales at The Cheesecake Factory restaurants declined 0.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (13 weeks vs. 13 weeks).\n“Our sales trend started to stabilize during the fourth quarter, which coupled with solid operational performance, drove comparable sales and earnings results within our expectations,” said David Overton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “In addition, we opened six restaurants during the quarter, including our first Company-owned international location in Canada, as we continue to execute our growth strategy.”\nOverton continued, “Underscoring the strength of our culture and values, we are honored to be recognized as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For ® ” by FORTUNE magazine for the fifth consecutive year. As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of our founding this year, our steadfast commitment to taking exceptional care of our guests and staff members has been integral to our success.
