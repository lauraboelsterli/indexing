Mandatory Credit: Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY Sports \n“We were forced to conduct a short-handed practice as more than half of the team was taken by the doping officers and the girls were late for training.” \nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Russia from Pyeongchang over “systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system in Sochi four years ago but left the door open for athletes with no history of doping to compete as neutrals. \nIt later invited 169 Russian athletes who met that criteria to participate in the Pyeongchang Games in a team officially known as “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (OAR). \nThe OAR women’s ice hockey team will play in Group A at the Feb. 9-25 Games alongside Canada, Finland and the United States.
