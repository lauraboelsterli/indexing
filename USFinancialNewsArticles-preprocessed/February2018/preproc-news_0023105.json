    "text": "February 10, 2018 / 4:20 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago Rugby-Ireland thrash Italy to make it two wins from two Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nDUBLIN, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Ireland crushed Italy 56-19 on Saturday to make it two Six Nations wins out of two and secure their first bonus point of the championship. \nIreland, who ran in nine tries against Italy in each of their last two meetings, looked to keep ball in hand early on and were three tries to the good after 20 minutes thanks to Robbie Henshaw, Bundee Aki and the pick from Conor Murray. \nWinger Keith Earls secured the bonus point before halftime and Henshaw added his second after the break but it came at a cost as he left the pitch in a sling following the grounding, joining prop Tadhg Furlong who went off with a leg injury. \nTwo tries for Jacob Stockdale and one by Rory Best completed the rout while Tomasso Allan, Edoardo Gori and Matteo Minozzi grabbed consolation scores for the Italians who equalled their worst ever run in the tournament with a 14th consecutive defeat.
