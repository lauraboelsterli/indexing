    "text": "The Codeship SaaS-based Solutions Further Extend the CloudBees Vision of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for All Developers and DevOps Teams\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CloudBees, Inc. , the hub of enterprise Jenkins and DevOps, today announced the acquisition of Codeship. The deal strengthens CloudBees’ market position as the de facto vendor of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), adding a fully automated and easy-to-use platform for individual developers and project teams to seamlessly test, integrate and deploy code.\nCodeship, founded in 2011, has more than 2,400 customers leveraging its cloud-based Codeship Basic and Codeship Pro solutions. The company, headquartered in Boston with satellite offices in Berlin, Germany and Vienna, Austria, has more than 100,000 developers using its platform, is executing millions of builds for its users and has raised more than $11 million in venture funding.\nThe acquisition gives CloudBees a broader portfolio of CI/CD solutions for organizations of all sizes - and with support for several CI/CD philosophies and approaches. CloudBees has long focused on the mass adoption of CI/CD through its work with Jenkins, the leading CI/CD open source automation server. Jenkins offers extensive flexibility and customizability. The CloudBees solutions have focused on the needs of enterprises running Jenkins at scale. Adding the Codeship SaaS enables CloudBees to serve a growing segment of the market looking for SaaS-delivered CI/CD solutions that are easy to use.\n“This is the most impactful acquisition in CloudBees’ history,” said Sacha Labourey, CEO and co-founder of CloudBees. “We’ve been leading the continuous delivery and DevOps industry with automation solutions and we recognize that needs are evolving quickly. With Codeship, we want to provide organizations an additional option that is self-service and easy to use. This acquisition ensures that CloudBees will be able to offer a range of CI/CD solutions, from cloud, self-service and opinionated to on-premise, self-managed and fully customizable - all through a smooth and unified experience.”\nCodeship offers two solutions: Codeship Basic and Codeship Pro. Both provide cloud-based CI/CD services for development teams and include free and paid tiers. Codeship also offers the option for organizations to run their builds in the cloud, while hosting their code on-premise.\nThe deal also provides CloudBees with a new source of top talent to bolster its investments in CI and CD. CloudBees will retain Codeship executives and employees, including Codeship CEO and founder Moritz Plassnig, who is working closely with Labourey on the smooth integration of the two companies.\n“We are excited to be joining CloudBees,” Plassnig said. “Our employees will benefit from the opportunity to join such a highly-regarded organization known for its commitment to excellence in CI and CD. Our customers’ investments in Codeship tools will receive the backing of CloudBees’ global customer service, support and success resources.”\nCodeship was founded in Vienna, Austria by Florian Motlik, Manuel Weiss and Moritz Plassnig. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nAdditional Resources:\nRead the blog from Sacha Labourey, CEO and co-founder, CloudBees\nhttps://www.cloudbees.com/blog/codeship-and-cloudbees-join-forces Read the blog from Moritz Plassnig, CEO and co-founder, Codeship\nhttps://blog.codeship.com/codeship-acquired-by-cloudbees Read the FAQ:\nhttps://www.cloudbees.com/blog/cloudbees-acquires-codeship-faq Learn more about Codeship Basic by CloudBees, Codeship Pro by CloudBees:\nhttps://codeship.com/features Learn more about CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise:\nhttps://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-enterprise\nThe acquisition of Codeship is expected to close in early February 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nAbout CloudBees\nCloudBees is the hub of enterprise Jenkins and DevOps, providing companies with smarter solutions for automating software development and delivery.
