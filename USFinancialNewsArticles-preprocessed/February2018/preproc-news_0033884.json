The municipal bond market is roughly $3.8 trillion in size.\nThe termination of the tax break for interest earned on the debt is expected to generate $17.3 billion for the U.S. government between 2018 and 2027.\nCurrent debt refundings, which are done within the 90-day call date window, remain tax exempt.
