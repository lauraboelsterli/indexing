    "text": "GANGNEUNG, It took the unified Korean women’s ice hockey team 149 minutes and 31 seconds of playing time to get their first Olympic goal. South Korea’s men’s hockey team needed only 7 minutes and 34 seconds to do it.\nSlideshow (5 Images) The Koreans jumped out to a surprise 1-0 lead over a much higher-ranked Czech Republic team with a goal by Cho Minho, assisted by Brock Radunske and Michael Swift, sending the near-capacity crowed at the Gangneung Hockey Centre into delirium.\nThe Czechs leveled the scores about four minutes later.\nReporting by Dan Burns, editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
