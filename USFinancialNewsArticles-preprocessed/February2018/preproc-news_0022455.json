(NASDAQ: HOLI) (\"Hollysys\" or the \"Company\"), a leading provider of automation and control technologies and applications in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2018 ended December 31, 2017 (see attached tables). The management of Hollysys, stated:\nIndustrial automation remained on the track of recovery, with revenue recording a 25.9% year-over-year growth, at $57.6 million. Management team has adhered to the low-to-high end market expansion strategy in industries such as chemical and petro-chemical, etc. while building comprehensive service capacity to address the substantial aftersales potential from the entire customer base and seeking new opportunities from existing end-users. On the chemical industry, we signed a contract with Jinan Taixing Fine Chemicals Company to provide system for their polyphosphazene project, a contract with Jiangsu Jingshen Salt & Chemical Industry Co., Ltd to provide Manufacturing Execution System for information integration of their salt packaging and distribution center. On the petro-chemical industry, we signed a contract with China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation to provide DCS and instruments for their liquid chemical wharf project. We entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with CEET, a wholly-owned subsidiary of China National Offshore Oil Corporation to collectively push forward the localization of core equipment on offshore oil platform. In the new energy and food-beverage area, we signed a contract to provide system for Chia Tai Group's recycling of waste project and a contract with Lihua Starch Co., Ltd for their sorbitol project.\nOur demonstration-for-further-application strategy in factory automation has brought us more market recognition. We earned government level recognition as we were listed as one of the 23 intelligent manufacturing system solution providers recommended by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. We continued to focus on several key industries and cooperate with renowned players. On white-goods, our cooperation with Haier went further as we signed contracts on their Tianjin-based and Qingdao-based washing machine factories. On food beverage area, we are dedicated to provide innovative solution to address safety and efficiency issues. Upon the successful delivery of the first project, our relationship with Hai Di Lao went deeper, with regular communication mechanism set. We expect broader cooperation with them and more clients in the future.\nThe performance of high speed rail was prominent in this quarter, with revenue recording a 199.0% year-over-year growth at $69.6 million. One of the contributors is the significant increase in aftersales order, including ATP maintenance and replacement contracts. Signing 80 sets of automatic train protection (ATP) to high speed trains in 300-350km/h also contributed greatly to the revenue because of the tightening delivery schedule to secure the Spring Festival Travel. Breakthrough has been made in our new product as we signed our first tract circuit contract for Chengdu-Ya'an regular speed railway line. In subway, we signed SCADA contract for Chengdu Subway Line 5. We will adhere to the expansion strategy to win SCADA contracts in more cities and work closely with subway authorities to promote our SCADA system and subway signaling technologies in future. Management team will adhere to the diversity strategy to create revenue stream from more new products and services, and to maintain a stable and healthy growth into the future.\nIn oversea business, we signed several EPC contracts with domestic companies, including a contract with Shandong Ludian Co. Ltd to provide DCS for 2X350MW power station in Indonesia. Mechanical and electrical installation services recorded a 0.4% revenue growth at $30.2 million. We continued to address operation, management and risk control issue to ensure that projects can be delivered in good quality, while closely following economic and political circumstances in South East Asia and Middle East. Concord and Bond remained active in seeking business opportunities and we believe that their strategic value as customer resources and international sales channels remains significant.\nFirst Half Year and the Second Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 Unaudited Financial Results Summary\nTo facilitate a clear understanding of Hollysys' operational results, a summary of unaudited non-GAAP financial results is shown as below:\n(In USD thousands, except for number of shares and per share data)\nThree months ended\nSix months ended\nDec 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\n%\nChange\nDec 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\n%\nChange\nRevenues\n$\n157,404\n99,137\n58.8%\n$\n272,914\n202,679\n34.7%\nIntegrated contract revenue\n$\n134,419\n89,535\n50.1%\n$\n230,109\n182,600\n26.0%\nProducts sales\n$\n9,717\n6,057\n60.4%\n$\n19,177\n14,370\n33.5%\nService rendered\n$\n13,268\n3,545\n274.3%\n$\n23,628\n5,709\n313.9%\nCost of revenues\n$\n95,424\n70,704\n35.0%\n$\n168,663\n143,588\n17.5%\nGross profit\n$\n61,980\n28,433\n118.0%\n$\n104,251\n59,091\n76.4%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n21,072\n17,236\n22.3%\n$\n40,278\n30,543\n31.9%\nSelling\n$\n7,740\n6,307\n22.7%\n$\n14,438\n11,858\n21.8%\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n12,177\n10,819\n12.6%\n$\n23,135\n20,493\n12.9%\nResearch and development\n$\n10,585\n8,293\n27.6%\n$\n19,216\n15,990\n20.2%\nVAT refunds and government subsidies\n$\n(9,430)\n(8,183)\n15.2%\n$\n(16,511)\n(17,798)\n(7.2)%\nIncome from operations\n$\n40,908\n11,197\n265.3%\n$\n63,973\n28,548\n124.1%\nOther income, net\n$\n2,271\n866\n162.2%\n$\n2,710\n1,260\n115.1%\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\n$\n29\n(715)\n104.1%\n$\n(1,104)\n(635)\n73.9%\nShare of net income of equity investees\n$\n1,337\n970\n37.8%\n$\n2,273\n2,279\n(0.3)%\nGains on deconsolidation of the Company's interests in Beijing Hollycon Electronic Technology Co., Ltd\n$\n-\n-\n-\n$\n-\n6,005\n(100.0)%\nDividend income from a cost investee\n-\n-\n-\n$\n1,057\n-\n-\nInterest income\n$\n1,560\n512\n204.7%\n$\n3,036\n1,257\n141.5%\nInterest expenses\n$\n(497)\n(271)\n83.4%\n$\n(634)\n(400)\n58.5%\nIncome tax expenses\n$\n9,295\n1,559\n496.2%\n$\n13,031\n4,570\n185.1%\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests\n$\n52\n(9)\n(677.8)%\n$\n86\n(13)\n(761.5)%\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd.\n$\n36,261\n11,009\n229.4%\n$\n58,194\n33,757\n72.4%\nNon-GAAP basic EPS\n$\n0.60\n0.18\n233.3%\n$\n0.96\n0.56\n71.4%\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS\n$\n0.60\n0.18\n233.3%\n$\n0.96\n0.56\n71.4%\nShare-based compensation expenses\n$\n(67)\n918\n(107.3)%\n$\n324\n1,837\n(82.4)%\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n$\n101\n122\n(17.2)%\n$\n279\n263\n6.1%\nGAAP Net income attributable to Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd.\n$\n36,227\n9,969\n263.4%\n$\n57,591\n31,657\n81.9%\nGAAP basic EPS\n$\n0.60\n0.17\n252.9%\n$\n0.95\n0.53\n79.2%\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$\n0.60\n0.17\n252.9%\n$\n0.95\n0.52\n79.2%\n-\n-\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding\n60,431,250\n60,070,218\n0.6%\n60,428,431\n59,976,132\n0.8%\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n61,251,116\n60,895,404\n0.6%\n61,241,092\n61,023,669\n0.4%\nOperational Results Analysis for the Second Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nComparing to the second quarter of the prior fiscal year, the total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased from $99.1 million to $157.4 million, representing an increase of 58.8%.

administrative expenses\", \"Non-GAAP net income attributable to Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd. stockholders\", \"Non-GAAP basic earnings per share\", and \"Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share\" serve as additional indicators of our operating performance and not as a replacement for other measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as they exclude the non-cash share-based compensation expenses, which is calculated based on the number of shares or options granted and the fair value as of the grant date, amortization of acquired intangible assets, fair value adjustments of acquisition-related consideration, and fair value adjustments of a bifurcated derivative. They will not result in any cash inflows or outflows. We believe that using non-GAAP measures help our shareholders to have a better understanding of our operating results and growth prospects. In addition, given the business nature of the Company, it has been a common practice for investors to use such non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures for the periods indicated:\n(In USD thousands, except for number of shares and per share data)\nThree months ended\nSix months ended\nDec 31,\nDec 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nCost of integrated contracts\n$\n88,186\n$\n67,896\n$\n155,998\n$\n137,810\nLess: Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n101\n122\n279\n263\nNon-GAAP cost of integrated contracts\n$\n88,085\n$\n67,774\n$\n155,719\n$\n137,547\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$\n12,110\n$\n11,737\n$\n23,459\n$\n22,330\nLess: Share-based compensation expenses\n(67)\n918\n324\n1,837\nNon-GAAP general and administrative expenses\n$\n12,177\n$\n10,819\n$\n23,135\n$\n20,493\nNet income attributable to Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd.\n$\n36,227\n$\n9,969\n$\n57,591\n$\n31,657\nAdd:\nShare-based compensation expenses\n(67)\n918\n324\n1,837\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n101\n122\n279\n263\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd.\n$\n36,261\n$\n11,009\n$\n58,194\n$\n33,757\nWeighted average number of basic ordinary shares\n60,431,250\n60,070,218\n60,428,431\n59,976,132\nWeighted average number of diluted ordinary shares\n61,251,116\n60,895,404\n61,241,092\n61,023,669\nNon-GAAP basic earnings per share\n$\n0.60\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.96\n$\n0.56\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share\n$\n0.60\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.96\n$\n0.55\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hollysys-automation-technologies-reports-unaudited-financial-results-for-the-first-half-year-and-the-second-quarter-ended-december-31-2017-300595905.html\nSOURCE Hollysys Automation Technologies, Ltd",
