    "text": "PARIS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Vivendiâ€™s core operating profit jumped by 23 percent over the last year, driven by the strong performance of its music division and the start of a recovery at its pay-TV unit.\nEarnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) amounted to 987 million euros ($1.23 billion) on total revenues of 12.4 billion euros, up 4.9 percent from a year earlier.\nThe group, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, did not provide yearly group targets but said it expected its pay-TV division Canal Plus to yield 450 million euros in EBITA in 2018.\nVivendi also said it would raise its dividend by 12.5 percent to 0.45 euros per share.\n$1 = 0.8013 euros Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain and Gwenaelle Barzic Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
