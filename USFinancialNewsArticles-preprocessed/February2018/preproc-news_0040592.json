    "text": "Feb 15 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index was little changed on Thursday as gains in the financial sector and shares of TransCanada Corp were tempered by a decline in resource companies.\n* At 10:20 a.m. EST (1520 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index edged up 4.79 points, or 0.03 percent, at 15,333.06.\n* TransCanada was the biggest advancer on the index, rising 3.7 percent to C$55.64, after its fourth-quarter profit beat expectations due to lower costs and an expansion of gas lines.\n* The financials group also helped support the market, gaining 0.5 percent as Toronto-Dominion Bank rose 0.6 percent to C$72.74, while Royal Bank of Canada advanced 0.4 percent to C$100.86.\n* On the downside, Barrick Gold Corp declined 3.0 percent to C$16.64 after the world’s biggest gold producer, forecast an output drop over the next four years.\n* Barrick helped weigh on the materials sector, which retreated 0.7 percent.\n* Investors were also taking in a slew of Canadian corporate earnings, while global markets rose.\n* Bombardier jumped 8.8 percent to C$3.58 after an improvement in sales and margins in its rail division helped its quarterly profit beat estimates.\n* Late on Wednesday, an independent U.S. trade body said it had rejected hefty U.S. duties on Bombardier’s CSeries jets partly because Boeing lost no sales or revenue when Delta Air Lines ordered the aircraft in 2016 from the Canadian planemaker.\n* Shopify weighed on the index, down 1.8 percent at C$168.4 after the company reported fourth-quarter results and guidance.\n* The TSX posted 11 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were 14 new 52-week highs and 15 new lows. Volume on the index was 47.64 million shares. (Reporting by Leah Schnurr in Ottawa; Editing by Bernadette Baum)\n ",
