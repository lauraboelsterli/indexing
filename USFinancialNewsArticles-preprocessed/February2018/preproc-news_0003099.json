    "text": "PayPal Holdings Inc’s shares fell as much as 12% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after former parent company eBay Inc said it had signed up a new primary payment processor.\nEBay said it will start processing payments globally using Dutch payments company Adyen, allowing its users to remain on the eBay website when checking out.\nPayPal said eBay shoppers will still be able to select PayPal as a form of payment until at least July 2023. The news from eBay came as PayPal reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street estimates but gave a disappointing outlook for the first quarter. PayPal shares initially fell 5% after the release of the quarterly results.\nThe chief executive officer of PayPal, Dan Schulman, said on a call with analysts that the changing relationship with eBay was very “manageable” and that it was in line with PayPal’s new strategy.\nEBay accounts for roughly 13% of total payments processed by PayPal.\nPayPal was spun out of eBay in 2015 and has since been working to transform itself from a company that mainly processed payments for its parent company to one that processes payments for other large companies and their customers, as well as for individuals paying family and friends.\nPayPal’s new strategic direction has led to partnerships with numerous large financial institutions and big technology companies including Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple Inc , Mastercard Inc, Visa Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nSan Jose, California-based PayPal forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings of 52 cents to 54 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nPayPal expects revenue for the full year of $15 billion to $15.25 billion. Analysts had been forecasting $15.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nPayPal’s focus on partnerships and acquisitions have been paying off with growth in payment volumes and users.\nThe company processed $131 billion in payments in the fourth quarter, up 32% from a year earlier, and added 8.7 million active customers.\nPayPal has been looking to freshen its brand and deepen usage with younger customers through its peer-to-peer payments app Venmo. Venmo processed around $35 billion in payments in 2017, up 97%.\nPayPal’s net income rose to $620 million, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $390 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned 55 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 52 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet revenue climbed to $3.74 billion from $2.98 billion.\nThe results included a net tax expense of $180 million connected to the recent U.S. tax reform, the company said.",
