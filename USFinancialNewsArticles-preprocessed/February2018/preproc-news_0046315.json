    "text": "BOSTON, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Block & Leviton LLP ( www.blockesq.com ), a securities litigation firm representing investors nationwide, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Riot Blockchain, Inc. (\"Riot\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: RIOT) and certain of its officers and directors alleging violations of the federal securities laws and reminds investors of April 18, 2018 lead plaintiff deadline.\nFollowing a February 16, 2018 report published by CNBC warning investors of numerous \"red flags,\" a securities class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of Riot stockholders who purchased their shares between November 13, 2017 and February 15, 2018, inclusive (the \"Class Period\").\nThe lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (No. 3:2018-cv-02293), alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Riot's principle executive offices were not in Colorado, but rather in Florida in the same location as a large, influential shareholder, Barry C. Honig who had a previous working relationship with Defendant O'Rouke; (2) Riot never intended to hold its Annual General Meetings scheduled for December 28, 2017 and February 1, 2018; and (3) as a result, Defendants' statements about Riot's business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\nIf you purchased Riot stock during the Class Period and wish to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 18, 2018. As a member of the class, you may seek to file a motion to serve as a lead plaintiff or take no action and remain an absent class member. If you wish to become involved in the litigation or have questions about your legal rights, you are encouraged to contact attorney Bradley Vettraino at (617) 398-5600, by email at bradley@blockesq.com , or by visiting www.blockesq.com/riot .\nConfidentiality to whistleblowers or others with information relevant to this investigation is assured.\nBlock & Leviton LLP is a Boston-based law firm representing investors nationwide.
