(NYSE:MTX) today reported diluted earnings per share of $1.10, excluding special items, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared with earnings per share of $1.08 in the prior year period. Reported earnings were $2.12 per share.\nFor the full year 2017, the company reported earnings per share of $4.59, excluding special items, compared with earnings of $4.47 per share in the prior year. Reported earnings per share were $5.48 for the full year of 2017.\n“The Company had a solid fourth quarter, with continued strong operating margins,” said Douglas T. Dietrich, Chief Executive Officer. “We saw strong sales growth in the second half of 2017, with increases across all four of our segments.”\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017\nWorldwide net sales increased 8 percent to $432 million. Operating income, as reported, was $45.7 million and represented 10.6 percent of sales. Operating income, excluding special items, increased 4 percent to $62.5 million and represented 14.5 percent of sales.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company incurred special charges primarily related to restructuring and non-cash impairment charges from the closure of paper mills in North America, as well as the alignment of corporate and Paper PCC staffing levels into higher growth regions. The restructuring is expected to result in approximately $6 million in savings on an annualized basis. The Company also recorded a provisional $47 million income tax benefit, or $1.32 per share, from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation. This benefit is comprised of an $82 million gain related primarily to the re-measurement of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax liabilities at a lower U.S. tax rate of 21%, partially offset by tax expense of $35 million for the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nSegment Information\nPerformance Materials and Specialty Minerals\nSales in the Minerals businesses, which include the Performance Materials and Specialty Minerals segments, grew 9 percent in the fourth quarter to $340 million. Operating income for the Minerals businesses, excluding special items, was $51.4 million and operating margins represented 15.1 percent of sales.\nPerformance Materials segment sales increased 12 percent in the fourth quarter to $196 million. Metalcasting sales rose 17 percent on higher volumes in all regions. Household, Personal Care & Specialty Products increased 16 percent driven by higher pet care volumes and increased fabric care sales. Building Materials sales increased 21 percent due to several large projects in the U.S., and Environmental Products sales rose 10 percent on higher volumes in the U.S. These sales increases were partially offset by 6 percent lower Basic Minerals sales due to reduced volumes and prices of bulk chromite. Operating income decreased 4 percent to $28.1 million, due to a decline in bulk chromite pricing and a weaker product mix, and represented 14.4 percent of sales. The Performance Materials segment provides a wide range of bentonite-based and synthetic materials for industrial and consumer markets and for non-residential construction, environmental remediation and infrastructure projects worldwide.\nSpecialty Minerals segment sales, which consist of the Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) and Processed Minerals product lines, increased 4 percent to $143.9 million. Income from operations for the segment, excluding special items, increased 8 percent to $23.3 million, and operating margins were 16.2 percent of sales.\nWorldwide sales of PCC, which is used mainly in the manufacturing processes of the paper industry, increased 4 percent to $110.9 million. Higher sales in Asia, Europe and Latin America were partially offset by reduced sales in North America.\nFourth quarter sales of Processed Minerals products increased 5 percent. Ground Calcium Carbonate sales grew 9 percent due to higher volumes in construction and automotive markets, which were partially offset by a 2 percent decrease in Talc sales. Processed Minerals products are used in the building materials, polymers, ceramics, consumer products, paints and coatings, glass and other manufacturing industries.\nRefractories and Energy Services\nThe Service businesses, which include the Refractories and Energy Services segments, continued to report improved performance. Sales of $92.4 million in the fourth quarter were 5 percent higher than the same period last year. Operating income for the Service businesses, excluding special items, increased 5 percent to $12.4 million and operating margins were 13.4 percent of sales.\nRefractories segment sales increased 5 percent to $71.3 million, driven by higher sales of metallurgical wire and refractories products. The Refractories segment operating income increased 4 percent to $10.2 million and was 14.3 percent of sales. The Refractories segment provides products and services primarily to the worldwide steel industry.\nEnergy Services segment sales were $21.1 million, a 4 percent increase from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher filtration activity. Operating income, excluding special items, was $2.2 million, an increase of 10 percent over the prior year, and represented 10.4 percent of sales. This improvement was driven by the benefits realized from the restructuring of the business in the first half of 2016 to focus on more profitable and differentiated services. Energy Services offers a range of patented technologies, products and services for off-shore filtration and well testing to the worldwide oil and gas industry.\nFULL YEAR 2017\nWorldwide net sales increased 2 percent to $1.676 billion. Operating income as reported increased 10 percent to $242.7 million and represented 14.5 percent of sales. Operating income, excluding special items, increased 2 percent to $263.2 million and represented 15.7 percent of sales.\n“MTI posted a solid year, driven by geographic expansion, organizational realignment and new product introductions. Our continued focus on operational excellence and productivity improvements resulted in record earnings, and we further strengthened our balance sheet through debt repayment. As we enter 2018, we are solidly positioned to continue to pursue sustainable, profitable growth across our portfolio,” said Mr. Dietrich.\nSegment Information\nPerformance Materials and Specialty Minerals\nSales in the Minerals businesses, which include the Performance Materials and Specialty Minerals segments, grew 3 percent to $1.320 billion. Operating income for the Minerals businesses, excluding special items, was $220.9 million and operating margins represented 16.7 percent of sales.\nPerformance Materials segment sales increased 7 percent in the full year to $734.8 million. Metalcasting sales increased 14 percent, principally due to higher volumes in Asia and North America. Basic Minerals sales increased 20 percent, driven primarily by higher sales of bulk chromite and drilling products, and Building Materials sales increased 6 percent. These sales increases were partially offset by decreased Environmental Products sales, and lower Fabric Care sales in Asia which affected Household, Personal Care & Specialty Products. Operating income decreased 1 percent to $119.7 million, due to a decline in bulk chromite pricing and a weaker product mix, and represented 16.3 percent of sales.\nSpecialty Minerals segment sales, which consists of the PCC and Processed Minerals product lines, decreased 1 percent to $584.8 million. Income from operations for the segment, excluding special items, decreased 1 percent to $101.2 million, and operating margins were 17.3 percent of sales.\nWorldwide sales of PCC decreased 2 percent in the full year to $443.7 million, primarily due to sales declines in North America, which offset growth in Asia, Europe and Latin America.\nFull year sales of Processed Minerals products increased 1 percent to $141.1 million. Ground Calcium Carbonate sales increased 4 percent due to higher volumes in construction and automotive markets, which were partially offset by a 3 percent decrease in Talc sales.\nRefractories and Energy Services\nThe Service businesses, which include the Refractories and Energy Services segments, reported sales of $356.1 million, a decrease of 1 percent compared to last year. However, operating income for the Service businesses, excluding special items, increased 18 percent to $46.6 million and operating margins were 13.1 percent of sales.\nRefractories segment sales increased 2 percent to $279.4 million. The Refractories segment operating income increased 14 percent to $39.8 million and was 14.2 percent of sales. The increase in operating income and margins was driven by higher equipment sales and improved refractory operating costs.\nEnergy Services segment sales were $76.7 million, an 11 percent decrease from the prior year, primarily due to the exit of certain businesses in 2016. Operating income, excluding special items, was $6.8 million, an increase of 55 percent over the prior year, and represented 8.9 percent of sales, which benefited from the 2016 restructuring mentioned above.\nMinerals Technologies will host a conference call tomorrow, February 2, 2018 at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.

AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME 1 ) For comparative purposes, the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2017, October 1, 2017 and December 31, 2016 consisted of 91 days, 91 days and 90 days. 2 ) On a regular basis, the Company reviews its segments and the approach used by the chief decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources. Accordingly, in Q1 2017, in order to generate greater alignment, speed decision making and accelerate growth, the Company reorganized the management structure for its Performance Materials and Construction Technologies business segments to better reflect the way performance is evaluated and resources are allocated. As a result, all of the product lines within these business segments were combined into one operating segment. Presented below are the restated financial results, by product line, for each of the quarters of 2016 of this operating segment to conform to the current management structure. Full Year (millions of dollars) Quarter Ended Ended Apr. 3, Jul. 3, Sep. 27, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, 2016\n2016\n2016\n2016\n2016\nSales Metalcasting $ 60.0 $ 68.0 $ 63.1 $ 66.9 $ 258.0 Household, Personal Care & Specialty Products 45.3 44.0 42.1 39.8 171.2 Environmental products 13.4 26.5 24.6 14.4 78.9 Building Materials 20.4 19.7 16.9 17.1 74.1 Basic Minerals 20.5 24.3 22.3 36.8 103.9 Performance Materials Segment $ 159.6 $ 182.5 $ 169.0 $ 175.0 $ 686.1 Operating Income Performance Materials Segment $ 28.2 $ 33.3 $ 30.2 $ 29.4 $ 121.1 % of Sales 17.7 % 18.2 % 17.9 % 16.8 % 17.7 % 3 ) During 2016, the Company incurred restructuring charges related to lease termination costs, inventory write-offs and impairment of assets relating to its exit from the U.S. on-shore service lines, including Nitrogen and Pipeline within the Energy Services segment as a result of the significant reduction in oil prices and overcapacity in the onshore oil services market. During 2017, the Company recorded additional restructuring costs related to the exited businesses in the Energy Services segment, impairment of assets in the Specialty Minerals segment related to paper mill shut downs and employee severance costs related to a reduction of our North American employee base as we realign our staffing levels to growth regions as well as efficiencies gained from our global ERP implementation.

The Company's management believes these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance as inclusion of such special items are not indicative of the ongoing operating results and thereby affect the comparability of results between periods. The Company feels inclusion of these non-GAAP measures also provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of historic operating trends. (millions of dollars) Quarter Ended Year Ended Dec. 31, Oct. 1, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, 2017\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to MTI $ 75.8 $ 41.7 $ 36.7 $ 195.1 $ 133.4 % of sales 17.5 % 9.8 % 9.1 % 11.6 % 8.1 % Special items: Acquisition related transaction and integration costs 0.6 0.5 2.9 3.4 8.0 Debt modification costs and fees 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.9 0.0 Write-off of receivables for Malaysia bankruptcy 2.1 0.0 0.0 2.1 0.0 Restructuring and other items, net 8.8 0.4 0.9 9.7 9.8 Impairment of assets 5.3 0.0 0.0 5.3 18.5 Related tax effects on special items (6.0 ) (0.3 ) (2.1 ) (8.9 ) (12.3 ) Effect of US tax law change (47.3 ) 0.0 0.0 (47.3 ) 0.0 Income from continuing operations attributable to MTI, excluding special items $ 39.3 $ 42.3 $ 38.4 $ 163.3 $ 157.4 % of sales 9.1 % 10.0 % 9.6 % 9.7 % 9.6 % Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items $ 1.10 $ 1.19 $ 1.08 $ 4.59 $ 4.47 Included in marketing and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 is a provision for bad debt of $2.1 million related to a bankruptcy of a Paper PCC customer in Malaysia. 5 ) On December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation was signed into law, encompassing a broad range of tax reform proposals, including a reduction of U.S. corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, transitioning U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax that is payable over eight years on deemed repatriated accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As required under ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company is required to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred tax positions and the retroactive effects of changes in tax laws in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. As such, the Company recorded a provisional $47 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, comprised of a tax benefit primarily from the lower U.S. tax rate, resulting in a reduction of deferred tax liabilities of $82 million and a $35 million charge related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings. The Company will continue to analyze and interpret the changes in the new tax law. 6 ) Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures. The following is a presentation of the Company's non-GAAP free cash flow for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2017, October 1, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and a reconciliation to cash flow from operations for such periods. The Company's management believes this non-GAAP measure provides meaningful supplemental information as management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's ability to maintain capital assets, satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

The Company's management believe these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance as inclusion of such special items are not indicative of ongoing operating results and thereby affect the comparability of results between periods. The Company feels inclusion of these non-GAAP measures also provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of historic operating trends.
