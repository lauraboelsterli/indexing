    "text": "February 5, 2018 / 12:49 PM / Updated 33 minutes ago Ukraine court rejects Saakashvili extradition protection appeal - lawyer Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nKIEV (Reuters) - A Ukrainian appellate court on Monday rejected an appeal by opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili for protection against his possible extradition, news agency Interfax Ukraine quoted Saakashviliâ€™s lawyer as saying. \nThe former president of Georgia entered Ukraine last September despite being stripped of his Ukrainian citizenship in a protracted standoff with the Kiev authorities. He is wanted in Georgia on four charges including abuse of office, which he says are trumped up. \nSaakashvili had earlier applied to the Kiev district court to be given the status of a person in need of additional protection, which the court rejected.
