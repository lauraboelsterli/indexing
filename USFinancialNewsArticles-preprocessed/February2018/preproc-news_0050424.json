    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (“Sabra,” the “Company” or “we”) (Nasdaq:SBRA) (Nasdaq:SBRAP) today announced results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“2017 was a transformational year for Sabra. We opportunistically executed our strategy of growth and diversification while simultaneously improving the strength of our balance sheet. We’ve delivered on our promise of building a better REIT for our stakeholders, and we’re not done yet,” said Rick Matros, Sabra CEO and Chairman.\nRECENT HIGHLIGHTS (1)\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders, FFO, Normalized FFO, AFFO and Normalized AFFO per diluted common share were $0.57, $0.60, $0.66, $0.60 and $0.60, respectively, compared to $0.31, $0.62, $0.62, $0.59 and $0.54, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Normalized AFFO per diluted common share increased 11.1% over the same quarter in 2016 primarily as a result of the completion of the Care Capital Properties, Inc. (CCP) merger in the third quarter of 2017.\nWe completed our CCP portfolio repositioning evaluation and have reduced the expected long-term annual impact on rents from $33.5 million to between $28.2 million and $31.2 million, after adjusting for the anticipated redeployment of proceeds from strategic asset sales. As previously disclosed, one of the repositioning strategies is to sell certain facilities and redeploy the related proceeds in a manner that results in no significant long-term cash rent reduction. The sales of these facilities are estimated to generate proceeds totaling approximately $58.8 million and we expect to largely offset the $5.5 million of current annual cash rents derived from these facilities through the redeployment of the sales proceeds.\nAfter giving effect to the anticipated long-term impact on rents, our pro forma Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care EBITDAR Coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 would have been between 1.38x and 1.40x. This compares to our actual Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care EBITDAR Coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 of 1.36x, which includes the CCP tenants for the month of September only (the month following the CCP merger). Lease Coverage for the seven Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facility operators included in our pro forma top 10 relationships (which top 10 relationships represent 63.9% of our pro forma annualized Cash NOI) would have been 1.30x (1.32x excluding Genesis) after giving effect to the anticipated long-term impact on rents from the CCP portfolio repositioning and Genesis's recently announced restructuring plan.\nWe have fully completed the integration of the CCP portfolio and operations into our Company, ahead of the one year time frame we initially expected.\nOn January 2, 2018, we completed our previously announced transaction with affiliates of Enlivant and TPG Real Estate, the real estate platform of TPG, pursuant to which we acquired (i) a 49% equity interest in an entity that collectively owns 172 Senior Housing communities managed by Enlivant (the “Enlivant Joint Venture”) and (ii) 11 Senior Housing communities under the Senior Housing - Managed structure that are operated by Enlivant pursuant to property management agreements (the “Enlivant Owned Portfolio”). Our investment in the Enlivant Joint Venture and Enlivant Owned Portfolio totaled $491 million, including net working capital. Our purchase price for the Enlivant Owned Portfolio reflected an effective 2% discount to the price we would have paid had we waited to exercise our option on 51% of this portfolio. The joint venture agreement includes an option for us to acquire the remaining majority interest in the Enlivant Joint Venture which terminates on January 2, 2021. Our partner in the Enlivant Joint Venture has the option to transfer its interest commencing on January 2, 2020 subject to our right of first offer.\nWe have begun the process of marketing for sale 46 of our remaining 54 facilities leased to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. (“Genesis”). We expect to retain eight strong-performing facilities having annual cash rents of $10.4 million, which would keep our Genesis exposure below 2% of our pro forma annualized Cash NOI, before any residual rents, as described below. 35 of the 46 facilities are under contract, with expected total sales proceeds of $296.9 million. Those sales are expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2018. Annual cash rents expected to be eliminated upon sale total $25.6 million. These sales are expected to trigger residual rents to be paid to Sabra of $5.2 million per year for the following 4.28 years as provided for in our agreement with Genesis. The remaining 11 facilities, with $10.0 million of annual cash rents, are expected to be sold in 2018 generating sales proceeds of approximately $70.7 million.\nOn December 15, 2017, we exercised our options to acquire a 140 bed Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facility in Texas for $12.8 million (inclusive of $2.0 million used to repay a portion of our related loan receivable investment), having an initial cash yield of 9.5%, and a 95 unit Senior Housing community in Colorado for $20.7 million (inclusive of $4.9 million used to repay our preferred equity investment in this property), having an initial cash yield of 7.5%. The two accretive investments were sourced through our proprietary development pipeline.\nIn January 2018, we acquired the remaining two Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities that were part of the North American Healthcare portfolio transaction that we executed in the third quarter of 2017. The purchase price for these two facilities was $42.8 million, having an initial cash yield of 8.0%.\nWe have updated our 2018 earnings guidance ranges as follows (per diluted common share): Net income attributable to common stockholders - $2.16 to $2.24 (from $2.09 to $2.15), FFO - $2.31 to $2.39 (from $2.43 to $2.49), Normalized FFO - $2.48 to $2.56 (from $2.48 to $2.54), AFFO - $2.15 to $2.23 (from $2.30 to $2.36) and Normalized AFFO - $2.28 to $2.36 (from $2.33 to $2.39). Normalized FFO per diluted share guidance range is essentially unchanged, and the midpoint of the updated Normalized AFFO per diluted share guidance range decreased by 1.7%.\nOn February 5, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on February 28, 2018 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2018. This dividend represents a 75% payout based on our fourth quarter 2017 Normalized AFFO per share.\nOn February 5, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4453125 per share of Series A preferred stock. The dividend will be paid on February 28, 2018 to preferred stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2018.\nFurther commenting on the fourth quarter results, Rick Matros said, “The quarter reflects the execution of Sabra's strategies on all fronts. The CCP merger integration process is complete, and we have finalized our analysis on the CCP portfolio repositioning. Rather than hitting the high end of our previously disclosed potential reduction of annual rents of $33.5 million, we now expect the annual rent reduction from the portfolio repositioning to not exceed $31.2 million and the final amount could be as low as $28.2 million. With respect to our tenant coverages, our Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care portfolio, calculated on a pro forma basis to give effect to the CCP portfolio repositioning, had a healthy EBITDAR Coverage of 1.38x for 2017. During the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of 22 Genesis facilities and we have 76% of the remaining Genesis facilities that we intend to sell under contract. We also committed to reducing our skilled nursing exposure down to where it was prior to the CCP merger. After giving effect to all the transactions we have announced to date, including the sales of the 35 Genesis facilities under contract, our pro forma skilled nursing exposure drops from 74% to 63%, getting us within range of where we were in a relatively short period of time, albeit as a much stronger credit with investment grade ratings and broad tenant diversification. Also during the fourth quarter, we exercised our purchase options on two facilities in our proprietary development pipeline. Subsequent to year end, we closed the investment in the Enlivant Joint Venture and were able to acquire 11 facilities at lower than the agreed upon option price. For Sabra, this reflects the strengthening of the partnership the Company has with both Enlivant and TPG. We also closed on the acquisition of the final two North American facilities. I greatly appreciate the incredibly good and hard work done by my team over this last year and for the continuing support of the Sabra Board of Directors. ”\n(1) FFO, Normalized FFO, AFFO, Normalized AFFO, and annualized Cash NOI are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts.

Pro forma for the January 2018 investment in the Enlivant Joint Venture and acquisitions of the Enlivant Owned Portfolio and two additional North American Healthcare facilities, available liquidity is reduced by $533.8 million to $343.6 million.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND COMPANY INFORMATION\nA conference call with a simultaneous webcast to discuss the 2017 fourth quarter earnings will be held on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.

The weighted average annual cash yield of these future investments is estimated to be 8.2%.\n$28.2 million of long-term rent reductions related to the CCP portfolio repositioning as though such reductions were effective January 1, 2018 and short term rent loss of $5.5 million associated with the sales of certain assets generating estimated sales proceeds of $58.8 million. The lost rents associated with these asset sales are expected to be replaced during 2018 by the future investments described above.\nThe expected sales of the remaining 46 Genesis facilities, reducing total annual cash rents by $31.7 million and providing an estimated $367.6 million of gross proceeds.

A tenant, or one of its affiliates, that owns one or more ancillary businesses that depends on providing services to the residents of the properties leased by the affiliated operating company (Sabra's tenant) for a meaningful part of the ancillary business's profitability.\nCash Net Operating Income (“Cash NOI”).* The Company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. We consider Cash NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and our management to evaluate the operating performance of our investments. We define Cash NOI as total revenues less operating expenses and non-cash revenues. Cash NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income.\nEBITDAR. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (“EBITDAR”) for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company) for the period presented. EBITDAR includes an imputed management fee of 5.0% of revenues for Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities and Senior Housing - Leased communities and an imputed management fee of 2.5% of revenues for Specialty Hospitals and Other facilities. The Company uses EBITDAR in determining EBITDAR Coverage. EBITDAR has limitations as an analytical tool. EBITDAR does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition, EBITDAR does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. The Company utilizes EBITDAR as a supplemental measure of the ability of the Company's operators/tenants and relevant guarantors to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.\nEBITDAR Coverage. Represents the ratio of EBITDAR to recognized rent for owned facilities (excluding Senior Housing - Managed). EBITDAR Coverage is a supplemental measure of an operator/tenant’s ability to meet their cash rent and other obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR. EBITDAR Coverage includes only Stabilized Facilities and excludes significant tenants with meaningful credit enhancement through guarantees (which include Genesis, Holiday and three former CCP tenants), two Ancillary Supported Tenants and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.\nEBITDARM. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees (“EBITDARM”) for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company), for the period presented. The Company uses EBITDARM in determining EBITDARM Coverage. The usefulness of EBITDARM is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR. Together with EBITDAR, the Company utilizes EBITDARM to evaluate the core operations of the properties by eliminating management fees, which vary based on operator/tenant and its operating structure.\nEBITDARM Coverage. Represents the ratio of EBITDARM to recognized rent for owned facilities (excluding Senior Housing - Managed). EBITDARM Coverage is a supplemental measure of an operator/tenant’s ability to meet their cash rent and other obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDARM. EBITDARM Coverage includes only Stabilized Facilities and excludes significant tenants with meaningful credit enhancement through guarantees (which include Genesis, Holiday and three former CCP tenants), two Ancillary Supported Tenants and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.\nFixed Charge Coverage Ratio. EBITDAR (including adjustments for one-time and pro forma items) for the period indicated (one quarter in arrears) for all operations of any entities that guarantee the tenants' lease obligations to the Company divided by the same period cash rent expense, interest expense and mandatory principal payments for operations of any entity that guarantees the tenants' lease obligation to the Company. Fixed Charge Coverage is a supplemental measure of a guarantor's ability to meet the operator/tenant's cash rent and other obligations to the Company should the operator/tenant be unable to do so itself. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR. Fixed Charge Coverage is calculated by the Company as described above based on information provided by guarantors without independent verification by the Company and may differ from similar metrics calculated by the guarantors.\nFunds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“FFO”) and Adjusted Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“AFFO”). * The Company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company also believes that Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined in accordance with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), and Adjusted Funds from Operations, or AFFO (and related per share amounts) are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of the Company's operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income attributable to common stockholders, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, net of amounts related to noncontrolling interests, and real estate impairment charges. AFFO is defined as FFO excluding merger and acquisition costs, stock-based compensation expense, straight-line rental income adjustments, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles, net, non-cash interest income adjustments, non-cash interest expense, as well as other non-cash revenue and expense items (including non-cash portion of loss on extinguishment of debt, change in fair value of contingent consideration, provision for doubtful straight-line rental income, loan losses and other reserves, ineffectiveness gain/loss on derivative instruments, and non-cash revenue and expense amounts related to noncontrolling interests). The Company believes that the use of FFO and AFFO (and the related per share amounts), combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of the Company's operating results among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among real estate investment trusts more meaningful. The Company considers FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding the applicable items listed above, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company’s real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund the Company’s future cash requirements. Further, the Company’s computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define AFFO differently than the Company does.\nInvestment. Represents the carrying amount of real estate assets after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization and excludes net intangible assets and liabilities. Investment also includes the Company's pro rata share of the real estate assets held in the Company's unconsolidated joint venture.\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”).* The Company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. We consider NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and our management to evaluate the operating performance of our investments. We define NOI as total revenues less operating expenses. NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income.\nNormalized FFO and Normalized AFFO. Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO represent FFO and AFFO, respectively, adjusted for certain income and expense items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its ongoing operating results. The Company considers Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO to be useful measures to evaluate the Company’s operating results excluding these income and expense items to help investors compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other companies. Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating performance. Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company’s real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund the Company’s future cash requirements. Further, the Company’s computation of Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO may not be comparable to Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define FFO and AFFO or Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO differently than the Company does.\nSenior Housing. Senior Housing communities include independent living, assisted living, continuing care retirement and memory care communities.\nSenior Housing - Leased. Senior Housing - Leased communities consist of Senior Housing communities other than Senior Housing - Managed communities.\nSenior Housing - Managed. Senior Housing - Managed communities consist of Senior Housing communities operated by third-party property managers pursuant to property management agreements.\nSkilled Nursing/Transitional Care. Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities include skilled nursing, transitional care, multi-license designation and mental health facilities.\nSpecialty Hospitals and Other. Includes acute care, long-term acute care, rehabilitation and behavioral hospitals, facilities that provide residential services, which may include assistance with activities of daily living, and other facilities not classified as Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care or Senior Housing.\nStabilized Facility. At the time of acquisition, the Company classifies each facility as either stabilized or pre-stabilized. In addition, the Company may classify a facility as pre-stabilized after acquisition. Circumstances that could result in a facility being classified as pre-stabilized include newly completed developments, facilities undergoing major renovations or additions, facilities being repositioned or transitioned to new operators, and significant transitions within the tenants’ business model. Such facilities will be reclassified to stabilized upon maintaining consistent occupancy (85% for Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care Facilities and 90% for Senior Housing Communities) but in no event beyond 24 months after the date of classification as pre-stabilized. Stabilized Facilities exclude (i) Senior Housing - Managed communities, (ii) facilities held for sale, (iii) facilities being sold pursuant to the Company's CCP portfolio repositioning, (iv) facilities being transitioned from leased by the Company to being operated by the Company, and (v) facilities acquired during the three months preceding the period presented.\nTotal Debt. The principal balances of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans, senior unsecured notes, and secured indebtedness.\nTotal Debt, Net. The carrying amount of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans, senior unsecured notes, and secured indebtedness, as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
