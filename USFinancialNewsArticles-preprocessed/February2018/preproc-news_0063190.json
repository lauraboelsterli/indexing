    "text": "February 28, 2018 / 11:07 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Britain to provide update on Northern Ireland budget, politicians' pay Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Northern Ireland minister will make a statement next week on implementing a budget for the region and on politicians’ salaries, while it continues to explore whether agreement can be reached to restore the province’s power-sharing government. The province has for over a year been without a devolved executive that was central to a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of violence. Talks between the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Irish nationalists Sinn Fein to end that stalemate broke down again two weeks ago. “Next week I will make a statement on the budget and I will make a statement on decisions around MLA (Members of the Legislative Assembly) pay,” Northern Ireland minister Karen Bradley told a parliamentary committee.
