    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its pattern of recruiting top talent, Sklar Kirsh LLP has added Partner Peter R. Fischer to its Real Estate Practice Group and Associate Rachel Weise to its Entertainment & Media Practice Group.\n\"We are extremely excited to add Peter to our team,\" said firm Co-Chairman Andrew Kirsh . \"Like our other attorneys, he has an unparalleled institutional law firm background. Our clients will greatly benefit from his years of experience in all facets of real estate and corporate transactions.\"\nFischer, an experienced commercial real estate transactional attorney whose clients include developers, operators, syndicators, private equity providers, investors and lenders, said he's excited to reunite with several of his former large firm colleagues in a boutique environment.\n\"Jeff (Sklar) and Andrew (Kirsh) have built an incredible brand in the marketplace with strengths in both corporate and real estate and now entertainment and litigation,\" said Fischer, who previously worked at Latham & Watkins, Sheppard Mullin and most recently Enenstein, Pham & Glass, where he started the transactional practice.\n\"I chose Sklar Kirsh because it had all of the same capabilities of a much larger firm, but with a more entrepreneurial spirit and the ability to move more quickly and decisively which is important to my client base,\" Fischer added. \"The Sklar Kirsh Real Estate practice closed over $2 billion in transactions in 2017 and is a fantastic platform for my practice.\"\nFischer, a Venice resident who obtained his Bachelor of Arts from Union College and his J.D. from American University Washington College of Law, has an extensive background with both securities and real estate law. His fund formation and syndication experience coupled with his direct real estate experience in several asset classes – including multifamily, mobile home parks, self-storage and raw land – expand the experience and breadth of Sklar Kirsh's already dynamic and broad Real Estate Practice, also while deepening the securities and finance abilities of the Firm's Corporate Practice.\nIn addition to Fischer, Sklar Kirsh added Weise, formerly Director of Business Affairs at VMI Worldwide, to its Entertainment and Media Practice Group. At Sklar Kirsh, Weise joins other former entertainment industry General Counsels Hillel Elkins, Scott Ehrlich and Michael Rosner. \"Sklar Kirsh is an easy choice for entertainment companies who want their outside lawyers to have the expertise and insight of an in-house counsel,\" said Weise, an Arcadia resident who received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Cinematic Arts, Film & Television Production from the University of Southern California and her J.D. from Southwestern Law School. \"As former in-house attorneys, we see our work from our client's perspective.\"\nAbout Sklar Kirsh\nSklar Kirsh LLP is a Los Angeles boutique law firm that provides sophisticated and expert advice in the areas of corporate, real estate and entertainment law as well as commercial and entertainment litigation.
