    "text": "Feb 13 (Reuters) - Storm Burglind will cost the insured property market 643 million euros ($791.8 million), based on loss data collected from affected insurers after the event, Zurich-based catastrophe data provider PERILS estimates.\nThe winter storm caused significant damage across Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Britain between Jan. 2 and Jan. 3.\nPERILS said the insurance loss levels for the affected countries were not unusual, with the exception of Switzerland, where the impact was at a level PERILS would expect only once in about 13 years.\nThe initial loss estimate will be updated in April, PERILS added.\nInsurance broker Aon Benfeld said last month that rain and winds from storm Burglind caused an estimated 300 million euros in insured losses in Germany.\nThe storm follows weather catastrophes that led to insurers having to pay record claims of about $135 billion last year after a run of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America.
