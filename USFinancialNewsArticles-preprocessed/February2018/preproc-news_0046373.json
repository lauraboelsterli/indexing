    "text": "Acquisition to Form a New and Innovative Omnichannel Payments Platform for ISOs, ISVs, VARs, Payment Facilitators and their Merchants\nROSELLE, Ill.& BRISTOL, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NMI , a leading provider of payments enablement technology for independent sales organizations (ISOs), independent software vendors (ISVs), value-added resellers (VARs) and payment facilitators, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Creditcall , an omnichannel payment gateway and EMV solutions provider. With offices in Bristol, England, and New York, and customers throughout many regions of the world, Creditcall will give NMI a global presence and access to new markets. This acquisition will continue to differentiate NMI from traditional payment gateway providers by further expanding its omnichannel and EMV capabilities, creating a one-of-a-kind payment gateway platform supporting all channels of commerce including retail, e-commerce, mobile and unattended.\n“The payment technology requirements of today’s merchants are more complex than ever—they need to accept and process payments in all sales channels and environments,” said Roy Banks, chief executive officer of NMI. “The need for a single vendor and platform that seamlessly integrates and simplifies the complexities of card-present and card-not-present payments has never been greater, and the combination of NMI and Creditcall will finally deliver a true omnichannel solution.”\nThe addition of Creditcall’s support for EMV chip card, swipe and contactless payment terminals, and processor certifications to the NMI platform, will make NMI the ideal payment technology partner for ISOs, ISVs and VARs who need a complete and unified payment solution for merchants conducting business in an omnichannel environment . NMI and Creditcall partners will be able to obtain all card-present and card-not-present payment technology from a single vendor and platform for their merchants.\n“We are excited to join forces with NMI as our solutions are highly complementary and will create a unique payment technology company,” commented Lars Pedersen, chief executive officer of Creditcall. “By combining our EMV technology and card-present expertise with NMI’s market-leading card-not-present white-label payment gateway platform, we will become a one-stop shop for omnichannel solutions for our partners and customers.”\nThe acquisition of Creditcall reflects the ongoing growth investment and commitment of NMI’s investors Francisco Partners and Great Hill Partners .\nThe combined company will account for more than $45 billion of payment volume, and customers and partners will benefit from more than 165 processor integrations and 100-plus device certifications worldwide.\nAbout NMI\nNMI provides payments enablement technology that empowers ISOs, ISVs, VARs and payment facilitators to offer branded payment gateway services without building or maintaining their own technology. Our exceptional team of software engineers has created a security-focused, feature-rich, omnichannel payment gateway platform that partners can completely and transparently brand, removing NMI from their merchant customers’ view. Headquartered in Roselle, Illinois, NMI is the operating trade name of Network Merchants, LLC.
