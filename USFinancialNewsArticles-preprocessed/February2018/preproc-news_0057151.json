    "text": "The Oracle of Omaha says his $1 million-a-year March Madness contest for Berkshire Hathaway employees will pay double if one of his two Nebraska favorites wins.\nBillionaire investor Warren Buffett , a long-time basketball fan, offered employees $1 million a year for life to anyone who guessed which teams make it to the NCAA men's basketball tournament's \"Sweet 16.\" No one won last year's big jackpot.\nThis year, there's a twist. If the Creighton Bluejays or Nebraska Cornhuskers wins the tournament, the prize will double, Buffett said Monday in a wide-ranging interview with CNBC.\n\"So, instead of $1 million, it'll be $2 million,\" the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway told \" Squawk Box .\"\nThe NCAA will reveal on March 11 which 68 teams have made the cut for this year's basketball championships. The tournament starts two days later and concludes April 2.\nBuffett joined CNBC from Omaha, Nebraska. He spoke on a range of topics, including the new tax law.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
