    "text": "Justin Robinson scored a career-high 32 points and Virginia Tech overcame second-half foul trouble to defeat North Carolina State 85-75 on Wednesday night at Cassell Coliseum in Blacksburg, Va.\nRobinson, a junior guard, was averaging 12.8 points per game entering the contest. He made 11 of 17 shots from the field, though he was 8-for-14 on free throws.\nKerry Blackshear Jr. added 18 points, while Justin Bibbs had 11 points and Chris Clarke chipped in nine off the bench for Virginia Tech (17-7, 6-5 Atlantic Coast Conference).\nThe Hokies, who shot 63.5 percent from the field, next will travel Saturday to in-state rival Virginia, which appears in position to move to No. 1 in the country if it defeats Virginia Tech.\nOmer Yurtseven’s 20 points and Markell Johnson’s 15 points and 10 assists paced N.C. State (16-8, 6-5), which had won its two most recent road games.\nN.C. State was aiming to produce its first four-game ACC winning streak in 12 years.\nJohnson shot 3-for-6 on 3-pointers, but the rest of the Wolfpack was a combined 7-for-25.\nBlackshear picked up his fourth foul with 13:25 to play and he soon was joined by teammate Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Devin Wilson had four by the 6:50 mark.\nBut Robinson kept providing offense during that stretch, repelling a couple of Wolfpack rallies.\nBolstered by 3-point shooting, N.C. State was within 61-55 with just less than 11 minutes to play. Virginia Tech scored the next six.\nThe Hokies continued to push the ball inside and dominated the points in the lane.\nThe Hokies built a 41-26 first-half lead before settling for a 47-34 edge at the break. That reflected their most points in a half in ACC play this season.\nVirginia Tech shot 64.5 percent from the field in the opening half despite a 1-for-7 mark on 3-point attempts.\nThe Hokies broke away from a 15-15 tie in the only scheduled meeting between the teams this season.\nYurtseven had 10 points and three fouls in the first half.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
