    "text": "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck Papua New Guinea’s Southern Highlands province in the early hours of Monday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nThe tremor hit near the centre of the country’s main island, around 560 kilometres (348 miles) from the capital Port Moresby at around 0345 local time (1545 GMT).\nIts depth was around 35 kilometres (22 miles), USGS said.\nThere were no immediate reports of damage or casualties and the country’s disaster management authority did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no risk of a tsunami in the aftermath of the tremor.\n“Recent earthquakes in this area have caused secondary hazards such as tsunamis and landslides that might have contributed to losses,” the USGS said.\nQuakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.\nReporting by Andrea Ricci and Charlotte Greenfield; Editing by Daniel Wallis ansd David Evans\n ",
