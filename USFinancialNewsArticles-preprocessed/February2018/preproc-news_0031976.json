    "text": "Also Announces Extension of Supplier Contract and Fourth Quarter 2017 Teleconference\nVERNAL, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (NYSE American: SDPI) (“SDP” or the “Company”), a designer and manufacturer of drilling tool technologies, today announced preliminary unaudited revenue for 2017 of $15.6 million, exceeding its expected range of $15 million to $15.5 million that was raised for the second time in November 2017, and more than doubling 2016 revenue of $7.1 million. Preliminary revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 ended December 31, 2017, is expected to be approximately $3.7 million, an increase of more than 50% over the prior-year period. Preliminary results are subject to change pending review by the Company’s independent accountants.\n\"2017 was a year of successful execution. We grew rapidly as our flagship Drill-N-Ream ® (DnR) wellbore conditioning tool continued to demonstrate its value by gaining greater market penetration. We expanded our future opportunities for the DnR by establishing a market development agreement in the Middle East with a leading oil field services company. And, we believe we have validated the unique capabilities and durability of our Strider TM oscillation system technology for increasing drilling efficiencies,” commented Troy Meier, Chairman and CEO of Superior Drilling Products.\nOperating expenses, excluding a $587,500 bonus in lieu of stock, are expected to be approximately $14.7 to $14.8 million, implying an operating margin for the year that well exceeds the November 2017 guidance of 2% to 3%. The Meiers used the bonus to pay principle and interest on the Tronco note receivable reducing it to $7.4 million at the end of 2017.\nThe Company also announced that it has mutually agreed with a leading customer to extend its supply agreement as the parties negotiate new terms with the intent to broaden the relationship and not have any disruption in operations or production.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Teleconference and Webcast\nThe Company will release its complete fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results before the opening of financial markets on Thursday, March 8, 2018, and will host a conference call that same day.\nThursday, March 8, 2018\n9:00 a.m. Mountain Time/11:00 a.m. Eastern Time\nPhone: (201) 689-8470\nWebcast and accompanying slide presentation: www.sdpi.com\nA telephonic replay will be available from 12:00 p.m. MT (2:00 p.m. ET) the day of the teleconference until Thursday, March 15, 2018.
