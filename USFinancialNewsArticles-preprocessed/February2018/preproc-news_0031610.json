    "text": "Feb 15 (Reuters) - Australian real estate company McGrath Ltd posted an interim loss on Thursday on impairment charges on its sales segment assets.\nNet loss for the six months to Dec. 31 was A$25.5 million ($20.21 million),compared to a profit of A$2.7 million from a year ago, the company said in a statement.\nAustraliaâ€™s only listed realtor had issued a profit warning in November that sent its shares plunging, as higher taxes and other restrictions resulted in a sharp pullback in Chinese buying interest for new apartments.
