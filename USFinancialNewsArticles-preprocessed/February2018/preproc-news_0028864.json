    "text": "Feb 13 (Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd said on Tuesday it would seek to elect six members to the board of its acquisition target Qualcomm Inc instead of the 11 it earlier sought to elect.\nBroadcom also reiterated it would withdraw its merger proposal for Qualcomm if it did not win an ongoing proxy fight or otherwise have its offer accepted by the end of Qualcomm’s shareholder meeting on March 6.\nThe move comes a week after Broadcom made a $121 billion “best and final offer” to buy Qualcomm, which was later rejected.
