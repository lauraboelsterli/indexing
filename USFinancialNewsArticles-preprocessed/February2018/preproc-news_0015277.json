    "text": "PARSIPPANY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- B&G Foods, Inc. (NYSE:BGS) today explained the tax treatment for dividends paid in 2017 on the Company’s common stock. Holders are urged to check their 2017 tax statements received from brokerage firms in order to ensure that the cash distribution information reported on such statements conforms to the information reported herein.\nAdditional information concerning the tax treatment of dividends paid in 2017 is posted to the Investors section of B&G Foods’ website, www.bgfoods.com , under the heading “FAQs.” Holders are also urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine their individual tax treatment.\nIn 2017, B&G Foods distributed $1.8600 per share of common stock (CUSIP # 05508R 10 6). Based on U.S. federal income tax laws, B&G Foods has determined that of such distributions, approximately 30.456% (or $0.566472 per share) will be treated as a taxable dividend and approximately 69.544% (or $1.293528 per share) will be treated as a return of capital. Generally, the portion of the distribution on the common stock that is treated as a return of capital should reduce the tax basis in the shares of common stock up to a holder’s adjusted basis in the common stock, with any excess treated as capital gains.\nThe table below summarizes the tax treatment for dividends paid in 2017 on the Company’s common stock.\nDeclaration\nDate\nRecord\nDate\nPayment\nDate\nTotal Per Share\nDistribution\n2017 Taxable\nDividend\n2017 Return of\nCapital\n11/3/2016 12/30/2016 1/30/2017 $0.465 $0.141618 $0.323382 2/21/2017 3/31/2017 5/1/2017 $0.465 $0.141618 $0.323382 5/23/2017 6/30/2017 7/31/2017 $0.465 $0.141618 $0.323382 8/1/2017 9/29/2017 10/30/2017 $0.465 $0.141618 $0.323382 2017 Totals $1.8600 $0.566472 $1.293528 About B&G Foods, Inc.\nBased in Parsippany, New Jersey, B&G Foods and its subsidiaries manufacture, sell and distribute high-quality, branded shelf-stable and frozen foods across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.
