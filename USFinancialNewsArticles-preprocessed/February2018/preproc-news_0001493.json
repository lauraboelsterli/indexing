    "text": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s government has appointed Yang Chin-long, deputy governor of the island’s central bank, as its next governor, a government official said on Thursday.\nYang will replace Perng Fai-nan at the helm when the 79-year-old financial veteran retires this month. The news confirmed a source-based Reuters report on Saturday that Yang would take on the position.\nPerng, the central bank’s governor for 20 years, will become a central bank adviser when his term expires, the sources told Reuters.\nYang was born in 1953. The 64-year-old holds a doctorate degree from the Institute of Economic Research at the University of Birmingham.\nBefore becoming the central bank’s vice governor, Yang was director of the bank’s London representative office.\nReporting by Jeanny Kao in TAIPEI; Writing by Lee Chyen Yee; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Sam Holmes\n ",
