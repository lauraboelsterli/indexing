    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla.,\nSBA Communications Corporation (Nasdaq:SBAC) (\"SBA\" or the \"Company\") today reported results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights of the fourth quarter include:\nNet income of $7.7 million or $0.06 per share AFFO per share growth of 9% over the year earlier period Added 1,165 sites to our portfolio during the quarter Repurchased 1.9 million shares during the fourth quarter\n“We ended the year with solid results and strong momentum as we move into 2018,” commented Jeffrey A. Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer. “In 2017 we saw steady activity across all our markets and we executed well, with results exceeding our plan and initial guidance. We stayed fully invested, allocating capital in substantial amounts to both portfolio growth and stock repurchases. We met our portfolio growth goals, growing the portfolio by 6.5% in 2017. We have moved into 2018 with solid momentum and the opportunity to build on the momentum we have. For the first time in years, all four major U.S. wireless carriers are active and anticipated to remain active through 2018. FirstNet activity is growing and has begun to produce revenue. Our international markets are also performing well, and we view the judicial approval of the Oi reorganization in Brazil as a major positive. We are off to a fast start in terms of portfolio growth, and expect to again achieve our portfolio growth goals of 5% to 10% in 2018. We anticipate staying fully invested to our target net debt leverage range of 7.0x to 7.5x annualized adjusted EBITDA, and to do so through a mix of portfolio growth and stock repurchases. We are optimistic that the anticipated improved organic leasing activity and continued opportunistic capital allocation will keep us on track to achieving our goal of $10 or more of AFFO per share in 2020.”\nOperating Results\nThe table below details select financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and comparisons to the prior year period.\n% Change Q4 2017 Q4 2016 $ Change % Change excluding FX (1) Consolidated ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Site leasing revenue $ 414.1 $ 393.6 $ 20.5 5.2 % 4.9 % Site development revenue 29.0 22.9 6.1 26.6 % 26.6 % Tower cash flow (1) 327.0 308.4 18.6 6.0 % 5.8 % Net income 7.7 5.3 2.4 45.3 % 431.2 % Earnings per share - diluted 0.06 0.04 0.02 50.0 % 475.0 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) 310.1 287.0 23.1 8.0 % 7.8 % AFFO (1) 211.8 201.3 10.5 5.2 % 4.9 % AFFO per share (1) 1.78 1.63 0.15 9.2 % 9.2 % (1) Non-GAAP metrics, please see the reconciliations and other disclosures under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this press release.\nTotal revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $443.1 million compared to $416.5 million in the year earlier period, an increase of 6.4%.

These securities are expected to have an anticipated repayment date of March 9, 2023 and a final maturity date of March 9, 2048. The fixed interest rate on the 2018-1C Tower Securities will be 3.448% per annum, payable monthly, and the proceeds of this offering, in combination with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be used to repay the entire aggregate principal amount of the 2013-1C Tower Securities ($425.0 million) and 2013-1D Tower Securities ($330.0 million), as well as accrued and unpaid interest.\nOutlook\nThe Company is providing its full year 2018 Outlook for anticipated results. The Outlook provided is based on a number of assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable at the time of this press release. Information regarding potential risks that could cause the actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is set forth below and in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Company’s full year 2018 Outlook assumes the acquisitions of only those communication sites under contract at the time of this press release. The Company may spend additional capital in 2018 on acquiring revenue producing assets not yet identified or under contract, or on stock repurchases, the impact of which is not reflected in the 2018 guidance. The Outlook does not contemplate any new financings or any additional repurchases of the Company’s stock during 2018 other than those financings and repurchases completed as of the date of this press release.\nThe Company’s Outlook assumes an average foreign currency exchange rate of 3.33 Brazilian Reais to 1.0 U.S. Dollar and 1.25 Canadian Dollars to 1.0 U.S. Dollar for the full year 2018 Outlook, including an assumption of 3.25 BRL to 1.0 USD during the first quarter of 2018.\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Full Year 2018 Site leasing revenue (1) $ 1,730.0 to $ 1,750.0 Site development revenue $ 100.0 to $ 120.0 Total revenues $ 1,830.0 to $ 1,870.0 Tower Cash Flow (2) $ 1,357.0 to $ 1,377.0 Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 1,279.0 to $ 1,299.0 Net cash interest expense (3) $ 346.0 to $ 356.0 Non-discretionary cash capital expenditures (4) $ 34.0 to $ 44.0 AFFO (2) $ 861.0 to $ 908.0 AFFO per share (2) (5) $ 7.27 to $ 7.67 Discretionary cash capital expenditures (6) $ 530.0 to $ 550.0 (1) The Company’s Outlook for site leasing revenue includes revenue associated with pass through reimbursable expenses.\n(2) See the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure presented below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n(3) Net cash interest expense is defined as interest expense less interest income. Net cash interest expense does not include amortization of deferred financing fees or non-cash interest expense.\n(4) Consists of tower maintenance and general corporate capital expenditures. Includes $3.5 million of estimated capital expenditures associated with hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\n(5) Outlook for AFFO per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s outlook for AFFO by an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of 118.4 million. Our Outlook does not include the impact of any repurchases of the Company’s stock during 2018.\n(6) Consists of new tower builds, tower augmentations, communication site acquisitions and ground lease purchases. Does not include expenditures for acquisitions of revenue producing assets not under contract at the date of this press release.\nConference Call Information\nSBA Communications Corporation will host a conference call on Monday, February 26, 2018 at 5:00 PM (ET) to discuss the quarterly results.

Furthermore, the Company’s 2018 outlook assumes that the Company’s business is currently operated in a manner that complies with the REIT rules and that the Company is able to qualify and to remain qualified as a REIT and the timing of such qualification. These forward-looking statements may be affected by the risks and uncertainties in the Company’s business. This information is qualified in its entirety by cautionary statements and risk factor disclosures contained in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission on March 1, 2017.\nThe Company wishes to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect the Company’s actual results and could cause the Company’s actual results for subsequent periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of the Company. With respect to the Company’s expectations regarding all of these statements, including its financial and operational guidance, such risk factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase their capital expenditures; (2) the Company’s ability to identify and acquire sites at prices and upon terms that will allow the portfolio growth to be accretive; (3) the Company’s ability to accurately identify any risks associated with its acquired sites, to effectively integrate such sites into its business and to achieve the anticipated financial results; (4) the Company’s ability to secure and retain as many site leasing tenants as planned at anticipated lease rates; (5) the impact of continued consolidation among wireless service providers on the Company’s leasing revenue; (6) the Company’s ability to successfully manage the risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates; (7) the Company’s ability to secure and deliver anticipated services business at contemplated margins; (8) the Company’s ability to maintain expenses and cash capital expenditures at appropriate levels for its business while seeking to attain its investment goals; (9) the Company’s ability to acquire land underneath towers on terms that are accretive; (10) the Company’s ability to realize economies of scale from its tower portfolio; (11) the economic climate for the wireless communications industry in general and the wireless communications infrastructure providers in particular in the United States, Brazil, and internationally; (12) the continued dependence on towers and outsourced site development services by the wireless carriers; (13) the Company’s ability to protect its rights to land under its towers; (14) the Company’s ability to obtain future financing at commercially reasonable rates or at all; and (15) the Company’s ability to qualify for treatment as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and to comply with and conduct its business in accordance with such rules. With respect to the Company’s plan for new builds, these factors also include zoning and regulatory approvals, weather, availability of labor and supplies and other factors beyond the Company’s control that could affect the Company’s ability to build additional towers in 2018. With respect to its expectations regarding the ability to close pending acquisitions, these factors also include satisfactorily completing due diligence, the amount and quality of due diligence that the Company is able to complete prior to closing of any acquisition and its ability to accurately anticipate the future performance of the acquired towers, the ability to receive required regulatory approval, the ability and willingness of each party to fulfill their respective closing conditions and their contractual obligations and the availability of cash on hand or borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund the consideration. With respect to repurchases under the Company’s stock repurchase program, the amount of shares repurchased, if any, and the timing of such repurchases will depend on, among other things, the trading price of the Company’s common stock, which may be positively or negatively impacted by the repurchase program, market and business conditions, the availability of stock, the Company’s financial performance or determinations following the date of this announcement in order to use the Company’s funds for other purposes.\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures.

(64,922 ) (64,913 ) (25,535 ) (21,693 ) (24,073 ) (19,661 ) Segment operating profit $ 268,617 $ 257,772 $ 55,010 $ 49,231 $ 4,916 $ 3,235 Segment operating profit margin 80.5 % 79.9 % 68.3 % 69.4 % 17.0 % 14.1 % Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe press release contains non-GAAP financial measures including (i) Cash Site Leasing Revenue; (ii) Tower Cash Flow and Tower Cash Flow Margin; (iii) Adjusted EBITDA, Annualized Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin; (iv) Net Debt, Net Secured Debt, Leverage Ratio, and Secured Leverage Ratio (collectively, our “Non-GAAP Debt Measures”); (v) Funds from Operations (“FFO”), Adjusted Funds from Operations (“AFFO”), and AFFO per share; and (vi) certain financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (collectively, our “Constant Currency Measures”).\nWe have included these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they provide investors additional tools in understanding our financial performance and condition. Specifically, we believe that:\n(1) Cash Site Leasing Revenue and Tower Cash Flow are useful indicators of the performance of our site leasing operations;\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance;\n(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude the impact of our (1) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is consistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;\n(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and leverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the extent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash, and short-term investments; and\n(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the calculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and indentures relating to our 2014 Senior Notes, 2016 Senior Notes, and 2017 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance sheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the following financial metrics by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period. The table below provides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of the following measures to the growth rate after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to such measure: (1) total site leasing revenue, total cash site leasing revenue, and International cash site leasing revenue, (2) total site leasing segment operating profit and International site leasing segment operating profit, (3) total Tower Cash Flow and International Tower Cash Flow, (4) Net income, (5) diluted earnings per share, (6) Adjusted EBITDA, and (7) AFFO and AFFO per share.\nGrowth Fourth quarter excluding 2017 year Foreign foreign over year currency currency growth rate impact impact Total site leasing revenue 5.2 % 0.3 % 4.9 % Total cash site leasing
