    "text": "The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 666 points on Friday. \nInvestors are concerned the Federal Reserve may reduce its monetary stimulus and increase interest rates more aggressively as the economy continues to strengthen. \nUsing Kensho, a hedge fund analytics tool, CNBC looked at what happens after the Dow drops 500 points or more in one day during the past 25 years. \nThe Dow has declined 500 points or more in one day 17 times since 1993. The findings show benchmark market indexes tend to rally the following trading session after such declines. \nThe Dow rose 1.5 percent on average the following day in the instances with a 65 percent chance of recovery. \nCNBC also looked at the results one week after a big drop and the odds of a rebound increase. \nOn average, the Dow rallied 2.8 percent in the following week after the decline day, according to Kensho. It was positive more than 70 percent of the time. \nCNBC also looked which stocks in the Dow outperformed in the week after the market decline day. Over the last 25 years, these were the stocks that investors tended to gravitate too. \nThe screen showed technology stocks did well. Apple and Cisco were the top performers during the following week with gains of more than 5 percent on average. \nPlease note past performance does not always equal future returns and if interest rates continue to shoot higher, this sell-off could buck historical trends and keep going. \nDisclosure: NBCUniversal, parent of CNBC, is a minority investor in Kensho.",
