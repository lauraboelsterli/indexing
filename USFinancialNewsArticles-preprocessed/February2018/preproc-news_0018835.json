Half of the net withdrawals during the quarter were attributable to one client. Year-over-year AUM increased by $239 million due to positive net investment performance of $596 million, partially offset by net withdrawals of $357 million.\nBase Management Fees for the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased year-over-year to $27.7 million from $26.6 million as the increase in Average AUM for the quarter to $9.1 billion from $8.6 billion for the same quarter last year was partially offset by a decrease in the average Base Management Fee Percentage to 1.20% from 1.22% for the same period last year.\nPerformance Fees for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were $28.4 million, compared to $37.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal expenses decreased by $1.0 million from the year ago quarter. Compensation expense decreased by $2.0 million due primarily to a decrease in accrued bonuses of $2.3 million as a result of lower performance fees. General and Administrative expense increased by $1.0 million due to a $1.7 million increase in the Founders related obligations to reflect the final arbitration settlement amount, and increases in research and technology spending, partially offset by a decrease of $1.8 million in professional fees associated with the arbitration.\nNet income was $19.1 million and represented earnings per share, basic and diluted, of $0.63 and $0.61, respectively for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Net income was $24.0 million and represented earnings per share, basic and diluted, of $0.80 and $0.78, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nBase EBITDA eliminates the effect of Performance Fees, Performance Fee related expenses, post-retirement obligations, stock option expense and amortization of RSU awards, and deducts the dollar value of the base bonus RSUs to be awarded in respect of the current period and special RSUs awarded in the period. Base EBITDA was $11.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $10.8 million in the year ago quarter due primarily to higher Base Management Fees.\n“I am pleased with our strong finish to the calendar year and confident about the team we have in place to continue to deliver strong risk-adjusted returns for our clients,” commented Jeff Moody, President & Chief Executive Officer. “We are excited to welcome two new talented portfolio managers, Alkarim Jiwa and Leanne Caravaggio, to our investment team and we look forward to their insights and contributions. We are also pleased to have resolution on the final amount in regards to the Founders’ Arbitration.”\nGluskin Sheff + Associates Inc. is one of Canada’s pre-eminent wealth management firms, serving high net worth private clients, estates, trusts and institutional investors.
