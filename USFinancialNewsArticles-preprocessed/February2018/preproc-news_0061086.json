Robert Henry and Jane Reusch to its Scientific Advisory Board.\nDr. Henry is a leader in diabetes research. As a past President of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and recipient of its Banting Medal for Scientific Achievement, among other international recognitions, his basic and clinical research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has resulted in more than 400 journal articles, chapters and books. He is currently Chief of the Section of Endocrinology, Metabolism & Diabetes, Veterans Affairs Healthcare System in San Diego, California, Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego and Chief of the Center for Metabolic Research in San Diego, California. In addition to studying the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of human skeletal muscle and adipose tissue signaling and interactions, his current clinical research interests involve the study and development of new therapies for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and obesity.\nDr. Reusch is a distinguished academic physician-scientist-diabetologist committed to understanding and treating the vascular complications of diabetes. She is currently Professor of Medicine and Associate Director, Center for Women's Health, at the University of Colorado at Denver and Director of the Diabetes Care Team at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center in Denver, Colorado. Dr. Reusch has been awarded numerous NIH RO1 and VA Merit grants for both basic and clinical research, leading to more than 100 peer-reviewed publications on diabetes and diabetic vascular complications. In a continuation of her life-long service to the diabetes community, Dr. Reusch is the current ADA President for Medicine and Science.\n\"We are honored and extremely fortunate to welcome Drs. Henry and Reusch to our Scientific Advisory Board. Their combined knowledge of diabetes and clinical development will be invaluable as our oral ORMD-0801 program accelerates towards our vision of making oral insulin available to patients battling diabetes and their physicians,\" said Nadav Kidron, CEO of Oramed.\nAbout Oramed Pharmaceuticals\nOramed Pharmaceuticals is a technology pioneer in the field of oral delivery solutions for drugs currently delivered via injection. Established in 2006, Oramed's Protein Oral Delivery (POD TM ) technology is based on over 30 years of research by top scientists at Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center. Oramed is seeking to revolutionize the treatment of diabetes through its proprietary flagship product, an orally ingestible insulin capsule ( ORMD-0801 ).

For example, we are using forward-looking statements when we discuss the timing of expected clinical development programs and clinical trials and FDA submissions or revolutionizing the treatment of diabetes with our products. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Oramed only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties related to the progress, timing, cost, and results of clinical trials and product development programs; difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approval or patent protection for our product candidates; competition from other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies; and our ability to obtain additional funding required to conduct our research, development and commercialization activities. In addition, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: changes in technology and market requirements; delays or obstacles in launching our clinical trials; changes in legislation; inability to timely develop and introduce new technologies, products and applications; lack of validation of our technology as we progress further and lack of acceptance of our methods by the scientific community; inability to retain or attract key employees whose knowledge is essential to the development of our products; unforeseen scientific difficulties that may develop with our process; greater cost of final product than anticipated; loss of market share and pressure on pricing resulting from competition; laboratory results that do not translate to equally good results in real settings; our patents may not be sufficient; and final that products may harm recipients, all of which could cause the actual results or performance of Oramed to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise required by law, Oramed undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
