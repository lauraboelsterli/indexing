    "text": "IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Endologix, Inc. (NASDAQ: ELGX), a developer and marketer of innovative treatments for aortic disorders, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\n“While our top-line performance during the fourth quarter finished at the low end of our guidance, we were pleased to have achieved expanded gross margins and to have further lowered our operating expenses,” said John McDermott, Chief Executive Officer of Endologix, Inc. “Subsequent to the quarter end, we completed patient enrollment in the ELEVATE IDE clinical study. We plan to file regulatory submissions in the third quarter of 2018 and currently anticipate potential approval of the Alto device in both the U.S. and European markets in 2019. The Alto device incorporates several design enhancements that are intended to simplify the procedure and enable the system to treat a wider range of AAA anatomies than Ovation iX. We also welcomed Greg Morrow as our Chief Marketing Officer, and we believe that under his leadership our team will be able to further strengthen our brand value proposition and maximize the impact of our innovative new product pipeline. Looking forward, we are confident that we have sufficient resources to drive innovation and position the Company for future growth in its addressable markets.”\nFinancial Results\nGlobal revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $44.0 million, a 7.3% decrease from $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, global revenue was $181.2 million, a 6.1% decrease from $192.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nU.S. revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $29.5 million, a 12.2% decrease from U.S. revenue of $33.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. U.S. revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $123.2 million, a 9.5% decrease from U.S. revenue of $136.1 million a year ago.\nInternational revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $14.5 million, a 4.8% increase from international revenue of $13.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter 2017 international revenue increased 0.8%. International revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $58.0 million, a 2.0% increase from international revenue of $56.8 million a year ago. On a constant currency basis, fiscal year 2017 international revenue increased 1.2%.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $31.4 million, which represents a gross margin of 71.3%. This compares to a gross profit of $29.5 million, or a gross margin of 62.1%, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross profit was $121.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a gross margin of 67.0%. This compares to a gross profit of $123.8 million, or a gross margin of 64.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Excluding these items, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 were lower by $10.3 million, or 20.8%, driven by synergy savings resulting from the TriVascular merger and ongoing cost management initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total selling, general and administrative expenses were 14.2% lower as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $14.5 million, or $(0.17) per share, compared to a net loss of $24.9 million, or $(0.30) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.

The Company's focus is endovascular stent grafts for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). AAA is a weakening of the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in the body, resulting in a balloon-like enlargement. Once an AAA develops, it continues to enlarge and, if left untreated, becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture. The overall patient mortality rate for ruptured AAA is approximately 80%, making it a leading cause of death in the U.S. For more information, visit www.endologix.com .\nThe Nellix ® EndoVascular Aneurysm Sealing System has obtained CE Mark in the EU and is only approved as an investigational device only in the United States. The Ovation Alto ® System is an investigational device, not currently approved in any market, and its safety and effectiveness have not been established.\nCautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nExcept for historical information contained herein, this press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private 1995.

Endologix's management uses these financial measures for strategic decision making, forecasting future financial results, and evaluating current period financial and operating performance.

(vii) restructuring and other transition costs; (viii) fair value adjustment of derivative liabilities; and (ix) inventory step-up amortization; and (x) loss on extinguishment of debt.\nIn the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, this GAAP adjustment to net loss specifically represents: (i) the fair value adjustment to Nellix contingent consideration liability; (ii) interest expense; (iii) foreign currency (gains) or losses; (iv) restructuring and other transition costs; and (v) loss on extinguishment of debt.\nIn the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, this GAAP adjustment to net loss specifically represents: (i) the fair value adjustment to the Nellix contingent consideration liability;
