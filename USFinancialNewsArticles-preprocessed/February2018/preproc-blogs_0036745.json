    "text": "Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., sat down to talk with CNBC's John Harwood about an array of issues. Here's what the retiring conservative lawmaker, and frequent critic of President Donald Trump , said about immigration.\nJOHN HARWOOD: The president has laid out conditions that include reductions in legal immigration, that I think go against what you think makes sense.\nSEN. JEFF FLAKE: Yeah.\nHARWOOD: Cutting legal immigration is directly harmful to the U.S. economy, is that not the case?\nFLAKE: Yes. I think somebody wrote — Fred Hiatt, in The Washington Post — you can be pro-growth and anti-immigration, you just can't be both. And that's very true. We're going to need increased immigration. So that's why I can't vote for the Grassley bill.\nHARWOOD: Whatever happens on DACA, do you believe that this Congress will pass reductions in legal immigration?\nFLAKE: No, I don't. You know, anything that does that would have to pass 60 votes in the Senate. And there aren't those 60 votes. I don't think there's a majority of Republicans who would go for that. In fact, I know there's not.",
