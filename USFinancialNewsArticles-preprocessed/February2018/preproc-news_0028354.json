    "text": "0 COMMENTS Happy Valentine’s Day! Today is especially lovely if you’re a retailer: U.S. consumers are expected to spend an average of $143.56 on Valentine’s Day, up from last year’s average of $136.57, according an annual survey released by the National Retail Federation . Lovebirds between the ages of 25 and 34 will be spending the most to woo their valentines, with an average of $202.76, which makes me seem like a cheapskate by comparison. Oh, well. There’s still time to send Valentine’s chicken wings or a lovey-dovey Facebook message .\nWill They or Won’t They? AT&T Inc. is starting to lay out its strategy for one of the biggest antitrust cases to go to court in a generation. To defend its proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. against the Justice Department’s suit to block the deal, AT&T is making some unusual moves to undermine the government’s case . The companies’ draft list of people it wants to call to the witness stand includes the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, a Trump nominee who made the decision to file the suit, The Wall Street Journal reports. AT&T has been publicly questioning the department’s motives, particularly given President Trump’s relentless criticism of Time Warner’s CNN. According to the New York Times, AT&T has requested communications between the White House and Justice Department officials . The outcome of the case will weigh on consolidation across the media and telecom industries. Comcast is said to be keeping an eye on the trial as it considers whether to revive its failed bid for significant parts of 21st Century Fox, which instead struck a deal with Walt Disney Co.\nMergers and Admonitions Turner CEO John Martin didn’t hold anything back at Recode’s Code Media conference on Tuesday. He expressed confidence that the Justice Department is going to lose its bid to block AT&T’s acquisition of Turner’s parent company Time Warner. “The government is clueless ,” he said, according to Recode. “As a person who’s actually going through the process and has been in depositions, the theory of the case just makes absolutely no sense.” Mr. Martin also took a swipe at satellite TV provider DirecTV, which happens to be part of AT&T, Time Warner’s potential future owner. “ I have DirecTV…It’s not that good ,” he said. Mr. Martin took to the stage as the Turner networks are cutting jobs, including about 30 employees in ad sales , according to AdAge.\n— no90?—\nAlso making an appearance in Huntington Beach, Calif., Oath CEO Tim Armstrong told conference attendees that go90 is being folded into Oath , casting doubt on the future of Verizon’s two-year-old mobile video service, according to Variety. Go90’s content will be distributed across the company’s platforms like HuffPost, Yahoo Sports and Yahoo Finance. It’s unclear if that fully spells the end of go90. “The brand will remain. I don’t know how long for,” Mr. Armstrong said.\nI Want to Be a Thousandaire So Freakin’ Bad They will probably never be featured on the magazine’s cover, but each of Forbes’ 1,500 freelance contributors will be put on a contract that guarantees them at least $250 a month beginning today . This is an about-face for Forbes, which has been using a combination of paid and unpaid contributors to boost its digital traffic for years. About 60% of Forbes’ contributors were unpaid before today’s change, and the company said it will be reviewing its roster and cutting the bottom 10% of performers each year. It isn’t just Forbes that’s spreading the wealth around: Earlier this year, HuffPost announced that it was cutting its unpaid contributor platform in favor of two sections for paid freelancers who will work with HuffPost editors. Focusing on quality content is probably a smart bet so long as Facebook continues to emphasize “time well spent” on its news feed.\nOlympics Ratings Fail to Score Gold Skiers aren’t the only thing headed downhill during this year’s Winter Olympics. So far, prime-time ratings for NBC’s coverage of the Pyeongchang Games are down 6% compared with the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, the network said Tuesday. But it sounds like company had managed marketers’ expectations ahead of time. NBC is still meeting its guarantees to advertisers, so it won’t have to give away valuable commercial time for free to make up for any shortfall, Bloomberg reports . Now that reserve inventory can be sold. NBC says it had anticipated the dip in traditional TV ratings. After all, the TV business has gone through the wringer in the past four years, with the rise of cord-cutting and streaming competition. That’s why NBC is focused on measuring its audience across all platforms and times of day, a total audience measurement that network executives expect will eclipse viewership from 2014.\nBest of the Rest A former employee of Vice Media is suing the company, alleging that it discriminates against female employees by intentionally paying them less. [ Los Angeles Times ]\nNetflix has signed a five-year, $300 million deal with producer Ryan Murphy. 21st Century Fox had bid aggressively to keep Mr. Murphy, who had previously said he was shaken by the news of Fox’s deal with Disney. [ WSJ ]\nThe Washington Post’s head of innovation, Jarrod Dicker, is becoming CEO of Po.et, a media startup that uses blockchain and cryptocurrency. [ Axios ]\nAd giant Publicis Groupe has landed the Mercedes-Benz account. [ The Drum ]\nNBCUniversal is supporting the Association of National Advertisers’ #SeeHer movement, which aims to end inaccurate portrayals of women in advertising. During the Olympics, NBC Sports will air prime-time coverage celebrating female American athletes, and the segments will be supported by AT&T, Verizon, USAA and P&G. [ Broadcasting & Cable ]\nShares of Sky PLC rose above the bid from 21st Century Fox for the first time, putting pressure on Fox to up its bid for the British pay-TV giant.
