    "text": "CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) said on Wednesday that President Jacob Zuma’s “unreasonable, irrational and reckless” behaviour was a threat to state security and a danger to society.\nThe ANC made the comments about Zuma in amendments to a no-confidence vote tabled by an opposition party and due to be heard on Thursday.\nZuma said earlier on Wednesday that the ANC, which has called for him to step down, had not told him what he had done wrong.
