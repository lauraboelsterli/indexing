Yong, Trio-Tech's CEO, said, \"Building on our solid first quarter performance, Trio-Tech delivered strong financial results once again in the second quarter. Operating earnings surged, as gross margins improved and expenses as a percentage of sales decreased.\n\"Growth in our semiconductor testing and semiconductor equipment manufacturing segments continued to be the primary drivers of these gains, and we see exciting opportunities for further growth in these businesses. The automotive industry is a particularly attractive opportunity for us. We are pleased by the progress we have made so far this fiscal year.\"\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Results\nFor the fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2017, revenue increased 16% to $10,552,000 compared to revenue of $9,104,000 for the same quarter last year.
