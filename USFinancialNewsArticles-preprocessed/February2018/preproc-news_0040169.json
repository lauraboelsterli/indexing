    "text": "DENVER, Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TTEC Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEC) a global customer experience company that designs, builds and operates captivating omnichannel customer experiences on behalf of the world's most prestigious and innovative brands recently unveiled its new brand identity. Architected through a partnership with the company's in-house agency and Seattle based design firm, AVO, the new brand blends high tech sophistication with the personality of the human touch to reinforce TTEC's mission of bringing humanity to the customer experience.\nSee how the TTEC brand comes to life here: http://www.ttec.com/welcome\n\"The choice of TTEC for our global name was easy. It has been our ticker symbol for over 20 years and many of our clients and employees refer to us as TTEC in shorthand,\" explained Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, Kyle Priest. \"We had two chief branding strategies. First, to better reflect our digital consulting and technology solutions through TTEC Digital and our process and operational excellence through TTEC Engage. Second was to affirm our leadership position as a true end-to-end provider of transformational customer engagement solutions that combine talent plus technology to define, deliver and operate world-class omnichannel customer experiences on behalf of world-class brands. Our entire brand can be summarized, now, in our icon, showcasing a smiling face subtly wed with the typography to reflect our mission: to bring humanity to every customer interaction, human or digital.\"\nOur new name, TTEC, is our nickname as it has been for years. The internal brand team is leveraging the humanity in the design and nickname-as-a-new-name to reinforce our mission and values. Externally, the name TTEC effectively demonstrates our differentiation in our market space as the leader of talent+technology (as evidenced by our leading CSAT scores and our first-mover status on many innovations over the years and currently). TTEC is infusing meaning into the nickname as follows: the first 't' stands for talent, the second 't' stands for technology, the 'e' represents engaging and 'c' closes it out for customers. TTEC â€“ Talent and Technology Engaging Customers.\"\nPriest continued, \"We did encounter some complexity as we thought through how to roll the name out across the globe. We wanted to update our name to reflect the omnichannel nature of our work but we also had to maintain our strong regional brand equity in the Philippines where we hire, train and employ over 20,000 employees in the Philippines every year, making us one of the largest employers in our space in that region. We created a dual branding strategy that utilizes TTEC globally, and retains TeleTech in the Philippines, using the same typography, and crucially, the distinctive \"smiley t\" icon to unify the two logo marks.\"\nAbout TTEC (pronounced T-tec):\nTTEC (NASDAQ: TTEC) is a global customer experience company that designs, builds and operates captivating omnichannel customer experiences on behalf of the world's most innovative brands.
