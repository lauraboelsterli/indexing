    "text": "CARMEL, Ind.,\nFull year 2017 record net income of $54.7 million, and $20.3 million for the fourth quarter Full year 2017 earnings per common share reached $2.28, and $0.73 for the fourth quarter Total assets at December 31, 2017 grew by $676.7 million, or 25% compared to 2016 Return on average assets of 1.84% for twelve months ended December 31, 2017 Record multi-family mortgage closings of $1.7 billion for full year 2017 Successfully completed initial public offering, raising $115 million in new capital\nMerchants Bancorp (the \"Company\" or \"Merchants\") (Nasdaq: MBIN), parent company of Merchants Bank of Indiana, today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $20.3 million, or $0.73 per common share. This compared with $8.8 million, or $0.38 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 results included a one-time $6.9 million tax benefit associated with changes to the Company's deferred tax liability, under the recent federal income tax reform legislation.\nThe Company also reported net income of $54.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This represented a $21.6 million, or 65% increase, compared with $33.1 million in the comparable period of 2016. Earnings per common share of $2.28 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased by 55%, compared with $1.47 in the comparable period of 2016.\nEach of the Company's business segments' net income increased in 2017, compared with 2016. Multi-family Mortgage Banking income increased by 205%, Mortgage Warehousing increased by 8%, and Banking increased by 20%.\n\"2017 was another record year for Merchants Bancorp. We achieved record assets, loans, deposits, and net income, while maintaining well capitalized capital ratios that were increased by the proceeds of our initial public offering,\" said Michael Petrie, Chairman and CEO of Merchants. \"We look forward to building on our success during 2018, which will be enhanced with the continued integration of RICHMAC Funding, and a more favorable tax environment. The additional equity from the IPO and the benefit of a lower tax rate will provide us with the capital needed to support additional growth in all of our segments.\"\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets increased $676.7 million, or 25%, to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2017, compared with $2.7 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to increases in loans, loans held for sale, and available for sale securities. Return on average assets was 1.84% for the full year 2017, compared with 1.24% in 2016.\nTotal loans receivable before allowance for loan losses increased $432.9 million, or 46%, to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017, compared with $941.8 million at December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to growth in multi-family and healthcare financing, as well as commercial and commercial real estate loans.\nAsset Quality\nThe allowance for loan losses increased by $2.1 million, to $8.3 million, reflecting higher loans for investment, compared with December 31, 2016, while non-performing loans 90 days or more past due were $3.1 million, or 0.23% of total loans.\nTotal Deposits\nTotal deposits increased $514.9 million, or 21%, to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017, compared with $2.4 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to growth in certificates of deposit and demand deposits during the year.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased $6.2 million, or 30%, to $26.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $20.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This increase was due to both growth in loans and an increase in loan yields. The average balance of loans, including loans held for sale, during the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased by $217.3 million, or 11%, to $2.1 billion, compared with $1.9 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The average yield on loans also increased 63 basis points, to 4.34%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with 3.71% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net interest margin increased to 2.43% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with 2.11% for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Expense\nTotal interest expense increased $2.4 million, or 44%, to $8.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense on deposits increased $2.1 million, or 58%, to $5.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a 30 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, to 1.13%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with 0.83% for the same period in 2016, and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of $276.9 million, or 16%, to $2.0 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The increase in deposits was primarily due to growth in savings account deposits, as well as custodial accounts of existing warehouse customers. The increase in the cost of deposits was due to the overall increase in interest rates since last year.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income increased by $8.0 million, or 115%, to $14.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.9 million in loan servicing fees and an increase of $2.3 million in gain on sale of loans. The increase in loan servicing fees was positively impacted by a $3.7 million fair market value adjustment in mortgage servicing rights. The 30% increase in gain on sale of loans was due primarily to an increase in the volume of multi-family loan sales in the secondary market.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased $3.4 million, or 46%, to $10.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $7.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to a $2.8 million, or 66%, increase in salaries and employee benefits. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was due primarily to an increase in the number of employees that reflected organic growth, the RICHMAC acquisition, and additional hiring associated with becoming a publicly traded company. Despite the increase in salaries and benefits, the efficiency ratio declined by 150 basis points, to 31.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAbout Merchants Bancorp\nMerchants Bancorp is a diversified bank holding company headquartered in Carmel, Indiana operating multiple lines of business with a focus on Federal Housing Administration (\"FHA\") multi-family housing and healthcare facility financing and servicing, mortgage warehouse financing, retail and correspondent residential mortgage banking, agricultural lending and traditional community banking.

see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\"\n(1) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however, they do have a number of limitations. As such, the reader should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is below. Net Income Available to Common Shareholders excludes preferred stock. Tangible common equity is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets and preferred stock from the calculation of total assets. Tangible Assets is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and intangible assets.
