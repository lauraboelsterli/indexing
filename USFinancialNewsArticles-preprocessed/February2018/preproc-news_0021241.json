    "text": "Continued Connected-Home Opportunities and Operational Focus Drive Financial Results\nSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ: CTRL), a leading global provider of smart-home and networking solutions, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $68.3 million, compared to revenue of $57.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing quarterly year-over-year growth of 19%. Total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 grew 17% year-over-year, from $208.8 million to $244.7 million (including $12.6 million from the sale of Triad Speaker products which we acquired in February 2017).\nNet Income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.1 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to Net Income in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $4.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $16.0 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to Net Income of $13.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-GAAP Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.1 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to Non-GAAP Net Income in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $7.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. Non-GAAP Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $32.1 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to Non-GAAP Net Income of $20.6 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information is contained in the attached tables.\nUnrestricted cash and net investments increased to $86.0 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $71.7 million as of September 30, 2017 and $61.9 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase reflects free cash flow generation of $11.1 million and $5.7 million received from stock options exercised during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“We closed 2017 with momentum reflected in our strong fourth quarter performance, as we have remained focused on operational improvements and new opportunities designed to increase customer and dealer satisfaction,” said Martin Plaehn, chairman and chief executive officer of Control4. “We continue to execute on our strategies, which include enhancing our award-winning connected home solutions, strengthening our dealer presence around the globe, delivering tools and services to enhance dealer productivity and improve the homeowner experience, and expanding our partner and interoperability ecosystem —all of which contribute to a strengthening of the Control4 family of brands.”\nCommenting on the company’s financial results, Mark Novakovich, chief financial officer of Control4, added: “We delivered record results for 2017, including revenue and net income. Fueled by consistently improving cross-company performance, our full-year 2017 Non-GAAP Net Income grew by 56%, year over year, reflecting the operating leverage improvements we made throughout the year and delivering on our commitment to achieve sustainable, profitable growth to enhance long-term shareholder value.”\nShare Buy-Back Program\nOn February 6, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the expansion of our share buy-back program enabling the repurchase of up to $20 million in Control4 stock from time to time in the open market during our open trading windows between now and the end of May 2019.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law and among other things reduces the corporate income tax rate to 21%, creates a territorial tax system (with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings), requires companies to pay minimum taxes on foreign earnings in excess of specified rates of return, and subjects certain payments from US corporations to foreign related parties to additional taxes.\nThe reduction in the corporate income tax rate requires a one-time revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company’s net deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance is expected to decrease by approximately $9.0 million. As the deferred tax asset is fully allowed for, this change in the income tax rate will have no impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The Act will result in a lower domestic income tax rate from which Control4 will benefit in the future once the Company fully utilizes its net operating loss and other accumulated tax credits. In addition, the Company will be subject to the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings. However, due to the valuation allowance and the availability of current and accumulated net operating losses and foreign tax credits, the book tax charge for this one-time mandatory tax is anticipated to be minimal and the cash impact from a Federal perspective will be zero. While the preceding adjustments are the Company’s best estimate of the impact of the tax reform as the date of this press release, Control4 will continue to evaluate the impact of the tax reform in 2018, and as allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, will update management’s estimates as additional information or clarification of the act becomes available.\nImplementation of New Revenue Recognition Guidelines\nOn January 1, 2018, Control4 adopted ASC 606, “Accounting for Contracts with Customers” using the full retrospective method, which means that in future filings the Company will restate each prior reporting period presented. Adoption of ASC 606 did not have a significant impact on Control4’s financial statements.\nQ1 and 2018 Guidance\nControl4 expects revenue in the first quarter of 2018, which is the seasonally low quarter each year, to be between $56.5 million and $58.5 million. Control4 expects non-GAAP Net Income for the first quarter of 2018 to be between $3.5 million and $4.5 million, and based on an expected 27.9 million weighted average shares outstanding (diluted), to be between $0.12 and $0.16 per diluted share. Control4 expects revenue for the full year 2018 to be between $270 million and $274 million. Control4 expects Non-GAAP Net Income to be between $33.5 million and $35.5 million, and based on an expected 28.3 million weighted average shares outstanding (diluted), to be between $1.19 and $1.26 per diluted share.\nControl4 does not provide forward guidance on GAAP Net Income because certain non-GAAP adjustments are inherently difficult to forecast, whereas others relate to the amortization or expensing of items tied to historical events. The following table highlights our estimates of non-GAAP stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets reflected in our non-GAAP net income guidance for the first quarter of 2018:\nExpense ($ mm) 1Q 2018 Stock-based compensation expense 3.1 Amortization of intangible assets 1.3 Total 4.4 Additional Financial and Operational Metrics\nRevenue ($ mm) 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 4Q 2016 North America Core Revenue 51.9 48.7 44.3 International Core Revenue 14.7 14.0 11.9 Other Revenue 1 1.7 2.0 1.2 Total Revenue 68.3 64.7 57.4 1 Primarily consists of Hospitality Revenue\n4Q 2017 3Q 2017 4Q 2016 Dealer Adds 2 North America 75 69 96 International 57 61 47 Total Dealer Adds 132 130 143 Active Dealers 2, 3 North America 3,057 3,019 2,913 International 1,169 1,148 1,050 Total Active Dealers 4,226 4,167 3,963 Total Dealers 2 North America 3,174 3,139 2,994 International 1,315 1,283 1,147 Total Dealers 4,489 4,422 4,141 Controller Shipments 30,083 26,814 29,332 2 These dealer figures only include dealers authorized to sell and install the full Control4 line of products and exclude approximately 1,070 active dealers that are currently authorized to sell only the Pakedge and or Triad brand of products.\n3 We define an active, authorized dealer (“active dealer”) as one that has placed an order with us in the trailing 12-month period.\nConference Call\nOn February 8, 2018, Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ: CTRL) will host an investor conference call and will webcast the event beginning at 3:00 p.m. Mountain Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date they were first issued, and were based on the then-current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections, as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond Control4’s control. Control4’s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, risks detailed in Control4’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as subsequent reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. The forward-looking statements included in this press release represent Control4’s views as of the date of this press release. The company anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its views to change. Control4 has no intention and undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Control4’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nControl4’s stated results include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP gross margin percentage, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating income percentage, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, certain tax items, amortization of intangible assets, and acquisition-related costs. We further exclude expenses related to executive severance and litigation settlements from non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income.\nManagement believes that it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expense because the amount of such expense in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of the business operations.\nThe company has recently completed acquisitions that resulted in operating expenses that would not have otherwise been incurred. Management has provided supplementary non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude acquisition-related expense items, to allow more accurate comparisons of the financial results to historical operations, forward-looking guidance and the financial results of less acquisitive peer companies. Management considers these types of costs and adjustments, to a great extent, to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of the company’s control. Furthermore, the company does not consider these acquisition-related costs and adjustments to be related to the organic continuing operations of the acquired businesses and are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired assets. In addition, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of future acquisitions. By excluding acquisition-related costs and adjustments from the non-GAAP measures, management is better able to evaluate the ability to utilize its existing assets and estimate the long-term value that acquired assets will generate. The company believes that providing a supplemental non-GAAP measure which excludes these items allows management and investors to consider the ongoing operations of the business both with, and without, such expenses.\nThese acquisition-related costs are included in the following categories: (i) professional service fees, recorded in operating expenses, which include third-party costs related to the acquisition, and legal and other professional service fees associated with diligence, entity formation and corporate structuring, disputes and regulatory matters related to acquired entities; (ii) transition and integration costs, recorded in operating expenses, which include retention payments, transitional employee costs, earn-out payments treated as compensation expense, as well as the costs of integration-related services provided by third parties; and (iii) acquisition-related adjustments which include adjustments to acquisition-related items such as being required to record acquired inventory at its fair value, resulting in a step-up in the inventory value, and having to reverse part of our valuation allowance in order to offset the deferred tax liability that was recorded based on differences between the book and tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The step-up in inventory is recorded through cost of goods sold when the inventory is sold, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin. Although these expenses are not recurring with respect to past acquisitions, the company will generally incur these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions.\nThe company excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP measures. These amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions. Providing a supplemental measure which excludes these charges allows management and investors to evaluate results “as-if” the acquired intangible assets had been developed internally rather than acquired. Although the company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.\nFurthermore, we believe it is useful to exclude expenses related to litigation settlements and executive severance because of the variable and unpredictable nature of these expenses which are not indicative of past or future operating performance. We believe that past and future periods are more comparable if we exclude those expenses.\nOur non-GAAP results also exclude the one-time financial impact of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “Tax Act”) as well as adjustments to deferred tax assets resulting from a non-cash write-off on an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets. This is consistent with our practice of excluding large, one-time items in non-GAAP results.\nManagement believes these adjustments provide useful comparative information to investors. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only for understanding the operating results. The non-GAAP results should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Management urges investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the business.\nCONTROL4 CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share data)\nDecember 31, December 31, 2017 2016 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $
