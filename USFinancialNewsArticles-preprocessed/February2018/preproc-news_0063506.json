    "text": "JERUSALEM--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) (“Teva”) announced today that its special purpose finance subsidiary, (i) Teva Pharmaceutical Finance Netherlands II B.V. (“Teva Finance II”) intends to offer €1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of EUR-denominated Senior Notes in one or more series (the “Euro Notes”) and (ii) Teva Pharmaceutical Finance Netherlands III B.V. (“Teva Finance III” and, together with Teva Finance II, the “Issuers”) intends to offer $2,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of USD-denominated Senior Notes in one or more series (the “USD Notes” and, together with the Euro Notes, the “Notes”) in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), in each case subject to market and other conditions. The Issuers and Teva expect to enter into a registration rights agreement with respect to the Notes. Teva expects to use the net proceeds from the offerings to repay approximately $2.3 billion outstanding indebtedness under its U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen term loan agreements and, together with cash on hand, to repay all $1.5 billion outstanding indebtedness under its 1.40% Senior Notes due 2018, with the remainder of the net proceeds, if any, to be used to pay related fees and expenses and/or otherwise for general corporate purposes. In connection with completion of the offerings, Teva expects to give notice of its intention to redeem all of its 1.40% Senior Notes due 2018.\nThe Notes will be unsecured senior obligations of the Issuers and will be unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by Teva. The Notes will be offered and sold (i) in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (ii) to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the U.S. pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes and the related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act or the laws of any state and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. or to, or for the benefit of, any U.S. persons absent registration under or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nAbout Teva\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) is a leading global pharmaceutical company that delivers high-quality, patient-centric healthcare solutions used by millions of patients every day.

Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include risks relating to our substantially increased indebtedness and significantly decreased cash on hand, which may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in additional transactions or make new investments, and may result in a further downgrade of our credit ratings; our inability to raise debt or borrow funds in amounts or on terms that are favorable to us; and other factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, including in the section captioned “Risk Factors,” and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available at www.sec.gov . Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or other information contained herein, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that the transactions described herein will be consummated or as to the ultimate terms of any such transactions.\nIt may be unlawful to distribute this press release in certain jurisdictions. This press release is not for distribution in Canada, Japan or Australia. The information in this press release does not constitute an offer of securities for sale in Canada, Japan or Australia.\nThe Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (\"MiFID II\"); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (\"IMD\"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the \"PRIIPs Regulation\") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This announcement constitutes a public disclosure of inside information by Teva under Regulation (EU) 596/2014 (16 April 2014).\nPromotion of the Notes in the United Kingdom is restricted by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”), and accordingly, the Notes are not being promoted to the general public in the United Kingdom. This announcement is for distribution only to, and is only directed at, persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.) of the Financial Promotion Order or (iii) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The Notes will only be available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such Notes will be engaged in only with, relevant persons. This announcement is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by anyone who is not a relevant person.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228005823/en/\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited\nIR Contacts:\nUnited States\nKevin C.
