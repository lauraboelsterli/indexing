    "text": "Published: Feb 11, 2018 4:43 p.m. ET Share \nBacow was formerly president at Tufts, chancellor at MIT Getty Images Lawrence Bacow is introduced as Harvard University's 29th president Sunday in Cambridge, Mass. \nBy Melissa Korn \nHarvard University on Sunday named as its new president Lawrence S. Bacow, a former president at Tufts University and previous chancellor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \nBacow takes the top spot at one of the world’s most prestigious universities at a time when traditional higher education is under fire from some corners as too politically liberal and not practical enough for today’s needs. Schools like Harvard, historically intellectual playgrounds for the elite, also have been under pressure to diversify. \nBacow will take the helm in July from Drew Gilpin Faust, who held the top spot at Harvard for 11 years and announced in June her intention to step down this summer. \nBacow, currently the Hauser Leader-in-Residence at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government’s Center for Public Leadership, spent 10 years as president of Tufts and another 24 as an environmental-science professor, faculty chair and chancellor at MIT. From 2011 to 2014, he was President-in-Residence in the Higher Education Program at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education.",
