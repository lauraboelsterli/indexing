    "text": "Team USA athletes have been finalized for the 2018 Winter Olympics taking place in Pyeongchang, South Korea this month.\nTo become an Olympian, you must be strong both physically and mentally. So who better to ask about what it takes to meet and surpass your goals?\nHere's what five members of Team USA told CNBC Make It about meeting and exceeding your expectations:\nIgnore the naysayers Matthew Stockman | Getty Images Aaron Blunck on December 15, 2017 in Breckenridge, Colorado. There will always be people who doubt your abilities, says free-skier Aaron Blunck , 21. Ignore them and keep trudging forward, he tells CNBC Make It .\n\"Don't let someone try and bring you down,\" says Blunk, who in 2014 represented Team USA in the first Olympic ski halfpipe event. \"Whether it's another competitor or someone that you work with or even just a friend.\"\nFocus on yourself and on what you want to achieve he adds. \"Hard work and dedication pays off.\"\nAnd when someone does try and bring you down? Just brush it off.\n\"Go out there and be yourself. Be you,\" Blunk advises. \"Don't let someone crush you and bring you down.\"\nDo what makes you happy Tom Pennington | Getty Images Morgan Schild during the 2018 FIS Freestyle Ski World Cup at Deer Valley Resort on January 10, 2018 in Park City, Utah. It becomes much easier to exceed your goals when you're doing something that genuinely makes you happy, says skier Morgan Schild .\nOnce that's established, she says, \"it takes hard work, dedication and focus\" to actually achieve your goal.\nSchild, who has taken home three top-10 World Cup finishes, says that after a recent injury, her main goal was to recover in time for the Winter Olympics.\n\"In order for me to get there, I had to put in the time at the gym. I had to go to the workouts. I had to go to the [personal trainer].\"\nThe 20-year-old adds that there was also a mental component in pushing her body past its limits, noting that she went through pain and emotions.\nHowever, she says, \"that dedication and hard work that I had to do, that is what got me to this point.\"\nBe confident in your abilities Alexander Hassenstein | Getty Images Bob pilot Steven Holcomb of USA celebrates with his teammate Carlos Valdes after the 2nd run of the 2-man Bobsleigh BMW IBSF World Cup at Deutsche Post Eisarena Koenigssee on January 28, 2017 in Koenigssee, Germany. It's all about your mindset, says 28-year-old bobsledder Carlo Valdes . \"You always have to go in there confident.\"\nHowever, he adds, you can't approach winning thinking that you've already earned it and that it's owed to you.\n\"Prove yourself day in and day out,\" says Valdes. \"You can't feel entitled to anything.\"\nThe bobsledder also warns against being complacent. \"Work hard, keep your head down and always control what you can control,\" he says. \"If you focus on those things, you'll be very successful.\"\nHold yourself accountable Alain Grosclaude / Agence Zoom | Getty Images Mikaela Shiffrin of USA in action during the Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup Women's Slalom on January 28, 2018 in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. Ski racer Mikaela Shiffrin, 22, says that you must hold yourself accountable to meet your goals. That starts by actively speaking it into existence.\n\"If you have a dream and you're passionate about it then there's no reason why you shouldn't do it,\" says the Olympic gold medalist, who has been dubbed the best slalom skier in the world.\nWhat stops most people from achieving success, she says, is being scared of those dreams and ambitions.\n\"People are afraid to say what their ambitions are. They're afraid to say that they want to do something amazing,\" says Shiffrin. \"They don't want to tell it to other people. They don't want to say it to their self.\"\nBut it's important that you do so, she says, because by simply uttering what you want in life it forces you to hold yourself accountable to that dream. However, it doesn't stop there.\n\"You have to focus on [that dream] and you have to put in the work,\" the ski racer explains.\"And it doesn't mean you can't have fun but a lot of the fun is just learning how to enjoy the process of getting there.\"\nFocus on the smaller goals Matthew Stockman | Getty Images Gus Kenworthy trains for the Men's Ski Slopestyle final during the Toyota U.S. Grand Prix on January 14, 2018 in Snowmass, Colorado. Your end goal will seem less daunting if you focus on accomplishing smaller goals along the way, according to freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy , 26.\n\"Stay focused, stay on track,\" he says, \"but also [don't] focus too much on the end goal.\"\nKenworthy secured two silver medals at the 2014 Sochi Olympics and was recently named to Forbes 30 under 30 . The Olympian tells CNBC Make It that too often we get \"hung up\" thinking about the future and that final goal.\nEven if your final goal is as lofty as the Olympics, he says, there are so many smaller goals along the way and those need to be the things that you focus on each time.\nGive priority to the next hurdle or the next issue at hand and then slowly make your way to your final destination, says the skier. \"It's definitely a trek and not a sprint.\"\nVideo produced by Luqman Adeniyi\nLike this story?
