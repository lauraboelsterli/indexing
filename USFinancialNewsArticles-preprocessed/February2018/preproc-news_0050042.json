    "text": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Overview\nFourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017 compared with Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2016\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 totaled $528.2 million compared with $532.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Organic sales growth was 3%. As previously disclosed, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 included an extra week of operations which accounted for $32.2 million in additional sales and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 included sales of $12.0 million from the Coleman Aerospace (“Coleman”) acquisition. Organic sales exclude the additional week of sales and the acquisition of Coleman. Net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $(52.0) million, or $(0.71) loss per share, compared with net income of $18.1 million, or $0.25 diluted income per share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that will affect future periods. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduced the federal corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. As a result of this rate reduction, the Company reduced its net deferred tax assets by $64.6 million. Before applying the effects of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate was 48.7%. This rate differs from the 35% statutory tax rate due to state income taxes, revisions of prior year balances based upon tax filings and adjustments to uncertain tax positions. The Company expects its tax rate in future years to be between 27% and 29%. Excluding the Tax Act adjustment of $64.6 million, net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 would have been $12.6 million, or $0.16 diluted income per share (Non-GAAP). Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $58.4 million compared with $68.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Segment performance before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items (Non-GAAP measure*) was $51.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with $63.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 totaled $186.9 million, compared with $109.5 fiscal 2016. Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure*) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 totaled $168.0 million, compared with $92.4 fiscal 2016. Funded contract backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $2.1 billion compared with $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2016. Total contract backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $4.6 billion compared with $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2016.\nFiscal 2017 compared with Fiscal 2016\nNet sales for fiscal 2017 totaled $1,877.2 million compared with $1,761.3 million for fiscal 2016.\nOrganic sales growth was 6%. As previously disclosed, fiscal 2016 included an extra week of operations which accounted for $32.2 million in additional sales and fiscal 2017 included sales of $41.8 million from the Coleman acquisition. Organic sales exclude the additional week of sales and the acquisition of Coleman.\nNet loss for fiscal 2017 was $(9.2) million, or $(0.13) loss per share, compared with net income of $18.0 million, or $0.27 diluted income per share, for fiscal 2016. Excluding the Tax Act adjustment, fiscal 2017 net income would have been $55.4 million, or $0.74 diluted income per share (Non-GAAP).\nAdjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure*) for fiscal 2017 was $225.4 million compared with $201.9 million for fiscal 2016.\nSegment performance before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items (Non-GAAP measure*) was $205.4 million for fiscal 2017 compared with $188.4 million for fiscal 2016.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 totaled $212.8 million, compared with $158.7 million in fiscal 2016.\nFree cash flow (Non-GAAP measure*) in fiscal 2017 totaled $183.4 million, compared with $111.1 million in fiscal 2016.\n* The Company provides Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included at the end of the release.\n“Our fourth quarter and full year financial performance was strong, and we achieved key milestones surrounding the execution of our operational improvement plan,” said Eileen Drake, CEO and president of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. “We expanded our strong legacy propulsion positions on key franchise programs such as the Standard Missile, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (“PAC-3”), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (“THAAD”) and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (“GMLRS”) missile propulsion systems and secured positions to provide propulsion system support to both prime contractors selected to compete in the next phase of the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (“GBSD”) program. These achievements, coupled with awards in our space portfolio, increased our year-end total contract backlog position to $4.6 billion, providing revenue visibility several years into the future,” said Drake.\n“The strength in our NASA programs continued its rapid pace through the fourth quarter of 2017 and mitigated the impacts of timing-related declines in certain missile defense programs,” said Drake. Adjusting for the additional week of operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the Coleman Aerospace acquisition that closed in the first quarter of 2017, organic sales growth was 3% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Drake added, “This sales growth coupled with much improved cost management and risk reduction programs across several key programs in our space and defense portfolio drove profitability growth throughout the enterprise for 2017.” Adjusted EBITDAP margins grew by 50 basis points to 12.0% in 2017. Adjusted EBITDAP was up $23.5 million, or 12%, to $225.4 million. Net loss for 2017 was ($9.2) million. Excluding the 2017 tax legislation change, net income for 2017 would have been $55.4 million, up 208%. “Free cash flow was also strong. Continued strong execution, coupled with early receipts from customers, again allowed us to deliver on our commitment to convert profits to cash, generating free cash flow of $183.4 million, an increase of 65% over an already strong free cash flow year in 2016. I’m especially pleased that our management team achieved these impressive financial results while also carrying out our facility optimization and product transition plans on schedule with no significant issues and staying on track to achieve our 2021 cost reduction goals.”\nConcluded Drake, “We enter 2018 with a strong balance sheet and are well positioned financially to expand production capacity and take advantage of longer-term growth demands in the areas of commercial and military launches, deep space exploration, missile defense, tactical and strategic missiles and hypersonics.”\nOperations Review\nAerospace and Defense Segment\nThree months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentage amounts) Net sales $ 526.6 $ 529.6 $ 1,870.8 $ 1,753.9 Segment performance 40.3 54.6 177.9 143.3 Segment margin 7.7 % 10.3 % 9.5 % 8.2 % Segment margin before environmental remediation\nprovision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual\nitems (Non-GAAP measure) 9.7 % 11.7 % 10.8 % 10.5 % Components of segment performance: Aerospace and Defense $ 51.3 $ 61.8 $ 202.9 $ 184.1 Environmental remediation provision adjustments (5.9 ) (1.5 ) (7.5 ) (18.3 ) Retirement benefits, net (1) (5.1 ) (5.7 ) (19.5 ) (22.5 ) Unusual items — — 2.0 — Aerospace and Defense total $ 40.3 $ 54.6 $ 177.9 $ 143.3\n(1) Retirement benefits are net of cash funding to the Company’s tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan which are recoverable costs under the Company’s U.S. government contracts. The Company’s recoverable tax-qualified pension costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $8.2 million and $33.7 million, respectively. The Company’s recoverable tax-qualified pension costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $6.8 million and $27.5 million, respectively.\nNet sales were relatively unchanged for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 included an additional week of operations which accounted for $32.2 million in additional net sales (see discussion below).\nThe increase in net sales in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase of $158.0 million in space programs primarily driven by the following (i) the RS-25 program development and integration effort in support of the Space Launch Systems development program; (ii) increased development effort and volume on the Commercial Crew Development program; and (iii) increased deliveries on the Atlas V program. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $36.5 million in defense programs primarily driven by the timing of deliveries on THAAD and Standard Missile programs partially offset by the net sales generated from the Coleman Aerospace acquisition. Further, as a result of the 2016 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 53 weeks of operations in fiscal 2016 compared with 52 weeks of operations in fiscal 2017. The additional week of operations, which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and accounted for $32.2 million in additional net sales, is included in the above discussion of program changes.\nThe decrease in the segment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net and unusual items in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of favorable contract performance on the RS-68 program due to reduced program risks in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as well as changes in the program mix that resulted in lower margins in the current period.\nSegment margin before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefits, net, and unusual items in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was up 30 basis points. Items that had a significant impact were favorable contract performance on numerous programs as a result of overhead cost reductions and reduced program risks, most notably on the THAAD program, partially offset by cost growth and manufacturing inefficiencies in fiscal 2017 on electric propulsion contracts.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s backlog:\nAs of December 31, 2017 2016 (In billions) Funded backlog $ 2.1 $ 2.3 Unfunded backlog 2.5 2.2 Total contract backlog $ 4.6 $ 4.5 Total contract backlog expected to be filled within one year $ 1.7 $ 1.7 Total backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated). Indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog. Backlog is subject to funding delays or program restructurings/cancellations which are beyond the Company’s control.\nReal Estate Segment\nThree months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions) Net sales $ 1.6 $ 2.6 $ 6.4 $ 7.4 Segment performance 0.4 1.8 2.5 4.3 During fiscal 2017 and 2016, net sales and segment performance consisted primarily of rental property operations.\nAdditional Information\nRetirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company’s tax-qualified pension plans’ assets were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2017 2016 (In millions) Tax-qualified pension plan assets $ 931.2 $ 925.1 As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s unfunded pension obligation for the tax-qualified pension plan was $492.8 million. The changes in the pension obligation for the tax-qualified pension plan since December 31, 2016 were as follows (in millions):\nBalance as of December 31, 2016 $ 548.2 Service and interest costs 71.8 Investment gain (1) (96.8 ) Company contributions (76.0 ) Discount rate decrease (2) 57.4 Mortality rate (12.7 ) Other 0.9 Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 492.8\n(1) The Company’s effective rate of return on plan assets was 10.8% during fiscal 2017.\n(2) The decrease in the discount rate was due to lower market interest rates used to determine the Company’s pension obligation. The discount rate was 3.59% as of December 31, 2017 compared with 4.02% as of December 31, 2016.\nThe Company estimates that its retirement benefits expense will be approximately $60 million in fiscal 2018.\nThe Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately $42.0 million to its tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2018. The Company is generally able to recover these contributions related to its tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on its U.S. government contracts, but there is a lag between when the Company contributes cash to its tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and recovers the cash under the U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards. During fiscal 2017, the Company made cash contributions of $75.8 million to its tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan of which $33.7 million was recoverable from the Company’s U.S. government contracts in fiscal 2017 with the remaining $42.1 million expected to be recoverable from the Company’s U.S. government contracts in the future.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release may contain certain “ ” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The Company’s recoverable tax-qualified pension costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $8.2 million and $33.7 million, respectively. The Company’s recoverable tax-qualified pension costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $6.8 million and $27.5 million, respectively. The Company evaluates its operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment performance. Segment performance represents net sales less applicable costs, expenses and unusual items relating to the segment operations. Segment performance excludes corporate income and expenses, unusual items not related to the segment operations, interest expense, interest income, and income taxes. The Company believes that segment performance provides information useful to investors in understanding its underlying operational performance. Specifically, the Company believes the exclusion of the items listed above permits an evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations. It is on this basis that management internally assesses the financial performance of its segments.\nAerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.

The Company uses this metric to measure its operating performance. The Company believes that to effectively compare core operating performance from period to period, the metric should exclude items relating to retirement benefits, significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on the earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, the Company defines Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP net (loss) income adjusted by income tax provision, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefits, and unusual items which the Company does not believe are reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary activities. Adjusted EBITDAP does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net (loss) income as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThree months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentage amounts) Net (loss) income $ (52.0 ) $ 18.1 $ (9.2 ) $ 18.0 Income tax provision 74.9 16.3 96.1 11.2 Interest expense 8.0 5.1 30.9 32.5 Interest income (1.2 ) (0.2 ) (3.5 ) (0.6 ) Depreciation and amortization 18.6 19.0 72.6 64.9 Retirement benefits, net (1) 10.1 10.4 39.5 41.4 Unusual items — — (1.0 ) 34.5 Adjusted EBITDAP $ 58.4 $ 68.7 $ 225.4 $ 201.9 Adjusted EBITDAP as a percentage of net sales 11.1 % 12.9 % 12.0 % 11.5 % Net (loss) income as a percentage of net sales (9.8 )% 3.4 % (0.5 )% 1.0 %\n__",
