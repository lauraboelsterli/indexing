DAUs increased 28.8 million or 18% year-over-year. Revenue was $285.7 million in Q4 2017, up 72% year-over-year and 37% sequentially, driven by auction traction and seasonality. Full year revenue was $824.9 million, up 104% year-over-year. Average revenue per user (ARPU) (2) was $1.53 in Q4 2017, up 46% year-over-year and 31% sequentially.

Adjusted EBITDA loss was $(158.9) million in Q4 2017, an increase of 4% year-over-year and an improvement of 11% sequentially. Full year Adjusted EBITDA was $(720.1) million and was $(459.2) million in 2016. Cash and marketable securities were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Cash management reduced Q4 2017 cash burn to $255 million, down 49% sequentially. Capital expenditures remained modest in Q4 2017, given our capital light business model, at $21.2 million compared to $20.4 million in Q4 2016 and $25.9 million in Q3 2017. Full year capital expenditures were $84.5 million, less than $0.50 per DAU.\n(1)\nWe define a Daily Active User, or DAU, as a registered Snapchat user who opens the Snapchat application at least once during a defined 24-hour period. We measure average Daily Active Users for a particular quarter by calculating the average Daily Active Users for that quarter.\n(2)\nWe define average revenue per user, or ARPU, as quarterly revenue divided by the average Daily Active Users.\n(3)\nWe define cost of revenue per user, or CoRPU, as quarterly cost of revenue divided by the average Daily Active Users.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nSnap Inc. will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific / 5:00 p.m. Eastern today. The live audio webcast along with supplemental information will be accessible at investor.snap.com . A recording of the webcast will also be available following the conference call.\nSnap Inc. uses the investor.snap.com and snap.com/news websites as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligation under Regulation FD.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Forward-looking statements include statements about expected financial metrics, such as revenue, non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, and stock-based compensation, as well as non-financial metrics, such as DAU and video views. They also include statements about our possible or assumed business strategies, potential growth opportunities, new products, and potential market opportunities.\nForward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as “believe,” “could,” “potential,” “will,” “would” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the . These risks include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties related to: our limited operating history, our lack of significant revenue and profitability to date, our ability to monetize our products, the highly competitive and rapidly changing market for internet and advertising companies, infrastructure costs, our ability to create new and innovative products, our ability to maintain users and manage any future user growth, litigation, and our international expansion strategies. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results are included in the section titled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the final prospectus for our initial public offering, dated March 1, 2017, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . Additional information will be made available in Snap Inc.’s annual report on Form 10-K and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC. In addition, any contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these , or to update the reasons if actual results differ materially from those anticipated in the .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss); excluding interest income; interest expense; other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense; and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time, as described below. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow, which is defined as net cash used in operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business and is a key financial indicator used by management. Additionally, we believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure since we use third-party infrastructure partners to host our services and therefore we do not incur significant capital expenditures to support revenue generating activities. Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth.\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of Non-GAAP Net Loss, which is defined as net income (loss); excluding amortization of intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense; certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time; and related income tax adjustments. Non-GAAP Net Loss and weighted average diluted shares are then used to calculate Non-GAAP diluted net loss per share. Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, we believe these measures help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses we exclude in the measure.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nFor a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nSnap Inc., “Snapchat,” and our other registered and common law trade names, trademarks, and service marks are the property of Snap Inc. or our subsidiaries.\nSNAP INC.
