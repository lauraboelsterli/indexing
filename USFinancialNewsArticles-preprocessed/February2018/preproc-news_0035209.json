The conference call / webcast details, earnings call presentation and supplemental financial information, which includes definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this release and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, are available on Iron Mountain's Investor Relations website at http://investors.ironmountain.com/company/for-investors/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2018/Q4-2017-Iron-Mountain-Incorporated-Earnings-Conference-Call-/default.aspx or by clicking HERE.\nFinancial Performance Highlights\nTotal Revenues, on a reported basis, for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $991 million, compared with $934 million in 2016. On a constant dollar (C$) basis, Total Revenues grew 4.1% compared to the prior year. For full year 2017, Total Revenues were $3.85 billion, compared with $3.51 billion in 2016, an increase of 9.0% on a C$ basis, reflecting the benefit from the acquisition of Recall Holdings Limited (\"Recall\"), which closed on May 2, 2016. Income from Continuing Operations for the fourth quarter was $24 million, compared with $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Income from Continuing Operations included $26 million of Recall Costs in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, Income from Continuing Operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 included $30 million of debt extinguishment charges associated with refinancing of the company's GBP notes. For the full year, Income from Continuing Operations was $192 million, compared with $104 million in 2016. For full year 2017, Recall Costs were $85 million in 2017 compared with $132 million in 2016 and debt extinguishment charges were $78 million in 2017 compared with $9 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, on a reported dollar basis, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $327 million, compared with $297 million in 2016. On a C$ basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 8% reflecting higher margins associated with cost synergies from the Recall acquisition as well as the company's Transformation Initiative. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA was $1.26 billion, compared with $1.09 billion in 2016 or an increase of 15% on a C$ basis, reflecting the benefit from the Recall acquisition and Transformation Initiative. Reported EPS - Fully Diluted from Continuing Operations for the fourth quarter was $0.09 compared with $0.19 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Reported EPS - Fully Diluted from Continuing Operations for the fourth quarter was impacted by the debt extinguishment charges referenced above. Full year, Reported EPS - Fully Diluted from Continuing Operations was $0.71 compared with $0.41 in 2016. The full year increase in Reported EPS was driven by improved margins and lower Recall Costs in 2017, partially offset by debt extinguishment charges. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.29, compared with $0.26 in 2016, an increase of 12%. For full year 2017, Adjusted EPS was $1.16 compared with $1.07 in 2016. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects an amortization charge of approximately $0.02 per share associated with an adjustment to Recall customer relationship value. Prior to the amortization adjustment, Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been $0.31. The structural tax rate was 19.7%, compared with 18.5% a year ago. Net Income for the fourth quarter was $21 million compared with $50 million in 2016. For the full year, Net Income was $185 million compared with $107 million in 2016. FFO (Normalized) per share was $0.53 for the fourth quarter, compared with $0.50 in 2016. For the full year, FFO (Normalized) per share was $2.13, compared with $1.98 in 2016. AFFO was $154 million for the fourth quarter compared with $170 million in 2016, a decrease of 9%. The decrease was primarily driven by timing of maintenance capital expenditures relative to the fourth quarter in 2016. For the full year, AFFO increased 12% to $752 million, compared with $669 million in 2016.\nGuidance\nThe company issued 2018 full-year guidance based on 2018 constant dollar budget rates; details are available on Page 7 of the Supplemental Financial Information.\nForward Looking Statement\nSafe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release contains certain within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws and is subject to the safe-harbor created by such Act.
