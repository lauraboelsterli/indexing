    "text": "MOLINE, Ill., Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- QCR Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCRH) today announced net income of $9.9 million and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.70 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. This included $2.1 million of acquisition costs and post-acquisition compensation, transition and integration costs (after-tax) related to the previously announced acquisition of Guaranty Bank and Trust Company (“Guaranty Bank”), based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which closed on October 1, 2017. It also included $753 thousand of cost (after-tax) related to the core processor conversion at Community State Bank (“CSB”), based in Ankeny, Iowa, which is planned for late 2018. Additionally, due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), the Company recorded a $2.9 million increase in the value of its net deferred tax asset, which was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding these, and other non-core items, the Company reported core net income (non-GAAP) of $9.9 million and diluted EPS of $0.70.\nBy comparison, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company reported net income of $7.9 million and diluted EPS of $0.58. This included $605 thousand of acquisition costs and post-acquisition transition and integration costs (after-tax) related to the acquisition of Guaranty Bank. Excluding these costs and other non-core items, the Company reported core net income (non-GAAP) of $8.5 million and diluted EPS of $0.63. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported net income of $8.5 million and diluted EPS of $0.64.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $35.7 million and diluted EPS of $2.61. Excluding all non-core items, the Company reported core net income (non-GAAP) of $36.3 million and diluted EPS of $2.66. By comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported net income of $27.7 million and diluted EPS of $2.17. Excluding all non-core items, the Company reported core net income (non-GAAP) of $29.4 million and diluted EPS of $2.31 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n“We are pleased with our operating performance this year,” commented Douglas M. Hultquist, President and Chief Executive Officer, “and we continue to strategize and pursue ways to improve our profitability through our ongoing key initiatives. We finished the year on a strong note, with solid organic loan and deposit growth, and significant fee income. The acquisition of Guaranty Bank in the fourth quarter of 2017 and CSB in the third quarter of 2016 also contributed to our improved profitability.”\nOrganic Loan and Lease Growth of 15.2% for the Year\nSwap Fee Income and Gains on the Sale of Government Guaranteed Loans Total $4.3 million in 2017\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s total assets increased $432.2 million, or 12%, to a total of $4.0 billion. Of this growth in assets, $274.8 million was attributable to the acquisition of Guaranty Bank. Total loans and leases grew $287.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which $192.5 million was attributable to the acquisition of Guaranty Bank. Loan and lease growth was primarily funded by deposit growth. Deposits grew organically by $159.9 million, or 6% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“Organic loan and lease growth totaled $366.5 million for the full year, or an annual growth rate of 15.2%,” commented Mr. Hultquist. “We were quite pleased with another year of very strong organic loan growth in 2017. We will continue to grow loans organically through market share increases, as customers continue to appreciate the way we do business and are attracted to our relationship-based community banking model.”\n“Swap fee income and gains on the sale of government guaranteed loans were very strong in the fourth quarter and totaled $4.3 million for the full year. Given the nature of this fee income source, large fluctuations can occur from quarter-to-quarter, as we experienced in 2017,” stated Todd A. Gipple, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. “We plan to continue executing these types of transactions, as they provide unique and beneficial solutions for our clients.”\nNet Interest Income Improvement\nDriven By Strong Loan Growth and Acquisition\nNet interest income totaled $31.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. By comparison, net interest income totaled $28.6 million and $29.3 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Acquisition-related net accretion totaled $745 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. By comparison, acquisition-related net accretion totaled $474 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and $2.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Excluding acquisition-related net accretion, net interest income of $31.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 11%, compared to $28.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nNet interest income totaled $116.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. By comparison, net interest income totaled $94.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n“We saw the benefit of our strong organic loan growth during 2017 with a significant increase in net interest income this quarter and for the full year. Net interest margin (excluding acquisition accounting net accretion) decreased four basis points when comparing linked quarters at 3.61% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.65% for the third quarter of 2017,” stated Mr. Gipple. “While we had strong organic loan growth in the quarter, most of the growth occurred later in the quarter and as a result we carried, on average, $52.2 million of excess liquidity in the fourth quarter due to strong deposit growth. Excluding this excess liquidity, our net interest margin would have increased one basis point when comparing linked quarters.”\nNonperforming Assets Decrease in Fourth Quarter\nNonperforming assets (“NPAs”) decreased $1.4 million in the current quarter. The ratio of NPAs to total assets was 0.81% at December 31, 2017, which was down from 0.95% at September 30, 2017 and down from 0.82% a year ago.\n“Asset quality was stable in the fourth quarter. The large CRE relationship that we added to NPAs in the third quarter of this year was moved to other real estate owned and we charged off a portion of the balance,” stated Mr. Hultquist. He continued, “We remain committed to improving asset quality.”\nThe Company’s provision for loan and lease losses totaled $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, which was up $168 thousand from the prior quarter, and down $344 thousand compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s allowance to total loans and leases was 1.16%, which was down compared to 1.31% at September 30, 2017 and down from 1.28% at December 31, 2016.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for acquisition accounting, the loans acquired through the acquisition of CSB and Guaranty Bank were recorded at market value; therefore, there was no allowance associated with the acquired loans. Management continues to evaluate the allowance needed on the acquired loans factoring in the net remaining discount ($8.1 million at December 31, 2017). When factoring this remaining discount into the Company’s allowance to total loans and leases calculation, the Company’s allowance as a percentage of total loans and leases increases from 1.16% to 1.43%.\nCapital Levels Remain Strong\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s total risk-based capital ratio was 11.09%, the common equity tier 1 ratio was 9.06%, and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.01%. By comparison, these respective ratios were 11.49%, 9.33% and 8.31% as of September 30, 2017. The decrease in ratios was primarily due to the acquisition of Guaranty Bank, as well as strong loan growth.\n“As a result of solid earnings performance, capital ratios continue to be strong and we are growing tangible common equity at a steady pace,” stated Mr. Gipple. He continued, “Additionally, the Company issued $30.7 million in common stock, net of issuance costs, as part of the Guaranty Bank acquisition. In total, tangible common equity has increased $52.4 million or 20% year-over-year when comparing December 31, 2017 to the same period of the prior year, and tangible book value per share increased by approximately 13%, increasing from $20.11 at December 31, 2016 to $22.70 at December 31, 2017.”\nContinued Focus on Seven Key Initiatives\nThe Company continues to focus on the following initiatives in an effort to improve profitability and drive increased shareholder value:\nStrong organic loan and lease growth to maintain loans and leases to total assets ratio in the range of 73-78% Grow core deposits to maintain reliance on wholesale funding at less than 15% of assets Generate gains on sale of USDA and SBA loans, and fee income on interest rate swaps, as a significant and consistent component of core revenue Grow wealth management net income by 10% annually Carefully manage noninterest expense growth Maintain asset quality metrics at better than peer levels Participate as an acquirer in the consolidation taking place in our industry to further boost ROAA, improve efficiency ratio, and increase EPS\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will host an earnings call/webcast on February 2, 2018 at 10 a.m. central time.

The Company's management believes that this measurement is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes period-to-period in common equity. In compliance with applicable rules of the SEC, this non-GAAP measure is reconciled to stockholders' equity and total assets, which are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. (2) Core net income, core net income attributable to QCR Holdings, Inc. common stockholders, core earnings per common share and core return on average assets are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's management believes that these measurements are important to investors as they exclude non-recurring income and expense items, therefore, they provide a more realistic run-rate for future periods. In compliance with applicable rules of the SEC, this non-GAAP measure is reconciled to net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. (3) Nonrecurring items (post-tax) are calculated using an estimated effective tax rate of 35%. (4) Acquisition costs were analyzed individually for deductibility. Presented amounts are tax-effected accordingly. (5) Interest earned and yields on nontaxable securities and loans are determined on a tax equivalent basis using a 35% tax rate for each period presented. (6) Net interest margin (TEY) is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company's management utilizes this measurement to take into account the tax benefit associated with certain loans and securities. It is also standard industry practice to measure net interest margin using tax-equivalent measures. In compliance with applicable rules of the SEC, this non-GAAP measure is reconciled to net interest income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. (7) Efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure. The Company's management utilizes this ratio to compare to industry peers. The ratio is used to calculate overhead as a percentage of revenue. In compliance with the applicable rules of the SEC, this non-GAAP measure is reconciled to noninterest expense, net interst income and noninterest income, which are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nContact:\nTodd A.
