    "text": "Feb 8 (Reuters) - Shares of British semiconductor material maker IQE, whose technology is used in Apple’s iPhone, fell nearly 19 percent after Muddy Waters Capital LLC said it was short on the company.\nThe short-seller said it IQE was an ‘egregious accounting manipulator’ and that it was reasonable to adjust net income down by about 5 million pounds or 69 percent for the first half of 2017 to account for likely ‘aggressive capitalization of expenses’.\nIt also adjusted downwards the company’s net income for 2015 by 58.5 percent and that of 2016 by 25.4 percent.\nMuddy Waters said IQE's transactions with CSC, a joint venture with Cardiff University, was \"not substantive, and the accounting is possibly designed to deceive investors\". ( bit.ly/2FYEtBf )\nMuddy Waters’ report came a week after one from ShadowFall, a hedge fund manager short on IQE, said it was concerned about two of IQE’s joint ventures set up with universities in Wales and Singapore. The joint ventures together accounted for a third of IQE’s earnings in 2015 and 2016, it added.\nIQE dismissed the ShadowFall report as being ‘without merit’ and providing a ‘misleading analysis of company’s financial position.’\nThe company also said then that it continues to expect full- year revenue ahead of market expectations.\nIQE was not immediately available for comment on Thursday on the Muddy Waters report.\nShares of the company were down 10.7 percent at 1309 GMT and were among the most heavily traded on the London Stock Exchange.\nReporting By Justin George Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Vyas Mohan\n ",
