Athyrium Capital Management (“Athyrium”) has confirmed it is participating in the Offering and efforts are underway to finalize the €25 million bond issue (the “Bond Issue”) with stock warrants, the size of which may subsequently be increased to €35 million.\nThe net proceeds from the capital increase and the Bond Issue will be used to increase HEMOBLAST TM Bellows’ production capacity, including the opening of a second manufacturing facility close to the existing unit in Saint Priest to support the marketing of the drug in Europe and the United States from summer 2018, to fund further preclinical and clinical trials for HEMOBLAST TM Bellows and HEMOSNOW TM and to repay the loan from Kreos Capital.\nEtienne Binant, Biom’Up’s Chief Executive Officer, commented: “Biom’Up wishes to thank all its investors—those from France and those from further afield, those who have long supported us and those who have only recently come on board—for making this fundraising transaction a success. The €16 million capital increase will enable us to accelerate the industrial development of Biom'Up, and to prepare the expansion of our hemostatic range. As planned, these funds will be used to accelerate the ramp-up in our production in connection with the launch of HEMOBLAST™ Bellows and further clinical efforts on HEMOBLAST™ Bellows and HEMOSNOW™. I would also like to warmly thank Athyrium Capital and its teams for their involvement in Biom’Up’s development as an investor, in the context of the offering, and particularly in the process of the Bond Issue.”\n(i) Public Offering\nShares not subscribed for during the priority subscription period, as well as new shares that may be issued under the extension clause, were made available in a global offering, consisting of an open-price offering in France (the “Public Offering”) and a global placement (the “Global Placement”), comprising a private placement in France primarily with qualified investors and an international private placement primarily with institutional investors in certain other countries.\nThe subscription price for the new shares, which was set by the Company’s Board of Directors on February 13, 2018 at €11.00 per share, represented a discount of 5% to the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s shares over the final three trading days prior to February 13, 2018 (inclusive).\nThe capital increase in a total amount of €16 led to the issue of 1,452,418 new shares, representing 12.9% of the Company’s existing share capital.\nDuring the priority period granted to the Company’s existing shareholders, demand, on a non-reducible basis, from them totaled €1,249,193, which accounted for 7.8% of the total amount of the capital increase.\nAs part of the public offer, the demand, on a reducible basis, reached a total amount of €339,196, or 2.1% of the total amount of the capital increase.\nTop-tier international investors subscribed for shares worth €14,388,209 through the Global Placement, or 90.1% of the capital increase.\nTo the best of the Company’s knowledge, the Company’s ownership structure upon completion of the capital increase was as follows:\nShareholders On a non-diluted basis On a diluted basis * Before issuance of\n1,452,418 new shares\nAfter issuance of\n1,452,418 new shares\nBefore issuance of\n1,452,418 new\nshares\nAfter issuance of\n1,452,418 new shares\nAfter issuance of the\n1,452,418 new shares,\nand completion of the\nBond Issue**\nNumber of\nshares\n% of\ncapital in\nvoting\nrights\nNumber of\nshares\n% of\ncapital in\nvoting\nrights\nNumber of\nshares\n% of\ncapital in\nvoting\nrights\nNumber of\nshares\n% of\ncapital in\nvoting\nrights\nNumber of\nshares\n% of\ncapital in\nvoting\nrights\nBpifrance Participations 1,637,006 14.6 % 1,637,006 12.9 % 1,637,006 13.3 % 1,637,006 11.9 % 1,637,006 11.6 % Bpifrance Investissement (InnoBio) 1,148,542 10.2 % 1,148,542 9.1 % 1,148,542 9.3 % 1,148,542 8.3 % 1,148,542 8.1 % Sub-Total Bpifrance 2,785,548 24.8 % 2,785,548 22.0 % 2,785,548 22.6 % 2,785,548 20.2 % 2,785,548 19.7 % Gimv 1,206,272 10.8 % 1,206,272 9.5 % 1,206,272 9.8 % 1,206,272 8.8 % 1,206,272 8.5 % Lundbeckfond Ventures 925,492 8.2 % 925,492 7.3 % 925,492 7.5 % 925,492 6.7 % 925,492 6.5 % Sham Innovation Santé 742,899 6.6 % 742,899 5.9 % 742,899 6.0 % 742,899 5.4 % 742,899 5.2 % Viveris Fund 570,354 5.1 % 570,354 4.5 % 570,354 4.6 % 570,354 4.1 % 570,354 4.0 % Mérieux Participations 267 088 2.4 % 267,088 2.1 % 267,088 2.2 % 267,088 1.9 % 267,088 1.9 % Sub-total historical shareholders 6,497,653 57.9 % 6,497,653 51.3 % 6,497,653 52.8 % 6,497,653 47.2 % 6,497,653 45.9 % Various historical shareholders 395,990 3.5 % 395,990 3.1 % 395,990 3.2 % 395,990 2.9 % 395,990 2.8 % Founding Partners and Directors 387,014 3.4 % 387,014 3.1 % 880,379, 7.1 % 880,379 6.4 % 880,379 6.2 % Free Float 3,935,706 35.1 % 5,206,306 41.1 % 3,935,706 32.0 % 5,206,306 37.8 % 5,206,306 36.8 % o/w Invesco 600,000 5.3 % 674,332 5.3 % 600,000 4.9 % 674,332 4.9 % 674,332 4.8 % Own shares 3,280 0.0 % 3,280 0.0 % 3,280 0.0 % 3,280 0.0 % 3,280 0.0 % Dilutive instruments held by employees -

Copies of the prospectus, comprising the document de base, the note d’opération and the summary are available free of charge from Biom’Up (Parc Technologique de Lyon, 8, allée Irène Joliot Curie, 69800 Saint-Priest, France) as well as on the Company’s website ( www.biomup.com ) and the AMF website ( www.amf-france.org ).\nInvestors’ attention is drawn to the risk factors mentioned in chapter 4 of the document de base, as updated in chapter 11 of the note d’opération, as well as chapter 2 of the note d’opération, before making their investment decision. The realization of all or some of these risks may have an unfavorable effect on Biom’Up’s activity, financial position, results, development or outlook.\n(ii) Bond Financing\nSince the capital increase met Athyrium’s requirements, the Company and the investor are working to finalize the legal documentation for the bond financing agreement as rapidly as possible. The Bond Issue will be for up to €35 million, including €25 million upon issue, along with an option for an additional €10 million to be agreed at the discretion of the parties within 12 months of the initial issue, repayable quarterly as of the third anniversary of the issue, in each case in the form of bonds with stock warrants with a maturity of five years after the initial issue, and to be subscribed for by one or more funds managed by Athyrium. The bonds will be secured by collateral equivalent to that granted for the purposes of the December 2016 bond issue to Kreos Capital. Furthermore, the bond financing agreement provides for a representative of Athyrium to join the Company’s Board of Directors as a non-voting advisor.\nThe arrangements for the issue are as follows:\nthe interest rate on the bonds stands at 10% p.a. (increased to 13% p.a. in the event of a default that goes unremedied, where no waiver had been granted and that had not ceased), representing an annual interest charge of €2.5 million, which may be increased to €2.8 million if the option for an additional €10 million is exercised the stock warrants attached to the bonds entitle their holder to subscribe for 385,000 new shares in the Company (equal to 3.1% of the Company’s share capital on a diluted basis prior to the capital increase), including 275,000 new shares in respect of the first tranche of €25 million (issued pursuant to the Sixth resolution of the Company’s Extraordinary General Meeting of August 31, 2017), and 110,000 new shares in respect of the second tranche of €10 million (issued pursuant to a subsequent resolution of the Company’s Extraordinary General Meeting), in each case entailing the payment of a subscription price equal to the volume-weighted average for the final five trading days preceding the issue of the stock warrants plus a premium of 2% the stock warrants attached to the bonds may be exercised during the period running from January 1, 2019 through to the 5-year anniversary date of the issue of the bonds the transferability of the stock warrants attached to the bonds will be restricted to affiliates of the bondholders for the first two years, except in the event of a default, and only the underlying shares will be admitted to trading on Euronext’s regulated market in Paris.\nAbout Biom’Up\nFounded in 2005 and based in the Lyon suburb of Saint-Priest (France), Biom’Up designs hemostatic products based on patented biopolymers that aim to simplify surgical procedures in numerous specialties (spine, cardiothoracic, general, orthopedic, plastic) and give patients a better quality of life.
