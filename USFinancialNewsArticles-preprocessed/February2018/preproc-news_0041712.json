    "text": "PARKLAND, Fla. (Reuters) - Stunned by last week’s bloodiest high school shooting in U.S. history, students across the country were mobilizing on Sunday for stronger gun laws, while Florida officials contemplated when to reopen their badly shaken school. \nStudents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a former student is accused of murdering 17 people on Wednesday, joined others on social media to plan rallies, a Washington march and a national walk-out aimed at getting the attention of an adult population many say has failed to protect them. \n“I felt like it was our time to take a stand, because, you know, we’re the ones in these schools, we’re the ones who are having shooters come into our classrooms and our spaces,” said Lane Murdock of Ridgefield High School in Connecticut. \nMurdock, a 15-old sophomore who lives 20 miles (32 km) from Sandy Hook Elementary School where 20 children and six adults were shot dead five years ago, drew more than 36,000 signatures on an online petition Sunday morning calling on students to walk out of their high schools on April 20. \nInstead of going to classes, she urged her fellow students to stage protests on the 19th anniversary of the mass shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado. \nLast week’s massacre in Florida, which followed several other school shootings this year, inflamed the country’s long-simmering debate between advocates for gun control and gun ownership. \nFor a graphic on Florida school shooting, click tmsnrt.rs/2nX8ECo \nFormer student Nikolas Cruz, 19, faces multiple murder charges in the deaths of 14 students and three staff members, and the wounding of more than a dozen others, in a rampage that eclipsed Columbine as the country’s worst mass shooting at a high school. \n\nPlacards and letters are shown, signed by worshipers at Christ Church United Methodist Church in response to shootings in nearby Parkland, Florida which will be sent to legislators and officials in Fort Lauderdale,   REUTERS/Joe Skipper The charges can bring the death penalty, but prosecutors have not yet said if they will seek capital punishment. \nSchool officials in Broward County said on Sunday that they were aiming to have staff return to the Douglas High School campus by the end of the week. The school system’s announcement did not say when classes would resume. \nCruz was reported to have been investigated by police and state officials as far back as 2016 after slashing his arm in a social media video, and saying he wanted to buy a gun. Authorities, however, determined he was receiving sufficient support, newspapers said on Saturday. \n\nCameron Kasky Jr. (C), a student who was   during a mass shooting, embraces the police officer Brad Griesinger in front of the school, after the police security perimeter was removed, in Parkland, Florida, U.S., February 18, 2018.
