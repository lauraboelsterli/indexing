    "text": "CINCINNATI, The board of directors of The E.W. Scripps Company (NYSE: SSP) has declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2018.\nScripps shareholders of record as of March 1, 2018, will receive 5 cents per share, payable on March 26, 2018. The dividend will be paid out of the company's surplus.\nThis will mark the first time the company has paid a quarterly dividend since 2008.\n\"The decision by our board to initiate a quarterly dividend is a sign of confidence in the state of our business and faith in our strategy for the future,\" said Adam Symson, Scripps president and chief executive officer. \"We're focused on strengthening our local media operations, anchored by our television stations, while we support the long-term value creation we see in the high-growth businesses we have in Katz, Midroll and Newsy.\"\nWhile the company intends to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed quarterly and declared by the board at its discretion.
