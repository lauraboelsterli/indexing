I am confident that Wes is the right person to build on Kaufman Hall's tradition as an industry leader.\"\n\"We are very grateful for Terri's critical contribution and equally pleased to have Wes leading Kaufman Hall as CEO as the industries we serve continue to transform, and new opportunities for the company present themselves,\" said Tim Sullivan, Managing Director of Madison Dearborn Partners. \"We look forward to Wes continuing to accelerate Kaufman Hall's strong growth trajectory.\" Kaufman Hall is a portfolio company of Madison Dearborn Partners.\nChampion and Wareham will work closely over the next several months to transition responsibilities, ensuring continuation of the key principles and values that have driven Kaufman Hall's historic growth: to be a trusted advisor to its clients and to bring best practices in strategy, software, and data to achieve performance excellence.\nAbout Kaufman Hall\nKaufman Hall provides management consulting and software to help organizations realize sustained success amid changing market conditions.
