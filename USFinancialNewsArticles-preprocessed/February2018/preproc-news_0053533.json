    "text": "MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- World Fuel Services Corporation (NYSE: INT)\nFourth-Quarter 2017\nGAAP net loss of $193.1 million or $2.86 per diluted share, including a tax charge attributable to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”), impairment and restructuring charges Adjusted net income was $17.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share Generated operating cash flow of $160.0 million\nFull-Year 2017\nRecord total of 20.9 billion gallons of fuel sold Record total gross profit of $932.2 million Impairment charges of $91.9 million primarily related to our marine segment Restructuring charges of $59.6 million related to exiting non-core business lines and improving operating efficiencies One-time transition tax of $144 million related to U.S. Tax Reform GAAP net loss of $170.2 million, or $2.50 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA of $295.9 million Adjusted net income of $126.6 million or $1.86 per diluted share\nFiscal Year 2017 Highlights\n“We generated $932 million in gross profit representing modest growth over 2016. Strength in our aviation segment was meaningfully offset by challenging market conditions in marine and parts of our land segment,” stated Michael J. Kasbar, chairman and chief executive officer of World Fuel Services Corporation. “We are optimistic about 2018 as we have begun executing on an organizational redesign to drive greater operating efficiencies. We continue to sharpen our portfolio of business activities while executing on a solid pipeline of initiatives to accelerate organic growth across the business, with opportunity for selective strategic investments, as well.”\nFor the full year, the company’s aviation segment generated gross profit of $441 million, an increase of $40 million or 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by our government business and increased volume and profitability in our international fueling operations. The company’s marine segment generated gross profit of $126 million, a decrease of 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by the continued weakness in the maritime environment. The company’s land segment generated gross profit of $366 million, up 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by the benefit derived from recent acquisitions offset in part by pressures in supply and trading activities in North America.\nIn conjunction with our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $91.9 million, in the fourth quarter, primarily related to our marine segment. This was primarily a result of growing weakness in maritime markets over the last year, along with a further decline in demand for price risk management products and our decision to exit our marine business in certain international markets. The goodwill impairment is a non-cash charge and does not impact our current financial flexibility, and we believe our overall cash generating capabilities remain strong.\nAs a result of our continuing efforts to sharpen our portfolio of business activities, we recorded a restructuring charge of $59.6 million in the fourth quarter, relating to the exit of two specific business activities. As we heighten our focus on sharpening our portfolio, we expect to identify additional opportunities to restructure our operations, exit non-core assets or under-performing lines of business in an effort to more effectively allocate resources to drive improved profitability.\nOur fourth quarter results reflect an income tax charge of approximately $157 million, which includes a $144 million one-time transition tax payable over eight years, as a result of U.S. Tax Reform. As we intend to utilize our U.S. net operating losses, we expect to only pay approximately $100 million over the eight-year payment period. Looking ahead, the new 21% domestic corporate tax rate should offer the potential for improved returns related to our large pipeline of strategic investment opportunities in the U.S.\n“We are committed to restructuring all relevant parts of the company, in terms of size and organizational design, to maximize our market competitiveness and operational agility. We are focused on achieving a more efficient operating model measured by the disciplined execution of fundamentals to drive improvement in long-term operational and financial performance,” said Ira M. Birns, executive vice president and chief financial officer. “Organic and strategic growth opportunities combined with the benefit from recent restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to identify additional cost saving opportunities, should drive improved results in 2018, delivering greater value to our shareholders.”\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL\nOperating cash flow amounted to $205 million for fiscal year 2017. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 1.8x at December 31, 2017 down from 2.1x at September 30, 2017.\nWe repurchased 1.73 million shares for $61.9 million in 2017 and we have $100.0 million remaining under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in October 2017.\nPrincipally as a result of U.S. Tax Reform, we repaid $242 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and term loan in the fourth quarter. We also amended our credit facility in January 2018 to facilitate additional repayments.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and net debt (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Measures”). The Non-GAAP measures exclude costs associated with goodwill and other impairments, severance and restructuring charges, the tax impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the valuation allowance against the net U.S. deferred tax assets and acquisition-related charges, primarily because we do not believe they are reflective of the Company’s core operating results. We used a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors to review goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment for all of our reporting units and as a result of performing these assessments, we recorded an impairment charge primarily attributable to the write-off of goodwill in our marine segment and intangible assets, mostly consisting of customer relationships in both the marine and land segments. Restructuring charges are related to an enterprise-wide restructuring plan that is designed to streamline the organization, and reallocate resources to better align our organizational structure and costs with our strategy. These non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of our business or economic trends. We believe that the Non-GAAP Measures, when considered in conjunction with our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, are useful to investors to further aid in evaluating the ongoing financial performance of the Company and to provide greater transparency as supplemental information to our GAAP results.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to the presentation of such metrics by other companies. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to World Fuel Services and available to common shareholders by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock, stock units, restricted stock entitled to dividends not subject to forfeiture and vested restricted stock units outstanding during the period and the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if our outstanding potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP Measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in this press release and on our website.\nInformation Relating to Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our beliefs and expectations to accelerate organic growth, execute on our long-term growth strategy, our expectations regarding our restructuring activities and additional cost saving opportunities, our future operating results and its contributing factors, our belief regarding our cash generating capabilities, our intentions regarding use of our net operating losses and its impact on future tax payment amounts, and the impact of the new corporate tax rate on our investment returns.
