(Nasdaq: SNOA, warrants SNOAW), a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets unique and effective solutions for the treatment of dermatological conditions and advanced tissue care, today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal revenue was $4.8 million for the third quarter as compared to $3.4 million for the same period last year. Product revenues of $4.6 million were up 46%, or $1.5 million, when compared to the same period last year, as result of strong growth in the United States, Europe and Latin America.\n“This quarter’s revenue of $4.8 million is our highest quarterly revenue in the history of the company. This record revenue has been driven by robust year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in the prescription dermatology business – our primary focus over the last three years. These results include sales growth in our Levicyn, Celacyn, Ceramax, SebuDerm and Mondoxyne products,” said Jim Schutz, Sonoma Pharmceuticals CEO.\nBusiness Highlights\nRobust portfolio of six non-steroidal products for treatment of atopic and seborrheic dermatitis, surgical procedures, severe acne, skin repair, descaling and scar management. Company has 30 sales representatives and five sales managers focused exclusively on the dermatology prescription market. Received approval by Brazilian Ministério da Saúde for seven non-steroidal and non-antibiotic topical dermatology products in October 2017. Received approval from United Arab Emirates (UAE) Ministry of Health & Prevention of three products for daily eyelid hygiene, antimicrobial nasal cleaning and antiseptic mouth and throat rinse. Received two FDA clearances to add antimicrobial language to both AlevicynSG™ Spray Gel and Alevicyn™ Dermal Spray solution.\nResults for the Three months Ended December 31, 2017\nProduct revenues in the United States, of $2.9 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased by $1.2 million, or 73%, as compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This increase was mostly the result of higher sales of the company’s dermatology, acute care and animal health care products.\nProduct revenue in Latin America for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $772,000. This amount reflects the sale of products to Invekra following the completion of Sonoma’s asset sale to Invekra in October 2016. Sonoma will continue to supply products to Invekra until its manufacturing facility is operational.\nProduct revenue in Europe and the rest of the world of $992,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $46,000, or 4%, as compared to $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was the result of lower sales in China and the Middle East, mostly offset by higher sales in Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong and India.\nSonoma reported gross profit of $2.4 million, or 49% of total revenue, during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a gross profit of $1.7 million, or 51% of total revenue in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, was primarily due to the lower profitability in Latin America related to the higher sales to Invekra at a very low profit, partly offset by higher margins in the United States caused by the strong growth of the more profitable dermatology product lines.\nOperating expenses minus non-cash expenses during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $4.9 million, up $555,000, or 13%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase in operating expenses was mostly due to higher sales, marketing and administrative expenses in the United States related to the growth of a direct sales force in dermatology, partly offset by a decline in Latin American expenses. A key driver to the growth in operating expenses is the increase in the number of sales representatives, compared to the same period last year.\nLoss from operations was $3.2 million, down $365,000, compared to $3.6 million for the same period last year. Operating loss less non-cash expenses (EBITDA) for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $2.4 million, compared to $2.5 million for the same period last year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Sonoma had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 million, as compared to $10 million as of September 30, 2017.\nResults for the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal revenues of $13 million increased by $4.2 million, or 48%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $8.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. Product revenue of $12.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2017, increased $4.2 million, or 52%, compared to the same period last year. This increase in product revenue was driven by strong growth in the United States, up $2.3 million, or 48% and by higher sales in Europe and rest of world, up $337,000, or 11%.\nThe company reported gross profit related to sales of its products of $6.0 million, or 46% of total revenues, for the nine months ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal operating expenses less non-cash expenses of $13.8 million increased $1.7 million, or 14%, for the nine months end December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher costs of the direct sales force for dermatology. Operating loss less non-cash expenses (EBITDA) of $7.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2017, was down $572,000, compared to $8.1 million for the same period last year.\nConference Call\nSonoma’s management will hold a conference call today to discuss third quarter fiscal year 2018 results and answer questions, beginning at 4:30 p.m. EST.
