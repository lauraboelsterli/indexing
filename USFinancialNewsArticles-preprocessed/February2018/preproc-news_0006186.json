His team successfully closed over $100 million in sales volume in 2017. Celeste was named Best Real Estate Agent in 2017 by Boston Magazine's Best of Boston, ranked in the Top 1% of all Brokers in the USA by Trulia.com , and ranked in the Top 150 USA Realtors by The Wall Street Journal's REAL Trends Report.\nAs business continues to flourish, Frank is thrilled to announce the addition of four new team members. \"The caliber of Frank Celeste's team continues to rise,\" commented Gibson Sotheby's International Realty's President/Co-owner, Paul McGann. \"We are thrilled to welcome his new team members to our growing company.\"\nIncluded are Jamie N. Imperato, Derek Vannah, Michael Valencius, and Brandon Gallagher.\nPrior to joining Gibson Sotheby's International Realty in 2016, Jamie N.

Before joining Team Frank Celeste, Mike worked at Metro Realty in Brookline for just under 4 years, where he closed over 350 transactions and became a top producer. Mike gained many repeat clients, leased hundreds of units for numerous owners, and looks forward to bringing his book of business to the Gibson Sotheby's International Realty brand. Brandon Gallagher comes from a background in commercial and residential rental transactions throughout Greater Boston. His patience, listening skills, and interest in establishing solid relationships has proven beneficial to Brandon and his business.\n\"Frank's business continues to positively impact the market in Boston and beyond,\" noted Gibson Sotheby's International Realty's Chairman/Co-owner, Larry Rideout. \"Frank has enlisted an all-star team of energetic and experienced real estate professionals. We are excited to see what is to come in 2018.\"\nWorking primarily out of Gibson Sotheby's International Realty's Charlestown office, Team Frank Celeste services all of Greater Boston.
