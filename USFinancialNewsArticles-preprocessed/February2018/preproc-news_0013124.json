    "text": "Jake Muzzin had a goal and two assists, and Anze Kopitar, Adrian Kempe, Dustin Brown and Alex Iafallo added a goal and an assist apiece in the Los Angeles Kings’ 6-0 victory over the visiting Arizona Coyotes at the Staples Center on Saturday.\nTrevor Lewis’s second short-handed goal of the season three minutes into a three-goal second period gave the Kings a 2-0 lead. That was plenty of cushion for goaltender Darcy Kuemper, who made 27 saves for his third shutout of the season, his second this week.\nThe Kings have won three of four and four of six after a season-worst, six-game losing streak. They tied a season high with six goals.\nThe Coyotes have lost three in a row and eight of 10. Their 33 points are the fewest in the league.\nKopitar has team highs with 20 goals and 55 points. Brown has 16 goals, Kempe 15, Lewis 13, Muzzin six and Iafallo five.\nKuemper, 8-1-3 in his games of record, had 28 saves in 3-0 shutout at Dallas in his last start on Tuesday.\nScott Wedgewood made 29 saves in his second consecutive start in place of the Coyotes’ No. 1 goaltender, Antti Raanta, who did not make the trip.\nRaanta, who has a 2.56 goals-against average, was rear-ended in a traffic accident on the way to the Coyotes’ home game against the Stars on Thursday and was replaced by Wedgewood in a 4-1 loss.\nIafallo gave the Kings a 1-0 lead at 7:14 of the first period when scored from point-blank range on assists from Tyler Toffoli and Kempe.\nLewis made it 2-0 with his short-handed goal at 2:37 of the second period on assists from Torrey Mitchell and Muzzin.\nKempe scored on a wrist shot from the high slot after a pass from Brown for a 3-0 lead after a Coyotes turnover at 5:12 of the second period.\nMuzzin scored five seconds into a power play goal for a 4-0 lead at 18:46 of the second period, and Kopitar and Brown scored in the third.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
