    "text": "Published: Feb 7, 2018 1:20 p.m. ET Share \nTwo-year pact raises federal spending by almost $300 billion above limits imposed by a 2011 budget law \nBy Reuters Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, center, announced a budget agreement on Wednesday. \nCongressional leaders said Wednesday they have reached an agreement on a two-year budget deal, charting a path out of the long-running turmoil over spending and immigration that culminated in a government shutdown last month. \nThe agreement raises federal spending by almost $300 billion over two years above limits imposed by a 2011 budget law. If approved by the GOP-controlled Congress, the deal would mark the triumph of defense hawks, who have pushed for higher military spending, over the dwindling number of conservatives focused on reducing the federal budget deficit. \nThe budget deal would raise military spending by $80 billion through the rest of fiscal year, which runs through September, and by $85 billion in fiscal year 2019, according to a congressional aide familiar with the agreement.
