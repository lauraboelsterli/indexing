    "text": "SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Militants stormed an Indian army camp early Saturday in the country’s northern Jammu and Kashmir state, killing at least two army officers and wounding seven people, a senior police official said.\nThe police officer, who asked not to be named, said three or four militants had launched the attack. At least two junior commissioned officers were killed, the officer said, and two women and two children - relatives of army personnel - were among seven injured in the fighting.\nS.D. Singh Jamwal, the inspector general of police in Jammu, said that at about 4:55 am, a guard noticed suspicious movement before gunfire on his bunker.\nAs of noon, fighting was still ongoing, said Jamwal. The site was cordoned off and surrounded by police and army units called in as reinforcements.\n“The fire was retaliated. The number of militants isn’t known,” he said. “They’ve been cornered in one of the family quarters.”\nIndia accuses Pakistan of training and arming militants and helping them infiltrate across the Line of Control that divides the Kashmir region. Pakistan denies the allegations.\nThe South Asian neighbours have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part.\nReporting by Fayaz Bukhari in Srinagar; Writing by Promit Mukherjee; Editing by Tom Lasseter and Richard Borsuk\n ",
