Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n“Adding such a well-established company like Covenant Security to our organization fulfills one of our strategic goals,” said Steve Jones, Allied Universal CEO. “Covenant Security is a demonstrated leader in several vertical markets and has great leadership. That combination made it a perfect fit for our long-term expansion plans.
