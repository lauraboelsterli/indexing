Most estate jobs he works on these days entail at least four ovens, he said.\nBuyers of these homes focus on entertaining and expect professional-grade appliances for chefs and catering teams, designers say. But there’s also a “cool toys” factor that is adding to the count: New-fangled ovens cook with steam, convection and microwave technology. “Some of the clients are big cooks,” said Steven Cooper, owner of Cooper-Pacific Kitchens in Los Angeles. \nHere’s a look at three kitchens with an abundance of ovens. Approximate prices do not include tax and installation.\nPhoto: Frank Gundry RAGING INFERNO For a client in L.A.’s Bel-Air neighborhood, Steven Cooper, owner of Cooper-Pacific Kitchens, installed a 60-inch Wolf range, a La Cornue rotisserie, a Miele Speed oven, a Miele Combi-Steam oven and a Wolf warming drawer. But that wasn’t enough: The client also wanted a BlueStar Salamander, a potent broiler typically found in restaurants.\nOven costs: $42,000\nPhoto: The Agency COOKING WITH GAS In this newly remodeled home, currently on the market for $35 million, builder Chris Dahowski of Archonomy included two 36-inch Wolf gas ranges with ovens, a Wolf electric wall oven, a Wolf convection steam oven, a Wolf microwave, an Officine Gullo rotisserie and a Wolf warming drawer.\nOven costs: $31,500\nPhoto: Frank Gundry SWEDISH SMORGASBORD This kitchen in Atherton, Calif., includes a 48-inch, six-burner Wolf range with two oven cavities, a Miele Combi-Steam oven, a Miele Speed oven and a Miele warming draw “that also cooks at low temperature,” said designer Ken Burghardt of Domicile in San Francisco. The kitchen was part of a whole-house “Swedish modern” remodel, he said.\nOven costs: $21,000\nRelated Reading \nThe His-and-Hers Kitchen The Kitchen Design Secrets of Top Restaurant Architects How to Stock a Mini Kitchen Without Giving up on Luxury",
