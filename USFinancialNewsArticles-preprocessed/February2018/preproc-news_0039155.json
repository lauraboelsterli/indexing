Mitsubishi Corporation contributed two existing data center facilities in the western Tokyo suburb of Mitaka, while Digital Realty contributed its recently completed data center development project in Osaka. The three seed assets were collectively valued at approximately 40 billion Japanese Yen, or approximately $350 million.\nLikewise during the fourth quarter of 2017, Digital Realty acquired a 250,000 square foot data center on a 19-acre site in suburban Chicago, approximately four miles from the company's Franklin Park campus, for a purchase price of $315 million. Roughly three-fourths of the building has been developed and is fully leased, and the property is expected to generate cash net operating income of approximately $22 million in 2018, representing a 7% going-in cap rate. The remaining 65,000 square feet of shell space is available for build-out of approximately eight megawatts of critical load from a dedicated, on-site sub-station.\nDigital Realty also acquired a 132,000 square foot multi-story parking garage adjacent to the company's highly connected Sovereign House data center in London for a purchase price of £22 million, or approximately $30 million. The parking garage is expected to generate cash net operating income of £0.8 million, or approximately $1 million, representing a 4% cap rate on in-place parking income. Digital Realty leased space within the parking garage to house critical Sovereign House equipment. This acquisition secures the company's position beyond the expiration of its previous parking garage lease in 2026.\nSeparately, Digital Realty acquired a 1.4-acre land parcel adjacent to 350 E. Cermak in Chicago, IL for a purchase price of $25 million. The site is expected to support the development of a 12-story, 720,000 square foot data center with up to 34 megawatts of critical power. Commencement of development will be subject to market demand, and delivery will be phased to facilitate customer expansion requirements.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Digital Realty closed on the sale of 44874 Moran Road, a 78,000 square foot data center in Sterling, VA for $34 million. The property was 100% leased and was expected to generate cash net operating income of approximately $3 million in 2017, representing an exit cap rate of 7%. The property was held in a consolidated joint venture, in which Digital Realty owned a 75% stake. The sale generated net proceeds of $34 million, and Digital Realty recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $12 million, net of non-controlling interests, during the fourth quarter.\nLikewise during the fourth quarter of 2017, Digital Realty closed on the sale of 1 Solutions Parkway, a 156,000 square foot suburban office building in St. Louis, MO for $37 million. The property was 100% leased to a single tenant and was expected to generate cash net operating income of approximately $3 million in 2017, representing an exit cap rate of 7%. The sale generated net proceeds of $35 million, and Digital Realty recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $15 million.\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, Digital Realty closed on the sale of 34551 Ardenwood Boulevard, a 323,000 square foot technology manufacturing property in Fremont, CA for $73 million. The property was 86% leased and was expected to generate cash net operating income of approximately $5 million in 2018, representing an exit cap rate of 7%. The sale generated net proceeds of $72 million, and Digital Realty recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $25 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, Digital Realty also closed on the sale of 200 Quannapowitt Parkway, a substantially vacant, 211,000 square foot data center redevelopment project in Wakefield, MA for $15 million. The sale generated net proceeds of $15 million, and Digital Realty recognized a loss on the sale of approximately $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nBalance Sheet\nDigital Realty had approximately $8.6 billion of total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017, substantially all of which was unsecured. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 5.2x, debt-plus-preferred-to-total enterprise value was 28.9% and fixed charge coverage was 4.2x.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including FFO, core FFO, and Adjusted EBITDA.

FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from real estate transactions, impairment charges, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), non-controlling interests in operating partnership and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' FFO. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.\nCore Funds from Operations :\nWe present core funds from operations, or core FFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, in excluding certain items that do not reflect core revenue or expense streams, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in our core business operating performance. We calculate core FFO by adding to or subtracting from FFO (i) termination fees and other non-core revenues, (ii) transaction and integration expenses, (iii) gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt, (iv) issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock, (v) equity in earnings adjustment for non-core items, (vi) severance, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, (vii) bridge facility fees, (viii) loss on currency forwards and (ix) other non-core expense adjustments. Because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of core FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate core FFO differently than we do and accordingly, our core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' core FFO. Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) :\nWe present adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, when compared year over year, it assesses our ability to fund dividend and distribution requirements from our operating activities. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, AFFO will be used by investors as a basis to assess our ability to fund dividend payments in comparison to other REITs, including on a per share and unit basis. We calculate AFFO by adding to or subtracting from core FFO (i) non-real estate depreciation, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, (iii) amortization of debt discount/premium, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (v) straight-line rent revenue, (vi) straight-line rent expense, (vii) above- and below-market rent amortization, (viii) deferred non-cash tax expense, (ix) capitalized leasing compensation, (x) recurring capital expenditures and (xi) capitalized internal leasing commissions. Other REITs may calculate AFFO differently than we do and accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs' AFFO. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA :\nWe believe that earnings before interest, loss from early extinguishment of debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and impairment of investments in real estate, or EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), are useful supplemental performance measures because they allow investors to view our performance without the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization or the cost of debt and, with respect to Adjusted EBITDA, severance-related expense, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, transaction and integration expenses, (gain) loss on real estate transactions, non-cash (gain) on lease termination, equity in earnings adjustment for non-core items, other non-core expense adjustments, noncontrolling interests, preferred stock dividends, including undeclared dividends, and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA excluding severance-related expense, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, transaction and integration expenses, (gain) loss on real estate transactions, non-cash (gain) on lease termination, equity in earnings adjustment for non-core items, other non-core expense adjustments, non-controlling interests, preferred stock dividends, including undeclared dividends, and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock. In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes, exclude capitalized costs, such as leasing commissions, and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business, their utility as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and accordingly, our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other REITs' EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our financial performance.\nNet Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOI :\nNet operating income, or NOI, represents rental revenue, tenant reimbursement revenue and interconnection revenue less utilities expense, rental property operating expenses, property taxes and insurance expenses (as reflected in the statement of operations). NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measurement of operating performance of the company's rental portfolio. Cash NOI is NOI less straight-line rents and above- and below-market rent amortization. Cash NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measure of property operating performance on a cash basis. However, because NOI and cash NOI exclude depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of NOI and cash NOI as measures of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate NOI and cash NOI differently than we do and, accordingly, our NOI and cash NOI may not be comparable to other REITs' NOI and cash NOI. NOI and cash NOI should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as measures of our performance.\nAdditional Definitions\nNet debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated using total debt at balance sheet carrying value, plus capital lease obligations, plus our share of JV debt, less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents divided by the product of Adjusted EBITDA (inclusive of our share of JV EBITDA) multiplied by four.\nDebt-plus-preferred-to-total enterprise value is mortgage debt and other loans plus preferred stock divided by mortgage debt and other loans plus the liquidation value of preferred stock and the market value of outstanding Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units, assuming the redemption of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units for shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock.\nFixed charge coverage ratio is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the sum of GAAP interest expense, capitalized interest, scheduled debt principal payments and preferred dividends. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, GAAP interest expense was $74 million, capitalized interest was $8 million and scheduled debt principal payments and preferred dividends was $20 million.\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nReconciliation of Net Operating Income (NOI) (in thousands)\n31-Dec-17\n30-Sep-17\n31-Dec-16\n31-Dec-17\n31-Dec-16\nOperating income\n$117,198\n$66,157\n$151,122\n$451,295\n$497,286\nFee income\n(1,386)\n(1,662)\n(1,718)\n(6,372)\n(6,285)\nOther income\n(447)\n(208)\n(33,104)\n(1,031)\n(33,197)\nDepreciation and amortization\n287,973\n199,914\n176,581\n842,464\n699,324\nGeneral and administrative\n44,311\n41,477\n40,481\n156,710\n146,525\nSeverance, equity acceleration, and legal expenses\n1,209\n2,288\n672\n4,731\n6,208\nTransaction expenses\n15,681\n42,809\n8,961\n76,048\n20,491\nImpairment in investments in real estate\n—\n28,992\n—\n28,992\n—\nOther expenses\n2\n3,051\n236\n3,077\n213\nNet Operating Income\n$464,541\n$382,818\n$343,231\n$1,555,914\n$1,330,565\nCash Net Operating Income (Cash NOI)\nNet Operating Income\n$464,541\n$382,818\n$343,231\n$1,555,914\n$1,330,565\nStraight-line rent, net\n(9,331)\n2,436\n(236)\n(4,489)\n1,913\nAbove- and below-market rent amortization\n6,633\n(873)\n(2,048)\n1,840\n(8,313)\nCash Net Operating Income\n$461,843\n$384,381\n$340,947\n$1,553,265\n$1,324,165\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-realty-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300599830.html\nSOURCE Digital Realty",
