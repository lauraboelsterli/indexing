    "text": "ENTERPRISE, Ala., Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Top 20 nationally ranked CPA and advisory firm Carr, Riggs & Ingram LLC (CRI) has increased its investment in Florida, expanding its locations to serve clients there through the merger of Shinn & Company.\n\"Increasing our footprint in Florida has been a part of our growth strategy for some time,\" stated William H. Carr, chairman and managing partner of CRI. \"The Shinn & Company offices in Bradenton and Sarasota coupled with our current Florida offices strategically position our expertise throughout the Gulf Coast making CRI one of the best accounting resources in the state.\"\nAllan D. Koltin, CEO of Koltin Consulting Group, who advised both firms on the merger commented, \"CRI is one of the fastest-growing first-generation firms in the entire country. Their ability to provide all of the resources that a smaller firm wants and needs, but to do it in a very entrepreneurial and culturally compatible environment is what sets them apart.
