    "text": "EWING, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD):\n2017 Fourth Quarter Results 2017 Full Year Results Sales growth +15.3%; Organic +3.4% Gross Margin +110 bps.; Adjusted +50 bps. Operating Margin +150 bps.; Adjusted +90 bps. EPS growth +281%; Adjusted +18% Sales growth +8.1%; Organic +2.7% Gross Margin +30 bps.; Adjusted +10 bps. EPS growth +66%; Adjusted +10% Cash from operations $681 million, +4.0% Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) today announced that full year 2017 EPS increased 66% to $2.90 per share. Full year adjusted EPS increased 10% from $1.77 to $1.94 per share, exceeding the Company’s outlook.\nFull year adjusted EPS excludes a 2017 one-time tax benefit (non-cash) of $272.9 million ($1.06 EPS) to adjust deferred tax accounts and reflect deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), a charge related to the sale of the Brazilian Specialty Products business (-$0.01), a U.K. pension settlement charge (-$0.12) and a tax benefit ($0.03) from a prior year joint venture impairment charge.\nFull year net sales grew 8.1% to $3,776.2 million. Organic sales grew 2.7% driven by volume growth of 5.0%, partially offset by 2.3% from higher promotional investments. Growth in Consumer Products and Specialty Products was 2.5% and 5.3%, respectively.\nMatthew Farrell, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Q4 organic sales growth exceeded our outlook in all three segments. Our Q4 category growth improved sequentially and year over year. The Consumer Domestic business had strong volume growth in Q4 while the promotional environment improved. In the domestic business, 7 out of 11 power brands exceeded category growth in 2017. The investments in our international business, particularly export, are paying off as evidenced by consistent organic growth which we expect to continue. In 2017, we made a great acquisition with Waterpik. Finally, we concluded the year with strong growth in our animal productivity business. We are hitting on all cylinders.”\nFourth Quarter Review\nReported net sales increased $137.1 million or 15.3% to $1,033.1 million. Organic sales growth of 3.4% exceeded the Company’s outlook of 2.5% driven by volume growth of 4.3%. Reported EPS increased 281% to $1.60 per share. Excluding the one-time tax benefit, adjusted EPS increased 18% to $0.52 per share exceeding the Company’s outlook of $0.50 per share.\nConsumer Domestic net sales were $787.8 million, a $92.4 million or 13.3% increase. Organic sales increased 2.7% due to higher volume (+4.0%) offset by price (-1.3%). Growth was led by VITAFUSION adult gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose laundry detergent, SPINBRUSH toothbrushes, ORAJEL oral analgesics, BATISTE dry shampoo and ARM & HAMMER baking soda. Volume growth was driven by key new product launches and personal care sales growth.\nConsumer International net sales were $170.1 million, a $42.5 million or 33.3% increase driven by recent acquisitions and broad based household and personal care sales growth. Organic sales increased 5.8% due to higher volume (+6.0%) offset by price (-0.2%). Sales were driven primarily by STERIMAR and OXICLEAN in the export business, ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada, and STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico.\nSpecialty Products net sales were $75.2 million, a $2.2 million or 3.0% increase. Organic sales increased 5.1% due to higher volume (+2.8%) and commodity pass-through pricing (+2.3%) primarily in the animal productivity business.\nGross margin increased 110 basis points to 46.6%. Excluding the prior year Brazil charge, adjusted gross margin increased 50 basis points. The increase was primarily driven by productivity programs, volume and the positive impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nMarketing expense was $120.6 million, an increase of $4.3 million or 3.7%. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 130 basis points to 11.7% as spending had been shifted to earlier quarters.\nSelling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A) was $146.1 million or 14.1% of net sales, a 90 basis point increase, entirely due to acquisitions and intangible amortization costs.\nIncome from Operations was $214.7 million or 20.8% of net sales.\nThe effective tax rate was -104.2% compared to 34.9% in 2016. The 2017 adjusted tax rate was 33.2% compared to 2016 adjusted rate of 33.9%. 2017 was impacted by the U.S. tax reform while 2016 was impacted by the Brazil impairment charge.\nOperating Cash Flow\nFor the full year 2017, net cash from operating activities was $681.5 million, a $26.2 million increase from the prior year due to higher cash earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital. The working capital increase was primarily driven by higher inventories and deferred compensation payments. Capital expenditures for the full year were $45.0 million, a $4.8 million decrease from the prior year.\nAt December 31, 2017, cash on hand was $278.9 million, while total debt was $2,374.3 million.\n14% Dividend Increase\nThe Company’s Board of Directors today declared an 14% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.19 to $0.2175 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $0.87 per share. This raises the dividend payout from $195 million to approximately $215 million. The quarterly dividend will be payable March 1, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2018. This is the 22nd consecutive year in which the Company has increased the dividend. The Company has paid a regular consecutive quarterly dividend for 117 years.\nMr. Farrell commented, “This action reflects the Company’s desire for stockholders to benefit from our strong growth and is an indication of our confidence in the continuation of the Company’s strong performance. The Company expects to generate significant cash flow over the next three years. Our robust cash flow enables us to deliver higher value directly to our stockholders while maintaining significant financial flexibility.”\nFocus on Asia Pacific\nThe Company has partnered with DKSH to be our master distributor in Southeast Asia. DKSH is the premier distributor in that region. The emphasis will be on Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. DKSH will provide marketing, sales, distribution and logistics services across the four markets for Church & Dwight’s household and personal care products. We are also investing resources for our animal productivity business in Asia Pacific.\n2018 New Products\nMr. Farrell commented, “Innovation continues to be a big driver of our success. In support of our long-term strategy to drive revenue and earnings growth, we are pleased to announce 2018 new product launches in several categories. We are launching ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL lightweight unscented cat litter with guaranteed 7-day odor control which builds on the success of our innovative CLUMP & SEAL franchise. We are expanding our ODOR BLASTERS laundry platform leveraging technology that helps eliminate tough odors. We are introducing new VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS probiotics gummy vitamins supporting digestive health by providing friendly bacteria in a great tasting gummy. WATERPIK is launching a water flosser to restore whiteness while flossing with a new infuser technology. TROJAN is launching NIRVANA, an assortment of sensation condoms celebrating self-expression in an exclusive package design. BATISTE will continue to expand distribution with three unique fragrances leveraging its 2017 growth and #1 U.S. share position.”\nOutlook for 2018\nMr. Farrell stated, “We now expect EPS of $2.24 to $2.28 or adjusted EPS growth of 16%-18% (reported -21% to -23%) in 2018 which reflects continued strong business performance, a lower on-going tax rate, and reinvestment to accelerate growth and other long-term objectives.”\nMr. Farrell continued, “We expect sales growth of approximately 8% and organic sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect gross margin to be flat as productivity programs will offset rising commodity costs and product enhancements. While recent acquisitions require lower levels of marketing, we expect to increase our spending to sustain marketing at approximately 12% of sales. SG&A will increase as a percentage of sales largely due to recent acquisitions which have intangible amortization expenses, integration costs and higher levels of SG&A. The new tax law is expected to reduce our tax burden by lowering our effective tax rate to approximately 24-25% compared to 32% (excluding tax reform) for 2017. Our estimate is based on our current understanding of the new Tax Act which may change as regulations are finalized.\n\"For the first quarter, we expect sales growth of approximately 11% and organic sales growth of approximately 2%. We expect EPS of $0.61 per share, a 19.6% reported increase over last year’s Q1 EPS and a 17.3% adjusted increase over last year’s Q1 EPS.”\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings results on February 5, 2018 at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures. The following non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures provided by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation and items and events being excluded.\nOrganic Sales Growth:\nThis press release provides information regarding organic sales growth, namely net sales growth excluding the effect of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange rate changes. Management believes that the presentation of organic sales growth is useful to investors because it enables them to assess, on a consistent basis, sales trends related to products that were marketed by the Company during the entirety of relevant periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and excluding foreign exchange rate changes that are out of the control of, and do not reflect the performance of, the Company and management.\nAdjusted Gross Margin:\nThis press release provides information regarding adjusted gross margin, namely gross margin excluding the effect of charges taken in 2016 and 2017 related to the Brazil Specialty Products business. We believe that excluding these charges from gross margin provides a useful measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and a more effective comparison to prior periods by excluding significant one-time events.\nAdjusted Operating Income and Margin:\nThis press release provides information regarding adjusted operating income and margin, which exclude the effect of charges taken in 2016 and in 2017 related to the Brazil Specialty Products business and a 2017 settlement charge related to our U.K. pension. We believe that excluding these charges from operating income and margin provides a useful measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance and a more effective comparison to prior periods by excluding significant one-time events.\nAdjusted Tax Rate:\nThis press release provides information regarding the adjusted tax rate which excludes the 2017 impact of the U.S. tax reform and the 2016 impact related to the Brazil Specialty Products business. We believe that excluding these charges from the tax rate provides a useful measure of the Company’s ongoing taxes and a more effective comparison to prior periods excluding significant one-time events.\nAdjusted EPS:\nThis press release also presents adjusted EPS, namely, earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted to exclude significant one-time items that are not indicative of the Company’s period to period performance. We believe that this metric provides investors a useful perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides useful supplemental information regarding our year over year earnings per share growth. Adjusted 2017 EPS excludes a one-time tax benefit to adjust deferred tax accounts and reflect deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings as result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, charges related to the Brazil Specialty Products business, a U.K. pension settlement, a tax benefit from a joint venture impairment. Adjusted EPS for 2016 excludes charges related to the Brazil Specialty Products business.\nCHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC.\nOrganic Sales\nThree Months Ended 12/31/2017 Total Worldwide Consumer Consumer Specialty Company Consumer Domestic International Products Reported Sales Growth 15.3% 16.4% 13.3% 33.3% 3.0% Less: Acquisitions 11.8% 12.3% 10.6% 22.0% 5.9% Add: FX / Other -0.9% -0.8% 0.0% -5.5% 0.0% Divestitures 0.8% -0.1% 0.0% 0.0% 8.0% Organic Sales Growth 3.4% 3.2% 2.7% 5.8% 5.1% Twelve Months Ended 12/31/2017 Total Worldwide Consumer Consumer Specialty Company Consumer Domestic International Products Reported Sales Growth 8.1% 8.5% 6.6% 18.3% 3.5% Less: Acquisitions 6.0% 6.2% 5.2% 11.1% 3.7% Add: FX / Other 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% -0.1% -0.4% Divestitures 0.6% 0.2% 0.0% 0.7% 5.9% Organic Sales Growth 2.7% 2.5% 1.4% 7.8% 5.3% CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC.\nReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures (Unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data) For the quarter ended December 31, 2017\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2016\nChange Adjusted Gross Profit and Margin Reconciliation\nGross Profit and Margin - Reported $ 481.4 46.6 % $ 408.0 45.5 % 110 bps Brazil Charge $ - 0.0 % $ 4.9 0.6 % (60 ) bps Gross Profit and Margin - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 481.4 46.6 % $ 412.9 46.1 % 50 bps Adjusted Operating Profit Margin Reconciliation\nOperating Profit and Margin - Reported $ 214.7 20.8 % $ 173.4 19.3 % 150 bps Brazil Charge $ - 0.0 % $ 4.9 0.6 % (60 ) bps Operating Profit and Margin - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 214.7 20.8 % $ 178.3 19.9 % 90 bps Adjusted Income Tax Expense and Rate Reconciliation\nIncome Tax Expense and Rate - Reported $ (206.9 ) -104.2 % $ 59.1 34.9 % (13,910 ) bps Brazil Charge - No $ Tax Effect $ - 0.0 % $ - -1.0 % 100 bps U.S. TCJA Tax Reform $ 272.9 137.4 % $ - 0.0 % 13,740 bps Income Tax Expense and Rate- Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 66.0 33.2 % $ 59.1 33.9 % (70 ) bps Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation\nDiluted Earnings Per Share - Reported $ 1.60 $ 0.42 281.0 % Brazil Charge $ - $ 0.02 U.S. TCJA Tax Reform $ (1.08 ) $ - Diluted Earnings Per Share - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 0.52 $ 0.44 18.2 % For the year ended December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016\nChange Adjusted Gross Profit and Margin Reconciliation\nGross Profit and Margin - Reported $ 1,729.6 45.8 % $ 1,590.6 45.5 % 30 bps Brazil Charge $ 1.3 0.0 % $ 4.9 0.2 % (20 ) bps Gross Profit and Margin - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1,730.9 45.8 % $ 1,595.5 45.7 % 10 bps Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation\nDiluted Earnings Per Share - Reported $ 2.90 $ 1.75 65.7 % Brazil Charge $ 0.01 $ 0.02 Joint Venture impairment Tax Benefit $ (0.03 ) $ - U.K. Pension Termination $ 0.12 $ - U.S. TCJA Tax Reform $ (1.06 ) $ - Diluted Earnings Per Share - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1.94 $ 1.77 9.6 % CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC.\nReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures (Unaudited)\nReported and Organic Forecasted Sales Reconciliation\nFor the Quarter For the Year Ended Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2018 Reported Sales Growth 11% 8% Less: Acquisitions 9% 4% FX / Other 1% 1% Add: Divestitures 1% 0% Organic Sales Growth 2% 3% For the quarter ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Change Forecasted Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation\nDiluted Earnings Per Share - Reported $ 0.61 $ 0.51 19.6 % Brazil Charge $ - $ 0.01 Diluted Earnings Per Share - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 0.61 $ 0.52 17.3 % Reported Adjusted Income Tax Expense and Rate Reconciliation\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Income Tax Expense and Rate - Reported -7.3 % U.S. TCJA Tax Reform 39.4 % Brazil Charge - No $ Tax Effect 0.1 % U.K. Pension Termination 1.1 % Joint Venture Impairment Tax Benefit -1.1 % Income Tax Expense and Rate - Adjusted (non-GAAP) 32.2 % Forecasted Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change Diluted Earnings Per Share - Reported $ 2.24 - 2.28 $ 2.90 -21% to -23% Brazil Charge $ - $ 0.01 U.K. Pension Settlement Charge $ - $ 0.12 Joint Venture Impairment Tax Benefit $ - $ (0.03 ) U.S. TCJA Tax Reform $ - $ (1.06 ) Diluted Earnings Per Share - Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 2.24 - 2.28 $ 1.94 16% to 18%\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180205005312/en/\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc.\nRick Dierker, 609-806-1200\nChief Financial Officer\nSource: Church & Dwight Co., Inc.",
