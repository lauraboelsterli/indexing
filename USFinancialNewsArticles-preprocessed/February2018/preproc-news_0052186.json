Significant items included:\nFourth Quarter:\nIncome tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 included $4.8 million, or 17 cents per diluted Class A share, related to the Company’s revaluation of its net deferred tax assets pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) that was enacted in December of 2017 Net income, excluding the above-mentioned TCJA impact, was $2.0 million, or 7 cents per diluted Class A share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $5.6 million, or 21 cents per diluted Class A share, for the fourth quarter of 2016 Net premiums earned of $181.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 Net premiums written 1 of $171.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 5.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of organic growth in both personal and commercial lines Combined ratio of 104.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 100.5% for the prior-year fourth quarter\nFull Year:\nNet income, excluding the above-mentioned TCJA impact, was $11.9 million, or 43 cents per diluted Class A share, for the full year of 2017, compared to $30.8 million, or $1.16 per diluted Class A share, for the full year of 2016 Net premiums earned of $702.5 million for the full year of 2017 increased 7.1% compared to the full year of 2016 Net premiums written of $729.1 million for the full year of 2017 increased 6.9% compared to the full year of 2016 Combined ratio of 103.0% for the full year of 2017, compared to 98.1% for the full year of 2016 Book value per share of $15.95 at December 31, 2017, compared to $16.21 at year-end 2016\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nIncome Statement Data Net premiums earned $ 181,060 $ 168,977 7.2 % $ 702,515 $ 656,205 7.1 % Investment income, net 6,142 6,161 -0.3 23,527 22,633 3.9 Net realized investment gains 1,498 321 366.7 5,705 2,525 125.9 Total revenues 190,759 177,196 7.7 739,027 688,423 7.4 Net (loss) income (2,779 ) 5,554 NM 2 7,116 30,801 -76.9 Operating income 1 986 5,345 -81.6 8,103 29,160 -72.2 Annualized return on average equity -2.5 % 5.0 % -7.5 pts 1.6 % 7.3 % -5.7 pts Per Share Data Net (loss) income – Class A (diluted) $ (0.10 ) $ 0.21 NM $ 0.26 $ 1.16 -77.6 % Net (loss) income – Class B (0.10 ) 0.18 NM 0.22 1.06 -79.2 Operating income – Class A (diluted) 0.04 0.20 -80.0 % 0.30 1.10 -72.7 Operating income – Class B 0.03 0.18 -83.3 0.26 1.00 -74.0 Book value 15.95 16.21 -1.6 15.95 16.21 -1.6 1 See the “Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures” section of this release, which defines data that the Company prepares on an accounting basis other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and reconciles such data to GAAP measures.\n2 Not meaningful.\nManagement Commentary\nKevin G. Burke, President and Chief Executive Officer of Donegal Group Inc., stated, “We achieved a 7.1% increase in net premiums earned for the full year of 2017, which contributed to a 7.4% increase in our total revenues. However, throughout the fourth quarter of 2017, we continued to experience higher-than-expected losses within our personal and commercial automobile lines of business, primarily related to increases in claim severity in certain geographic markets. We have already implemented actions, and are taking additional measures, intended to reduce future losses and to increase our premium rates to levels that we expect will result in improved profitability of our automobile lines of business going forward. As we stated throughout 2017, we continue to strive for improved profitability by expanding our utilization of predictive analytical tools and implementing rate increases for those lines in all of the states in which we conduct business.”\nMr. Burke continued, “In spite of the challenges we faced in our automobile lines and the impact of unusually severe weather events, we achieved net income for the full year of 2017 of $11.9 million, excluding the $4.8 million income tax expense impact of the December tax law change. Excellent workers’ compensation results during the year helped to offset the underperformance in our commercial automobile line of business.”\nMr. Burke concluded, “In the coming quarters, the actions we have taken to increase premium rates will begin to add to our revenues, and we will continue to file for rate increases and manage our diversified product lines to achieve solid underwriting performance.”\nJeffrey D. Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, “Our workers’ compensation statutory combined ratio 1 was 80.7% for fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 79.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Large losses in our workers’ compensation line of business, which we define as individual losses in excess of $50,000, increased $5.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. That increase in loss severity was related to a handful of unusual claims and was partially offset by $4.0 million of favorable loss reserve development that resulted from bulk reserve releases and favorable settlements of claims incurred in prior years.”\nMr. Miller concluded, “At December 31, 2017, our book value per share was $15.95, compared to $16.21 at December 31, 2016. The bulk of the decrease relates to the additional income tax expense related to the December 2017 tax law change, which reduced our book value per share by 17 cents. We expect to recoup that impact quickly through reduced income tax expense beginning in 2018.”\nInsurance Operations\nDonegal Group is an insurance holding company whose insurance subsidiaries offer personal and commercial property and casualty lines of insurance in four Mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania), three New England states (Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont), seven Southern states (Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia) and eight Midwestern states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin) . Donegal Mutual Insurance Company and the insurance subsidiaries of Donegal Group conduct business together as the Donegal Insurance Group.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change (dollars in thousands) Net Premiums Earned Personal lines $ 99,106 $ 92,308 7.4 % $ 384,124 $ 361,131 6.4 % Commercial lines 81,954 76,669 6.9 318,391 295,074 7.9 Total net premiums earned $ 181,060 $ 168,977 7.2 % $ 702,515 $ 656,205 7.1 % Net Premiums Written Personal lines: Automobile $ 61,435 $ 55,875 10.0 % $ 255,297 $ 229,789 11.1 % Homeowners 29,904 29,422 1.6 125,054 122,811 1.8 Other 4,765 4,690 1.6 19,672 19,057 3.2 Total personal lines 96,104 89,987 6.8 400,023 371,657 7.6 Commercial lines: Automobile 23,430 20,625 13.6 99,333 87,849 13.1 Workers' compensation 23,891 24,848 (3.9 ) 109,884 108,349 1.4 Commercial multi-peril 25,961 24,225 7.2 110,313 104,728 5.3 Other 2,002 2,091 (4.3 ) 9,586 9,451 1.4 Total commercial lines 75,284 71,789 4.9 329,116 310,377 6.0 Total net premiums written $ 171,388 $ 161,776 5.9 % $ 729,139 $ 682,034 6.9 % The 5.9% increase in the Company’s net premiums written for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, as shown in the table above, represents the combination of 4.9% growth in commercial lines net premiums written and 6.8% growth in personal lines net premiums written. The $9.6 million growth in net premiums written for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 included:\n$3.5 million in commercial lines premiums that the Company attributes primarily to new commercial accounts the Company’s insurance subsidiaries have written throughout their operating regions and a continuation of modest renewal premium increases. $6.1 million in personal lines premiums that the Company attributes to a combination of new policy growth and premium rate increases the Company has implemented over the past four quarters.\nFor the full year of 2017, the Company's net premiums written increased 6.9% compared to the full year of 2016.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its commercial lines and personal lines segments primarily based upon the underwriting results of its insurance subsidiaries as determined under statutory accounting practices. The following table presents comparative details with respect to the Company’s GAAP and statutory combined ratios for the three months and full years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Combined Ratios (Total Lines) Loss ratio (non-weather) 69.0 % 62.8 % 61.1 % 58.8 % Loss ratio (weather-related) 3.0 4.3 8.3 5.7 Expense ratio 31.9 32.4 32.9 33.0 Dividend ratio 0.9 1.0 0.7 0.6 Combined ratio 104.8 % 100.5 % 103.0 % 98.1 % Statutory Combined Ratios Personal lines: Automobile 119.2 % 118.5 % 109.3 % 106.7 % Homeowners 94.2 91.0 109.9 95.5 Other 79.4 84.1 90.8 86.3 Total personal lines 109.3 107.5 108.5 101.8 Commercial lines: Automobile 127.7 122.9 115.0 110.8 Workers' compensation 80.7 79.6 79.0 83.8 Commercial multi-peril 96.9 85.3 96.7 87.7 Total commercial lines 98.8 91.9 93.6 90.7 Total lines 104.6 % 100.4 % 101.7 % 96.8 % Donegal Group’s combined ratio was 104.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 100.5% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase related primarily to increases in loss severity in the Company’s casualty lines of business.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s loss ratio increased to 72.0%, compared to 67.1% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Weather-related losses totaled approximately $5.4 million, or 3.0 percentage points of the Company’s loss ratio, decreasing from the $7.4 million of weather-related losses, or 4.3 percentage points of the Company’s loss ratio, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Weather-related losses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were in line with the previous five-year average for fourth quarter weather-related losses of $5.0 million.\nLarge fire losses, which the Company defines as individual fire losses in excess of $50,000, were $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $7.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Large fire losses represented 4.3 percentage points of the Company’s loss ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 4.4 percentage points of the Company’s loss ratio for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nUnfavorable net development of reserves for losses incurred in prior accident years did not have a material impact on the Company's loss ratios for the fourth quarters and full years of 2017 and 2016. Favorable development of workers’ compensation loss reserves partially offset unfavorable development of commercial multi-peril, personal automobile and commercial automobile loss reserves.\nThe Company’s expense ratio was 31.9% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 32.4% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in the Company's expense ratio reflected lower underwriting-based incentive costs for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company’s expense ratio was 32.9% for the full year of 2017, in line with the 33.0% expense ratio for the full year of 2016.\nInvestment Operations\nDonegal Group’s investment strategy is to generate an appropriate amount of after-tax income on its invested assets while minimizing credit risk through investment in high-quality securities. As a result, the Company had invested 90.0% of its consolidated investment portfolio in diversified, highly rated and marketable fixed-maturity securities at December 31, 2017.\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amount % Amount % (dollars in thousands) Fixed maturities, at carrying value: U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies $ 115,786 11.5 % $ 99,970 10.6 % Obligations of states and political subdivisions 269,698 26.8 308,876 32.7 Corporate securities 213,764 21.2 179,011 18.9 Mortgage-backed securities 306,353 30.5 263,319 27.8 Total fixed maturities 905,601 90.0 851,176 90.0 Equity securities, at fair value 50,445 5.0 47,088 5.0 Investments in affiliates 38,774 3.9 37,885 4.0 Short-term investments, at cost 11,050 1.1 9,371 1.0 Total investments $ 1,005,870 100.0 % $ 945,520 100.0 % Average investment yield 2.4 % 2.5 % Average tax-equivalent investment yield 2.9 % 3.0 % Average fixed-maturity duration (years) 5.2 4.5 Net investment income of $6.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 was comparable to $6.2 million in net investment income for the fourth quarter of 2016. The change in net investment income reflected primarily an increase in average invested assets relative to the prior-year fourth quarter, offset by an increase in expenses the Company allocated to the investment function.\nNet realized investment gains were $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $321,042 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures\nThe Company prepares its consolidated financial statements on the basis of GAAP. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries also prepare financial statements based on statutory accounting principles state insurance regulators prescribe or permit (“SAP”) . In addition to using GAAP-based performance measurements, the Company also utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures that it believes provide value in managing its business and for comparison to the financial results of its peers. These non-GAAP measures are net premiums written, operating income and statutory combined ratio.\nNet premiums written and operating income are non-GAAP financial measures investors in insurance companies commonly use. The Company defines net premiums written as the amount of full-term premiums the Company records for policies effective within a given period less premiums the Company cedes to reinsurers. The Company defines operating income as net income excluding after-tax net realized investment gains or losses. The Company also excluded from its calculation of non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 the deferred income tax expense that resulted from the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA. Because the Company’s calculation of operating income may differ from similar measures other companies use, investors should exercise caution when comparing the Company’s measure of operating income to the measure of other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Company's net premiums earned to the Company's net premiums written for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change (dollars in thousands) Reconciliation of Net Premiums Earned to Net Premiums Written Net premiums earned $ 181,060 $ 168,977 7.2 % $ 702,515 $ 656,205 7.1 % Change in net unearned premiums (9,672 ) (7,201 ) 34.3 % 26,624 25,829 3.1 % Net premiums written $ 171,388 $ 161,776 5.9 % $ 729,139 $ 682,034 6.9 % The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company's net (loss) income to the Company's operating income for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income to Operating Income Net (loss) income $ (2,779 ) $ 5,554 NM $ 7,116 $ 30,801 -76.9 % Realized gains (after tax) (988 ) (209 ) 372.7 % (3,766 ) (1,641 ) 129.5 % Effect of the TCJA at enactment 4,753 - NM 4,753 - NM Operating income $ 986 $ 5,345 -81.6 % $ 8,103 $ 29,160 -72.2 % Per Share Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income to Operating Income Net (loss) income – Class A (diluted) $ (0.10 ) $ 0.21 NM $ 0.26 $ 1.16 -77.6 % Realized gains (after tax) (0.03 ) (0.01 ) 200.0 % (0.13 ) (0.06 ) 116.7 % Effect of the TCJA at enactment 0.17 - NM 0.17 - NM Operating income – Class A $ 0.04 $ 0.20 -80.0 % $ 0.30 $ 1.10 -72.7 % Net (loss) income – Class B $ (0.10 ) $ 0.18 NM $ 0.22 $ 1.06 -79.2 % Realized gains (after tax) (0.03 ) - NM (0.12 ) (0.06 ) 100.0 % Effect of the TCJA at enactment 0.16 - NM 0.16 - NM Operating income – Class B $ 0.03 $ 0.18 -83.3 % $ 0.26 $ 1.00 -74.0 % The statutory combined ratio is a standard non-GAAP measurement of underwriting profitability that is based upon amounts determined under SAP. The statutory combined ratio is the sum of:\nthe statutory loss ratio, which is the ratio of calendar-year incurred losses and loss expenses to premiums earned; the statutory expense ratio, which is the ratio of expenses incurred for net commissions, premium taxes and underwriting expenses to premiums written; and the statutory dividend ratio, which is the ratio of dividends to holders of workers’ compensation policies to premiums earned.\nThe statutory combined ratio does not reflect investment income, federal income taxes or other non-operating income or expense. A statutory combined ratio of less than 100% generally indicates underwriting profitability.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will hold a conference call and webcast on Friday, February 23, 2018, beginning at 11:00 A.M. Eastern Time. You may listen via the Internet by accessing the webcast link on the Company’s website at http://investors.donegalgroup.com .
