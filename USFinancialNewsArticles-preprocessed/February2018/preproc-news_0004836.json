    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 11:01 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago Reuters reporters arrested under Myanmar Secrets Act denied bail Thu Thu Aung , Yimou Lee 6 Min Read \nYANGON (Reuters) - A court in Myanmar declined to grant bail on Thursday for two Reuters journalists accused of violating the country’s Official Secrets Act, although their defense lawyer said information in documents at the center of the case was publicly available. \nLawyer Than Zaw Aung said a police witness had accepted during court proceedings that details in documents found in the possession of the reporters when they were arrested had already been published in newspaper reports. \nWa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in Rakhine state, where an army crackdown on insurgents that started on Aug. 25 has triggered the flight of nearly 690,000 Rohingya Muslims to neighboring Bangladesh, according to the United Nations. \nThe reporters were detained on Dec. 12 after they had been invited to meet police officers over dinner in Yangon. They have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents at a restaurant by two officers they had not met before. \nPolice Major Min Thant, who said he led the team of arresting officers, on Thursday submitted what he said were secret documents seized from the two reporters to the district court in Yangon. \nPolice have previously said the documents contained information on the disposition and operations of security forces in Rakhine’s Maungdaw district. \nIn response, defense attorney Than Zaw Aung submitted copies of several newspaper articles that he said showed the information in the documents was already in the public domain. \n“After Aug. 25, the government explained to the media and diplomats about what happened in Maungdaw,” Than Zaw Aung said. \n(GRAPHIC: Arrested Reuters Reporters - here ) \nHe said afterwards that Major Min Thant had acknowledged that when cross-examined. \n“The witness admitted that the content of the documents they obtained from them is the information that the public already knew. He said the contents are same,” Than Zaw Aung told Reuters. CALLS FOR RELEASE \nAt the end of the day’s proceedings, the court rejected the defense’s application for bail. Reading from the Official Secrets Act, Judge Ye Lwin said the alleged offense was “non-bailable”, without elaborating further. \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the international community “to do whatever it can” to secure the release of two Reuters journalists detained in Myanmar and ensure press freedom in the country, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday. \nReuters President and Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler expressed disappointment at the decision and called for the journalists’ prompt release. \n“It has now been more than fifty days since they were arrested, and they should have the opportunity to be with their families as the hearings continue,” he said in a statement. Detained Reuters journalist Kyaw Soe Oo carries his daughter Moe Thin Wai Zin while being escorted by police during a break at a court hearing in Yangon, Myanmar February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Jorge Silva \n“We believe the court proceedings will demonstrate their innocence and Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo will be able to return to their jobs reporting on events in Myanmar.” \nRelatives of the two reporters were distraught after the decision was announced. \n“I cleaned my house with the hope that he might get bail, just in case,” Pan Ei Mon, Wa Lone’s wife, said, sobbing. “I knew that he wouldn’t get bail but still I cannot handle this.” \nKyaw Soe Oo’s wife, Chit Su Win, held on to him in tears, kissing him as he was being taken back to prison. \nIn the morning, the two journalists had been smiling and appeared in good spirits as they were brought handcuffed to the court from Yangon’s notorious Insein prison. Wa Lone gave the “thumbs up” sign and Kyaw Soe Oo hugged his young daughter.

DIFFERENT LOCATIONS \nUnder cross-examination, police witness Min Thant also said he had updated the paperwork recording Kyaw Soe Oo’s arrest and search to show he was detained outside the restaurant where the reporters say they had a meal with police officers. \nKyaw Soe Oo had refused to sign a form stating he was arrested at an intersection in northern Yangon where police say they had a checkpoint, the officer said. \nThe two journalists said afterwards that Min Thant was not among the officers who arrested them.
