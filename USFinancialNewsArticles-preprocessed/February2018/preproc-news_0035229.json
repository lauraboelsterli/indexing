    "text": "Q4 net sales increased 0.3%; Organic Net Sales (1) decreased 0.6% Q4 net income attributable to common shareholders increased to $8.0 billion; Adjusted EBITDA (1) increased 3.2% on a constant currency basis Q4 diluted EPS increased to $6.52; Adjusted EPS (1) decreased to $0.90 from $0.91 the prior year\nPITTSBURGH & CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC) (“Kraft Heinz” or the “Company”) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\n“There's no question that our financial performance in 2017 did not reflect our progress or potential,” said Kraft Heinz CEO Bernardo Hees. “We made significant improvements in many of our businesses, and were able to accelerate some important business investments at the end of the year. This, together with benefits from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and additional investments in our capabilities, should help further advantage our brands and grow our business in 2018 and beyond.”\n“Since the HR-1 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, we have already taken actions and are accelerating key business initiatives,” said Kraft Heinz CFO David Knopf. “This includes approximately $300 million in strategic investments to build our capabilities, our people skills and our brands; more than $800 million in capital expenditures to improve quality, safety and capacity; as well as $1.3 billion to pre-fund our post-retirement benefit plans.”\nQ4 2017 Financial Summary\nFor the Quarter Ended Year-over-year Change December 30, December 31, Impact of 2017 2016 Actual Currency Organic (in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 6,877 $ 6,857 0.3 % 0.9 pp (0.6 )% Operating income 1,640 1,580 3.8 % Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders 8,003 944 747.8 % Diluted EPS $ 6.52 $ 0.77 746.8 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) 2,015 1,937 4.0 % 0.8 pp Adjusted EPS (1) $ 0.90 $ 0.91 (1.1 )% Net sales were $6.9 billion, up 0.3 percent versus the year-ago period, including a 0.9 percentage point benefit from currency. Organic Net Sales decreased 0.6 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing increased 1.0 percentage points, driven by price increases in Rest of World markets and the United States. Volume/mix decreased 1.6 percentage points, primarily due to lower shipments across several categories, particularly nuts, natural cheese and cold cuts in the United States as well as cheese and coffee in Canada. This was partially offset by ongoing growth in macaroni and cheese in the United States as well as strong growth from condiments and sauces in Europe, China and Indonesia.\nNet income attributable to common shareholders increased to $8.0 billion and diluted EPS increased to $6.52, primarily reflecting benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.0 percent versus the year-ago period to $2.0 billion, including a favorable 0.8 percentage point impact from currency. Excluding the impact of currency, Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to gains from cost savings initiatives (2) , lower overhead costs and favorable pricing, which was partially offset by higher input costs and lower volume/mix. Adjusted EPS decreased 1.1 percent to $0.90, mainly reflecting growth in Adjusted EBITDA that was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate versus the prior year period.\nQ4 2017 Business Segment Highlights United States For the Quarter Ended Year-over-year Change December 30, December 31, Impact of 2017 2016 Actual Currency Organic (in millions) Net sales $ 4,787 $ 4,839 (1.1 )% 0.0 pp (1.1 )% Segment Adjusted EBITDA 1,523 1,502 1.4 % 0.0 pp United States net sales were $4.8 billion, down 1.1 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing increased 0.6 percentage points, reflecting higher pricing in cheese and seasonal items partially offset by distribution-related investments in cold cuts. Volume/mix decreased 1.7 percentage points driven by a combination of distribution losses on Planters in the club channel, lower shipments in natural cheese and service-related losses in cold cuts. This was partially offset by consumption-driven gains in macaroni and cheese as well as innovation-led growth in Lunchables, Capri Sun ready-to-drink beverages, and P3.\nUnited States Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4 percent versus the year-ago period to $1.5 billion, driven by gains from cost savings initiatives, lower overhead costs and higher pricing. This was partially offset by unfavorable key commodity (3) costs, lower volume/mix and increased investments to support strategic growth initiatives.\nCanada\nFor the Quarter Ended Year-over-year Change December 30, December 31, Impact of 2017 2016 Actual Currency Organic (in millions) Net sales $ 591 $ 617 (4.1 )% 4.5 pp (8.6 )% Segment Adjusted EBITDA 162 151 7.1 % 5.2 pp Canada net sales were $591 million, down 4.1 percent versus the year-ago period, including a favorable 4.5 percentage point impact from currency. Organic Net Sales decreased 8.6 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing was flat to the prior year period while volume/mix decreased 8.6 percentage points. The decline in volume/mix primarily reflected lower inventory levels at retail versus the prior year period, the discontinuation of select cheese products and lower shipments of coffee.\nCanada Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.1 percent versus the year-ago period to $162 million, including a favorable 5.2 percentage point impact from currency. Excluding the impact of currency, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.9 percent as gains from cost savings initiatives more than offset the impact of lower volume/mix.\nEurope (4)\nFor the Quarter Ended Year-over-year Change December 30, December 31, Impact of 2017 2016 Actual Currency Organic (in millions) Net sales $ 656 $ 600 9.3 % 8.4 pp 0.9 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA 203 189 7.4 % 8.0 pp Europe net sales were $656 million, up 9.3 percent versus the year-ago period, including an 8.4 percentage point benefit from currency. Organic Net Sales increased 0.9 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing declined 0.9 percentage points, primarily due to changes in promotional spending levels versus the prior year in Italy, the UK and Russia. Volume/mix increased 1.8 percentage points as growth from condiments and sauces in Germany, Spain and France more than offset ongoing consumption weakness in Italy infant nutrition.\nEurope Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.4 percent versus the year-ago period to $203 million, including a positive 8.0 percentage point impact from currency. Excluding the impact of currency, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.6 percentage points as gains from cost savings were more than offset by higher input costs in local currency and weak commercial performance in Italy.\nRest of World (4)(5)\nFor the Quarter Ended Year-over-year Change December 30, December 31, Impact of 2017 2016 Actual Currency Organic (in millions) Net sales $ 843 $ 801 5.2 % (1.8) pp 7.0 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA 142 144 (0.8 )% (4.4) pp Rest of World net sales were $843 million, a 5.2 percent increase versus the year-ago period, despite a negative 1.8 percentage point impact from currency. Organic Net Sales increased 7.0 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing increased 5.7 percentage points, primarily driven by actions to offset higher input costs in local currency. Volume/mix was 1.3 percentage points higher as strong growth in China and Indonesia was partially offset by negative mix impacts in Australia and lower shipments in Brazil.\nRest of World Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.8 percent versus the year-ago period to $142 million, including an unfavorable 4.4 percentage point impact from currency. Excluding the impact of currency, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.6 percentage points, primarily reflecting favorable pricing and lower overhead costs that were partially offset by higher input costs in local currency.\nEnd Notes\n(1) Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

The Company disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement in this press release, except as required by applicable law or regulation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the financial information, the Company has presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) that are presented in this press release. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted earnings per share, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations. Management believes that presenting the Company's non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company's results. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\nOrganic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of acquisitions, currency, divestitures and a 53rd week of shipments. The Company calculates the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela following the Company's June 28, 2015 currency devaluation, for which the Company calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, and provision for/(benefit from) income taxes; in addition to these adjustments, the Company excludes, when they occur, the impacts of depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses; including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits), integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis. The Company calculates the impact of currency on Adjusted EBITDA by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela following the Company's June 28, 2015 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and remeasurement of assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan subsidiary, for which it calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Adjusted EBITDA and Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA are tools that can assist management and investors in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and U.S. Tax Reform, and including when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. The Company believes Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.\nSee the attached schedules for supplemental financial data, which includes the financial information, the non-GAAP financial measures and corresponding reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures for the relevant periods.\nSchedule 1\nThe Kraft Heinz Company Consolidated Statements of Income (in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited) For the Quarter Ended For the Year Ended December 30, December 31, December 30, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (13 weeks) (13 weeks) (52 weeks) (52 weeks) Net sales $ 6,877 $ 6,857 $ 26,232 $ 26,487 Cost of products sold (a) 4,470 4,398 16,529 16,901 Gross profit 2,407 2,459 9,703 9,586 Selling, general and administrative expenses (b) 767 879 2,930 3,444 Operating income 1,640 1,580 6,773 6,142 Interest expense 308 310 1,234 1,134 Other expense/(income), net 1 (10 ) 9 (15 ) Income/(loss) before income taxes 1,331 1,280 5,530 5,023 Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes (6,665 ) 336 (5,460 ) 1,381 Net income/(loss) 7,996 944 10,990 3,642 Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest (7 ) — (9 ) 10 Net income/(loss) attributable to Kraft Heinz 8,003 944 10,999 3,632 Preferred dividends (c) — — — 180 Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 8,003 $ 944 $ 10,999 $ 3,452 Basic shares outstanding 1,219 1,217 1,218 1,217 Diluted shares outstanding 1,228 1,226 1,228 1,226 Per share data applicable to common shareholders: Basic earnings/(loss) per share $ 6.57 $ 0.78 $ 9.03 $ 2.84 Diluted earnings/(loss) per share 6.52 0.77 8.95 2.81 (a) Integration and restructuring expenses recorded in cost of products sold were $200 million for the quarter ended December 30, 2017 ($146 million after-tax), $179 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 ($130 million after-tax), $324 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 ($239 million after-tax), and $711 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 ($491 million after-tax).

(c) On June 7, 2016, the Company redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the Company no longer pays any associated dividends, and there were no such dividend payments in 2017. Prior to the redemption, the Company made cash distributions of $180 million in the second quarter of 2016. The Company's Series A Preferred Stock entitled holders to a 9.00% annual dividend, to be paid in four dividends, in arrears on each March 7, June 7, and December 7, in cash. Concurrent with the declaration of our common stock dividend on December 8, 2015, we also declared and paid the Series A Preferred Stock dividend that would otherwise have been payable on March 7, 2016. Accordingly, there were no cash distributions related to the Series A Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2016, resulting in only one dividend payment in 2016 prior to redemption.\nSchedule 2\nThe
