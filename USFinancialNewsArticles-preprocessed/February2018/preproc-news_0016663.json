The quality of our dialogues with key clients remains very high, which we believe positions us well for future growth.”\n“We are raising our guidance for total revenues and Adjusted EPS growth for fiscal year 2018, driven by the strong event-driven revenues generated in the first half of the year and by the impact of lower tax rates. We are also raising our three year Adjusted EPS growth objective to reflect the positive impact of lower U.S. corporate tax rates,\" Mr. Daly added.\nFiscal Year 2018 Financial Guidance - Revised\nOriginal Revised Recurring fee revenue growth 4-6% 4-6% Total revenue growth 2-3% 2-4% Operating income margin - GAAP ~14% ~14% Adjusted operating income margin - Non-GAAP ~16% ~16% Diluted earnings per share growth* 15-19% 22-26% Adjusted earnings per share growth* - Non-GAAP 15-19% 27-31% Free cash flow* - Non-GAAP $400-450M $500-550M Closed sales $170-210M $170-210M * Revised guidance includes projected $20 million, or $0.17 per share, from excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation\nFinancial Results for the Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018\nRevenues\nRevenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 (\"second quarter of fiscal year 2018\") increased 13% to $1,013 million from $893 million in the prior year period.\nRecurring fee revenues rose 5% to $562 million. The increase in recurring fee revenues reflected organic growth of 4%, including 3% from Net New Business, 1% from our recent acquisitions and 1% from internal growth. Event-driven fee revenues rose 227% to $97 million, primarily from increased mutual fund proxy activity and equity proxy contests. Distribution revenues increased $25 million, or 7%, to $370 million. Changes in foreign currency rates positively impacted revenues by $1 million as compared to the prior year period.\nOperating Income\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2018:\nOperating income was $115 million, an increase of $56 million, or 96%, compared to $59 million for the prior year period. Operating income margin increased to 11.4% compared to 6.6% for the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was $137 million, an increase of $53 million, or 63%, compared to $84 million for the prior year period. Adjusted operating income margin increased to 13.6%, compared to 9.4% for the prior year period. The increases in Operating income margin and Adjusted operating income margin are primarily due to the increase in event-driven fee revenues.\nInterest Expense and Other Non-Operating Expenses\nInterest expense, net for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $10 million, a decrease of less than $1 million, or 4%, compared to $11 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense driven by a more favorable mix of interest rates on outstanding borrowings.\nOther non-operating expenses, net were $1 million, a decrease of $1 million, or 44%, compared to $2 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower expense of $1 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 40.0% compared to 34.1% for the prior year period. During the second quarter, the Company incurred a net total of $16 million (\"the net tax charge\") tax expense resulting from the recent changes to U.S. tax laws. These expenses included $32 million in charges relating to earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and earnings deemed repatriated for U.S. tax purposes. The charges were offset by a $16 million benefit from the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities.\nExcluding that net $16 million charge, the provision for income taxes would have been $25 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and the effective tax rate would have been 24.3%.\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Share\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2018:\nNet earnings increased 106% to $62 million, compared to $30 million for the prior year period. Adjusted net earnings increased 102% to $95 million, compared to $47 million for the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 108% to $0.52, compared to $0.25 for the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share increased 103% to $0.79 from $0.39 for the prior year period.\nSegment and Other Results for Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018\nInvestor Communication Solutions (\"ICS\")\nICS revenues for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $802 million, an increase of $98 million, or 14%, compared to $704 million for the prior year period.\nRecurring fee revenues rose $5 million, or 2%, to $334 million. The increase was primarily driven by Net New Business from increases in revenues from Closed sales and revenues from acquisitions. Event-driven fee revenues increased $68 million, or 227%, to $97 million, the result of increased mutual fund proxy activity and equity proxy contests. Position growth compared to the same period in the prior year, which is a component of internal growth, was 10% for mutual fund interims. Distribution revenues increased $25 million, or 7%, to $370 million.\nEarnings before income taxes for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $72 million, an increase of $52 million, or 255%, compared to $20 million for the prior year period, primarily due to higher event-driven fee revenues and recurring fee revenues. Pre-tax margins increased by 6.1 percentage points to 9.0% from 2.9%.\nGlobal Technology and Operations (\"GTO\")\nGTO revenues for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $228 million, an increase of $21 million, or 10%, compared to $207 million in the prior year period. The increase was attributable to: (i) higher Net New Business from Closed sales (5pts), (ii) internal growth from higher trade and non-trade activity levels (3pts) and (iii) revenue from recent acquisitions (2pts).\nGTO earnings before income taxes were $51 million, an increase of $6 million, or 14%, compared to $44 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher organic revenues. Pre-tax margins increased by 0.8 percentage points to 22.2% from 21.4%\nOther\nOther Pre-tax loss increased 27% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 to $26 million from $21 million in the prior year period.

The increase in recurring fee revenues reflected organic growth of 4%, including 3% from Net New Business, 1% from our recent acquisitions and 1% from internal growth. Event-driven fee revenues rose 133% to $157 million, primarily from increased mutual fund proxy activity and equity proxy contests.\nDistribution revenues increased $2 million, or less than 1%, to $705 million.

The decrease was primarily due to lower expense of $3 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and lower expense of $1 million related to equity method investments.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was 37.0%, compared to 34.4% for the prior year period.

Event-driven fee revenues increased $89 million, or 133%, to $157 million, the result of increased mutual fund proxy activity and equity proxy contests.

Pre-tax margins increased by 3.8 percentage points to 7.7% from 3.9%.\nGlobal Technology and Operations (\"GTO\")\nGTO revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $443 million, an increase of $43 million, or 11%, compared to $400 million in the prior year period. The increase was attributable to: (i) higher Net New Business from Closed sales (5pts), (ii) internal growth from higher trade and non-trade activity levels (3pts) and (iii) revenue from recent acquisitions (3pts).\nGTO earnings before income taxes were $96 million, an increase of $15 million, or 19%, compared to $81 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher organic revenues. Pre-tax margins increased by 1.5 percentage points to 21.6% from 20.1%.\nOther\nOther Pre-tax loss increased 10% in the six months ended December 31, 2017 to $48 million from $44 million in the prior year period. The increased loss was primarily due to higher expense related to corporate charges, including efficiency initiatives.\nChanges in U.S. Federal Tax Laws\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. One of the primary provisions of this new legislation is a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate statutory rate to 21% from 35%. With a fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, Broadridge's full year corporate rate will be subject to a blended rate that includes both the new and old rates. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, the Company will realize the full benefit of the lower corporate statutory rate in its provision for income taxes.\nIn addition, as a result of the changes in tax laws, Broadridge incurred a net charge of $16 million tax expense related to the repatriation of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities. This amount is provisional and represents the Company's best estimate of the expected impact from the tax law changes. The ultimate impact of these changes may differ from Broadridge's estimate due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Company, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, as well as the amount of our fiscal year 2018 earnings before taxes.\nAcquisitions of Summit Financial and Morningstar's 15(c) Board Consulting Services\nOn October 2, 2017, Broadridge acquired Summit Financial Disclosure, LLC (“Summit”). Summit is a full service financial document management solutions provider, including document composition and regulatory filing services. Summit's document composition and regulatory filing services will be integrated with Broadridge's proxy voting and shareholder communications services to create an end-to-end solution that spans the entire corporate disclosure lifecycle from private funding, through capital markets transactions and ongoing communications to regulators and shareholders.\nOn January 2, 2018, Broadridge acquired Morningstar's 15(c) Board Consulting Services unit, which provides materials to the boards of directors and executive teams of mutual funds, helping them meet their 15(c) fiduciary duties to review and approve the fee agreements with each of their investment advisors. The acquisition should strengthen Broadridge's ability to be the most complete source for independent, verifiable data that mutual fund boards of directors rely on to fulfill their governance responsibilities.\nEarnings Conference Call\nAn analyst conference call will be held today, Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

In certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures (“Non-GAAP”). These Non-GAAP measures are Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Operating income margin, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted Earnings per share, and Free cash flow. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results.\nThe Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company’s business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company’s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.\nAdjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings per Share\nThese Non-GAAP measures reflect Operating income, Operating income margin, Net earnings, and Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, Acquisition and Integration Costs and Tax Act items. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property represents non-cash expenses associated with the Company's acquisition activities. Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisition activities. Tax Act items represent the net impact of a U.S. federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the Tax Act.\nWe exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, Acquisition and Integration Costs and Tax Act items from these measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. Management believes these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures as well as Software purchases and capitalized internal use software.\nReconciliations of such Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP can be found in the tables that are part of this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release and other written or oral statements made from time to time by representatives of Broadridge may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
