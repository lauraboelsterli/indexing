    "text": "Of the top 10 places where filers owed the most, here are the top five: San Francisco, California \nPercent of filers who owed: 25 percent Denver, Colorado \nPercent of filers who owed: 22 percent San Diego, California \nPercent of filers who owed: 22 percent Boise, Idaho \nPercent of filers who owed: 21 percent Sacramento, California \nAverage amount owed: $4,243Percent of filers who owed: 22 percent \nAs it turns out, \"Tax season really hurts out west,\" the study notes. \"Eight of the top 10 metros where taxpayers owed the IRS were either on the West Coast, Midwest or Southwest regions. \n\"California metros took three of the top spots,\" it adds, and \"San Francisco tops the list among those who owe taxes.\" A quarter of \"San Francisco taxpayers owes taxes when they file, with an average tax bill of $7,226. That's about 40 percent greater than the national average.\" show chapters 9:55 AM ET Sun, 9 April 2017 | 00:38 \nBut some of that cost might be offset by refunds of state taxes at filing, according to the study, and those are not included in the IRS data. Also, while San Francisco residents who owe may face huge bills, those who do get a refund take home the sixth-largest check, at an average $3,466. \nIf you find that you owe the IRS after filing your taxes — which is a more likely scenario if you itemize your deductions rather than standardize them, the study notes — don't ignore the bill: \"If you fail to pay your tax debt, you could face a host of penalties, from interest charges and late fees to wage garnishment and even liens against your property.\" \nConsidering enrolling in an IRS payment plan if you can't pay the full amount in a lump sum. \nIf you receive a sizable refund, on the other hand, here are some smart things you can do with it.",
