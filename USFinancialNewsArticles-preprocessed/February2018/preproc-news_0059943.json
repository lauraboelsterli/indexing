    "text": "(Adds share movement, analyst Quote: , details of charges incurred)\nBy Chris Thomas\nFeb 28 (Reuters) - Australia’s biggest electronics retailer Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd said first-half net profit fell 19.3 percent, sending its shares sharply lower, on the back of property revaluations and costs related to its non-core dairy business.\nNet profit for the six months to Dec. 31 came in at A$207.7 million ($161.74 million), down from A$257.3 million a year ago.\nRevaluations for Australian investment properties fell by about A$53 million to A$22.8 million. Property prices in Australia’s biggest cities have stalled in recent months after years of double-digit price rises.\nHarvey Norman also flagged impairment losses of A$20.7 million for the write-down of its investment in its dairy farming business.\nHarvey Norman shares fell as much as 14.6 percent to a three-month low in mid-morning trade, their sharpest intraday percentage drop since 1990.\n“The main concern is around the headline profit number that came as a shock and the reaction we’re seeing represents a possible downgrading of Harvey Norman against its peers,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\n“Dairy farming is seen as a hobby project rather than a core business of Harvey Norman, and the fact that it is dragging on the results is seen as a double negative, potentially.”\nCompany-operated sales revenue rose 4.7 percent to A$1.02 billion and franchise sales were up 4.8 percent to A$3 billion.\nThe retailer cut its interim dividend to 12 Australian cents per share from 14 cents per share last year.
