    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - The official North Korea is sending to South Korea’s Winter Olympics closing ceremony, Kim Yong Chol, is the “right person” for inter-Korean and denuclearisation talks, the South’s Yonhap news agency reported on Friday citing a lawmaker briefed by the country’s spy agency.\n“It’s possible to speculate but it cannot be stated clearly that Kim Yong Chol gave the order (to torpedo the Cheonan),” said Kang Seok-ho to Yonhap and other reporters after being briefed by the spy agency.\nKim Yong Chol was previously chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, a top North Korean military intelligence agency, which South Korea blamed for the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy corvette.\nNorth Korea has denied its involvement in the sinking which killed 46 sailors.\nReporting by Christine Kim; Editing by Michael Perry\n ",
