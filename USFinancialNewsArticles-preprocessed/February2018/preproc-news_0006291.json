    "text": "FRANKFURT, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank on Friday posted its third consecutive annual loss in 2017, taking a hit from challenging markets, a drop in investment bank revenue and a U.S. tax reform.\nThe loss of 497 million euros ($621 million) at Germanyâ€™s flagship lender fell short of expectations of analysts, who had forecast a loss of 290 million euros, according to a Reuters poll of nine banks and brokerages.\nThe bank warned last month that it would post a loss for the year. ($1 = 0.8003 euros) (Reporting by Tom Sims; Editing by Maria Sheahan)\n ",
