    "text": "RIDGEFIELD, Conn., Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Chefs’ Warehouse, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHEF), a premier distributor of specialty food products in the United States and Canada, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 29, 2017.\nFinancial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016:\nNet sales for the 13-week quarter ended December 29, 2017 increased 4.1% to $357.1 million from $342.9 million for the 14-week quarter ended December 30, 2016. Net sales, pro-rated for a 13-week fourth quarter in 2016, increased 12.2%. GAAP net income was $9.5 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $9.1 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Modified pro forma net income per diluted share was $0.23 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.18 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA 1 was $22.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $19.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“Our overall customer base remained healthy in the fourth quarter despite the wildfires in California,” said Chris Pappas, chairman and chief executive officer of The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. “We are pleased with our continued strong top-line growth and with our ability to deliver solid gross profit margins despite continued inflation. We continue to provide our customer base with the high value, high service model that makes Chefs the premier partner to independent, chef-driven restaurants.”\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results\nNet sales for the 13-week quarter ended December 29, 2017 increased 4.1% to $357.1 million from $342.9 million for the 14-week quarter ended December 30, 2016. Net sales, pro-rated for a 13-week fourth quarter in 2016, increased 12.2%. On a pro-rated basis, organic growth contributed $21.9 million, or 7.0% to sales growth in the quarter. The remaining sales growth of $16.8 million, or 5.3% resulted from the acquisition of Fells Point Wholesale Meats Inc. on August 25, 2017. Pro-rated for a 13-week fourth quarter in 2016, organic case count grew approximately 4.4% in the Company's specialty division, which net of the expected attrition from the Chicago fold-in acquisition was 5.8%. In addition, growth in unique customers and placements grew 4.0% and 5.3%, respectively, compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the Fells Point acquisition and pro-rated for a 13-week fourth quarter in 2016, pounds sold in the Company's protein division declined 0.6% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the California fires pounds sold rose 0.2%. Estimated inflation was 4.2% and 0.7% in the specialty and protein divisions, respectively.\nGross profit increased approximately 3.3% to $92.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $89.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross profit, pro-rated for a 13-week fourth quarter in 2016, increased 11.2%. Gross profit margin decreased approximately 20 basis points to 25.8% from 26.0%, due in large part to the impact of inflation. Gross margins decreased 190 basis points in the Company's protein division and increased 70 basis points in the Company's specialty division compared to the prior year quarter. As a reminder, gross profit margins in the Protein division rose 84 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016 and protein experienced approximately 2.1% deflation in the same quarter. This compares to a continued inflationary environment in 2017.\nTotal operating expenses increased by approximately 14.9% to $76.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $66.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 21.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 19.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in the Company’s operating expense ratio is due largely to the $8.4 million gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the change in fair value of the Del Monte earn-out liability and lower costs as a percentage of sales related to the company's warehouse facilities and compensation related expenses.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $15.3 million compared to $22.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in operating income was driven primarily by the 2016 Del Monte earn-out liability revaluation, as discussed above, offset by an increase in gross profit. As a percentage of net sales, operating income was 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 6.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal interest expense decreased to $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 due primarily to a reduction in interest rates charged on the Company's outstanding debt.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.5 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.1 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. On December 22, 2017 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was enacted. As a result, a one-time gain of $3.6 million was recorded in net income in the fourth quarter due to the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liability using the new corporate federal income tax rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 was $22.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $19.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, modified pro forma net income 1 was $6.2 million and modified pro forma EPS 1 was $0.23 compared to modified pro forma net income of $4.7 million and modified pro forma EPS of $0.18 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n1 Please see the Consolidated Statements of Operations at the end of this earnings release for a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, modified pro forma net income and modified pro forma EPS to these measures' most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance\nBased on current trends in the business, the Company is providing the following financial guidance for fiscal year 2018:\nNet sales between $1.40 billion and $1.44 billion Gross profit between $355.0 million and $365.0 million Net income between $19.0 million and $22.0 million Net income per diluted share between $0.67 and $0.77 Adjusted EBITDA between $74.0 million and $78.0 million Modified pro forma net income per diluted share between $0.68 and $0.78\nThis guidance is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 28.5% and fully diluted shares of approximately 29.5 million shares. Note that the Company expects the outstanding convertible notes to be dilutive for the full year 2018, and accordingly, those convertible shares are included in the fully diluted share count.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2017 financial results today at 5:00 p.m. EST.
