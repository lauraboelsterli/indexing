These records led us to a 25% increase in our 2017 net income, excluding the non-operating items. For the first time in our history, we exceeded 5,000 units in both homes delivered and new contracts while reaching nearly $2 billion in revenue. Importantly, our revenue and earnings growth resulted from strong performances in many of our homebuilding divisions, combined with another record performance by our financial services business. We also reached our highest year-end backlog level in more than 10 years, with a sales value of $791 million - a 15% increase over 2016.\"\nMr. Schottenstein continued, \"We are excited about our business as we move into 2018. We ended the year with $152 million of cash, no outstanding borrowings under our $475 million unsecured credit facility, shareholders' equity of $747 million and homebuilding debt to capital ratio of 46%. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2018 with our strong year-end backlog and a significant number of planned new community openings.\"\nThe Company will broadcast live its earnings conference call today at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
