(Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $339 million, a decrease of $748 million from the prior quarter primarily due to lower systems and third-party module sales. Systems revenue decreased primarily due to the sale of the California Flats and Cuyama projects in the third quarter. Fourth quarter net sales were slightly lower than guidance as a result of certain foreign project sales that are now expected to be recognized in 2018.\nThe Company reported a fourth quarter GAAP loss per share of $(4.14), compared to GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) of $1.95 in the prior quarter. The loss in the fourth quarter was due primarily to higher tax expense associated with U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017 and the timing of system project sales. Net income decreased compared to the prior quarter primarily as a result of lower net sales, the mix of lower gross profit projects, higher operating expenses and an increase in tax expense. Tax expense in the fourth quarter included a charge of $408 million resulting from U.S. tax reform. This one-time charge includes a tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits and the impact of re-measuring deferred tax assets using the new U.S. statutory corporate tax rate. The cash payment associated with the impact of U.S. tax reform is expected to be approximately $101 million, as a result of utilizing tax credits, and is expected to be paid over the full eight-year period allowed. Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS, adjusted for restructuring and asset impairment charges and the impact of U.S. tax reform, was $(0.25).\nOur evaluation of the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform and the provisional amounts recorded require additional analysis and further interpretation and guidance from government regulators. We expect to continue revising our provisional estimates and making additional estimates throughout the measurement period until the associated accounting is complete. As a result the estimated financial impact of U.S. tax reform on our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results as well as the estimated impact on 2018 Financial Guidance, may differ from current estimates.\nCash and marketable securities at the end of the fourth quarter increased to $3.0 billion from $2.7 billion at the end of the prior quarter. The increase primarily resulted from cash received from projects sold in the prior quarter and third-party module sales. Cash flows from operations were $434 million in the fourth quarter.\n“First Solar delivered another year of solid execution in 2017,” said Mark Widmar, CEO of First Solar. “On the technology front we made significant progress preparing multiple factories for Series 6 manufacturing in 2018, including the production of our first complete module late last year. We had tremendous commercial success as we booked a record 7.7GW DC of new business in 2017, with 1.3GW DC booked so far in 2018. Our financial results were strong with 2017 non-GAAP EPS of $2.59 and operating cash flows in excess of $1.3 billion. We enter 2018 with an unwavering focus on profitably, scaling our modules business, executing on our systems project portfolio, and delivering on our financial commitments.”\nThe Company raised its 2018 revenue, EPS, and net cash guidance for the year as a result of revised systems project sale timing, increased Series 4 production, the expected sale of 8point3 and other developments.\n2018 GAAP Guidance Prior Current Net Sales $2.3B to $2.5B $2.45B to $2.65B Gross Margin % 1 22% to 23% 21.5% to 22.5% Operating Expenses 2 $400M to $410M Unchanged Operating Income $110M to $170M $130M to $180M Earnings per Share $1.25 to $1.75 $1.50 to $1.90 Net Cash Balance 3 $1.6B to $1.8B $2.1B to $2.3B Operating Cash Flow $100M to $200M Unchanged Capital Expenditures $650M to $750M $700M to $800M Shipments 2.7GW to 2.8GW 2.9GW to 3.0GW 1.

We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to adjust for (i) restructuring, asset impairment and related charges primarily associated with the transition from Series 4 to Series 6 production, (ii) the tax effect associated with these items and (iii) the tax effect associated with U.S. tax reform. We believe non-GAAP earnings per share, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, is relevant and useful information to our investors because it provides them with additional information in assessing our financial operating results. Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure in evaluating our operating performance. However, this measure has limitations, including that it excludes the effect of certain changes to our assets and liabilities and certain amounts that we may ultimately have to pay in cash. Accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is the reconciliation of earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share for each period presented (in millions, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet loss $ (432.5 ) Restructuring and asset impairments (1.9 ) Tax effect of restructuring and asset impairments* 0.2 Tax effect of U.S. tax reform $ 408.1 Non-GAAP net loss $ (26.1 ) Weighted-average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 104.4 GAAP loss per share $ (4.14 ) Non-GAAP loss per share $ (0.25 ) * Restructuring treated as a non-discrete item for tax purposes and will be reflected in the effective tax rate over the duration of 2017.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet loss $ (165.6 ) Restructuring and asset impairments 37.2 Tax effect of restructuring and asset impairments (7.1 ) Tax effect of U.S. tax reform $ 408.1 Non-GAAP net income $ 272.6 Weighted-average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 104.3 GAAP loss per share $ (1.59 ) Weighted-average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 105.2 Non-GAAP earnings per share $ 2.59\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222006465/en/\nFirst Solar Investors\nSteve Haymore\n602-414-9315\nstephen.haymore@firstsolar.com\nor\nFirst Solar Media\nSteve Krum\n602-427-3359\nsteve.krum@firstsolar.com\nSource: First Solar, Inc.",
