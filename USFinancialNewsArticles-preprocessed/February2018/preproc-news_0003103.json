Its gainers included Apple, which is to report earnings after the bell, along with Alphabet and Amazon .\nStrong reports from S&P 500 companies so far have pushed up analysts’ fourth-quarter profit growth estimate to 13.7 percent, from 12 percent at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAt 12:32 p.m. ET (1732 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 141.57 points, or 0.54 percent, at 26,290.96, the S&P 500 was up 9.92 points, or 0.35 percent, at 2,833.73 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 18.31 points, or 0.25 percent, at 7,429.79.\nThe market opened lower, a day after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, but raised its inflation outlook for the year and flagged “further gradual” rate hikes. Currently the market has priced in three rate hikes for 2018.\n“There are concerns that rates are moving up and inflation is firming,” said Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank.\n“If inflation moves higher then the chances of a fourth rate hike go up. The market is a lot more jittery and is dissecting every piece of economic data more closely.”\nEconomic data also painted a mixed picture. An unexpected drop in weekly jobless claims pointed to a tight labor market. But while fourth-quarter nonfarm productivity fell for the first time in seven quarters, unit labor costs rose, which could signal faster inflation. Another report showed U.S. factory activity slowed in January as new orders fell.\nThe economic data-heavy week will culminate in the nonfarm payrolls data on Friday.\nBanks, which tend to benefit from higher interest rates gained, leading the financial sector up 0.66 percent.\nOther notable stock movers included eBay, which jumped 14.1 percent after reporting a strong holiday quarter and saying it would eventually move away from PayPal as its main payments partner. PayPal fell 6.2 percent.\nUPS dropped 5.8 percent after the world’s largest package delivery company reported a fourth-quarter net profit that was hurt by additional costs.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,503 to 1,372. On the Nasdaq, 1,511 issues rose and 1,343 fell.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 25 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 60 new highs and 55 new lows.
