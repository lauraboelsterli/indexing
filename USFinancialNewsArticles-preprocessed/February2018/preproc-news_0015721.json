See reconciliations of non-GAAP measures in the financial statements following this release.\nCEO's Remarks:\n\"Our team delivered solid sales growth and great products and service in the fourth quarter, with consumer demand for organic Dave's Killer Bread driving top line growth and offsetting a challenging marketplace for traditional bakery items,\" said Allen Shiver, Flowers Foods president and CEO. \"This was achieved in a quarter where we implemented new roles and responsibilities as part of our revamped organizational model. We also made headway in improving manufacturing efficiencies, lowering selling, distribution and administrative costs, while removing complexity from the business. These improvements, along with lower net interest expense and strong cash flow, enabled us to offset higher workforce-related expenses, reduce debt and support dividend growth.\"\nMr. Shiver continued, \"Our priority in 2018 is to create shareholder value by improving profit margins and driving sustainable sales growth, and we believe the progress we made in 2017 has us well-positioned for a promising 2018. We enter the year with strong momentum in our key initiatives. These efforts are expected to allow us to capture additional cost savings and drive brand growth in underdeveloped segments and geographies with new, innovative products and marketing investments.\"\nFor the 52-week Fiscal 2018, the Company Expects:\nSales in the range of approximately $3.921 billion to $3.982 billion, representing growth of approximately 0.0% to 1.6%. Adjusted diluted EPS in the range of approximately $1.04 to $1.16, representing growth of approximately 16.9% to 30.3%. Adjusted EPS guidance includes approximately $0.15 to $0.17 related to the impact of the lower effective tax rate described below, and excludes consulting and restructuring costs associated with Project Centennial expected to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million.\nThe company's outlook includes the following assumptions:\nSales associated with incremental brand investment relative to fiscal 2017 are expected to primarily benefit results in the second-half of fiscal 2018. Input cost inflation of approximately $40 million is expected to be offset through pricing actions taken in early first quarter fiscal 2018. Depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be in the range of $145 million to $150 million. Net interest expense is forecasted to be in the range of $11 million to $12 million. For the full year, the company expects an effective tax rate of approximately 25% to 26%, reflecting the effects of the new tax law. In the first quarter the tax rate will be approximately 27% due to the expected impact at vesting of stock-based compensation awards. The effective tax rate for the remaining quarters of the year is expected to be approximately 25%. Weighted average diluted share count for the year of approximately 211 million shares. Capital expenditures for the year are estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million.\nUpdate on Strategic Priorities:\nThe company continues to execute on its strategic priorities established under Project Centennial. During the fourth quarter, Flowers began transitioning to the new organizational model that includes enhanced focus on brand growth and operating efficiency. The company expects the organizational model to be fully implemented in fiscal 2019. The company also finalized its fiscal 2018 brand investment plans, which includes new internal capabilities intended to deliver innovative products that offer consumers a meaningful point of difference.\nAs part of Project Centennial, the company achieved gross cost savings of $32 million in fiscal 2017, primarily from reductions in spending on purchased goods and services (PG&S). The company is targeting additional gross savings in fiscal 2018 of $38 million to $48 million. This target reflects further savings through PG&S, as well as from a more efficient and productive organizational structure, continuous improvement, supply chain optimization, and improved ordering and stale reduction initiatives.\nMatters Affecting Comparability:\nReconciliation of Earnings per Share to Adjusted Earnings per Share\nFor the 12 Weeks Ended\nFor the 52 Weeks Ended\nDec. 30, 2017\nDec. 31, 2016\nDec. 30, 2017\nDec. 31, 2016\nNet income per diluted common share\n$ 0.37\n$ 0.06\n$ 0.71\n$ 0.78\nGain on divestiture\n-\n-\n(0.09)\n-\nRestructuring and related impairment charges\n0.01\n-\n0.30\n-\nProject Centennial consulting costs\n0.02\n0.01\n0.11\n0.02\nImpairment of assets (unrelated to restructuring)\n-\n0.07\n-\n0.07\nLease terminations/legal settlement/extinguishment loss\n-\n0.03\n0.02\n0.04\nPension plan settlement loss\n-\n-\n0.01\n0.02\nMulti-employer pension plan withdrawal costs\n-\n-\n0.05\n-\nImpact of tax reform\n(0.23)\n-\n(0.23)\n-\nWindfall tax benefit from stock option exercises\n(0.01)\n-\n(0.01)\n-\nAdjusted net income per diluted common share\n$ 0.17\n$ 0.17\n$ 0.89\n$ 0.93\nCertain amounts may not add due to rounding.\nConsolidated Fourth Quarter 2017 Summary\nCompared to the prior year fourth quarter where applicable\nSales increased 0.6% to $873.6 million. Percentage point change in sales attributed to: Pricing/mix: 1.1% Volume: 0.0% Divestiture: -0.5% Net income increased $65.5 million to $78.5 million. Excluding matters affecting comparability, adjusted net income decreased 2.1% to $35.8 million. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the company recorded an estimated tax benefit of $48.2 million related to the revaluation of the company's net deferred tax liability. Operating income increased $25.2 million to $46.4 million. Excluding matters affecting comparability, adjusted operating income decreased 1.3% to $58.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.7% to $91.0 million, or 10.4% of sales, a 10 basis point decrease. Materials, supplies, labor and other production costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were 52.3% of sales, up 40 basis points, primarily driven by workforce-related costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies. Selling, distribution and administrative (SD&A) expenses were 38.1% of sales, a 100 basis point decrease, driven primarily by lower workforce-related costs, and reduced legal settlement charges, partially offset by higher distributor distribution fees due to a larger portion of sales being sold by independent distributors, and incremental Project Centennial consulting costs. Restructuring charges of $3.6 million and a pension plan settlement loss of $1.6 million in the current quarter, compared to $24.9 million of asset impairments and a $0.2 million pension plan settlement loss in in the prior year quarter. Depreciation and amortization (D&A) expenses were $32.4 million, 3.7% of sales, flat when compared to the prior year quarter.\nContinued sales growth from branded organic products and expansion markets, resulted in the sales increase, partially offset by the divestiture of a mix manufacturing business in January 2017 and by a competitive marketplace and cycling of certain promotions in the prior year quarter. Sales of Dave's Killer Bread (DKB) branded products continue to increase, in part due to the introduction of breakfast items in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOn a consolidated basis, branded retail sales increased 1.4% to $507.0 million and store branded retail sales decreased 0.6% to $127.4 million, while non-retail and other sales decreased 0.5% to $239.2 million. The sales increase in the branded retail category resulted primarily from increased sales of branded organic products, partially offset by volume declines in branded loaf breads, snack cakes, and buns and rolls. Store branded retail sales decreased primarily as a result of volume declines in loaf breads, offset partially by increased sales of buns and rolls. The impact of the mix manufacturing divestiture in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 somewhat offset by volume growth in vending and foodservice sales, principally resulted in the decrease of non-retail and other sales, which includes contract manufacturing, vending and foodservice.\nDSD Segment Fourth Quarter Summary\nCompared to the prior year fourth quarter where applicable\nSales increased 1.1% to $738.6 million. Percentage point change in sales attributed to: Pricing/mix: 3.4% Volume: -2.3% Operating income increased $33.9 million to $56.0 million. Excluding matters affecting comparability, adjusted operating income increased 8.2% to $60.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.4% to $88.6 million, or 12.0% of sales, a 60 basis point increase. Materials, supplies, labor and other production costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were 48.4% of segment sales, up 20 basis points, primarily driven by higher workforce-related costs, partially offset by improved price/mix. SD&A expenses were 39.6% of segment sales, an 80 basis point decrease. This decrease was driven primarily by lower workforce-related costs, and reduced legal settlement charges, partially offset by higher distribution fees due to a larger portion of sales being sold by independent distributors. Restructuring charges were $3.4 million. Prior year asset impairment charges were $24.9 million. D&A expenses were $27.8 million, 3.8% of sales, a 10 basis point increase.\nDSD segment branded retail sales increased 1.6% to $474.7 million and store branded retail sales decreased 1.6% to $102.7 million, while non-retail and other sales increased 1.5% to $161.2 million.\nBranded retail sales increased due to significant sales growth for branded organic products, partially offset by volume declines in branded loaf breads, snack cakes, and buns and rolls. Sales of DKB branded products continue to increase, driven by volume gains and the addition of DKB breakfast items in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. A competitive marketplace and the cycling of certain promotions in the prior year drove the declines in other branded products. Store branded retail sales were down primarily due to soft volumes for loaf breads. Increased sales to fast food and institutional customers drove the increase in non-retail and other sales.\nWarehouse Segment Fourth Quarter Summary\nCompared to the prior year fourth quarter where applicable\nSales decreased 2.3% to $135.1 million. Percentage point change in sales attributed to: Pricing/mix: -5.6% Volume: 6.5% Divestiture: -3.2% Operating income decreased $4.2 million to $7.5 million. Excluding matters affecting comparability, adjusted operating income decreased $4.1 million to $7.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 24.5% to $12.4 million, or 9.2% of sales, a 260 basis point decline. Materials, supplies, labor and other production costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were 73.5% of segment sales, up 240 basis points, primarily driven by increased production for the DSD segment, higher workforce-related costs, and higher freight costs. SD&A expenses were 17.3% of segment sales, a 20 basis point increase. This increase was primarily driven by significantly lower sales that spread the costs over a smaller sales base, and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. D&A expenses were $4.8 million, 3.6% of sales, a 20 basis point increase.\nBranded retail sales declined 1.4% to $32.3 million and store branded retail sales increased 3.9% to $24.7 million, while non-retail and other sales decreased 4.5% to $78.0 million. Branded retail sales decreased largely due to a decline in warehouse-delivered branded organic bread, which was partially offset by increased sales of branded snack cakes. Volume increases in store branded items due to a new customer resulted in the increase in store branded retail sales. The decrease in non-retail and other sales, which include contract manufacturing, vending and foodservice, was due primarily to the impact of the mix manufacturing divestiture, and to a lesser extent, lost contract manufacturing business, partially offset by growth in vending volume.\nUnallocated Corporate Expense Fourth Quarter Summary\nNote: Comparisons are to consolidated sales\nSD&A expenses increased 40 basis points to 1.8% of consolidated sales, including incremental Project Centennial consulting costs and pension settlement losses totaling $3.1 million, or 30 basis points as a percent of sales. Restructuring charges and a pension plan settlement loss were $1.8 million in the current quarter compared to a $0.2 million pension plan settlement loss in the prior year quarter.\nCash Flow, Capital Allocation, and Capital Return\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, cash flow from operating activities was $73.4 million, capital expenditures were $24.0 million, and dividends paid were $35.8 million. During the quarter, the company had a net decrease in debt and capital lease obligations of $22.8 million.\nThe company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the quarter. There are 6.6 million shares remaining under the company's current share repurchase plan. As in the past, the company expects to continue to make opportunistic share repurchases under this plan.\nConference Call\nFlowers Foods will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern) on February 8, 2018.

Other factors that may cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained in this release and that may affect the company's prospects in general include, but are not limited to, (a) general economic and business conditions and the competitive conditions in the baked foods industry, including promotional and price competition, (b) changes in consumer demand for our products, including changes in consumer behavior, trends and preferences, including health and whole grain trends, and the movement toward more inexpensive store-branded products, (c) the success of productivity improvements and new product introductions, (d) a significant reduction in business with any of our major customers including a reduction from adverse developments in any of our customer's business, (e) fluctuations in commodity pricing, (f) energy and raw material costs and availability and hedging and counterparty risk, (g) our ability to fully integrate recent acquisitions into our business, (h) our ability to achieve cash flow from capital expenditures and acquisitions and the availability of new acquisitions that build shareholder value, (i) our ability to successfully implement our business strategies, including those strategies the company has initiated under Project Centennial, which may involve, among other things, the integration of recent acquisitions or the acquisition or disposition of assets at presently targeted values, the deployment of new systems and technology and an enhanced organizational structure, (j) consolidation within the baking industry and related industries, (k) disruptions in our direct-store delivery system, including litigation or an adverse ruling from a court or regulatory or government body that could affect the independent contractor classification of our independent distributors, (l) increasing legal complexity and legal proceedings that we are or may become subject to, (m) product recalls or safety concerns related to our products, and (n) the failure of our information technology systems to perform adequately, including any interruptions, intrusions or security breaches of such systems. The foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors, nor necessarily present them in order of importance. In addition, you should consult other public disclosures made by the company, including the risk factors included in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and disclosures made in other filings with the SEC and company press releases, for other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the company. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, as they speak only as of the date made and are inherently uncertain. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update such statements, except as required by law.\nInformation Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). However, from time to time, the company may present in its public statements, press releases and SEC filings, non-GAAP financial measures such as, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income by segment, adjusted EBIT by segment, adjusted EPS, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted selling, distribution and administrative expenses (SD&A), gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization and the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA. The reconciliations attached provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this presentation or release to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. The company's definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. These non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe company defines EBITDA as earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and income attributable to non-controlling interest. The company believes that EBITDA is a useful tool for managing the operations of its business and is an indicator of the company's ability to incur and service indebtedness and generate free cash flow. EBITDA is used as the primary performance measure in the company's 2014 Omnibus Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of our credit facility, EBITDA is used to determine the company's compliance with certain financial covenants. The company also believes that EBITDA measures are commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as measures of a company's operating performance and debt servicing ability because EBITDA measures assist in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation or amortization, which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods and non-operating factors (such as historical cost). EBITDA is also a widely-accepted financial indicator of a company's ability to incur and service indebtedness.\nEBITDA should not be considered an alternative to (a) income from operations or net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance; (b) cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the company's ability to meet its cash needs; or (c) any other indicator of performance or liquidity that has been determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe company defines adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income by segment, adjusted EBIT by segment, adjusted EPS, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted selling, distribution and administrative expenses (SD&A), respectively, excluding the impact of asset impairment charges, Project Centennial consulting costs, lease terminations and legal settlements, acquisition-related costs, and pension plan settlements. Adjusted income tax expense also excludes the impact of tax reform.The company believes that these measures, when considered together with its GAAP financial results, provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of its business operating results, including underlying trends, by excluding the effects of certain charges.\nNet debt to EBITDA is used as a measure of financial leverage employed by the company. Gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization is used as a performance measure to provide additional transparent information regarding our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis. Changes in depreciation and amortization are separately discussed and include depreciation and amortization for materials, supplies, labor and other production costs and operating activities.\nPresentation of gross margin includes depreciation and amortization in the materials, supplies, labor and other production costs according to GAAP. Our method of presenting gross margin excludes the depreciation and amortization components, as discussed above.\nThe reconciliations attached provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this presentation or release to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.\nFlowers Foods, Inc.\nConsolidated Statement of Operations\n(000's omitted, except per share data)\nFor the 12 Week\nPeriod
