    "text": "IRVING, Texas, Energy Hunter Resources, Inc., an exploration and production company headquartered in Irving, Texas ( www.energyhunter.energy ), today announced that it has promoted H. C. Kip Ferguson III to President & Chief Operating Officer.\nGary C. Evans, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Energy Hunter Resources said, \"Kip Ferguson and I have worked closely together for more than eight years. While a geologist by training, Kip has a well-rounded knowledge of all aspects of our business. We have drilled many successful horizontal wells together. At Magnum Hunter Resources, he was President of our Eagle Ford Shale division. He was in charge of the project development and oversaw the execution of our day-to-day drilling, completion and production activities in this South Texas region. The drilling of approximately 60 horizontal wells and the ultimate sale of the assets for $401 million in cash provided an excellent return for our shareholders.\"\nEvans continued, \"At Energy Hunter Kip has played an instrumental role in assisting me in building our lease acreage positions in both the San Andres and Eagle Ford oil plays. We are continuing our acquisition efforts, predominantly in the Permian Basin, and have begun development of our horizontal drilling initiatives. Our first new high impact horizontal well went on production January 1 st in the Eagle Ford shale. It is my pleasure to announce Kip's promotion to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of Energy Hunter Resources, which is so well deserved.\"\nPrior to joining Energy Hunter Kip Ferguson served as Executive Vice President of Exploration at Magnum Hunter Resources. At Magnum Hunter Resources, Ferguson was President of the company's Eagle Ford Shale division where his actions successfully contributed to the sale of the division to Penn Virginia for $401 million; generating an approximately 80 percent Internal Rate of Return for our shareholders. Prior to Magnum Hunter Resources, Kip Ferguson was President and Director of Sharon Resources, Inc. and Sharon Energy Ltd., which was subsequently acquired by Magnum Hunter in 2009. Ferguson, a third generation geologist, earned a Bachelor's degree in Geology from the University of Texas at Austin. He is a member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Society of Petroleum Engineers, Independent Petroleum Association of America and the Houston Geological Society.\nAbout Energy Hunter Resources, Inc.\nEnergy Hunter Resources, Inc. is an independent oil company headquartered in Irving, Texas with a mission to own and operate properties within some of the most prolific resource plays in the United States.
