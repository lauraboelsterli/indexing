    "text": "(Adds context on Hikma’s struggling generics business, shares)\nFeb 20 (Reuters) - Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc named former Teva Pharmaceutical executive Sigurdur Olafsson as its CEO, as the Jordan-based drugmaker looks to improve its struggling generics business.\nHikma said its current chairman and CEO, Said Darwazah, would become executive chairman.\nShares of Hikma rose as much as 5 percent in early trading on the London Stock Exchange.\nOlafsson’s appointment comes at a time when Hikma is facing higher price erosion levels than the rest of the industry that prompted it to lower the revenue guidance for its generics business twice last year.\nHikma, which makes and markets branded and non-branded generic and injectable drugs, has been re-negotiating contracts with suppliers to cut costs to boost profitability at the division.\nOlafsson served as the chief executive of the global generics business of Israel-based Teva, the world’s biggest generics drugmaker, from 2014 to 2016.
