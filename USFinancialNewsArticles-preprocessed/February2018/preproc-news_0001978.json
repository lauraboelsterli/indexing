All figures have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard (\"IFRS\"), and are presented in nominal million Mexican Pesos (\"$\").\nHIGHLIGHTS- 2017\nNet sales increased 5.9% in 4Q17 and 11.6% in year 2017. EBITDA margin was 7.1% for 4Q17 and 10.9% for the whole year. Earnings per basic and diluted share totaled $2.46 for 4Q17 and $8.07 for the year.\nCEO COMMENTS\nMr. Rodolfo Ramos Arvizu, Chief Executive Officer of Bachoco, stated \"With 4Q17 we ended a year of excellent results with historically high; net sales, EBITDA and earnings per share, among others. All of this, despite the challenges we faced in the fourth quarter.\nIn Mexico, during the first part of the quarter, we observed oversupply conditions in the chicken industry, leading to lower prices than we expected. However, by the end of the quarter, we observed a recovery in the demand and a better balance between supply and demand.\nIn the US, we observed similar prices to 4Q16 for poultry, despite an industry growing at slightly higher rates than normalized levels during the fourth quarter.\nWe reached an increase in total sales of 5.9% in 4Q17 when compared to 4Q16, and an EBITDA of $1,074.3 million, lower than the EBITDA of the same quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter, our EBITDA margin was 7.1% and our earnings per basic and diluted share were $2.46\nWe continue working on the integration of our recent acquisitions, Albertville Quality Foods and La Perla, in order to capitalize the synergies as fast as we can.\nFor the full year of 2017, we increased total sales by 11.6%, our EBITDA grew 9.4%, and earnings per share of $8.07; the highest amounts in the company's history.\nWe continued with our growth plans as our CAPEX reached $3,479.3 million for the year, including acquisitions.\nOur financial structure continued strong as we ended the quarter with a net cash of $11,979.7 million, which will allow us to continue supporting our growth plans\".\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following financial information is expressed in millions of nominal pesos, except for amounts per share or per ADR, with comparative figures for the same period in 2016.\nQUARTERLY RESULTS\nNET SALES BY GEOGRAPHY\nIn millions of pesos\n4Q17\n4Q16\nChange\n$\n$\n$\n%\nNet sales\n15,039.1\n14,206.6\n832.6\n5.9\nNet sales in Mexico\n10,268.4\n10,266.9\n1.4\n0.0\nNet sales in the U.S.\n4,770.7\n3,939.6\n831.1\n21.1\nNET SALES BY SEGMENT\nIn millions of pesos\n4Q17\n4Q16\nChange\n$\n$\n$\n%\nNet sales\n15,039.1\n14,206.6\n832.6\n5.9\nPoultry\n13,562.0\n12,734.2\n827.8\n6.5\nOther\n1,477.1\n1,472.4\n4.8\n0.3\nNET VOLUME SOLD BY SEGMENT\nIn tons\nChange\n4Q17\n4Q16\nVolume\n%\nTotal sales volume:\n585,965\n550,991\n34,974\n6.3\nPoultry\n461,653\n442,246\n19,406\n4.4\nOthers\n124,312\n108,744\n15,568\n14.3\nThe Company's 4Q17 net sales totaled $15,039.1 million, $832.6 million or 5.9% more than $14,206.6 million reported in 4Q16. The increase is a mainly result of more volume sold when compared to 4Q16.\nIn 4Q17, sales of our U.S. operations represented 31.7% of our total sales; this compares with 27.7% it represented in 4Q16. Most of the increase comes from the integration of Albertville Quality Foods (AQF).\nGROSS PROFIT\nIn millions of pesos\n4Q17\n4Q16\nChange\n$\n$\n$\n%\nCost of sales\n12,808.8\n11,885.9\n923\n7.8\nGross profit\n2,230.4\n2,320.7\n(90)\n(3.9)\nGross margin\n14.8%\n16.3%\n-\n-\nIn 4Q17, the cost of sales totaled $12,808.8 million, $923 million or 7.8% higher than $11,885.9 million reported in 4Q16. The increase in cost of sales is mainly attributed to higher volume sold and a mix effect, due to higher percentage of our US operation as we integrated AQF.\nThe gross profit was $2,30.4 million with a gross margin of 14.8% in 4Q17. The gross profit is higher than the $2,320.7 million reported in 4Q16 and lower than the gross margin of 16.3% reported in 4Q16.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\")\nIn millions of pesos\n4Q17\n4Q16\nChange\n$\n$\n$\n%\nTotal SG&A\n1,510.2\n1,321.9\n188.3\n14.2\nTotal SG&A expenses in 4Q17 were $1,510.2 million, $188.3 million or 14.2% more than the $1,321.9 million reported in 4Q16, this increase is due mainly to higher volume sold and one-time expenses in our US operation as part of the AQF integration process.
