    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Multiple buyers are interested in buying Turk Telekom’s stake, Turkey’s Garanti Bank chief executive Ali Fuat Erbil said on Friday, after Oger Telecom failed to make three payment on a $4.75 billion loan it secured to acquire 55 percent stake in Turkish fixed-line operator.\nIn an annual evaluation meeting in Istanbul, CEO Erbil said that he expects the shareholding would become clear in the second half of this year.\nGaranti, which has extended some $1 billion to the company, said last month that it reclassified Oger Telecom’s debt as “closely watched” as of the end of 2017.\nReporting by Ebru Tuncay; Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
