    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Hornet , the world's premier gay social network and LGBTQ media company, announced the acquisition of the domain Hornet.com . The domain will allow users access to Hornet's vast social network and original editorial content with a newly designed website â€“ restyled for a seamless, user-friendly experience. Hornet.com will replace the existing Hornetapp.com and provide a one-stop destination for users to both login to their accounts and stay up-to-date on the latest news and headlines that are important to the LGBTQ community.\nAs both a worldwide social network that allows users to follow each other via profiles and social feeds and as a digital magazine featuring original content by award-winning LGBTQ journalists, Hornet is differentiating itself as a leader in the media landscape. Under the newly revamped Hornet.com , users will have quick and easy access to breaking news, pop culture headlines and a curated LGBTQ guide to cities around the world. These features will continue to be available in the Hornet app as well, where users can make meaningful connections with guys who have similar interests. Furthering what it means to be an international LGBTQ media company, Hornet's global editorial team offers content in several languages including English, French, Spanish, Russian, Thai, Portuguese, Chinese and others.\n\"Hornet has been listening and taking feedback from our online community. What we heard is that they want media companies that speak directly to them, while also giving them a platform to have their own voice to share opinions and interests,\" said Sean Howell, Hornet's president and co-founder. \"Bringing editorial and a social network under one roof is a new direction for media, and we are excited to be at the forefront. We expect to see others continue to follow our direction.\"\nWith the newly acquired domain, Hornet is moving away from its older layout and continuing to position itself as a leader in LGBTQ media. Hornet now makes it easy to quickly gather news from around the world, while still maintaining the primary social media function that made it a global gay phenomenon. Guys can easily connect over commonly shared interests and stay in touch with their followers via comprehensive profiles.\n\"The Hornet.com domain name delivers greater accessibility and new user-friendly features that the gay community craves--while unifying our brand presence and leadership position in LGBTQ media,\" said Matthew Smith, Hornet's SVP of Global Sales. \"This immediately amplifies our platform for creating head-of-class brand partnerships.\"\nHornet's free social network app is available on",
