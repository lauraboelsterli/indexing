    "text": "(Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) said on Thursday it was vigorously contesting the $2.3 billion tax and penalties for certain years proposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and that the case would not have a material impact on its finances and operations.\nLast year, the IRS challenged the company’s taxes for 2007-2012 and federal law enforcement officials searched three of its facilities in March in connection with an investigation related to profits earned by a Swiss parts subsidiary, Caterpillar SARL, or CSARL.\nThat subsidiary was the subject of a 2014 U.S. Senate committee report that concluded Caterpillar shifted billions in profits abroad and had $2.4 billion in taxes deferred or avoided from 2012.\nIn a regulatory filing, the heavy machinery manufacturer said the relevant transactions were in compliance with the law. ( bit.ly/2nZbqqH )\n“We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations,” Caterpillar said in the filing.\nThe U.S. tax overhaul signed into law in December has raised hopes of a settlement with the government. Chief Executive James Umpleby last month said the company was cooperating with authorities and hopeful of a quick resolution.\nThe company’s shares were up more than 1 percent at $159.31 in afternoon trading.\nReporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Meredith Mazzilli\n ",
