    "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, doubled its return on investment in 2017, beating its benchmark, as strong global stock markets boosted the value of the portfolio, it said on Tuesday.\nThe fund earned a return of 13.7 percent in 2017, up from 6.9 percent in 2016.\n“The fund’s cumulative return since inception has passed 4,000 billion Norwegian crowns ($511 billion). One out of four crowns of return was generated in 2017, after a very strong year for the fund,” CEO Yngve Slyngstad said in a statement.\n“Again, our equity investments returned strongest with a return close to 20 percent.”\nThe fund invests the proceeds from Norway’s oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad.\nSlideshow (2 Images) It is one of the world’s largest shareholders, with investments in around 9,100 companies worldwide, equivalent to 1.4 percent of listed companies globally.\nThe fund’s biggest single company investment at the end of 2017 was in Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), worth 66 billion crowns, ahead of Nestle ( NESN.S ) at 51 billion and Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) at 50 billion.\nApple was also the biggest single contributor to the fund’s returns in 2017, ahead of Chinese tech group Tencent Holdings ( 0700.HK ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ).\nThe fund’s size is equivalent to $200,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child.\nThe government withdrew 61 billion Norwegian crowns during 2017 to pay for public expenses, compared with 101 billion crowns in 2016.\nCEO Yngve Slyngstad earned an annual salary of 6.7 million crowns. His chief investment officer for equity strategies, Petter Johnsen, earned more, with 7.4 million crowns. By comparison, the country’s prime minister, Erna Solberg, earned 1.6 million crowns.\nRelated Coverage Expect big swings in value of Norway's wealth fund ahead: CEO Editing by Terje Solsvik, editing by Louise Heavens\n ",
