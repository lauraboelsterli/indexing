    "text": "February 14, 2018 / 9:54 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Man dies after vehicles collide at London's Heathrow Airport Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - A man died after two vehicles collided on the airfield at London’s Heathrow Airport, Europe’s biggest hub, police said on Wednesday. “One male, is believed to have sustained a broken shoulder; his injuries are not life-threatening or life-changing,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. “Another male, aged in his 40s, was taken to a west London hospital with serious injuries. He has since died.” Some passengers had to disembark from a plane due to the incident, a spokeswoman for the airport said. “We will be fully cooperating with the police in the investigation which will follow,” Heathrow said in a statement. The airport was not closed as a result of the accident. Reporting by Costas Pitas; Editing by William Schomberg",
