    "text": "February 4, 2018 / 7:09 PM / Updated an hour ago Pique defends celebration after 'special' goal against Espanyol Rik Sharma 3 Min Read \nBARCELONA (Reuters) - Gerard Pique said shushing Espanyol fans with a finger to his lips after scoring was the least he could have done while celebrating the goal which earned Barcelona a 1-1 draw in La Liga on Sunday. \nThe defender headed home Lionel Messi’s free kick in the 82nd minute to preserve the league leaders’ 22-game unbeaten run, a club record, tying a spiky derby clash at the waterlogged RCDE Stadium in Cornella. \nPique had been berated throughout by Espanyol fans for his comments after Barcelona eliminated their local rivals in the King’s Cup quarter-finals in January. \nA long-time hate figure for Espanyol supporters, Pique stoked the fire by referring to them as ‘Espanyol de Cornella’ multiple times. \nEspanyol moved to their new stadium in the town near Barcelona in 2009 after previously playing at the Olympic Stadium in Catalonia’s capital. \n”They are from Cornella, like I said the other day,“ said Pique. ”I know it hurt them and I used sarcasm to annoy them. \n“Saying they play in Cornella is not disrespectful, it’s a fact. They complain about that and report me, but they don’t investigate insults towards my family. That is disrespectful. Telling them to be quiet was the least I could do.” Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Espanyol vs FC Barcelona - RCDE Stadium, Barcelona, Spain - February 4, 2018 Barcelona’s Luis Suarez in action with Espanyol’s David Lopez REUTERS/Albert Gea \nEspanyol supporters had hurled abuse at the defender and his pop star partner Shakira during the King’s Cup first leg at Cornella, which the hosts won 1-0. \nAfter Pique scored on Sunday he ran off in celebration before approaching a stand packed with Espanyol supporters and putting his finger to his lips.

I know a lot of Espanyol fans that are good people but those at the top don’t report those insulting chants. \n“We are people and we have a limit. It’s a derby game and it is what it is.” \nEspanyol midfielder Esteban Granero was not impressed with Pique’s celebration. \n“When you provoke people you can’t later ask for respect,” Granero told reporters. “Before the gesture it was a model game. Later it was more wild. Everybody must take responsibility for their actions.” Editing by Clare Fallon",
