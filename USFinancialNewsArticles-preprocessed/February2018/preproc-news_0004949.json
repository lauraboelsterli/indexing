    "text": "BOSTON, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- OptiRTC, Inc. (\"Opti\") today announced the appointment of David Rubinstein as President and Chief Operating Officer (COO). With over 35 years of experience in building and scaling startups, Rubinstein brings valuable leadership to Opti as the company accelerates its growth and enhances services for current and new client communities.\nAs President and COO of Opti, Rubinstein leads all day-to-day operations and is focused on aligning the organization structure and teams to scale the business. Prior to joining Opti, he held senior executive roles and was responsible for setting the strategy, operations, and structure at several high-growth SaaS organizations, including DataXu, Inc., Resolve Technology, and Invoke Solutions. He was also instrumental in leading Convergent Group to a successful IPO and the subsequent sale of the company to Schlumberger. Rubinstein graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) with a degree in Management with Computer Science and served as Student Body President.\n\"David joins Opti with not just a proven operational and management track record but also a wealth of experience in successfully applying a customer-centric point of view to business operations,\" said Marcus Quigley, CEO of Opti. \"We're thrilled to have him on board as we expand delivery of our solutions for our clients and partners.\"\nWith over 130 commercial deployments in 21 states across the U.S. and over 65 million gallons of storage under active management, Opti is the leader in forecast-based intelligent control of stormwater infrastructure. As communities face growing uncertainty around flooding, water quality, protection of public property, and protection of public health and safety, there is an increasing need for resilient and cost-effective approaches to better manage these critical water issues. Opti is focused on directly addressing these challenges by accelerating the deployment of its solutions at watershed scale and enabling stormwater storage systems to adapt to environmental changes in real-time.\n\"The Opti platform is providing enormous economic benefits to its clients and quality outcomes for our environment,\" said Rubinstein. \"Each person at Opti cares greatly about our water resources and the team is dedicated to delivering trusted services to help communities thrive. I'm very fortunate to serve this team and excited and eager to help the company achieve the success it so richly deserves.\"\nRubinstein joined Opti on January 1, 2018 and is based at the company's Boston headquarters.\nAbout Opti\nOpti is focused on improving water quality, preventing localized flooding, and mitigating combined sewer overflows through continuous monitoring and adaptive control (CMAC) of distributed stormwater infrastructure. Opti's CMAC technology uniquely combines sensor data, weather forecasts, and proprietary algorithms to optimize stormwater infrastructure through active, cloud-based control. Opti CMAC lowers the risk of managing stormwater by adaptively managing the rate and timing of stormwater flows. Opti aims to improve the effectiveness of new or existing infrastructure and help keep natural water bodies clean.
