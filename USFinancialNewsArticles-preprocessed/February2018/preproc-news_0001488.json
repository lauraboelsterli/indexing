In addition, Martino was Finance Director of Citibank Poland’s consumer banking division in Poland and Vice President of Finance within Citibank credit card business in Canada. Martino started his career in public accounting with Ernst & Young.\n“We are delighted to add Tony Martino to our team at LendingPoint. His deep experience with multi-product balance sheet lenders as well as his experience in rapidly growing markets match perfectly with where we are in our journey at LendingPoint,” said Tom Burnside, CEO of LendingPoint. “As we grow our core LendingPoint online consumer loan business as well as integrate our fast growing LoanHero acquisition, Tony’s knowledge ensures that our financial modeling, planning and execution will be done at the very highest level.”\nLendingPoint announced on January 11, 2018, that it had acquired LoanHero, a fully integrated, one-stop-shop loan origination and payments platform that helps merchants provide access to consumer finance, increase revenue and eliminate friction at point of sale.
