    "text": "The Un-carrier surpasses $40B in total revenues and $30B in service revenues, reports 5.7M net customer additions in FY 17\nBELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS):\nRecord Financial Performance in FY 2017 Across the Board (all percentages year-over-year):\nService revenues up 7.1% to $7.8 billion in Q4 2017 - up 8.3% to $30.2 billion in 2017 Total revenues up 5.1% to $10.8 billion in Q4 2017 - up 8.3% to $40.6 billion in 2017 Net income of $2.7 billion and $4.5 billion in Q4 2017 and 2017, respectively Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $3.11 and $5.20 in Q4 2017 and 2017, respectively The impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") on Net income and EPS was a benefit of $2.2 billion and $2.50 in Q4 2017 and $2.2 billion and $2.49 in 2017, respectively Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $2.7 billion and $11.2 billion in Q4 2017 and 2017, respectively Net cash from operating activities up 28.5% to $2.1 billion in Q4 2017 - up 29.8% to $8.0 billion in 2017 Free Cash Flow (1) up 53.0% to $1.1 billion in Q4 2017 - up 90.2% to $2.7 billion in 2017\nCustomer Growth Again Leads the Industry:\n1.9 million total net additions in Q4 2017 - 5.7 million in 2017 1.1 million total branded postpaid net additions in Q4 2017 - 3.6 million in 2017 891,000 branded postpaid phone net additions in Q4 2017 - 2.8 million in 2017 149,000 branded prepaid net additions in Q4 2017 - 855,000 in 2017 1.18% postpaid phone churn in Q4 2017, down 10 bps year-over-year - 1.18% in 2017, down 12 bps from 2016\nStrong Network and Distribution Expansion:\nT-Mobile covered 322 million people with 4G LTE at the end of 2017 - targeting 325 million people across 2.5 million square miles by the end of 2018 16 quarters in a row with the fastest network; first U.S. carrier to exceed 30 Mbps average download speed Aggressive deployment activity of 600 MHz in 2017, accelerated pace anticipated for 2018 2,800 new stores opened in 2017, including nearly 1,500 new T-Mobile and over 1,300 net new MetroPCS\nOutlook for 2018:\nBranded postpaid net customer additions of 2.0 to 3.0 million Net income is not available on a forward looking basis (2) Adjusted EBITDA target of $11.3 to $11.7 billion which includes leasing revenues of $0.6 to $0.7 billion (1) Cash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest, of $4.9 to $5.3 billion. This includes expenditures for 5G deployment Increasing three-year compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) for Net cash provided by operating activities and Free Cash Flow from FY 2016 to FY 2019 to 16% - 18% and 46% - 48%, respectively (1)\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial metric. These non-GAAP financial items should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information provided in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP financial items to the most directly comparable financial items based on GAAP as of December 31, 2017 are provided in the financial tables on pages 9 - 12. (2) T-Mobile is not able to forecast net income on a forward looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect GAAP net income including, but not limited to, income tax expense, stock based compensation expense and interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used to predict net income as the difference between the two measures is variable. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) reported record revenues and net income in Q4 and its best ever Q4 Adjusted EBITDA. This has resulted in record full-year 2017 results across the board and shows that the Un-carrier continues to outperform the industry in both customer and financial growth metrics.\nIt’s been five years since T-Mobile launched Un-carrier by declaring war on the wireless industry status quo in an effort to change industry practices on behalf of consumers. The industry was stupid, broken, arrogant and treated customers like second class citizens. Five years later, it’s clear that the Un-carrier movement has ushered in an era of change. Customers have responded in droves. Over the past five years, T-Mobile’s reported customer base has increased by more than 39 million in total - more than doubling in size.\nThis trend continued in 2017. For the fourth year in a row, T-Mobile added more than 5 million total customers and captured a majority of the industry’s postpaid phone growth by adding 2.8 million branded postpaid phone customers in 2017. On top of that, T-Mobile is the only company in wireless consistently growing service revenues and reported the best financial results in the company's history for 2017. In 2017, T-Mobile completed its fourth year of growing service revenues, recording 8% growth in 2017 as the competition continued to show declines. The Un-carrier revolution shows no signs of slowing down.\n\"Wow - what a way to cap off 2017! Record financial results across the board and over 5 million customers added for the fourth year in a row,\" said John Legere, President and CEO of T-Mobile. \"We made incredible progress in 2017 building out our network and retail footprint to set ourselves up for future growth. Our business is clearly firing on all cylinders and our strong guidance for 2018 shows that we have no plans of letting up!\"\nRecord Financial Performance in FY 2017 Across the Board\nT-Mobile’s record full-year financial performance in 2017 proves that taking care of customers is also good for shareholders. The Company continues to successfully translate customer growth into industry-leading revenue and cash flow growth. The outlook for 2018 and beyond reveals a continuation of this winning formula.\n(in millions, except EPS) Quarter Year Ended December 31, Q4 2017 vs.\nQ3 2017\nQ4 2017 vs.\nQ4 2016\n2017 vs.\n2016\nQ4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 Total service revenues $ 7,757 $ 7,629 $ 7,245 $ 30,160 $ 27,844 1.7 % 7.1 % 8.3 % Total revenues (1) 10,759 10,019 10,234 40,604 37,490 7.4 % 5.1 % 8.3 % Net income 2,707 550 390 4,536 1,460 392.2 % 594.1 % 210.7 % EPS 3.11 0.63 0.45 5.20 1.69 393.7 % 591.1 % 207.7 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) 2,711 2,822 2,607 11,213 10,639 (3.9 )% 4.0 % 5.4 % Cash purchases of property and equipment,\nincluding capitalized interest\n921 1,441 859 5,237 4,702 (36.1 )% 7.2 % 11.4 % Net cash provided by operating activities 2,058 2,362 1,602 7,962 6,135 (12.9 )% 28.5 % 29.8 % Free Cash Flow 1,137 921 743 2,725 1,433 23.5 % 53.0 % 90.2 % (1) The amortized imputed discount on EIP receivables previously recognized as Interest income has been retrospectively reclassified as Other revenues. The effects of this change in accounting principle are provided in the financial tables. Total service revenues increased 7.1% year-over-year to $7.8 billion in Q4 2017 and 8.3% to $30.2 billion in full-year 2017. These results represent our best quarterly and full-year performance ever, and mark the 15th consecutive quarter and fourth consecutive year of leading the industry in service revenue percentage growth. Total revenues increased 5.1% year-over-year to $10.8 billion in Q4 2017 and 8.3% to $40.6 billion in full-year 2017. These record quarterly and full-year results were achieved despite a lower contribution from equipment sales in Q4 2017 compared to Q4 2016, driven by a lower branded postpaid handset upgrade rate and an increase in the impact from handset promotions. Branded postpaid phone Average Revenue per User (ARPU) was $46.38 in Q4 2017 ($46.54 excluding the impact from hurricanes), down 1.2% from Q3 2017 and down 4.1% from Q4 2016 primarily due to dilution from promotions targeting families and new segments and the impact of hurricanes. For 2018, we expect ARPU to continue to be generally stable based on GAAP as of December 31, 2017. Branded prepaid ARPU was $38.63 in Q4 2017, up 1.1% from Q4 2016, primarily due to continued growth of MetroPCS customers who generate higher ARPU, partially offset by the negative impact from hurricanes. For full-year 2017, prepaid ARPU increased by 2.0% from 2016. Net income increased year-over-year to $2.7 billion in Q4 2017 and to $4.5 billion in full-year 2017, due to a combination of factors including: the impact of the TCJA which resulted in a one-time net tax benefit of $2.2 billion recognized in Q4 2017, after-tax spectrum gains of $124 million in Q4 2017 and $174 million in full-year 2017, net hurricane losses in Q4 2017 of $40 million and $130 million in full-year 2017. We expect additional hurricane related expenses to be incurred and customer activity to be impacted in Q1 2018, primarily related to our operations in Puerto Rico. EPS increased by $2.66 year-over-year to $3.11 in Q4 2017. For the full-year 2017, EPS increased by $3.51 to $5.20. EPS excluding the impacts of the TCJA and other net tax benefits, spectrum gains and hurricane impacts was $0.48 in Q4 2017 and $2.29 in full-year 2017, respectively. The impact from the TCJA on Net income and EPS was $2.2 billion and $2.50 in Q4 2017 and $2.2 billion and $2.49 in 2017, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA increased year-over-year to $2.7 billion in Q4 2017 and to $11.2 billion in full-year 2017. Adjusted EBITDA excluding the spectrum gains and hurricanes was $2.6 billion in Q4 2017 and $11.2 billion in full-year 2017. Spectrum gains were $168 million in Q4 2017 and $235 million in full-year 2017. The net impact from hurricanes was $53 million in Q4 2017 and $201 million in full-year 2017.\nThe improvement in full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA reflects strong cost performance, most notably in cost of services, which declined 80 basis points as a percentage of service revenues (excluding the net impact of hurricanes) and SG&A, which declined 40 basis points as a percentage of service revenues (excluding the net impact of hurricanes) in full-year 2017. Cash purchases of property and equipment increased by 7.2% year-over-year to $921 million in Q4 2017 and included capitalized interest of $25 million. For the full-year, cash purchases of property and equipment increased by 11.4% to $5.2 billion and included capitalized interest of $136 million. These increases were primarily due to growth in network build as we continue deployment of 700 MHz and begin to deploy 600 MHz. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 28.5% year-over-year to $2.1 billion in Q4 2017 and 29.8% to $8.0 billion in full-year 2017. Free Cash Flow increased 53.0% year-over-year to $1.1 billion in Q4 2017 and 90.2% to $2.7 billion in full-year 2017.\nCustomer Growth Again Leads the Industry\nT-Mobile delivers superior value over the competition, and customers continue to respond by switching to the Un-carrier. Customers are loving Un-carrier benefits such as Netflix On Us and simple rate plans like T-Mobile ONE with taxes and fees included. In 2017, more than 5 million customers joined T-Mobile for the 4 th year in a row - all thanks to consumer-friendly offers and an Un-carrier philosophy that puts customers first.\nQuarter Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands, except churn) Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 Total net customer additions 1,854 1,329 2,101 5,658 8,173 Branded postpaid net customer additions 1,072 817 1,197 3,620 4,097 Branded postpaid phone net customer additions (1) 891 595 933 2,817 3,307 Branded postpaid other customers (1) 181 222 264 803 790 Branded prepaid net customer additions 149 226 541 855 2,508 Total customers, end of period (2) 72,585 70,731 71,455 72,585 71,455 Branded postpaid phone churn 1.18 % 1.23 % 1.28 % 1.18 % 1.30 % (1) During the third quarter of 2017, we retitled our “Branded postpaid mobile broadband customers” category to “Branded postpaid other customers” and reclassified 253,000 DIGITS customer net additions from our “Branded postpaid phone customers” category for the second quarter of 2017, when the DIGITS product was released. (2) We believe current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. We will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but have excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 160,000 and 4,368,000 reported wholesale customers as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2017, respectively. Total net customer additions were 1.9 million in Q4 2017, bringing our total customer count to 72.6 million. Q4 2017 marked the 19th straight quarter in which T-Mobile generated more than 1 million total net customer additions. For full-year 2017, total net customer additions were 5.7 million, marking the fourth year in a row of more than 5 million total net additions. Branded postpaid net customer additions were 1.1 million in Q4 2017 and 3.6 million for the full-year 2017. Branded postpaid phone net customer additions were 891,000 in Q4 2017 and marked the 16th consecutive quarter in which T-Mobile has led the industry in this category. Branded postpaid phone net customer additions were 2.8 million in full-year 2017 driven by the continued strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities, the growing success of T-Mobile for Business, continued growth in existing markets and distribution expansion to new Greenfield markets, and lower churn, partially offset by increased competitive activity in the marketplace with all competitors having launched Unlimited rate plans in Q1 2017. Branded postpaid phone churn was a Q4 record at 1.18% in Q4 2017, down 10 basis points from Q4 2016. For the full-year 2017, branded postpaid phone churn was 1.18%, down 12 basis points from 2016. These improvements were primarily due to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality, customer service and overall value of our offerings in the marketplace. Additionally, for the full-year 2017, churn benefited from the impact of the MVNO Transaction as the customers transferred had a higher rate of churn. Branded prepaid net customer additions were 149,000 in Q4 2017 and 855,000 in full-year 2017, down due to higher deactivations from a growing customer base, increased competitive activity in the marketplace and the de-emphasis of the legacy T-Mobile prepaid brand. Branded prepaid churn was 4.00% in Q4 2017, down 25 basis points compared to Q3 2017 driven by the overall value of our offerings in the marketplace. For full-year 2017, branded prepaid churn was 4.04%, up 16 basis points compared to full-year 2016 primarily due to increased competitive activity in the marketplace, partially offset by increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality, customer service and overall value of our offerings in the marketplace.\nStrong Network and Distribution Expansion\nT-Mobile’s network continues to be faster and more technologically advanced than our competition, and that trend will only continue as we clear and deploy new spectrum, densify our network, and lay the groundwork for 5G. We have been the fastest network in America in both download and upload speeds for the past 16 quarters and this quarter, we were the first U.S. carrier to exceed 30 Mbps average download speed with 31.6 Mbps. We will build on our speed advantage, while extending our coverage even further through the accelerated 600 MHz buildout.\nT-Mobile's network is not only earning accolades from customers but also from OpenSignal, the global standard for measuring consumers' real-world mobile network experiences. In the most recent report, OpenSignal named T-Mobile as the winner in five categories, including mobile data speed and LTE signal availability.\nWe continue to make investments to expand and improve our network and distribution footprint including:\nExpanding our 4G LTE coverage breadth to 322 million people by the end of 2017. By the end of 2018, we are targeting a population coverage of 325 million and a geographic coverage of 2.5 million square miles. Deploying 600 MHz spectrum. By year-end 2017, we had already lit up 600 MHz spectrum in 586 cities and towns in 28 states across the country, covering 300,000 square miles. Two 600 MHz compatible devices were available for the 2017 holiday season, and we expect more than a dozen compatible smartphones to be rolled out in 2018. Using our 600 MHz spectrum holdings to deploy America’s first nationwide 5G network expected by 2020.\nTax Cuts Jobs Act (\"TCJA\")\nWe expect that the TCJA will be very beneficial for us, both through lower tax rates, as well as the immediate expensing of capital expenditures for five years. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be 24% to 25% for 2018. As a result of the TCJA, we do not expect to be a material cash tax payer until 2024, compared to 2020 previously. We expect a positive impact on net cash taxes paid of $6.5 to $7.0 billion from 2020 to 2027. Additionally, we do not anticipate any permanent interest expense disallowance in the future.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn December 6, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2018 (the “Stock Repurchase Program”). The Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. Repurchased shares are retired. During Q4 2017, we repurchased approximately 7.0 million shares of our common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program at an average price per share of $63.34 for a total purchase price of approximately $444 million.\nFrom the inception of our Stock Repurchase Program through February 5, 2018, we repurchased approximately 12.3 million shares at an average price per share of $63.68 for a total purchase price of approximately $783 million.\nWe also understand that Deutsche Telekom AG, our majority stockholder, or its affiliates, is considering plans to purchase additional shares of our common stock. Such purchases would likely take place through December 31, 2018, all in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements.\n2018 Outlook\nIn 2018, we expect postpaid net customer additions between 2.0 and 3.0 million.\nT-Mobile is not able to forecast net income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect GAAP net income including, but not limited to, income tax expense, stock based compensation expense and interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used to predict net income as the difference between the two measures is variable. Guidance is stated in terms of GAAP as of December 31, 2017, and does not include impacts from the adoption of ASU 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" and ASU 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\"\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $11.3 and $11.7 billion. Our Adjusted EBITDA target includes leasing revenues of $0.6 - $0.7 billion. Including the estimated impact of the new revenue standard, Adjusted EBITDA will increase by an additional $0.2 - $0.5 billion for a total range of $11.5 - $12.2 billion.\nCash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest, are expected to be between $4.9 and $5.3 billion. This includes expenditures for 5G deployment.\nThe three-year CAGR guidance (2016 - 2019) for net cash provided by operating activities is expected to be 16% - 18%, up from the previous guidance of 15% - 18%. The three year CAGR guidance for Free Cash Flow is expected to be 46% - 48%, up from the previous guidance of 45% - 48%. These increases are after considering the impacts of the approved up to $1.5 billion stock repurchase program.\nUnder existing revenue accounting standards, T-Mobile continues to expect that branded postpaid phone ARPU in full-year 2018 will be generally stable compared to full-year 2017, with some quarterly variations. The adoption of the new revenue accounting standard will impact the timing, amount and allocation of our revenue and is expected to impact ARPU.\nIn 2018, we expect the following impacts from the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard:\nService revenues $(0.2) - $(0.1) billion Total revenues $0.3 - $0.5 billion Operating expenses $(0.1) - $0.1 billion Net income $0.2 - $0.4 billion Adjusted EBITDA $0.2 - $0.5 billion We expect postpaid phone ARPU to be negatively impacted from changes in revenue allocation under the new accounting standard.\nThe adoption of the new cash flow accounting standard will result in a reclassification of cash flows related to our deferred purchase price from securitization transactions from operating activities to investing activities. In addition, cash flows related to debt prepayment and extinguishment costs will be reclassified from operating activities to financing activities. In Q1 2018, we plan to redefine Free Cash Flow to reflect the above changes in classification and present cash flows on a consistent basis for investor transparency.\nWe will provide additional disclosures comparing results to previous GAAP in our 2018 consolidated financial statements. Please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 8, 2018 for more information.\nFinancial Results\nFor more details on T-Mobile’s Q4 and full year 2017 financial results, including the Investor Factbook with detailed financial tables and reconciliations of certain historical non-GAAP measures disclosed in this release to the most comparable measures under GAAP, please visit T-Mobile US, Inc.'s Investor Relations website at http://investor.T-Mobile.com .\nT-Mobile Social Media\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial and operational information to our investors using our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts.

The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information provided in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided below. T-Mobile is not able to forecast net income on a forward looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect GAAP net income including, but not limited to, income tax expense, stock based compensation expense and interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used to predict net income as the difference between the two measures is variable. We made an accounting change in 2017 to include imputed interest associated with EIP receivables in Other revenues which are included in Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA is reconciled to net income as follows:\nQuarter Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions) Q2 2015 Q3 2015 Q4 2015 Q1 2016 Q2 2016 Q3 2016 Q4 2016 Q1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 2016 2017 Net income $ 361 $ 138 $ 297 $ 479 $ 225 $ 366 $ 390 $ 698 $ 581 $ 550 $ 2,707 $ 1,460 $ 4,536 Adjustments: Interest expense 257 262 305 339 368 376 335 339 265 253 254 1,418 1,111 Interest expense to affiliates 92 121 134 79 93 76 64 100 131 167 162 312 560 Interest income (1) (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) (3 ) (3 ) (3 ) (4 ) (7 ) (6 ) (2 ) (2 ) (13 ) (17 ) Other (income) expense, net (1 ) 1 3 2 3 1 — (2 ) 92 (1 ) (16 ) 6 73 Income tax expense (benefit) 2 100 184 272 147 232 216 (91 ) 353 356 (1,993 ) 867 (1,375 ) Operating income (1) 710 621 922 1,168 833 1,048 1,001 1,037 1,416 1,323 1,112 4,050 4,888 Depreciation and Amortization 1,075 1,157 1,369 1,552 1,575 1,568 1,548 1,564 1,519 1,416 1,485 6,243 5,984 Cost of MetroPCS business combination (2) 34 193 21 36 59 15 (6 ) — — — — 104 — Stock-based compensation (3) 71 43 52 53 61 57 64 67 72 83 85 235 307 Other, net (4) 40 2 — 5 1 1 — — 5 — 29 7 34 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 1,930 $ 2,016 $ 2,364 $ 2,814 $ 2,529 $ 2,689 $ 2,607 $ 2,668 $ 3,012 $ 2,822 $ 2,711 $ 10,639 $ 11,213 (1) The amortized imputed discount on EIP receivables previously recognized as Interest income has been retrospectively reclassified as Other revenues. See the Effect of Change in Accounting Principle table for further detail. (2) Beginning Q1 2017, we will no longer separately present Cost of MetroPCS business combination as it is insignificant. (3) Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the condensed consolidated financial statements. (4) Other, net may not agree to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur, and are therefore excluded in Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA - Earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash Stock-based compensation and certain expenses not reflective of T-Mobile's ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure utilized by T-Mobile's management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. T-Mobile uses Adjusted EBITDA internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate its personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate T-Mobile's operating performance in comparison to its competitors. Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of T-Mobile's ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs as they are not indicative of T-Mobile's ongoing operating performance and certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). In Q1 2017, we made an accounting change to include imputed interest associated with EIP receivables in Other revenues which are included in Adjusted EBITDA.\nT-Mobile US, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nNet debt (excluding Tower obligations) to last twelve months Net income and Adjusted EBITDA ratios are calculated as follows:\n(in millions, except net debt ratio) Mar 31,\n2016\nJun 30,\n2016 Sep 30,\n2016 Dec 31,\n2016 Mar 31,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2017 Short-term debt $ 365 $ 258 $ 325 $ 354 $ 7,542 $ 522 $ 558 $ 1,612 Short-term debt to affiliates — — — — — 680 — — Long-term debt 20,505 21,574 21,825 21,832 13,105 13,206 13,163 12,121 Long-term debt to affiliates 5,600 5,600 5,600 5,600 9,600 14,086 14,586 14,586 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (3,647 ) (5,538 ) (5,352 ) (5,500 ) (7,501 ) (181 ) (739 ) (1,219 ) Less: Short-term investments (2,925 ) — — — — — — — Net debt (excluding Tower Obligations) $ 19,898 $ 21,894 $ 22,398 $ 22,286 $ 22,746 $ 28,313 $ 27,568 $ 27,100 Divided by: Last twelve months Net income $ 1,275 $ 1,139 $ 1,367 $ 1,460 $ 1,679 $ 2,035 $ 2,219 $ 4,536 Net Debt (excluding Tower Obligations) to last twelve months Net income 15.6 19.2 16.4 15.3 13.5 13.9 12.4 6.0 Divided by: Last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 9,124 $ 9,723 $ 10,396 $ 10,639 $ 10,493 $ 10,976 $ 11,109 $ 11,213 Net Debt (excluding Tower Obligations) to last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA Ratio (1) 2.2 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.2 2.6 2.5 2.4 (1) The amortized imputed discount on EIP receivables previously recognized as Interest income has been retrospectively reclassified as Other revenues.
