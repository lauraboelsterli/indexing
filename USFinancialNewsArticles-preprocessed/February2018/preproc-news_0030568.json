    "text": "OAK BROOK, Ill., Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE: THS) today reported fourth quarter GAAP loss per fully diluted share of $(5.40) compared to GAAP loss of $(4.96) reported for the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company reported adjusted earnings per fully diluted share 1 for the fourth quarter of $1.02 compared to adjusted earnings of $1.14 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\"Our cash flow delivery continues to be robust, and although our fourth quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, our operational results were disappointing,\" said Sam K. Reed, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President. \"We are well positioned within the private label marketplace; however, it is imperative that we build a more effective and efficient foundation for private label customer engagement. Our infrastructure is unrivaled in our sector, and we continue to see opportunity to, over time, achieve consistent organic growth and margin expansion in parallel.\"\n\"We are on track and committed to our TreeHouse 2020 restructuring program, whereby simplification continues to be the fundamental tenet in our recovery process. As we realign the Company to meet the demands of today's evolving food and beverage landscape, we must narrow our strategic focus to those categories and customers that value organic growth, market segmentation, product differentiation, service capability, and economies of scale,\" Mr. Reed concluded.\nMatthew Foulston, Chief Financial Officer of TreeHouse, continued, \"Sales growth in the quarter was solid, up 2.4% excluding the impact of the divestiture of the Soup and Infant Feeding business, and driven by favorable volume/mix and pricing. Segment direct operating income, however, was once again disappointing, and we relied on SG&A expense control and tax favorability to offset these shortfalls. That said, we are pleased to have generated strong free cash flow 2 of $320 million in 2017.\"\nThe Company recorded a $549.7 million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 related entirely to the Snacks segment. This segment did not achieve the forecasted results for the year and as a result, future revenue and profitability expectations were reduced. The Company recorded impairment losses of $276.4 million related to the Snacks segment's goodwill, which brings the allocated goodwill balance of this segment to zero. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the Company determined the carrying value of certain long-lived assets may not be recoverable due to the decline in forecasted future cash flows in the Snacks segment resulting in a $273.3 million impairment of the Snacks customer lists. No other segments had impairment charges.\nThe Company's previously announced share repurchase program launched in the fourth quarter with repurchases totaling $28.7 million, or 0.6 million shares. The Company may continue to repurchase shares throughout 2018 in accordance with the approved plan with a total annual cap of $150 million. The extent to which the Company repurchases shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors.\nUPDATE ON TREEHOUSE 2020 AND SG&A INITIATIVE\nTreeHouse 2020 is a comprehensive strategic blueprint that consists of aggressive actions to manage the Company's category and customer portfolio and optimize its manufacturing and supply chain. It is a multi-year plan designed to improve TreeHouse's operating margin structure by approximately 300 basis points by the end of 2020 by fully integrating its business and reducing its cost structure in order to invest in market-differentiated capabilities that will serve the rapidly evolving needs of its customers that are strategically focused and highly committed to their corporate brands.\nPhase 1 of the TreeHouse 2020 restructuring program achieved the following milestones in 2017:\nClosed the Plymouth, Indiana and Brooklyn Park, Minnesota plants; 19 production lines permanently shuttered; and 27% of SKUs eliminated, slightly ahead of the Company's previously communicated 25% goal.\nThe Company outlined the following TreeHouse 2020 action steps for calendar year 2018:\nthe partial closure of Dothan, Alabama expected in the second quarter of 2018; the final phase of closure of the Battle Creek, Michigan facility announced on January 31, 2018; the closure of the Visalia, California facility which is targeted for closure by the end of first quarter 2019; at least 15 production lines permanently shuttered; and the full roll-out of the TreeHouse Management Operating System (TMOS) to 12 plants in 2018.\nIn addition to TreeHouse 2020, TreeHouse has completed a comprehensive review of SG&A and related expenses in partnership with a major global consulting firm to provide an independent perspective of improvement potential across all of its functions, business units, and geographies based on industry benchmarks. As such, the Company plans to reduce salaried headcount across the organization by mid-year 2018. TreeHouse expects savings in calendar 2018 to total approximately $30 million, with a run rate impact of $55 million exiting 2018.\nOUTLOOK\n\"2018 will be a transition year,\" said Mr. Reed. \"Although the retail grocery landscape continues to evolve, private label absolutely continues to be the right place to be within food and beverage. It will take some time for our TreeHouse 2020 initiatives to manifest themselves in our results. However, we are well on our way to simplifying, reshaping, and optimizing our manufacturing and distribution footprint so that we can be a more efficient and effective operating company going forward.\"\nIn 2018, the Company believes the overall food and beverage industry will further evolve, as the marketplace for customer brands continues to transform, both through traditional brick and mortar channels and through the growth of e-commerce channels. TreeHouse remains committed to growing the top line over time, improving its operating margins through the TreeHouse 2020 restructuring program and delivering strong free cash flow.\nTreeHouse net sales are expected to decrease in 2018 to approximately $5.9 to $6.1 billion, driven by the sale of the Soup and Infant Feeding business in May 2017 and the Company's planned SKU reduction initiatives. Additionally, in 2018, the Company will be lapping the adverse effects of bid pricing concessions from 2017 and cycling through business that has been lost.\nEarnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") is expected to be between $265 to $305 million, or approximately 4.5% to 5.0% of sales, representing a decline in comparison to 2017.\nNet interest expense is expected to be between $118 and $120 million and assumes a rising interest rate environment as the year progresses.\nThe effective tax rate is expected to decrease to a range of 25% to 26%, primarily due to tax reform.\nThe Company's earnings per fully diluted share guidance is between $2.00 and $2.40 in 2018. The Company also anticipates diluted weighted average shares outstanding will average in a range of 56 to 57 million shares in 2018, including anticipated share repurchases.\nIn regard to the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects earnings in the range of $0.10 to $0.20 per fully diluted share. The expected decrease compared to the first quarter of 2017 is due to lower volumes, the timing of higher commodity and freight costs versus pricing actions that will take effect in later quarters and operational inefficiencies.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $1.7 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the same period last year, a decrease of (4.3)%. The change in net sales from 2016 to 2017 was due to the following:\nThree Months\n(unaudited)\nVolume/mix\n1.7\n%\nPricing\n0.5\nAcquisition/divestiture\n(6.7)\nForeign currency\n0.2\nTotal change in net sales\n(4.3)\n%\nThe change in net sales was more than explained by the divestiture of the canned soup and infant feeding business (\"SIF\") which contributed (6.7)% to the year-over-year decline. Volume/mix was favorable compared to the prior year primarily related to the Snacks, Beverages, and Condiments segments. Pricing and foreign currency were also slightly favorable. On a comparable basis, excluding the SIF business and an extra week of Private Brands in 2016, the Company reported sales growth of 2.4%.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 15.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 19.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in cost of sales was $32.8 million related to restructuring and margin improvement activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.0 million in the prior year. These transactions lowered gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 2.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The remaining 2.6% decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher commodity costs (primarily cashews, almonds, durum, dairy, and soybean oil), higher operating costs, and unfavorable mix, partially offset by a reduction in variable incentive compensation and depreciation.\nOperating expenses increased $178.8 million, or 30.1%, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $569.7 million related to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; acquisition, integration, divestiture, and related costs; debt refinancing costs; and restructuring and margin improvement activities in the fourth quarter of 2017. Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; acquisition, integration, divestiture, and related costs; and restructuring and margin improvement activities totaled $365.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase of $203.9 million more than explains the overall increase in operating expenses year-over-year. Excluding these charges, operating expenses decreased $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016. This decline was primarily related to cost savings, lower variable incentive compensation of $6.4 million, and lower stock compensation expense of $2.3 million.\nTotal other expenses, which includes interest expense, interest income, gain on foreign currency exchange, and other income, net increased $5.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to lower gains from hedging activities and $3.3 million of debt refinancing cost included in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by favorable fluctuations between the U.S. and Canadian dollar during the respective periods.\nIncome tax expense (benefit) of $(229.4) million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company's fourth quarter 2017 effective income tax rate was 42.6% compared to (6.2%) in the prior year's fourth quarter. The change in the rate year-over-year is primarily due to the impairment of goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes, the benefit related to the recognition of foreign tax credits, and a one-time benefit due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding the impact of non-recurring items, the fourth quarter effective tax rate would have been 8.2%. Our effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the jurisdictional mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, settlement of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $(309.0) million, compared to a net loss of $(281.8) million for the same period of the previous year. Adjusted EBITDAS 3 was $162.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a (22.6)% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in adjusted EBITDAS was primarily due to higher commodity costs, higher operating costs, and unfavorable mix, partially offset by a reduction in variable incentive compensation, stock comp, and cost savings.\nThe Company's fourth quarter 2017 results included ten items noted below that, in management's judgment, affect the assessment of earnings.\nRECONCILIATION OF DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE TO ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nDiluted loss per share per GAAP\n$\n(5.40)\n$\n(4.96)\n$\n(5.01)\n$\n(4.10)\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets\n9.57\n6.19\n9.55\n6.30\nAcquisition, integration, divestiture, and related costs\n0.05\n0.17\n1.76\n1.06\nRestructuring and margin improvement activities\n0.84\n0.14\n1.52\n0.37\nDebt refinancing\n0.09\n—\n0.09\n—\nMark-to-market adjustments\n(0.05)\n(0.18)\n(0.04)\n(0.25)\nForeign currency loss (gain) on re-measurement of intercompany notes\n0.03\n0.04\n(0.10)\n(0.05)\nProduct recall (reimbursement) costs\n—\n—\n(0.15)\n0.28\nTax reform\n(1.86)\n—\n(1.86)\n—\nTaxes on adjusting items\n(2.26)\n(0.26)\n(2.99)\n(0.66)\nAdd back of dilutive equity awards (1)\n0.01\n—\n0.04\n—\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$\n1.02\n$\n1.14\n$\n2.81\n$\n2.95\n(1) - As reported results reflect a loss, therefore, all equity awards were considered antidilutive and excluded from the EPS calculation.

The change in direct operating income margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to higher operating costs, the non-repeat of a one-time rebate in the fourth quarter of 2016, and higher commodity costs (primarily soybean oil).\nMeals\nSegment Metrics\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nNet sales\n$\n292.2\n$\n397.9\n$\n1,189.2\n$\n1,335.2\nDirect operating income\n37.4\n48.2\n137.3\n137.1\nDirect operating income percent\n12.8\n%\n12.1\n%\n11.5\n%\n10.3\n%\nChange in Net Sales from Prior Year\nVolume/mix\n(6.5)\n%\n(3.8)\n%\nPricing\n(0.4)\n(1.0)\nAcquisition/divestiture\n(19.7)\n(6.1)\nTotal change in net sales\n(26.6)\n%\n(10.9)\n%\nThe change in net sales in the Meals segment in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was mostly explained by the divestiture of the SIF business and an additional week of Private Brands Business in the fourth quarter of 2016, unfavorable volume/mix from competitive pressure (principally in the ready-to-eat cereal category), and unfavorable pricing from competitive pressure. The change in direct operating income margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to the divestiture of the low margin SIF business and favorable depreciation, partially offset by higher commodity costs (primarily in durum and oats).\nSnacks\nSegment Metrics\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nNet sales\n$\n394.3\n$\n363.0\n$\n1,334.5\n$\n1,330.5\nDirect operating income\n1.1\n18.9\n25.5\n66.2\nDirect operating income percent\n0.3\n%\n5.2\n%\n1.9\n%\n5.0\n%\nChange in Net Sales from Prior Year\nVolume/mix\n9.0\n%\n(4.3)\n%\nPricing\n3.2\n2.0\nAcquisition/divestiture\n(3.6)\n2.6\nTotal change in net sales\n8.6\n%\n0.3\n%\nThe change in net sales in the Snacks segment in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to favorable volume/mix from distribution gains and favorable pricing from commodity-based price increases, partially offset by an additional week of Private Brands Business in the fourth quarter of 2016. The change in direct operating income margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to higher commodity costs (predominantly in cashews) not fully offset by pricing, and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nCOMPARISON OF ADJUSTED INFORMATION TO GAAP INFORMATION\nThe Company has included in this release measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP (\"Non-GAAP\"). A Non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes these measures provide useful information to the users of the financial statements as we also have included these measures in other communications and publications.\nFor each of these Non-GAAP financial measures, the Company provides a reconciliation between the Non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why management believes the Non-GAAP measure provides useful information to financial statement users, and any additional purposes for which management uses the Non-GAAP measure. This Non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information for the financial statement users and is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. These Non-GAAP measures may be different from similar measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Fully Diluted Share, Adjusting for Certain Items Affecting Comparability\nAdjusted earnings per fully diluted share (\"Adjusted Diluted EPS\") reflects adjustments to GAAP loss per fully diluted share to identify items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the assessment of earnings results between periods. This information is provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the Company's earnings performance between periods and to view the Company's business from the same perspective as Company management. This measure is also used as a component of the Board of Director's measurement of the Company's performance for incentive compensation purposes. As the Company cannot predict the timing and amount of charges that include, but are not limited to, items such as acquisition, integration, divestiture, and related costs, mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts, and foreign currency exchange impact on the re-measurement of intercompany notes, management does not consider these costs when evaluating the Company's performance, when making decisions regarding the allocation of resources, in determining incentive compensation, or in determining earnings estimates. The reconciliation of adjusted diluted EPS, excluding certain items affecting comparability, to the relevant GAAP measure of diluted EPS as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, is presented above.\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBIT, and Adjusted EBITDAS, Adjusting for Certain Items Affecting Comparability\nAdjusted net income represents GAAP net loss as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations adjusted for items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the assessment of earnings results between periods as outlined in the adjusted diluted EPS section above. This information is provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the Company's earnings performance between periods and to view the Company's business from the same perspective as Company management. This measure is also used as a component of the Board of Director's measurement of the Company's performance for incentive compensation purposes and is the basis of calculating the adjusted diluted EPS metric outlined above.\nAdjusted EBIT represents adjusted net income before interest expense, interest income, and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDAS represents adjusted EBIT before depreciation expense, amortization expense, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDAS are performance measures commonly used by management to assess operating performance, and the Company believes they are commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as a measure of a company's operating performance between periods.\nA full reconciliation between the relevant GAAP measure of reported net loss for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 calculated according to GAAP, adjusted net income, adjusted EBIT, and adjusted EBITDAS is presented in the attached tables. Given the inherent uncertainty regarding adjusted items in any future period, a reconciliation of forward-looking financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not feasible.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to measuring the Company's cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow which represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company believes free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measure of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions, repaying debt, and repurchasing our common stock. A reconciliation between the relevant GAAP measure of cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 calculated according to GAAP and free cash flow is presented in the attached tables.\nCONFERENCE CALL WEBCAST\nA webcast to discuss the Company's fourth quarter earnings and its outlook will be held at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) today.
