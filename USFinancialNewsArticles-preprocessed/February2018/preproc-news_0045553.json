    "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - The escalating battle for the besieged Syrian enclave of Eastern Ghouta could turn into a repeat of the battle for Aleppo, Syria’s second city which endured months of conflict at the end of 2016, U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Tuesday.\n“This has a risk of becoming a second Aleppo, and we have learned, I hope, lessons from that,” de Mistura told Reuters when asked to comment on the situation.\nReporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
