Marcus Lemonis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We had a very strong fourth quarter and fiscal year and are pleased with the continued performance of our business and underlying trends in the RV market. Demand for towable and smaller recreational vehicles remained strong throughout 2017, and we made the strategic decision to carry a little more inventory in order to drive volumes and gain market share in the final months of the year. This decision paid off and we generated record fourth quarter revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 33% to $889 million, Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income increased 113% to $22 million, and Adjusted EBITDA increased 76% to $65 million.”\nMr. Lemonis continued, “The trends that we have been talking about for the past year remain strong and continue to drive our business. Our focus on towables and the lower priced segment of the RV market allows us to sell to a much wider and more diverse group of consumers than ever before. We see a lot of similarities between the outdoor consumer and the RV consumer, and we believe there is a significant opportunity to continue diversifying our business as these lifestyles converge. Over the past year, we have acquired a number of outdoor and active sports businesses that give us access to a more diverse base of outdoor lifestyle customers. Overton’s, Gander Outdoors, TheHouse.com , Uncle Dan’s, W82 and Erehwon all come with great talent, great products and a loyal customer following that we believe we can leverage over time through cross-selling and cross-promotions. We began opening our first Gander Outdoors stores in December 2017 and are pleased with the early trends, including Good Sam Club conversion rates at these stores.”\nPresentation\nThis press release presents historical results, for the periods presented, of the Company and its subsidiaries, that are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), unless noted as a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) and related reorganization transactions (“Reorganization Transactions”) that occurred on October 6, 2016 resulted in the Company as the sole managing member of CWGS Enterprises, LLC (“CWGS, LLC”), with sole voting power in and control of the management of CWGS, LLC. Despite its position as sole managing member of CWGS, LLC, the Company has a minority economic interest in CWGS, LLC. As of December 31, 2017, the Company owned 41.5% of CWGS, LLC. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the financial results of CWGS, LLC and reports a non-controlling interest in its consolidated financial statements. As the Reorganization Transactions are considered transactions among entities under common control, the financial statements for the periods prior to the IPO and related Reorganization Transactions have been adjusted to combine the previously separate entities for presentation purposes. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial comparisons in this press release compare our financial results from the 2017 fourth quarter and full year to our financial results from the 2016 fourth quarter and full year, respectively.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016 Results\nUnits and Average Selling Prices\nThe total number of recreational vehicle units sold increased 36.1% to 18,117 units from 13,316 units and the average selling price of a unit sold decreased 4.6% to $33,031 from the fourth quarter of 2016. New vehicle units sold increased 50.4% to 12,013 units and the average selling price of a new vehicle decreased 8.4% to $38,163. Used vehicle units sold increased 14.5% to 6,104 units and the average selling price of a used vehicle decreased 4.9% to $22,930.\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased 32.9% to $889.0 million from $668.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Consumer Services and Plans revenue increased 4.5% to $51.1 million and Retail revenue increased 35.1% to $837.9 million. In the Retail segment, new vehicle revenue increased 37.8% to $458.5 million, used vehicle revenue increased 9.0% to $140.0 million, parts, services and other revenue increased 48.4% to $174.7 million and finance and insurance revenue increased 57.3% to $64.8 million. Included in the parts, services and other revenue was $38.2 million in sales from the Outdoor and Active Sports Retail businesses acquired in 2017, including Gander Outdoors, Overton’s, TheHouse.com , Uncle Dan’s and W82. Finance and insurance, net revenue as a percentage of total new and used vehicle revenue increased to 10.8% from 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSame store sales for the base of 115 retail locations that were open both at the end of the corresponding period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year increased 11.9% to $655.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The increase in same store sales was primarily driven by a 18.6% increase in new vehicle same store sales, a 34.0% increase in finance and insurance same store sales, and a 3.0% increase in parts, services and other same store sales, partially offset by a 4.9% decrease in used vehicle same store sales.\nThe Company operated a total of 140 Camping World retail locations, two Overton’s locations, two TheHouse.com locations, two Gander Outdoors locations, two W82 locations, and five Uncle Dan’s locations as of December 31, 2017, compared to 122 Camping World retail locations at December 31, 2016.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit increased 37.1% to $266.6 million, or 30.0% of total revenue, from $194.5 million, or 29.1% of total revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a segment basis, Consumer Services and Plans gross profit increased 8.2% to $31.1 million, or 60.8% of segment revenue, from $28.7 million, or 58.7% of segment revenue, and Retail gross profit increased 42.1% to $235.5 million, or 28.1% of segment revenue, from $165.8 million, or 26.7% of segment revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016. A 211 basis point improvement in Consumer Services and Plans gross margin was primarily driven by increased file size of our membership clubs combined with reduced club marketing expense, and increased contracts in force in our roadside assistance programs combined with reduced program costs. A 137 basis point increase in Retail gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in the finance and insurance, net revenue as a percentage of total new and used vehicle revenue to 10.8% of vehicle sales from 8.9% of vehicle sales in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the 50.4% increase in new units sold.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased 36.9% to $222.3 million from $162.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 37.5% to $213.1 million from $154.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by the additional expenses associated with the incremental 26 greenfield and acquired retail locations opened during 2016 and 2017, two Overton’s locations, two TheHouse.com locations, two Gander Outdoors locations and two W82 locations operated during the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the prior year period, $17.7 million of pre-opening and payroll costs associated with the Gander Mountain acquisition, and $0.1 million of transaction expenses associated with the acquisition into new or complimentary markets. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses increased 25 basis points to 79.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 33.2% to $8.7 million primarily due to the addition of acquired and greenfield locations, and acquired businesses.\nFloor Plan Interest & Other Interest Expenses\nFloor plan interest expense increased to $8.4 million from $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher inventory from new dealership locations and locations expecting higher unit sales, as well as a 84 basis point increase in the average floor plan borrowing rate. Other interest expense increased to $12.0 million from $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average debt outstanding partially offset by an 86 basis point decrease in the average interest rate.\nNet Loss, Net loss margin, Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income (1) , Diluted Earnings Per Share, and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share (1)\nNet loss was $52.5 million, reflecting a $99.8 million tax receivable liability adjustment to other income and $165.4 million of income tax expense related to changes stemming from the U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017, among other things. Net loss margin was (5.9%), and diluted earnings per share was ($1.87).\nAdjusted pro forma net income (1) increased 112.8% to $22.0 million from $10.3 million and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share (1) increased 100.0% to $0.25 from $0.12 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (1)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) increased 76.0% to $65.3 million and adjusted EBITDA margin (1) increased 180 basis points to 7.3% from 5.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nSelect Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items\nThe Company's working capital and cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2017 were $478.7 million and $224.2 million, respectively, compared to $257.7 million and $114.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. At the end of the fourth quarter 2017, the Company had $3.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under its $35 million revolving credit facility, $916.9 million of term loan principal outstanding under its senior secured credit facilities and $974.0 million of floor plan notes payable outstanding under its floor plan financing facility. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 56.9% to $1,415.9 million compared to $902.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nReclassifications and Revisions to Prior Periods\nCertain revisions have been recorded in prior periods to correct for errors that were immaterial to our previously-reported consolidated financial statements. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, errors were identified relating to i) the lack of deferral of a portion of Good Sam roadside assistance policies sold through the finance and insurance process with the sale of new and used vehicles, ii) the application of a portion of certain vendor rebates against the related inventory balances, iii) the elimination of the intercompany allocation of certain revenue from new and used vehicles to consumer services and plans, and iv) the allocation of the intercompany markup between costs applicable to new and used vehicles. To quantify these errors, management performed an analysis of deferred roadside assistance policies and vendor rebates applicable to ending inventory for each period presented. The Company evaluated the materiality of these errors both qualitatively and quantitatively in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 99 - Materiality, and SAB No. 108 and concluded that the impact of these errors on the Company's previously-issued consolidated financial statements was not material. To enhance comparability and transparency, the Company has revised its previously-reported consolidated financial statements for the years ended and as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, to correct for these errors. As a result of these revisions, new vehicles revenue, used vehicles revenue, finance and insurance, net revenue, costs applicable to revenue – new vehicles, costs applicable to revenue – used vehicles, all within the retail segment, and net income attributable to non-controlling interests and earnings per share, basic and diluted were corrected as presented in the table below.\n($ in thousands except per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Year Ended December 31, 2016 As Reported Adjustment As Corrected As Reported Adjustment As Corrected Revenue: New vehicles $ 333,263 $ (637 ) $ 332,626 $ 1,866,182 $ (3,987 ) $ 1,862,195 Used vehicles 128,929 (469 ) 128,460 705,893 (2,567 ) 703,326 Finance and insurance, net 41,232 (23 ) 41,209 229,839 (1,155 ) 228,684 Retail segment revenues 621,127 (1,129 ) 619,998 3,341,933 (7,709 ) 3,334,224 Total revenue 670,032 (1,129 ) 668,903 3,526,706 (7,709 ) 3,518,997 Costs applicable to revenue- new vehicles 287,387 723 288,110 1,604,534 (7,671 ) 1,596,863 Costs applicable to revenue- used vehicles 100,454 255 100,709 555,113 2,140 557,253 Retail segment costs applicable to revenue 453,246 978 454,224 2,448,833 (5,531 ) 2,443,302 Total costs applicable to revenue 473,447 978 474,425 2,528,105 (5,531 ) 2,522,574 Income from operations 34,235 (2,107 ) 32,128 281,368 (2,178 ) 279,190 Net income 13,635 (2,107 ) 11,528 203,237 (2,178 ) 201,059 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (11,576 ) 1,634 (9,942 ) (11,576 ) 1,634 (9,942 ) Net income attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. 2,059 (473 ) 1,586 191,661 (544 ) 191,117 Earnings per share of Class A common stock: Basic $ 0.11 $ (0.03 ) $ 0.08 $ 0.11 $ (0.03 ) $ 0.08 Diluted $ 0.09 $ (0.02 ) $ 0.07 $ 0.09 $ (0.02 ) $ 0.07\nAdditionally, as a result of these errors, the cumulative effect of the change on stockholders’ /members’ deficit as of January 1, 2015, the earliest date presented in these consolidated financial statements, was $8.1 million, resulting in an as-corrected amount of $250.7 million, as compared to $242.6 million reported previously.

This Recapitalization changed the relative membership rights of the owners of membership interests in CWGS, LLC such that retroactive application of the Recapitalization to periods prior to the IPO for the purposes of calculating earnings per share would not be appropriate.\nPrior to the IPO, the CWGS, LLC membership structure included membership units, preferred units, and profits units. The Company analyzed the calculation of earnings per unit for periods prior to the IPO using the two-class method and determined that it resulted in a value that would not be meaningful to the users of the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, earnings per share information has not been presented for periods prior to the IPO on October 6, 2016.\nThree Months Ended Year ended December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, (In thousands except per share amounts) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Numerator: Net income (loss) attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. — basic $ (52,483 ) $ 11,528 $ 186,004 $ 11,528 Less: net income attributable to non-controlling interests (12,599 ) (9,942 ) (204,612 ) (9,942 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. — basic (65,082 ) 1,586 (18,608 ) 1,586 Add: reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interests from the assumed exchange of common units of CWGS, LLC for Class A common stock — 4,164 — 4,164 Net income attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. — diluted $ (65,082 ) $ 5,750 $ (18,608 ) $ 5,750 Denominator: Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding — basic 34,837 18,766 26,622 18,766 Dilutive common units of CWGS, LLC that are convertible into Class A common stock — 64,836 — 64,836 Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding — diluted 34,837 83,602 26,622 83,602 Earnings (loss) per share of Class A common stock — basic $ (1.87 ) $ 0.08 $ (0.70 ) $ 0.08 Earnings (loss) per share of Class A common stock — diluted $ (1.87 ) $ 0.07 $ (0.70 ) $ 0.07 Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share (collectively the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\"). We believe that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics we use in our financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP measures are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by any items adjusted for in these non-GAAP measures. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of those adjusted in this presentation. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures that we use are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe define “EBITDA” as net income before other interest expense (excluding floor plan interest expense), provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things, loss and expense on debt restructure, loss (gain) on sale of assets, monitoring fees, equity-based compensation, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, acquisition related transaction expenses and pre-opening costs, and other unusual or one-time items. We define “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the same manner. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these Non-GAAP Financial Measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.\nThe following tables reconcile EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which are net income, net income and net income margin, respectively:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, ($ in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ (52,483 ) $ 11,528 $ 186,004 $ 201,059 Other interest expense, net 11,986 10,278 42,959 48,318 Depreciation and amortization 8,726 6,551 31,545 24,695 Income tax expense 175,705 1,269 203,952 5,907 EBITDA 143,934 29,626 464,460 279,979 Adjustments: Loss and expense on debt restructure (a) 849 6,270 849 6,270 Loss (gain) on sale of assets (b) 159 (339 ) (133 ) (564 ) Monitoring fee (c) – – – 1,875 Equity-based compensation (d) 2,317 1,537 5,109 1,597 Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (e) (99,766 ) – (99,687 ) – Acquisitions - transaction expense (f) 109 – 2,662 – Acquisitions - pre-opening costs (g) 17,683 – 26,352 – Adjusted EBITDA $ 65,285 $ 37,094 $ 399,612 $ 289,157 Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, (as percentage of total revenue) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) margin -5.9 % 1.7 % 4.3 % 5.7 % Other interest expense, net 1.3 % 1.5 % 1.0 % 1.4 % Depreciation and amortization 1.0 % 1.0 % 0.7 % 0.7 % Income tax expense 19.8 % 0.2 % 4.8 % 0.2 % Subtotal EBITDA margin 16.2 % 4.4 % 10.8 % 8.0 % Adjustments: Loss and expense on debt restructure (a) 0.1 % 0.9 % 0.0 % 0.2 % Loss (gain) on sale of assets (b) 0.0 % -0.1 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Monitoring fee (c) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.1 % Equity-based compensation (d) 0.3 % 0.2 % 0.1 % 0.0 % Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (e) -11.2 % 0.0 % -2.3 % 0.0 % Acquisitions - transaction expense (f) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.1 % 0.0 % Acquisitions - pre-opening costs (g) 2.0 % 0.0 % 0.6 % 0.0 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 7.3 % 5.5 % 9.3 % 8.2 %\n(a)\nRepresents the loss and expense incurred on debt restructure and financing expense incurred from the First and Second Amendment to the Existing Senior Credit Facilities in 2017, the write-off of a portion of the original issue discount, capitalized finance costs from our previous term loan facilities, and rating agency fees and legal expenses related to the previous term loan facilities in 2016.\n(b)\nRepresents an adjustment to eliminate the gains and losses on sales of various assets.\n(c)\nRepresents monitoring fees paid pursuant to a monitoring agreement to Crestview and Stephen Adams.

These items include, among other things, reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interests, loss and expense on debt restructure, loss (gain) on sale of assets, monitoring fees, equity-based compensation, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, acquisition related transaction expenses and pre-opening costs, other unusual or one-time items, and the income tax expense effect of (i) these adjustments and (ii) the pass-through entity taxable income as if the parent company was a subchapter C corporation in periods prior to the IPO. We define “Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share” as Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income divided by the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming (i) the full exchange of all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC (or the common unit equivalent of membership interests in CWGS, LLC for periods prior to the IPO) for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock of CWH, (ii) the Class A common stock issued in connection with the IPO was outstanding as of January 1 of each year presented, and (iii) the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units, if any. We present Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these Non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is net income attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. and weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding — diluted:\nThree Months Ended Year ended December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, (In thousands except per share amounts) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Numerator: Net income (loss) attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. $ (65,082 ) $ 1,586 $ (18,608 ) $ 191,117 Adjustments: Reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interests from the assumed exchange of common units in CWGS, LLC (a) 12,599 9,942 204,612 9,942 Loss and expense on debt restructure (b) 849 6,270 849 6,270 Loss (gain) on sale of assets (c) 159 (339 ) (133 ) (564 ) Monitoring fee (d) — — — 1,875 Equity-based compensation (e) 2,317 1,537 5,109 1,597 Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (f) (99,766 ) — (99,687 ) — Acquisitions - transaction expense (g) 109 — 2,662 — Acquisitions - pre-opening costs (h) 17,683 — 26,352 — Revaluation of deferred tax assets from tax reform (i) 165,375 — 165,375 — Income tax expense (j) (12,228 ) (8,653 ) (87,856 ) (78,703 ) Adjusted pro forma net income $ 22,015 $ 10,343 $ 198,675 $ 131,534 Denominator: Weighted-average Class A common shares outstanding - diluted 34,837 83,602 26,622 83,602 Adjustments: Assumed exchange of post-IPO common units in CWGS, LLC for shares of Class A common stock (k) 53,772 — 59,995 — Assumed exchange of pre-IPO common unit equivalent of membership interests in CWGS, LLC (l) — — — 193 Assumed issuance of Class A common stock in connection with IPO (m) — 170 — 170 Dilutive options to purchase Class A common stock 376 — 200 — Dilutive restricted stock units 200 24 112 6 Adjusted pro forma fully exchanged weighted average Class A common shares outstanding - diluted 89,185 83,796 86,929 83,971 Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share $ 0.25 $ 0.12 $ 2.29 $ 1.57",
