    "text": "12:59 PM ET Mon, 12 Feb 2018 | 02:07 \nWhen music titan Jay-Z goes out, he goes big. \nOn Sunday, the rapper and businessman took out Roc Nation Sports president Juan Perez for a birthday celebration in Manhattan, along with a group of Roc Nation executives, Page Six reports . The group ended their night at Playroom, a nightclub in Inwood, where Jay ordered 40 bottles of Ace of Spades champagne. \nAlthough Jay-Z owns the brand , he paid full price for the bottles, racking up a bar tab of $80,035. With an included 15 percent gratuity of $11,100, his total came to $91,135. \nA representative for Jay-Z did not immediately return CNBC Make It's requests for comment. Ari Perilstein | Getty Images \nJay-Z's not the only big name doling out massive tips. Retired NBA star Shaquille O'Neal once left $4,000 behind . But the reason for his generous gratuity wasn't a five-digit bill. When he gets good service, O'Neal asks his server how much they wantâ€”and he delivers. \n\"When I'm at restaurants, I am a big tipper,\" he told Jimmy Kimmel in 2017 . \"I like to show people my appreciation. So when they come up to the table, I say, 'The quicker I get my order, the bigger your tip will be.' And then the food will come fast. Then, when we're getting ready to leave, I'll ask them: 'How much do you want?'\" \nVenture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya tips well too. He leaves 100 percent unless he had bad service, he tells CNBC on \" Squawk Box .\" \n\"If it's bad service, no, but most of the time [I tip 100 percent]. Because they just have such joy on their face and it's wonderful,\" says the sharp investor, whose early investments include Slack, Box and SurveyMonkey. \"Look, I got lucky, so I feel like I should just pay it forward.\" \nDon't miss: ",
