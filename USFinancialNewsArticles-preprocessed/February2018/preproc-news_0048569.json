(NYSE American: ENRJ) announced today that it has set the record date for the special meeting of its shareholders to, among other things, consider and vote on various proposals necessary to close the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 19, 2017 (the “Merger Agreement”), with AgEagle Aerial Systems, Inc.\nShareholders of record as of the close of business on February 20, 2018 will be entitled to vote at the special meeting on March 21, 2018.
