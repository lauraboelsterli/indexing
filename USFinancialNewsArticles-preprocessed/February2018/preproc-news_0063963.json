    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Donnelley Financial Solutions (NYSE: DFIN) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nHighlights:\nFourth-quarter 2017 Full-year 2017 Net Sales $224.8 million $1,004.9 million GAAP Net earnings (loss) (1) ($23.7) million $9.7 million Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (2) $32.9 million $174.1 million Operating Cash Flow $57.7 million $91.4 million Free Cash Flow (2) $49.9 million $63.6 million (1)\nIncludes $22.4 million of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of items\nnoted in the reconciliation tables below. See the tables below for amounts and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nReduced outstanding debt by $128.7 million during 2017, ending the year with total debt of $458.3 million, and cash of $52.0 million Company issues full-year 2018 guidance\n“I am pleased with our results for 2017, our first full year as a standalone company,” said Daniel N. Leib, Donnelley Financial’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Revenue increased by $21 million, driven by growth in Investment Markets, Language Solutions and International, while softer than expected transactional activity resulted in a modest decline in U.S. capital markets. The revenue growth we achieved, coupled with aggressive cost management, drove $63.6 million of free cash flow in 2017, most of which was used to reduce the Company's debt. Within the first five quarters of the spin-off from R.R. Donnelley, we have reduced our total debt by nearly $180 million, ending 2017 with gross leverage of 2.6x. In addition, we ended the year with $52 million of cash.”\nLeib continued, “In light of our strengthened financial position, the market opportunities we see and the benefits of the recently announced tax legislation, we will increase our investments in 2018 to drive long-term growth. Our targeted gross leverage range remains in the range of 2.25x to 2.75x.”\nNet Sales\nNet sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $224.8 million, an increase of $3.8 million, or 1.7%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. After adjusting for changes in foreign exchange rates, organic sales increased 1.0% from the fourth quarter of 2016 driven primarily by growth in transactional, compliance and Venue revenue within U.S. Capital Markets, which was partially offset by declines in U.S. Investment Markets and International.\nGAAP Earnings (loss)\nFourth-quarter 2017 net loss was $23.7 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $0.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth-quarter 2017 net loss included additional income tax expense of $22.4 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The fourth-quarter net loss included after-tax charges of $28.4 million and $4.9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, all of which are excluded from the presentation of non-GAAP net earnings. Additional details regarding the amount and nature of these and other items are included in the attached schedules.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Net Earnings (loss)\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $32.9 million, compared to $27.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 14.6%, 210 basis points higher than in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by company-wide cost reductions and increased activity within U.S. Capital Markets, partially offset by reduced activity within International and U.S. Investment Markets, as well as higher employee-related expenses.\nNon-GAAP net earnings totaled $4.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to non-GAAP net earnings of $4.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Reconciliations of net earnings to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net earnings, as well as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin, are presented in the attached schedules.\nImpact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nThe Company recorded additional income tax expense of $22.4 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The additional income tax expense represents the Company’s initial estimate of the transition tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of the Company's net deferred tax asset.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company provides the following full-year guidance for 2018, which includes increased operating expense and capital expenditures related to investments targeted toward driving long-term revenue growth:\n2018 Guidance Net sales Approximately $1 billion, representing organic growth in the\nrange of 1% to 2%\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (1) $165-$175 million Depreciation and amortization Approximately $50 million Interest expense Approximately $37 million Non-GAAP effective tax rate 29% to 31% Diluted share count Approximately 34 million Capital expenditures $40 to $45 million Free cash flow (2) $55 to $60 million (1) Pension income excluded from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA beginning in 2018; pension income of $3.3 million was included in full-year 2017 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (2) Defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. 2018 free cash flow guidance includes approximately $15 million for spinoff-related transition expenses. Certain components of the guidance given above are provided on a non-GAAP basis only, without providing a reconciliation to guidance provided on a GAAP basis. Information is presented in this manner, consistent with SEC rules, because the preparation of such a reconciliation could not be accomplished without “unreasonable efforts.” The Company does not have access to certain information that would be necessary to provide such a reconciliation, including non-recurring items that are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, restructuring charges, impairment charges, spinoff-related transaction expenses, acquisition-related expenses, gains or losses on investments and business disposals and other similar gains or losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company does not believe that this information is likely to be significant to an assessment of the Company’s ongoing operations, given that it is not an indicator of business performance.\nConference Call\nDonnelley Financial will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss its fourth-quarter results today, Wednesday, February 28, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Central Time).

The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, provide useful information about the Company’s operating results and liquidity and enhance the overall ability to assess the Company’s . The Company uses these measures, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business.\nOur non-GAAP statement of operations measures, non-GAAP SG&A, non-GAAP SG&A as % of total net sales, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operations. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of expenses associated with the Company’s acquisition activities, spin-off related expenses, share-based compensation and eliminate potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historic cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures, taxation positions or regimes, restructuring, impairment and other charges and gain or loss on certain equity investments and asset sales.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. By adjusting for the level of capital investment in operations, the Company believes that free cash flow can provide useful additional basis for understanding the Company’s ability to generate cash after capital investment and provides a comparison to peers with differing capital intensity.\nOrganic net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as reported net sales adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and acquired and disposed businesses.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these measures are defined differently by different companies in our industry and, accordingly, such measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.\nUse of Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release includes certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of, and subject to the safe harbor created by, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the business, strategy and plans of Donnelley Financial and its expectations relating to future financial condition and performance.

The Revolving Facility is subject to a number of covenants, including a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Leverage Ratio, both as defined and calculated in the Credit Agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2017. Based on the Company’s results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and existing debt, the Company would have had the ability to utilize $300.0 million of the $300.0 million Revolving Facility and not have been in violation of the terms of the agreement. (2) Approximately 30% and 46% of cash as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was located outside of the U.S. Certain cash balances of foreign subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. or local country taxes if repatriated to the U.S. In addition, repatriation of some foreign cash balances is further restricted by local laws.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228005324/en/\nInvestor Contact:\nSloan Bohlen\nSolebury Communications Group\ninvestors@dfsco.com\nSource: Donnelley Financial Solutions",
