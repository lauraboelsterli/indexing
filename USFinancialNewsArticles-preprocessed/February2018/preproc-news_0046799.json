    "text": "This release should be read with the Company's Financial Statements and Management Discussion & Analysis (\"MD&A\"), available at www.tasekomines.com and filed on www.sedar.com . Except where otherwise noted, all currency amounts are stated in Canadian dollars. Taseko's 75% owned Gibraltar Mine is located north of the City of Williams Lake in south-central British Columbia. Production volumes stated in this release are on a 100% basis unless otherwise indicated.\nVANCOUVER, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Taseko Mines Limited (TSX: TKO; NYSE American: TGB) (\"Taseko\" or the \"Company\") reports financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2017.\nRussell Hallbauer, President and CEO of Taseko, commented, \"2017 was an excellent year for Taseko, demonstrated by the $211 million of cash flow from operations and $164 million of EBITDA for the year, with $32 million and $22 million, respectively, coming in the fourth quarter. Over the past three months, copper prices have averaged approximately US$3.15 per pound, which is 30% higher than where it was at the beginning of 2017. Additionally, molybdenum prices are 50% higher today over the same period and are now over US$12 per pound. Given this higher metal pricing environment, our financial performance is expected to continue into 2018, allowing us to invest in and advance our projects. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have a long life cash flowing asset, such as Gibraltar, as the foundation upon which to build a successful company.\"\nMr. Hallbauer continued, \"In addition to our financial successes in 2017, we achieved a number of important milestones during the year, on both corporate and operational levels. Our balance sheet was greatly strengthened after completing a new, long-term debt financing, Gibraltar had one of its strongest production years ever and we made significant strides forward on our Florence Copper project.\"\n\"Our Florence Copper project has been advancing on-time and on budget. We now have nearly 80% of the test wellfield completed and construction crews broke ground on the SX/EW plant in January. Pre-leaching of the deposit and commissioning of the SX/EW plant are expected to begin in the third quarter, with first cathode production before the end of 2018. We will be evaluating the operating data from the wellfield while we complete permit amendments for the full scale production facility,\" added Mr. Hallbauer.\n\"2017 was not without its challenges, the most significant being the major wildfires in the BC Cariboo region this past summer. During these wildfires, we maintained production with reduced operations personnel for a lengthy period and also had a complete shutdown of the mine for several days in July – this had an immediate impact on mine production but, more importantly, impacted our mine plan sequencing which has continued to affect production into the first quarter of 2018. Taking this into account, the first quarter will be similar to the fourth quarter in terms of grade and copper production. Looking beyond the first quarter, with higher stripping rates and transition into the new ore zone completed, copper grade will increase and we expect the average copper grade for 2018 to be in line with Gibraltar's life of mine average grade,\" concluded Mr. Hallbauer.\n*Non-GAAP performance measure. See end of news release.\n2017 Annual Highlights\nEarnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization* was $177.7 million, a significant increase over the $54.7 million in 2016 due to higher copper and molybdenum production, lower costs and stronger metal prices; The Company generated cash flows from operations of $211.1 million, up from $33.9 million in 2016; Higher throughput and grades in 2017 resulted in strong copper and molybdenum production of 141.2 million pounds and 2.6 million pounds (100% basis), an increase of 6% and 178%, respectively, over 2016; Net income for the year was $34.3 million, or $0.15 per share, and Adjusted net income* was $41.4 million, or $0.18 per share. The cash balance at the end of 2017 was $80.2 million, slightly lower than the end of 2016 as the Company used $72 million of cash to complete a refinancing and reduce long-term debt in June 2017; Site operating costs* were US$1.09 per pound produced, and Total operating costs (C1)* were US$1.43 per pound produced, reductions of 28% and 23%, respectively, over 2016 unit costs; In March the Company completed a US$33 million streaming agreement with Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd. for Taseko's 75% share of payable silver production from the Gibraltar Mine; In April 2017, the Company announced that a new long-term agreement was ratified by its unionized employees at Gibraltar. The new agreement will be effective through May 31, 2021; In June 2017, the Company completed an offering of US$250 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% senior secured notes due 2022. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering and $72 million of its existing cash balance to fund the redemption of its US$200 million senior notes due 2019 and to repay its senior secured credit facility (due March 2019) and the related copper call option; In July 2017, Gibraltar's mining and milling operations were impacted by wildfires in the Cariboo region which limited our employees' ability to travel to the mine site, due to restrictions on road access and evacuation orders in the region; and In September 2017, the Company announced that it had received all necessary state and federal permits to build and operate the Florence Copper Production Test Facility (\"PTF\") in Arizona, and the Company's board of directors had approved the construction of the PTF at an estimated cost of US$25 million.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nEarnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization* was $32.7 million, compared to $46.6 million in 2016; Cash flow from operations was $31.9 million, a decrease from the same period in 2016 due to lower production and sales volumes; Copper and molybdenum production in the fourth quarter was 25.5 million pounds and 0.5 million pounds, respectively, a decrease from previous quarters as a result of the anticipated lower grade mine feed combined with the increased use of lower grade ore stockpiles, a consequence of the summer wildfires; The increased use of stockpiled ore resulted in a non-cash inventory expense and additional depletion and amortization which reduced earnings from mining operations by $10.6 million in 2017; Site operating costs, net of by-product credits* were US$1.69 per pound produced and Total operating costs (C1)* were US$2.11 per pound produced. Spending in the quarter remained at a similar level as previous quarter but unit costs were impacted by the lower grades and production; and Total sales (100% basis) for the quarter were 32.0 million pounds of copper and 0.6 million pounds of molybdenum.\n*Non-GAAP performance measure.

See end of news release.\nOPERATIONS ANALYSIS\nFull-year results\nGibraltar's copper production in 2017 was 141.2 million pounds, a 6% increase over 2016 due to higher average head grades and increased mill throughput. Mining and milling operations in July and August were impacted by wildfires in the Cariboo region which limited our employees' ability to travel to the mine site, resulting in reduced mine and mill production for periods of time as well as a complete mine shutdown for several days.\nA total of 93.1 million tons were mined in the year at a strip ratio of 3.4 to 1. Waste stripping costs of $69.0 million (75% basis) were capitalized in 2017, an increase over the $9.2 million capitalized in 2016, as a new pushback in the Granite pit was initiated in the current year. Approximately 8.5 million tons of ore were drawn from ore stockpiles during the year.\nSite operating costs per pound* for the year were US$1.22 per pound of copper produced, a 23% reduction from 2016, primarily due to the higher copper production and increased capitalization of stripping costs in 2017.\nMolybdenum production for 2017 was approximately 2.6 million pounds, resulting in by-product credits per pound produced* of US $0.13, an increase from US$0.06 in the prior year.\nOff property costs per pound produced* were US$0.34 per pound of copper produced, consistent with US$0.33 per pound produced in 2016. Long-term contracts for treatment and refining costs and ocean freight were completed in 2016.\nTotal operating costs (C1)* decreased to US$1.43 per pound for the year, compared to US$1.85 per pound in 2016.\nFourth quarter results\nFourth quarter copper production at Gibraltar was 25.5 million pounds, lower than the previous quarters in 2017 as a result of reduced head grades. Although a reduction in head grade was expected in the mine plan, head grade was further affected by reduced waste stripping in the third quarter as a result of the summer wildfires in the Cariboo region whereby more mill feed came from the stockpile than planned. Copper head grade at Gibraltar was 0.209% in the fourth quarter. The low head grades and some oxidation from stockpile also impacted copper recoveries which averaged 78% for the period.\nA total of 26.9 million tons were mined during the quarter at a strip ratio of 4.9 to 1. Waste stripping costs of $17.5 million (75% basis) were capitalized in the quarter related to the new pushback in the Granite pit. Approximately 4.3 million tons of ore were drawn from the ore stockpile in the fourth quarter.\nSite operating cost per ton milled* was $7.68 in 2017, which is higher than the third quarter primarily due to the decreased capitalization of stripping costs.\nSite operating costs per pound produced* increased to US$1.86 in 2017 from US$0.97 in the third quarter of 2017. The increase is due to the lower copper production and lower capitalized stripping costs during the fourth quarter. A total of 0.6 million pounds of molybdenum were sold resulting in by-product credits per pound produced* of US$0.17 in the fourth quarter.\nOff-property costs per pound produced* were US$0.42 for 2017 compared to the prior quarter off-property costs of US$0.30. The increase is due to the higher sales volumes, as treatment and refining and ocean freight costs are recognized at the time of sale.\nTotal operating costs (C1) per pound* increased to US$2.11, a 79% increase from the third quarter of 2017.\n*Non-GAAP performance measure. See end of news release.\nHealth and Safety Milestones\nHealth and safety have always been a high-level commitment for Taseko, Gibraltar, and Florence management. Taseko is committed to operational practices that result in improved efficiencies, safety performance and occupational health. Nothing is more important to the Company than the safety, health and well-being of our workers and their families.\nGibraltar's 2017 loss time frequency was 0.59 per one million man hours worked, below the British Columbia mining industry average of 1.06.\nIn February 2017, the Province of British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines awarded Gibraltar with the 2016 John Ash award at the 55th Annual Mine Safety Awards held in Victoria, BC, for the third year in a row. This prestigious award goes to the mining operation in British Columbia that has worked at least one million hours during the year with the lowest injury-frequency rate.\nAs site activities ramp up at the Florence PTF we are pleased to report that there were no lost time accidents in 2017.\nGIBRALTAR OUTLOOK\nDuring the summer wildfires, the Gibraltar Mine maintained production with reduced operations personnel for a lengthy period and also had a complete shutdown for several days in July. This had an immediate impact on mine production but, more importantly, impacted mine plan sequencing which has continued to affect copper production into the first quarter of 2018. Taking this into account, head grades and copper production in the first quarter of 2018 will be similar to 2017. Looking beyond the first quarter, with the higher stripping rates and the transition into the new ore zone completed, copper grade will increase and we expect the average copper grade for 2018 to be in line with Gibraltar's life of mine average grade.\nCopper markets have shown continued strength in early 2018 with prices rising to US$3.19 per pound as of February 20, 2018. Molybdenum prices have also continued to strengthen in the first quarter of 2018, increasing to US$12.33 per pound as of February 20, 2018, which is 40% higher than the average molybdenum price in 2017. The Company continues to review engineering plans for a potential mill expansion at Gibraltar.\nThe Company is pursuing an insurance claim related to the Cariboo region wildfires in July 2017. The amount of the claim cannot be determined at this time, but could be in the range of $3 to $10 million.\nREVIEW OF PROJECTS\nTaseko's strategy has been to grow the Company by leveraging cash flow from the Gibraltar Mine to assemble and develop a pipeline of projects. We continue to believe this will generate the best, long-term returns for shareholders. Our development projects are located in British Columbia and Arizona and represent a diverse range of metals, including gold, copper, molybdenum and niobium. Our project focus is currently on the development of the Florence Copper Project where we incurred expenditures of $15.2 million in 2017 (2016 - $5.0 million). We also spent $1.7 million on the Aley Niobium project in 2017 (2016 - $0.8 million) and $1.7 million on the New Prosperity project (2016 - $1.7 million). Taseko will continue to take a prudent approach to spending on development projects.\nFlorence Copper Project\nIn January 2017, the Company announced that completed technical work on the Florence property has resulted in a significant improvement in project economics. The NI 43-101 technical report documenting these results was filed on www.sedar.com on February 28, 2017.\nFlorence Copper Technical Report Highlights:\nPre-tax net present value of US$920 million at a 7.5% discount rate; Post-tax net present value of US$680 million* at a 7.5% discount rate; Pre-tax internal rate of return of 44% with a 2.3 year payback; Operating costs of US$1.10 per pound LME grade cathode copper; Total life of mine production in excess of 1.7 billion pounds of copper; Average annual production of 81 million pounds of copper for the life of mine; 21 year mine life; Total pre-production capital cost of US$200 million; and Long-term copper price of US$3.00 per pound.\n*The Company expects that the reduced US corporate income tax rates, announced in December 2017, will have a significant positive impact on the project's post-tax net present value.\nIn September 2017, the Company announced that it has now received all necessary state and federal permits to build and operate the Production Test Facility (\"PTF\") and is moving forward with construction of the PTF at an estimated cost of US$25 million. PTF construction expenditures in 2017 were $5.3 million.\nThe PTF will include a well field comprised of thirteen commercial scale production wells, numerous monitoring, observation and point of compliance wells, and an integrated SX/EW plant. The PTF is expected to be operational in the latter half of 2018.\nAley Niobium Project\nIn 2014, the Company filed an NI43-101 technical report for the Aley Niobium Project. Further engineering and metallurgical testwork has been completed since then which is expected to result in improved project economics. Environmental monitoring on the project continues and a number of product marketing initiatives are underway.\nThe Company will host a telephone conference call and live webcast on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Pacific) to discuss these results. After opening remarks by management, there will be a question and answer session open to analysts and investors. The conference call may be accessed by dialing (877) 303-9079 in Canada and the United States, or (970) 315-0461 internationally.\nThe conference call will be archived for later playback until March 1, 2018 and can be accessed by dialing (855) 859-2056 in Canada and the United States, or (404) 537-3406 internationally and using the passcode 1099316.\nRussell Hallbauer\nPresident and CEO\nNo regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of the information in this news release.\nNON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nThis document includes certain non-GAAP performance measures that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. These measures may differ from those used by, and may not be comparable to such measures as reported by, other issuers. The Company believes that these measures are commonly used by certain investors, in conjunction with conventional IFRS measures, to enhance their understanding of the Company's performance. These measures have been derived from the Company's financial statements and applied on a consistent basis. The following tables below provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measure.\nTotal operating costs and site operating costs, net of by-product credits\nTotal costs of sales include all costs absorbed into inventory, as well as transportation costs. Site operating costs is calculated by removing net changes in inventory and depletion and amortization and transportation costs from cost of sales. Site operating costs, net of by-product credits is calculated by removing by-product credits from the site operating costs. Site operating costs, net of by-product credits per pound are calculated by dividing the aggregate of the applicable costs by copper pounds produced. Total operating costs per pound is the sum of site operating costs, net of by-product credits and off-property costs divided by the copper pounds produced. By-product credits are calculated based on actual sales of molybdenum (net of treatment costs) and silver during the period divided by the total pounds of copper produced during the period. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented.\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(Cdn$ in thousands, unless otherwise indicated) – 75% basis\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nCost of sales\n77,273\n57,235\n248,305\n262,089\nLess:\nDepletion and amortization\n(14,561)\n(9,224)\n(47,722)\n(52,939)\nNet change in inventories of finished goods\n(5,392)\n(3,679)\n302\n272\nNet change in inventories of ore stockpiles\n(8,006)\n11,261\n(14,266)\n16,466\nTransportation costs\n(4,074)\n(5,358)\n(19,281)\n(16,507)\nSite operating costs\n45,240\n50,235\n167,338\n209,381\nLess by-product credits:\nMolybdenum, net of treatment costs\n(4,016)\n(3,689)\n(16,883)\n(4,400)\nSilver, excluding amortization of deferred revenue\n(173)\n(1,018)\n(810)\n(3,988)\nSite operating costs, net of by-product credits\n41,051\n45,528\n149,645\n200,993\nTotal copper produced (thousand pounds)\n19,094\n30,512\n105,874\n99,938\nTotal costs per pound produced\n2.15\n1.49\n1.41\n2.01\nAverage exchange rate for the period (CAD/USD)\n1.27\n1.33\n1.30\n1.32\nSite operating costs, net of by-product credits\n(US$ per pound)\n1.69\n1.12\n1.09\n1.52\nSite operating costs, net of by-product credits\n41,051\n45,528\n149,645\n200,993\nAdd off-property costs:\nTreatment and refining costs of copper concentrate\n6,172\n9,454\n28,072\n27,924\nTransportation costs\n4,074\n5,358\n19,281\n16,507\nTotal operating costs\n51,297\n60,340\n196,998\n245,424\nTotal operating costs (C1) (US$ per pound)\n2.11\n1.48\n1.43\n1.85\nAdjusted net income (loss)\nAdjusted net income (loss) remove the effect of the following transactions from net income as reported under IFRS:\nUnrealized foreign currency gains/losses; Write-down of mine equipment; Write-down of investment; Unrealized gain/loss on copper put options; Loss on settlement of long-term debt; Gain/loss on copper call option; and Non-recurring transactions, including related tax adjustments.\nManagement believes these transactions do not reflect the underlying operating performance of our core mining business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

EBITDA is presented because it is an important supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. Issuers of \"high yield\" securities also present EBITDA because investors, analysts and rating agencies consider it useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations. The Company believes EBITDA is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity, because cash expenditures on interest are, by definition, available to pay interest, and tax expense is inversely correlated to interest expense because tax expense goes down as deductible interest expense goes up; depreciation is a non-cash charge.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of the Company's performance and ability to service debt. Adjusted EBITDA is prepared by adjusting EBITDA to eliminate the impact of a number of items that are not considered indicative of ongoing operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding to EBITDA certain items of expense and deducting from EBITDA certain items of income that are not likely to recur or are not indicative of the Company's future operating performance consisting of:\nUnrealized foreign exchange gains/losses; Write-down of mine equipment; Write-down of investment; Unrealized gain/loss on copper put options; Gain/loss on copper call option; and Non-recurring transactions.\nWhile some of the adjustments are recurring, other non-recurring expenses do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company's core mining business and are not necessarily indicative of future results. Furthermore, unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments, and unrealized foreign currency translation gains/losses are not necessarily reflective of the underlying operating results for the reporting periods presented.\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss)\n(7,600)\n5,113\n34,262\n(31,396)\nAdd:\nDepletion and amortization\n14,561\n9,225\n47,722\n53,024\nShare-based compensation expense\n1,321\n1,382\n7,100\n3,682\nFinance expense\n8,692\n8,028\n46,430\n30,007\nFinance (income) loss\n269\n(297)\n(935)\n(1,084)\nIncome tax (recovery) expense\n5,107\n8,861\n29,178\n(14,713)\nEBITDA\n22,350\n32,312\n163,757\n39,520\nAdjustments:\nUnrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss\n1,541\n8,802\n(17,684)\n(7,785)\nWrite-down of mine equipment\n-\n-\n3,551\n-\nWrite-down of investment\n3,850\n-\n3,850\n-\nUnrealized loss on copper put option\n898\n477\n1,970\n1,044\nLoss on copper call option\n-\n2,886\n6,305\n3,360\nOther non-recurring expenses*\n-\n-\n-\n5,489\nAdjusted EBITDA\n28,639\n44,477\n161,749\n41,628\n* Other non-recurring expenses includes legal and other advisory costs associated with the special shareholder meeting, the proxy contest and related litigation, and other non-recurring financing costs.\nEarnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization\nEarnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization is earnings from mining operations with depletion and amortization added back.
