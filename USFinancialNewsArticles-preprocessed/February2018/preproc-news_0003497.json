LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) •The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,612.50, trading down 0.99 percent from its previous close. •The Indian rupee will likely fall against the greenback in opening trade, tracking a sharp rally in the dollar Friday on the back of upbeat U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, which also pushed treasury yields higher. •Indian sovereign bonds are likely to fall in early session tracking gains in U.S. Treasury yields, even as demand for debt remains muted amid concerns about the government fiscal situation. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.52 percent -7.60 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • Worries about the impact of a tightening job market on the prospects for inflation and a surge in bond yields sent investors fleeing equities on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrials Average swooning almost 666 points, for its biggest daily percentage loss in 20 months. • Asian shares fell the most in over a year as fears of resurgent inflation battered bonds, toppled Wall Street from record highs and sparked speculation that central banks globally might be forced to tighten policy more aggressively. • The dollar steadied after rallying on upbeat U.S. jobs data, which sent bond yields surging on the prospects of increasing inflation and hammered equities. • A strong U.S. payrolls report on Friday raised concerns the Federal Reserve might hasten to increase interest rates to stem inflation, compounding a bond market rout that pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to a four-year high. • Oil prices extended declines from the end of last week on the back of a stronger dollar, with Brent crude falling to its lowest in nearly a month. • Gold prices inched down early on a firmer dollar after robust U.S. jobs data late last week, but a fall in equities cushioned losses.
