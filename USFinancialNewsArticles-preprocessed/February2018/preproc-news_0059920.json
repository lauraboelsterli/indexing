    "text": "Salesforce is set to report earnings for the fourth quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, which ended on Jan. 31, after the bell on Wednesday. The company will hold a conference call with analysts at 5 p.m. Eastern time. \n\nHere's what Wall Street expects: \nEarnings: 33 cents per share (excluding certain items) as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $2.81 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. \"Multiple industry sources have suggested to us that Salesforce seems to have achieved its internal sales goals well in advance of the end of the quarter,\" JMP Securities analysts Patrick Walravens and Mathew Spencer said in a Feb. 21 note. \nIn terms of guidance, analysts are expecting Salesforce to forecast 37 cents, excluding certain items, on $2.9 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. \nMizuho analysts Abhey Lamba and Parthiv Varadarajan believe the company could raise its revenue guidance for its 2019 fiscal year, they wrote in a Wednesday note. \"Initial EPS outlook could indicate upside from a lower tax rate,\" the analysts wrote. Other tech companies, like Cisco and Intel , have said they expect lower tax rates as a result of recently enacted U.S. tax reform. \nIn the quarter Salesforce announced a strategic partnership with Google and deepened its IBM partnership. \nSalesforce stock is up about 15 percent since the beginning of the year, and it hit a new 52-week high during trading hours on Wednesday. \nProgramming Note: For more on Salesforce.com, watch \"Mad Money\" host Jim Cramer's interview with Chairman and CEO Marc Benioff tonight at 6 p.m. Eastern time. \nThis is breaking news.
