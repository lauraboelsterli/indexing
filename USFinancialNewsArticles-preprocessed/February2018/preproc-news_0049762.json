Production averaged 37,405 boepd in 2017.\nThe company estimates total unit operating expenditure to fall about 6 percent to $24 per boe in 2018 and cash capital expenditure to be about 32 percent lower at about $250 million.\nEnQuest expects to begin reducing its debt of about $2 billion, helped by the higher operating cash flow and lower capital expenditure.\nSpending on Kraken was also further reduced by about $100 million and the project’s cost is now expected to be about $2.3 billion, 25 percent lower than its original budget in 2013.\nReuters reported in January that EnQuest hired investment bank Jefferies to advise on a sale of a 20 percent stake in Kraken.
