    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Century Aluminum Company (NASDAQ:CENX) President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Bless issued the following statement today in response to the release of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Section 232 report detailing the impact of imported aluminum on the national security of the United States:\n“We strongly support today’s release by the Department of Commerce of the Section 232 Aluminum Report. The report demonstrates this administration’s clear recognition that swift action is required to stop the surge of aluminum imports from destroying our industry. Aluminum is vital to our national security. Today we face a flood of imports—and that will only accelerate without immediate relief. We call on President Trump to act swiftly and boldly to save the American aluminum industry. We look forward to working with the administration to address this crisis.”\nAbout Century Aluminum\nCentury Aluminum Company owns primary aluminum capacity in the United States and Iceland.
