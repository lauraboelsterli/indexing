    "text": "February 28, 2018 / 8:02 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Kyrgios bemused by lack of action on Gavrilova tantrum Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - Outspoken Australian Nick Kyrgios has bemoaned a recent outburst by Daria Gavrilova, saying that he would have been “banned for six years” had he behaved in a similar manner to his compatriot. Gavrilova lost her temper during a match against American Madison Brengle at the Acapulco Open on Monday, the Australian throwing her racket after misfiring on a serve and nearly hitting a ballkid. The racket then bounced up and slammed into the umpire’s chair, yet Gavrilova escaped punishment and went on to win the match 4-6 6-3 6-3. Kyrgios, known for tantrums and controversial moments of his own, tweeted a video of the incident and wrote: “I would be banned for 6 years and been on every paper and news channel for the next month.” American Coco Vandeweghe, who has also found herself in trouble with tennis authorities, appeared to support Kyrgios with a reply to his tweet that included an emoji of a woman shrugging. “Double standards everywhere,” she commented.
