    "text": "ELKHART, Ind., Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- LCI Industries (NYSE: LCII) (\"LCI\", or the \"Company\"), a supplier of components for the leading original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") of recreational vehicles (\"RVs\") and adjacent industries, and the related aftermarkets of those industries, today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results.\n\"We exceeded $2.1 billion in net sales in 2017, just four years after reaching $1 billion,\" stated Jason Lippert, LCI's Chief Executive Officer. \"We are achieving record top and bottom line numbers, and we are doing it at a time when labor and materials environments are particularly challenging. Our continuing growth story is a testament to the focus of our more than 11,000 team members.\"\n\"The RV industry growth trend in 2017 remained strong as wholesale RV shipments were up 19 percent in the fourth quarter,\" continued Jason Lippert. \"RV sales momentum has continued as the industry attracts a new generation of RV enthusiasts, supported by strong economic growth and the expected economic tailwind of the recent tax law changes. Orders appear to be strong going into 2018 as dealer sentiment remains bullish, as evidenced by the recent Tampa RV show, and OEMs continue to add capacity to meet demand. We also continue to see strong growth in our aftermarket and adjacent market sales. Aftermarket sales reached $171 million in 2017, up 31 percent from 2016. We remain optimistic, as January 2018 consolidated net sales are approximately $205 million, 35 percent higher than January 2017.\"\n\"Strong industry growth and new products drove our 2017 growth,\" said Scott Mereness, LCI's President. \"Our content per travel trailer and fifth-wheel increased 8 percent year-over-year, the largest annual increase since 2012, and our content per motorhome increased 10 percent year-over-year, representing our fourth straight year of double-digit content growth for motorhomes. Recent acquisitions contributed $42 million in net sales in 2017, and we anticipate the recent acquisition of Taylor Made Group will add revenue of $154 million in 2018.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nConsolidated net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $547 million, a 36 percent increase over 2016 fourth quarter net sales of $403 million. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $17.5 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to net income of $26.3 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a one-time non-cash charge of $13.2 million ($0.52 per diluted share) related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\"). Excluding the estimated impact of the TCJA, adjusted net income was $30.7 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $26.3 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016, as referenced in the \"Supplementary Information Non-GAAP Measures\" section.\nThe increase in year-over-year net sales reflects industry-wide growth in wholesale shipments of towable and motorized RVs by OEMs, which increased 20 percent and 16 percent, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, enhanced by solid growth in content per unit and acquisitions. Net sales from acquisitions completed by the Company over the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 contributed $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The organic growth rate was 31 percent for the fourth quarter and acquisitions provided the remainder of the 36 percent increase. Through continued focus on aftermarket channels for the Company's products, the Company increased net sales to the aftermarket in the fourth quarter of 2017 by 36 percent to $41 million.\nThe health of the RV industry is determined by retail demand, which is up 11 percent through November, as reported by Statistical Surveys, Inc, and will likely be revised upwards in future months as various states report. Based on the retail sales strength experienced through the first eleven months of 2017, as well as sales order backlogs reported by RV OEMs at record levels, the current outlook from several RV OEMs and their dealer networks remains very positive. The RVIA's current forecast for 2018 estimates a year-over-year increase of three percent to approximately 521,000 units.\nThe Company's content per travel trailer and fifth-wheel RV for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, increased $241 to $3,263, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, of $3,022. This is the largest increase in five years for travel trailer and fifth-wheel RV content. The Company's content per motorhome RV for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, increased $208 to $2,219, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, of $2,011. The content increases are a result of organic growth, including new product introductions.\n2017 Full-Year Results\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to a record $2.1 billion, 28 percent higher than the net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1.7 billion. Acquisitions completed by the Company in 2017 added $42 million in net sales in 2017. An 18 percent increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth-wheel RVs, LCI's primary OEM market, as well as increased content per RV unit, positively impacted net sales growth in 2017. Further, the Company organically increased sales to adjacent industries and the aftermarket.\nNet income for the full-year 2017 increased to $132.9 million, or $5.24 per diluted share, up from net income of $129.7 million, or $5.20 per diluted share, in 2016. Net income in 2017 included a one-time non-cash charge of $13.2 million ($0.52 per diluted share) related to the estimated impact of the TCJA. Excluding the estimated impact of the TCJA, adjusted net income was $146.1 million, or $5.76 per diluted share, in 2017 compared to $129.7 million or $5.20 per diluted share in 2016, as referenced in the \"Supplementary Information Non-GAAP Measures\" section.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 60 percent and 38 percent for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 35 percent for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $13.2 million ($0.52 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and $0.52 per diluted share in 2017) related to enactment of the TCJA which resulted in the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Excluding the one-time charge, the Company's effective tax rate was 30 percent and 31 percent for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, as referenced in the \"Supplementary Information Non-GAAP Measures\" section.\nThe one-time charge related to the TCJA is a provisional amount based on the Company's current estimates. The final impact of the TCJA is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance, and may differ materially due to factors such as further revisions to the Company's calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that the Company has made, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Government, and actions the Company may take, among other items.\nBalance Sheet and Other Items\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's cash balance was $26 million, a decrease of $60 million from its cash balance of $86 million at the beginning of the year, primarily as a result of $61 million used for acquisitions, $87 million for capital expenditures and $51 million of dividend payments in 2017, offset by operating cash flows. The Company's outstanding debt was $50 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nConference Call & Webcast\nLCI will provide an online, real-time webcast of its fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call on the Company's website, www.lci1.com/investors , on Thursday, February 8, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.\nInstitutional investors can access the call via the password-protected site, StreetEvents ( www.streetevents.com ).

The charge resulted from the re-measurement of the Company's deferred tax assets considering the TCJA's newly enacted tax rates. This provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of enactment of the TCJA. This item represents a significant charge that impacted the Company's financial results. Net income, earnings per diluted share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which the Company provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company's operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for this item is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of this item may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lci-industries-reports-2017-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results-300595475.html\nSOURCE LCI Industries",
