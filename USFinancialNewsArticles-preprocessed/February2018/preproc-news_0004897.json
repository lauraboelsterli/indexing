    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Landstar System, Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) reported net income of $64.8 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, in the 2017 fourth quarter on record revenue of $1.052 billion. Included in net income in the 2017 fourth quarter are one-time tax benefits of approximately $19.5 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, related to the Company’s reasonable estimate of the change in future tax rates on net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the deferred tax liabilities, the Company’s 2017 fourth quarter net income was $45.2 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.08, each of which would also have been quarterly records from continuing operations.\nRevenue for the 2017 fourth quarter represented the first quarter in the Company’s history to surpass $1 billion. The Company also established new quarterly records for gross profit (defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents) and operating income in the 2017 fourth quarter. Gross profit was $149.7 million and operating income was $70.0 million in the 2017 fourth quarter. Operating margin, representing operating income divided by gross profit, was 46.8 percent in the 2017 fourth quarter.\nTruck transportation revenue hauled by independent business capacity owners (“BCOs”) and truck brokerage carriers in the 2017 fourth quarter was $967.5 million, or 92 percent of revenue, compared to $832.2 million, or 93 percent of revenue, in the 2016 fourth quarter. Truckload transportation revenue hauled via van equipment in the 2017 fourth quarter was $634.4 million compared to $548.4 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. Truckload transportation revenue hauled via unsided/platform equipment in the 2017 fourth quarter was $309.5 million compared to $263.3 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. Revenue hauled by rail, air and ocean cargo carriers was $68.0 million, or\n6 percent of revenue, in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $48.7 million, or 5 percent of revenue, in the 2016 fourth quarter.\nFiscal year 2017 return on average shareholders’ equity was 29 percent and return on invested capital, representing net income divided by the sum of average equity plus average debt, was 24 percent. As previously disclosed, the Company announced that on December 11, 2017, its Board of Directors increased the number of shares of its common stock that the Company is authorized to purchase under its stock purchase program to 3,000,000 and also that its Board declared a special one-time cash dividend in the amount of $1.50 per share, that was paid on January 26, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 12, 2018. Currently, there are 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock available for purchase under Landstar’s authorized share purchase program. In addition, Landstar announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share payable on March 16, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2018. This represents a 50 percent increase to the Company’s previous quarterly dividend. It is currently the intention of the Board to pay dividends on a quarterly basis going forward.\nCommenting on Landstar’s 2017 fourth quarter results, Landstar’s President and CEO Jim Gattoni said, “The 2017 fourth quarter was a historic quarter for the Company as it represented the first quarter ever that the Company exceeded $1 billion in revenue. The Company also set quarterly records in the 2017 fourth quarter for many other financial metrics. Revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share were all quarterly records. The number of loads hauled via truck in the fourth quarter of 2017 was also an all-time Landstar quarterly record. 2017 fourth quarter revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share grew 18%, 13%, 10%, 64% and 64%, respectively, over the 2016 fourth quarter despite the 2016 fourth quarter having one additional week of operations. Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, net income and diluted earnings per share grew 14% and 15%, respectively, over the 2016 fourth quarter.”\nGattoni continued, “The number of loads hauled via truck in the 2017 fourth quarter increased 3 percent over the 2016 fourth quarter, driven by a 2 percent increase in the number of loads hauled via van equipment, a 4 percent increase in the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment and a 9 percent increase in LTL volume. As previously disclosed in the Company’s 2017 third quarter earnings press release dated October 25, 2017, the 2016 fourth quarter included an extra week and, in 2016, Christmas day fell on a Sunday, making the week including Christmas in 2016 more productive than years when Christmas falls on a weekday, as in 2017 when Christmas fell on a Monday. We estimate that the extra week, plus the increased productivity due to the timing of Christmas, added approximately 30,000 loads to the 2016 fourth quarter. Excluding these loads, we estimate that the number of loads hauled via truck in the 2017 fourth quarter exceeded the 2016 fourth quarter by approximately 10 percent. The number of loads hauled via railroads, ocean cargo carriers and air cargo carriers in the fourth quarter increased 9 percent over the 2016 fourth quarter.”\nGattoni further stated, “The pricing environment for our truckload services was strong throughout the 2017 fourth quarter. Industry-wide truck capacity was tight throughout the quarter resulting in year-over-prior-year increases in revenue per load on loads hauled via truck of 11 percent, 14 percent and 14 percent as compared to October, November and December of 2016, respectively.”\nGattoni further commented, “Landstar’s financial performance in fiscal year 2017 was the best in the Company’s history. Landstar set many annual financial and operational high water marks in 2017, including revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, truck loads and year end truck count provided by BCOs. Revenue in fiscal 2017 was approximately $3.6 billion, an annual record. Gross profit in 2017 was $544 million, also an annual record. Record revenue and gross profit in 2017 was provided on the strength of approximately 1,903,000 loads hauled via truck capacity, the highest number of loads hauled via truck in any year in Landstar history. Operating income in 2017 was an annual record of $244 million and represented year-over-year growth of 9 percent. Diluted earnings per share in 2017 was an annual record of $4.21 and represented year-over-year growth of 30 percent. Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, the Company’s fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share was $3.75, which also would have been an annual record. The year-over-year earnings growth rates are particularly impressive given a significant increase in the provision for incentive compensation in 2017 and the fact that 2016 had one additional week of operations compared to 2017. These 2017 achievements speak to the strength and depth of the Landstar network and ability to execute. I am extremely pleased by our continued organic load volume growth and our ability to continue to attract productive agents and capacity to the network.”\nGattoni further commented, “With respect to near term performance, during the first three weeks of 2018, we are experiencing growth in the number of loads hauled via truck in the high single-digit percentage range over the 2017 first quarter. I expect that trend to continue throughout the 2018 first quarter. As it pertains to revenue per load on loads hauled via truck, rates continue to be strong and I do not expect a significant change in the rate environment over the balance of the 2018 first quarter. As such, I expect revenue per load on loads hauled via truck in the 2018 first quarter to increase in a mid-teen percentage range over the 2017 first quarter. Assuming the current environment continues throughout the 2018 first quarter, I anticipate revenue for the 2018 first quarter to be in a range of $925 million to $975 million. Assuming that range of estimated revenue, I would anticipate 2018 first quarter diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.22 to $1.27 per share. The estimated range of diluted earnings per share assumes insurance and claims costs at 3.5 percent of BCO revenue, representing the historical annual average of insurance and claims costs to BCO revenue over the previous 5 years, and an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5 percent, prior to any discrete items that may occur in 2018.”\nLandstar will provide a live webcast of its quarterly earnings conference call tomorrow morning at 8:00 am ET.
