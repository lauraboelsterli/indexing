    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Panasas ®, the leader in performance scale-out network-attached storage (NAS), announced today that CRN ®, a brand of The Channel Company , has named Philip Crocker, senior director of global channel marketing and business development, to its prestigious list of 2018 Channel Chiefs. This win marks the third consecutive year that Crocker has been named a Channel Chief.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN's editorial staff for their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel-partner community and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding channel-partner programs.\nIn 2017, Crocker led a Panasas channel mix that represented close to 60 percent of overall sales, entered into 10 new strategic partnerships around the world and enabled three partners to raise their revenue by more than 200 percent.\nIn addition, Crocker expanded the 5-Star CRN-rated Panasas Accelerate partner program to offer global coverage within a single program. He also established a new Diamond Elite tier for partners selling more than $3 million of product and removed the entry threshold and ceiling on net new-business rebates. A five-percent rebate now applies to every net new dollar.\n\"I am truly honored to be recognized by such an esteemed organization as CRN,\" said Crocker. \"Providing the best possible customer experience is at the heart of everything we do, and our partners play a key role in fulfilling that promise. We continue to invest in the development of a hand-picked group of committed and laser-focused value-added resellers as we expand the global customer base for Panasas ActiveStor , the only plug-and-play parallel storage file system on the market.\"\n\"The executives on CRN's 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision, and commitment to the channel,\" said Robert Faletra, executive chairman of The Channel Company. \"These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel.
