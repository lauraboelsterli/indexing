    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Veritex Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:VBTX) (“Veritex” or “the Company”), the holding company of Veritex Community Bank, previously announced its financial results on January 29, 2018, which reflected an initial provisional purchase price accounting estimate for Veritex's deferred taxes recorded for the acquisition of Liberty Bancshares, Inc. (“Liberty”) that closed on December 1, 2017. Subsequent to reporting earnings, and in accordance with accounting guidance, Veritex made an update to the provisional estimate for the deferred taxes of Liberty and re-measured the updated provisional estimate at December 31, 2017, using the new effective tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The re-measurement resulted in a decrease in total assets and a decrease in net income of $1.1 million for the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2017, and a decrease in diluted earnings per share of $0.05 and $0.06 for the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nThe measurement period for Veritex to determine the fair values of acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities is the earlier of (i) twelve months from the date of the acquisition or (ii) as soon as Veritex receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not obtainable. As Veritex has only recorded provisional estimates for the Liberty and Sovereign Bancshares, Inc. acquisitions with respect to loans, bank premises, furniture and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and deferred taxes, any changes to these provisional estimates and re-measurement of deferred taxes could potentially have a further impact on our earnings.\nIn addition, the Company also early adopted ASU No. 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (ASU 2018-02). ASU 2018-02, issued in February 2018, provides for the reclassification of the effect of re-measuring deferred tax balances related to items within accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI\") to retained earnings resulting from the Tax Act. Veritex early adopted ASU 2018-02 and reclassified $227 thousand from AOCI to retained earnings.\nVeritex has included amended preliminary fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2017 results herein. Veritex has also amended its earnings presentation to reflect these amended results, which will be available on the Company’s website.\nAbout Veritex Holdings, Inc .\nHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, Veritex Holdings, Inc. is a bank holding company that conducts banking activities through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Veritex Community Bank, with currently twenty branch locations and one mortgage office throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and one branch in the Houston metropolitan area. Veritex Community Bank is a Texas state chartered bank regulated by the Texas Department of Banking and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nFor more information, visit www.veritexbank.com\nMedia Contact:\nLaVonda Renfro\n972-349-6200\nlrenfro@veritexbank.com\nInvestor Relations:\nSusan Caudle\n972-349-6132\nscaudle@veritexbank.com\nThis release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include information regarding Veritex’s future financial performance, business and growth strategy, projected plans and objectives, and related transactions, integration of the acquired businesses, ability to recognize anticipated operational efficiencies, and other projections based on macroeconomic and industry trends, which are inherently unreliable due to the multiple factors that impact economic trends, and any such variations may be material. Such forward-looking statements are based on various facts and derived utilizing important assumptions, current expectations, estimates and projections about Veritex and its subsidiaries, any of which may change over time and some of which may be beyond Veritex’s control. Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “plans” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “should,” “would,” “may” and “could” are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts, although not all forward-looking statements include the foregoing. Further, certain factors that could affect our future results and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to whether Veritex can: successfully implement its growth strategy, including identifying acquisition targets and consummating suitable acquisitions; continue to sustain internal growth rate; provide competitive products and services that appeal to its customers and target market; difficult market conditions and unfavorable economic trends in the United States generally, and particularly in the market areas in which Veritex operates and in which its loans are concentrated, including the effects of declines in housing markets; an increase in unemployment levels and slowdowns in economic growth; Veritex's level of nonperforming assets and the costs associated with resolving any problem loans including litigation and other costs; changes in market interest rates may increase funding costs and reduce earning asset yields thus reducing margin; the impact of changes in interest rates and the credit quality and strength of underlying collateral and the effect of such changes on the market value of Veritex's investment securities portfolio; the credit risk associated with the substantial amount of commercial real estate, construction and land development, and commercial loans in our loan portfolio; the extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination governing almost every aspect of Veritex's operations including changes in regulations affecting financial institutions, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations being issued in accordance with this statute and potential expenses associated with complying with such regulations; Veritex's ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements, including our ability to generate liquidity internally or raise capital on favorable terms, including continued access to the debt and equity capital markets; possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations; the effects of weather and natural disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, tornadoes and hurricanes as well as effects from geopolitical instability and manmade disasters including terrorist attacks; and achieve its performance goals. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to “Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in Veritex’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 10, 2017 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Veritex’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Veritex’s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Veritex anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Veritex does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, Veritex cannot assess the impact of each factor on Veritex’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this communication are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that Veritex or persons acting on Veritex’s behalf may issue. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.\nVERITEX HOLDINGS, INC.

Total noninterest-bearings deposits and total deposits at December 31, 2017 include branch liabilities held for sale of $39.4 million and $64.3 million, respectively. We calculate our average assets and average equity for a period by dividing the sum of our total assets or total stockholders’ equity, as the case may be, at the close of business on each day in the relevant period, by the number of days in the period. We have calculated our return on average assets and return on average equity for a period by dividing net income for that period by our average assets and average equity, as the case may be, for that period. Net interest margin represents net interest income, annualized on a fully tax equivalent basis, divided by average interest-earning assets. Efficiency ratio represents noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. Accruing loans 90 or more days past due excludes $3.3 million of PCI loans acquired from Sovereign as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017. No PCI loans were considered non-performing loans as of December 31, 2017.\nVERITEX HOLDINGS, INC.
