    "text": "BOULDER, Colo., Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gaia, Inc. (NASDAQ:GAIA), a conscious community and media company, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter\n80% subscriber growth generated 94% increase in streaming revenues Total revenues up 77% Gross margin up 50 basis points to 86.2%\n2017 vs. 2016\nSubscriber count grew to 364,500 with a 78% increase in streaming revenues Total revenues up 64% Gross margin up 260 basis points to 86.1%\n“The fourth quarter was highlighted by achieving our 80% subscriber growth rate target we announced in mid-2016, with lower than expected customer acquisition costs, resulting in another sequential quarter of declining operating losses,” said Jirka Rysavy, Gaia’s CEO. “Subscriber growth rate accelerated from 73% in the third quarter and 52% in the year-ago quarter.”\nGaia’s paying subscriber count increased 80% to 364,500 on December 31, 2017, from 202,300 on December 31, 2016. This is 300% higher than in the third quarter of 2015 when Gaia operated profitably, but with only 20% revenue growth.\nDuring the quarter, Gaia grew its geographic subscriber footprint to over 170 countries, expanded its Spanish library, and launched Gaia in German and French.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenues in the fourth quarter increased 77% to $8.4 million from $4.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. This was due to 94% growth in streaming revenues, which was driven by the 80% increase in paying subscribers versus December 31, 2016, achieving the company’s target for the year.\nGross profit in the fourth quarter increased 78% to $7.3 million compared to $4.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin increased 50 basis points to 86.2% from 85.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to increased revenues and the related leverage on streaming costs and Gaia media library investments.\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $13.4 million compared to $9.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to the planned increase in marketing expenses associated with the announced acceleration of subscriber growth throughout 2017. Customer acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue declined to 87% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 95% in the same year-ago quarter, despite increasing the subscriber growth rate to 80% in the current quarter from 52% in the year-ago quarter.\nWhile accelerating the year-over-year growth rate, the company continued the trend of declining quarterly losses before income taxes during 2017 from $6.8 million in the first quarter, to $6.3 million in the second quarter, to $5.8 million in the third quarter and $5.7 million in the fourth quarter.\n2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenues in 2017 increased 64% to $28.3 million from $17.2 million in 2016. This was due to 78% growth in streaming revenues, which was driven by the 80% increase in paying subscribers versus December 31, 2016.\nGross profit in 2017 increased 69% to $24.4 million compared to $14.4 million in 2016. Gross margin increased 260 basis points to 86.1% from 83.5% in 2016 due to increased revenues and the related leverage on streaming costs and Gaia media library investments.\nTotal operating expenses in 2017 were $49.5 million compared to $31.0 million in 2016. The increase was due to the planned increase in marketing expenses associated with the acceleration of subscriber growth throughout 2017.\nNet loss in 2017 was $23.3 million or $1.54 per share, compared to net income of $87.1 million or $4.39 per share in 2016, which reflected the $114.5 million gain on the sale of the Gaiam branded business and the company’s repurchase of approximately 40% of its outstanding common stock in July 2016.\nAs Gaia had $32.8 million in cash.\nConference Call\nGaia is hosting a conference call today, February 26, 2018, beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET (2:30 p.m. MT).
