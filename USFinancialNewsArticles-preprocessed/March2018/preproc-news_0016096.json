    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Loma Negra (NYSE: LOMA) (BYMA: LOMA) (“Loma Negra” or the “Company”), the leading cement producer in Argentina, today announced results for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017.\n4Q17 Key Highlights 1\nCement, masonry & lime sales volume in Argentina up 14.0% YoY driven by continued market recovery. Net revenue up 57.1% YoY to Ps.4,452 million (US$254 million) on volume and price increases. Gross profit up 56.8%, with margin relatively stable YoY at 29.1%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 56.8% YoY to Ps.1,199 million (US$68 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin flat YoY at 26.9%, and up 280 basis points from 24.1% in 3Q17. Excluding one-time gains in both quarters, Adjusted EBITDA margin would have increased 137 bps to 25.4%. Net Debt at year-end down 66.8% to Ps.1,184 million (US$63 million) with Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.30x compared with 1.50x a year ago, reflecting Ps.1,867 million in net IPO proceeds.\nFY17 Key Highlights 1\nTotal cement, masonry & lime sales volume up 18.6%, with Argentine operations increasing 8.9% to 6.42 million tons, while Yguazu Cementos in Paraguay contributed with 0.57 million tons. Net revenue up 54.8% to Ps.15,287 million (US$923 million) driven by continued market recovery. Gross profit increased 70.0%, with gross margin expanding 259 basis points year-over-year to 29.0%. Adjusted EBITDA up 67.7% to Ps.3,942 million (US$238 million) and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 199 basis points to 25.8%.\nCommenting on 2017, Sergio Faifman, Loma Negra’s Chief Executive Officer, noted: “2017 was a pivotal year for Loma Negra marked by achieving significant milestones. Key events for the Company last year included; volume and sales expansion benefitting from the economic momentum in Argentina, record EBITDA, commenced expansion of the L’Amalí plant and ending the year with the successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) – the largest Argentine IPO in almost 25 years and the largest ever for a cement company.”\n“Loma Negra’s 4Q17 cement segment in Argentina sales volume was up 14% compared to the same period of 2016, accelerating pace from the 9% expansion in the previous quarter. This volume growth, combined with higher prices, ongoing cost control, along with scale and efficiency gains, resulted in a 57% increase in EBITDA.”\n“We enter 2018 with good momentum as we expect the Argentinean economic recovery to continue, particularly the construction sector – both private and infrastructure - driving increasing demand for cement, albeit not as fast following the significant recovery experienced in 2017, sustaining our expansion plans.”\n“With the proceeds from the IPO, the Company’s financial position has been enhanced and we are moving ahead with the expansion of the L’Amalí plant. This project will expand cement production capacity by 40% when completed in the beginning of 2020, further strengthening our competitive position with improved efficiency and profitability and ability to participate in the many infrastructure projects being undertaken in Argentina.”\n1 Unless otherwise stated, all financial figures discussed in this announcement are prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” and represent comparisons between the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017, and the equivalent three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016.

(Yguazu Cementos), achieving control and 51% of ownership in the Paraguayan cement company. Accordingly, considering that the consolidation was not deemed significant for the 10-day period ended December 31, 2016, until December 31, 2016, Loma Negra’s ownership in Yguazu Cementos was accounted for by the equity method and results of operations of Yguazú Cementos were recorded under the line item “Share of profit (loss) of associates”. Starting January 1, 2017, Loma Negra began to fully consolidate Yguazu Cementos’ results on a line by line basis.\nOverview of Operations\nSales Volumes\nTable 2: Loma Negra Sales Volumes Three-months ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Cement, masonry & lime Argentina MM Tn 1.76 1.54 14.0% 6.42 5.89 8.9% Paraguay MM Tn 0.13 - n.m.\n0.57 - n.m.\nCement, masonry & lime total 1.89 1.54 22.5% 6.99 5.89 18.6% Argentina: Concrete MM m 3 0.24 0.16 53.8% 0.82 0.60 36.6% Railroad MM Tn 1.29 1.22 6.3% 4.98 4.64 7.2% Aggregates MM Tn 0.28 0.26 7.2% 1.07 0.97 10.1%\nTotal cement, masonry and lime sales volumes in Argentina increased 14.0% YoY in 4Q17 to 1.76 million tons, driven by increased construction activity both in infrastructure and private consumption. This, along with the 0.13 million tons contribution from Yguazú Cementos, resulted in a 22.5% increase in total volume for the quarter.\nIn Argentina, concrete volumes were up 53.8% to 0.24 million m 3 reflecting the strong pick-up in public infrastructure in our markets - the city of Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires as well in as the city of Rosario, province of Santa Fe. Aggregates volumes notwithstanding strong demand saw growth constrained to 7.2% to 0.28 million tons due to capacity constrains. A new crusher is anticipated to begin production in 2Q18, which will enable the Company to double production capacity of Aggregates.\nOur railroad subsidiary, Ferrosur, reported sales volumes rose 6.3% YoY reaching 1.29 million tons as a result of increased transportation activity in the period.\nFor FY17 Loma Negra reported an 18.6% increase in total cement, masonry and lime sales volumes. In Argentina, volumes rose 8.9%, with concrete increasing 36.6%. Yguazú Cementos, which was fully consolidated starting January 1, 2017, contributed with 0.57 million tons in sales volumes.\nReview of Financial Results\nTable 3: Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss (amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) Three-months ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Net revenue 4,452 2,834 57.1 % 15,287 9,874 54.8 % Cost of sales (3,157 ) (2,008 ) 57.2 % (10,850 ) (7,265 ) 49.4 % Gross Profit 1,295 826 56.8 % 4,436 2,610 70.0 % Share of profit (loss) of associates - (9 ) -100.0 % - 37 -100.0 % Selling and administrative expenses (347 ) (303 ) 14.6 % (1,199 ) (929 ) 29.0 % Other gains and losses 82 109 -25.0 % 79 124 -36.5 % Tax on debits and credits to bank accounts (59 ) (34 ) 73.3 % (188 ) (140 ) 34.3 % Finance costs, net Exchange rate differences (98 ) (60 ) 63.1\n% (313 ) (261 ) 19.9\n% Financial income 65 15 334.2\n% 104 41 152.3\n% Financial expenses (134 ) (186 ) -28.2\n% (633 ) (721 ) -12.3\n% Profit before tax 805 359 124.4\n% 2,286\n760 200.9\n% Income tax expense Current (194 ) (126 ) 54.1\n% (651 ) (239 ) 172.8\n% Deferred 82 (8 ) n.m. 66 (19 ) n.m.

Accordingly, considering that the consolidation was not deemed significant for the 10-day period ended December 31, 2016, until December 31, 2016, Loma Negra’s ownership in Yguazu Cementos was accounted for by the equity method and results of operations of Yguazú Cementos were recorded under the line item “Share of profit (loss) of associates”. Starting January 1, 2017, Loma Negra began to fully consolidate Yguazu Cementos’ results on a line by line basis. Net Revenues\nNet revenue for 4Q17 increased 57.1% to Ps.4,452 million, from Ps.2,834 million in 4Q16, mainly driven by higher volumes sold across all segments along with increased prices. Revenues from Argentina grew 47.1%, or Ps.1,335 million, while Yguazú Cementos contributed with Ps.284 million.\nFor FY17, net revenues rose 54.8% to Ps.15,287 million. Revenues in Argentina grew 43.1%, or Ps.4,259 million, while revenues at Yguazú Cementos reached Ps.1,153 million in revenues from during the year.\nCost of Sales & Gross Profit\nCost of sales increased 57.2% YoY to Ps.3,157 million in 4Q17, reflecting the greater sales volume, cost inflation, particularly wages and maintenance costs, together with thermal energy cost, and the contribution of Ps.201 million in costs from Yguazú Cementos. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales remained unchanged YoY at 70.9% and declined from the 72.1% reported in 3Q17 as third quarter results are typically impacted by higher seasonal thermal and electricity costs experienced during winter months.\nCost of Sales in the Argentinean business grew by 38.3%, mainly due to higher thermal along with increased wages and maintenance costs. As a percentage of revenues, however, cost of sales in Argentina remained stable at 70.9%.\nAs a result, Gross profit rose 56.8% to Ps.1,295 million from Ps.826 million in 4Q16, with gross margin relatively flat YoY at 29.1%. Sequentially, however, gross margin expanded by 120 basis points from 27.9% in 3Q17. Gross profit in Argentina increased 46.7% to Ps.1,212 million in 4Q17, with gross profit margin stable at 29.1%.\nDuring FY17, gross profit rose 70%, with gross margin expanding 259 basis points to 29.0% from 26.4% in FY16, benefiting from scale and ongoing efficiency gains. Argentina posted a 56.6% increase in gross profit in FY17 reaching Ps.4,087 million, with gross profit margin expanding 249 basis points to 28.9%.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses (SG&A) rose 14.6% YoY, to Ps.347 million in 4Q17 from Ps.303 million in 4Q16, mainly reflecting higher sales volumes. SG&A for the Argentine operations grew by 10.6%, while the consolidation of Yguazú Cementos contributed with Ps.12 million in SG&A. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A declined 290 basis points to 7.8% from 10.7% in the year-ago period as the Company continues to enjoy the benefits of scale and operational leverage.\nDuring FY17, SG&A in absolute values increased 29.0% from the year-ago levels, but as a percentage of sales contracted by 157 basis points to 7.8%, from 9.4% in FY16. SG&A for the Argentine operations increased 24.4% YoY to Ps.1,156 million, representing 8.2% of revenues, compared with 9.4% in FY16. SG&A at Yguazú Cementos reached Ps. 42.9 million in FY17, reaching 3.7% of revenues.\nNet Profit and Net Profit Attributable to Owners of the Company\nDuring 4Q17, the Company achieved Net Profit of Ps.692 million, representing a 207.7% increase from Ps.225 million reported in the year-ago period. Net Profit also benefited from the increase in Loma Negra’s equity interest in Yguazú Cementos. The effective tax rate declined to 14% in 4Q17 from 37% in 4Q16, reflecting an adjustment in deferred taxes in Argentina resulting from the recent Tax Reform which reduced the income tax rate from 35% to 30% in 2018 and 2019, and to 25% thereafter; and the consolidation of Yguazu Cementos which has a 10% income tax rate.\nNet Profit Attributable to Owners of the Company for the quarter rose 221.2% YoY, or Ps.458 million, to Ps.665 million. Earnings per common share were Ps.1.14 in 4Q17, compared with earnings per share of Ps.0.37 for the same period last year.\nDuring FY17, Net Profit Attributable to Owners of the Company increased 223.9% YoY, to Ps.1,591 million, from Ps.491 million in FY16.\nAdjusted EBITDA & Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nTable 4: Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation & Margin (amounts expressed in millions of pesos, unless otherwise noted) Three-months ended\nDecember 31,\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation: Net profit 692 225 207.7%\n1.700 502 238.7%\n(+) Financial interest, net 63 116 -46.2%\n441 572 -22.9%\n(+) Income tax expense 112 134 -16.0%\n586 258 127.2%\n(+) Depreciation and amortization 168 140 19.9%\n626 509 22.9%\n(+) Exchange rate differences 98 60 63.1%\n313 261 19.9%\n(+) Other financial expenses, net 6 55 -88.6%\n88 108 -18.4%\n(+) Tax on debits and credits to bank accounts 59 34 73.3%\n188 140 34.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA 1.199 765 56.8%\n3.942 2.350 67.7%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 26,9% 27,0% -6bps 25,8% 23,8% +199bps Adjusted EBITDA increased 56.8% year-over-year in 4Q17 reaching Ps.1,199 million, driven mainly by the combination of expanding revenues from continued growth in sales volumes and prices, good cost control and higher operational leverage, along with the consolidation of Yguazú Cementos in 2017, which contributed with Adjusted EBITDA of Ps.120 million in the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin remained relatively unchanged YoY at 26.9%. Sequentially, however, Adjusted EBITDA Margin expanded 280 basis points from 24.1% in 3Q17, as the business in Argentina continues to expand.\nDuring 4Q16 the Company reported one-time gains of Ps.84.4 million from Ferrosur Roca’s canon (concession fee) recovery and Ps.69.3 million related to the international equity offering, both included under the other income line. Excluding these one-time items, Adjusted EBITDA would have increased 66%, with Adjusted EBITDA Margin expanding 137 bps to 25.4%.\nBy geography, Argentina reported a 41.0% year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA reaching Ps.1,078 million in 4Q17, with Adjusted EBITDA margin contracting 111 basis points to 25.9% in 4Q17 reflecting one-time gains in both quarters. Excluding the one-items discussed above, Adjusted EBITDA in Argentina would have increase 20 basis points to 24.2% from 24.0% in 4Q16. Sequentially, Adjusted EBITDA margin in Argentina expanded 325 basis points, from 22.6% in 3Q17, driven by higher sales and operating leverage. Paraguay, in turn, contributed with Ps.120 million in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 42.4% in 4Q17.\nOn a full-year basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased 67.7% and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 199 basis points to 25.8% from 23.8% in 2016.
