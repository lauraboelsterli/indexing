Sources told Reuters last month that the project has drawn interest from a number of infrastructure and pension funds, including Australia’s Macquarie ( MQG.AX ), Switzerland’s Partners Group ( PGHN.S ) and Denmark’s PFA Pension. Innogy parent RWE ( RWEG.DE ) and rival E.ON ( EONGn.DE ) over the weekend announced plans to divide up the operations of the Germany energy company. ($1 = 0.7211 pounds)",
