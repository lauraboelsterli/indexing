    "text": "We hear it all the time; job security is becoming increasingly elusive. Advances in technology mean that the job you do today may not be the job you do in a few years' time. A decade from now, it may not exist at all.\nLess clear, however, is how to prepare for that and make sure you adapt alongside the changes.\nBusinesses and governments have a role to play, of course, but it also comes down to individuals' abilities to learn new skills.\nAccording to Orit Gadiesh, chairman of global management consultancy Bain & Company, that means learning to be curious.\n\"If you're curious... it will allow you constantly to question things, to learn more about things, to connect dots,\" Gadiesh told CNBC's \"Life Hacks Live\" at YPO Edge in Singapore .\nDoing that means you'll be able to grow your skill set beyond your specific job role, she said.\n\"Everybody becomes a specialist in the field they choose. But I do believe that if you do that you're going to get yourself trapped,\" Gadiesh said.\n\"You're also not going to be as good as if you open yourself up to understanding some other domains and being curious.\"\nGadiesh credited her curiosity for helping her work with diverse groups of people and becoming an effective leader.\nOriginally from Israel, she relocated to the U.S. to study for her MBA at Harvard Business School and is known for her role in turning around Bain & Co after a series of setbacks.\nShe noted that curiosity comes more naturally to some than to others, but said everybody should try to embrace it.\n\"It's fun for a lot of people but it's also going to be essential,\" she said.\nBain & Co employs some 8,000 staff and also provides employment advice to other leading businesses.\nGadiesh described automation as a \"real issue\" for people and businesses, and said that the ability to learn will soon be the most valuable asset.\n\"This education of learning how to learn, as opposed to learning a certain set of skills that you think are going to be a good set of skills for a long time, is going to become more important because the skills will change,\" Gadiesh noted.\nLike this story?
