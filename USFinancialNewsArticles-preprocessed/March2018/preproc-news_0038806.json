    "text": "March 21, 2018 / 1:37 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Deutsche Bank sees $550 million first-quarter headwind from strong euro, funding costs   FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A strong euro and higher funding costs have created a 450 million euro ($552.92 million) headwind for Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) in the first quarter of the year, the German lender’s finance chief said on Wednesday. The cash desk sign of a nearby car park is pictured next to the head quarters of Germany's largest business bank, Deutsche Bank, in Frankfurt, Germany, January 29, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach James von Moltke, the bank’s chief financial officer, said that a stronger euro was turning out to be a 300 million euro drag on the investment bank, while the cost of funding was a 150 million euro drag. “We do have a headwind on a year-on-year comparison before you get to business performance of about 450 million euros,” von Moltke said. Shares in the bank were down 5.1 percent at 1324 GMT. ($1 = 0.8139 euros)",
