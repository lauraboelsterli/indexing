    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, March 8 (Reuters) - Argentinaâ€™s central bank said it sold $123 million in the spot market on Thursday, its third intervention this week, after the peso currency hit a record intra-day low at 20.45 per U.S. dollar.\nThat sale was larger in volume than its two earlier interventions, and traders said this time the bank sold at various moments throughout the session. The peso rebounded to close up 0.2 percent at 20.35 per dollar. (Reporting by Jorge Otaola and Luc Cohen; editing by Diane Craft)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
