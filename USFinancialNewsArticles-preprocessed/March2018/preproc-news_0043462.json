    "text": "March 26, 2018 / 10:49 AM / Updated an hour ago Parliament will have a meaningful vote on Brexit deal- PM's spokesman Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - The British government has been clear that it will give parliament a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal it negotiates with Brussels, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said on Monday. The opposition Labour Party has called for parliament to be given a wider range of options beyond either accepting the Brexit deal, or leaving the bloc without a deal. “The government’s position on this is very clear which is that there will be a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal where parliament can choose to either accept that deal or we can leave without a deal, but we will be leaving the European Union on March 29, 2019,” the spokesman said.
