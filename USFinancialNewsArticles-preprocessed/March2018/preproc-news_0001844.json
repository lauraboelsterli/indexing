    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar held steady on Wednesday, recouping earlier losses tied to the exit of a top economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, which had raised concerns that tensions over a global trade war were entering a heightened phase.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Dollar banknotes are seen in this photo illustration taken February 12, 2018. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/Illustration Doubts among traders persist over whether Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum will be enacted, even after the White House signaled they would go into effect following the resignation of Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council.\nTraders also are looking to gauge the level of possible retaliation from the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other major U.S. trade partners if these stiff levies were to be implemented.\n“So far the reaction has been muted,” Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho in New York, said of the dollar. “(Cohn’s) resignation has signaled higher risk of a trade war.”\nCohn’s departure comes against the backdrop of steps by the Trump administration to assert protectionist policies, including withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, instigating a renegotiation of NAFTA and imposing hefty import tariffs on some targeted products.\nThe dollar and global stock markets initially sagged on the Cohn departure. The greenback staged a steady recovery during U.S. trading, while Wall Street shares pared initial losses.\nAt 11:44 a.m. (1644 GMT), the index that tracks the dollar versus six currencies .DXY rose 0.135 points or 0.15 percent, to 89.753, rebounding from an earlier low of 89.407.\n(GRAPHIC: JPY and CFTC - reut.rs/2CSTWkv )\nThe dollar’s bounce was further stoked by encouraging data on domestic private hiring and labor costs that reinforced the view of underlying strength in the U.S. economy. However, those figures were mitigated by a larger-than-forecast widening of the U.S. trade deficit in January.\nNevertheless, anxiety about a deterioration in global trade limited the dollar rebound with some traders favoring the yen as a safe haven, analysts said.\n“We therefore see the latest news as an additional reason to remain cautious on the outlook for the broad dollar,” Goldman Sachs economists Zach Pandl and Karen Reichgott wrote in a research note.\nThe dollar JPY= was down 0.02 percent at 106.09 yen. It held just above a 14-month low of 105.23 yen set last week, Reuters data showed.\nThe euro EUR= was last down 0.10 percent, at $1.2389.\nThe trade-weighted euro index EUREER=ECF hit 100.2565, the highest level since September 2014.\nAdditional reporting by Saikat Chatterjee in London; Editing by Jon Boyle and Meredith Mazzilli\n ",
