    "text": "Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant Aramco is expected to list public shares on the Saudi domestic stock market in the second half of this year, but a potential international listing could come later, according to sources familiar with the situation.\nCurrently, there is no international listing planned, but sources said the company continues to hope it will list in a foreign financial center some time next year. \n\"The Company continues to review options for the listing,\" Saudi Aramco said in a statement after the news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\"In addition to listing on Tadawul, the home exchange, a range of international options are still being held under active review. The Company will not provide a running commentary on the course of the IPO.\"\nSources said the Aramco listing will be much smaller than anticipated in the international market, and that an Asian cornerstone investor is likely to participate.\nThis story is developing. Please check back for updates.",
