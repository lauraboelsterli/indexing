It said in a statement that the measure was “in response to the provocative actions of the British side and unsubstantiated accusations” against Russia. \nPermission for the U.K. to open a general consulate in St. Petersburg, Russia, would be revoked and the British Council, a cultural and educational organization, would have to cease activities, the ministry said. \nThe move caps a week that has seen relations between the U.K. and Russia reach their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. Britain’s top diplomat on Friday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering the nerve-agent attack that left Sergei Skripal and his daughter fighting for their lives. In response, the U.K. government said it would expel 23 Russian diplomats and called off high-level contacts with Moscow. \nRead the full version of this article at WSJ.com. Most popular on WSJ.com",
