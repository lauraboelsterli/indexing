    "text": "2 COMMENTS “King Dollar” is official. Larry Kudlow used his first TV appearance since being appointed as President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser to argue for a strong dollar policy, telling CNBC that “a great country needs a strong currency.”\nIf greatness were gauged purely on the foreign exchanges, America would be merely middling. The dollar—measured against trading partners and adjusted for inflation—is slap-bang in line with its average value since President Richard Nixon broke the link between dollar and gold in the early 1970s. This isn’t about the huge swings in the greenback in the 1970s and 1980s: The dollar’s in line with the average over the last 20 years, too.\nThe dollar has also weakened since Mr. Trump came to power. The dollar, at least, hasn’t been made great again.\nAmericans should not panic about the currency’s fall in the last year, as most of it was due to the recovery of struggling foreign economies. A stronger euro because Europe is growing faster might make a trip to Paris more expensive, but it’s no reflection on the U.S.\nAmericans should be concerned about further falls, however: Mr. Trump’s policies could almost be designed to weaken the greenback.\nThe short-term challenges are the deficit-financed tax cuts and the idea that the economy can be made to grow without inflation, or, as Mr. Kudlow put it, “Just let it rip, for heaven’s sake.” Longer-term threats come from Mr. Trump’s inclination toward protectionism and his treatment of allies.\nThe tax cuts create two problems. They add fiscal stimulus to the economy at a time when it’s already running close to full capacity, encouraging inflation rather than real growth. More inflation means a weaker dollar, all else equal, to keep international prices unchanged.\nThe deficits run up by the tax cuts mean a flood of new government debt, much of which is financed by foreigners. To attract more buyers requires a mix of higher interest rates—offsetting the stimulus—and a weaker exchange rate to make the bonds and bills more attractive.\nLetting growth rip is a message to the Federal Reserve to ignore concerns about inflation, and allow a boom. Yet, investors surely would worry even more about inflation if the Fed were to suddenly reverse its arguments of the past year and become dovish again.\nMr. Kudlow can make these arguments because he’s a supply-sider , who believes tax cuts can be self-financing by encouraging stronger economic growth. It wasn’t true for Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts, which had more chance of succeeding both because they were better designed and because they came early in the economic cycle. It’s unlikely to be true for Mr. Trump’s tax package, either, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will add $1.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.\nStill, Mr. Kudlow might be proven right about more growth not being inflationary, or at least not as inflationary as in the past. In my view, inflation is on the way, because supply and demand means wages accelerate as the job market tightens. But it would be foolish to be too confident. It is true that people who had given up looking for work are starting again as jobs are more plentiful, increasing supply.\nIt is also true that companies say they plan more capital spending, and if they follow through—they haven’t yet—then productivity might pick up, helping to keep a lid on inflation. Add in price competition enabled by online retailing and global supply chains, and there are powerful forces holding down inflation. I still expect a pick-up in both wage and price inflation, but it’s easy to find evidence to support Mr. Kudlow on prices.\nOf course, the dollar isn’t just about the U.S. The currency might do better if growth fizzled in the rest of the world, a bad outcome for everyone. But from the U.S. side the policies being adopted aren’t helpful for the greenback.\nIn the long run, the dollar faces a challenge to its dominance from the rise of China. The renminbi is a long way from being a major reserve currency, but China is liberalizing access to its markets, so it is likely to become more widely held. As the biggest buyer of pretty much every raw material, China is in a good position to push commodity suppliers to price in renminbi, something they might consider once they become happy with the security of Chinese bonds.\nChina’s politics work against this. It’s a one-party state with scant regard for freedom, and it cares little about the international order. In a crisis, suppliers of reserve currencies need to help foreigners who use their money, as the U.S. did in 2008. Few could have faith that China would put concerns about the international order above its own self-interest. Yet, Mr. Trump has questioned NATO commitments in defense, threatened tariffs on his closest allies and promised to put America first.\nIt will be many years before China can challenge the dollar’s reserve-currency status, but it is becoming less hard to imagine. China, too, thinks it is a great country, and wants a reserve currency, if not necessarily a strong one.\nWrite to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.com",
