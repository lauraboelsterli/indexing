    "text": "37 COMMENTS CHENNAI, India—The U.S. government is trying to thwart Huawei Technologies Co.’s ascent in wireless technology, but the Chinese company is determined to prevail.\nFar from Washington, where the government has called Huawei a national security threat, the world’s largest maker of cellular-tower equipment is trying to guide the development and design of the next generation of mobile networks, dubbed 5G.\nHuawei is sending large teams to industry-sponsored meetings—including one held recently in this south India port city. Just as the home-movie industry agreed years ago on specifications for DVD players, wireless-technology companies are now meeting to establish 5G standards.\nHuawei representatives are swamping such conferences with recommendations for how the new system should work, leveraging the company’s large research-and-development budget and its growing workforce of skilled engineers, according to meeting attendees and outside analysts.\nThe U.S. and Europe, drawing on the expertise of Western firms, were the quickest to roll out today’s 3G and 4G mobile networks. Now, industry leaders say China, with Huawei’s leadership, is ahead in the race for the next stage.\n“5G will be made in China,” said Dimitris Mavrakis, a director at ABI Research.\nGlobal Powers Huawei has zoomed ahead of rivals in the telecom-equipment market.

But the industry, at meetings like the one held in Chennai, is still crafting the technical details about how 5G will actually work.\nSome companies are pushing certain standards that rely on technology they have the right to patent. Similarly, hardware manufacturers support standards that would accommodate products they have been developing.\nHuawei, which is also the world’s No. 3 smartphone maker, sent 40 representatives to the Chennai meeting, behind only the 41 from South Korean smartphone giant Samsung Electronics Co. , according to conference records. There were 30 delegates from San Diego-based chip maker Qualcomm Inc., while Huawei’s major wireless-equipment rivals, Sweden’s Ericsson AB and Finland’s Nokia Corp. , sent 25 and 18 representatives, respectively.\nRepresentatives from Chinese companies now hold 10 of the 57 chairman and vice chairman positions on decision-making panels at 3GPP, the France-based industry group overseeing the standard-setting process, according to Jefferies Group researchers.\nEven before the current 5G discussions, Huawei was ramping up its research and patenting efforts , nearly matching design contributions for 4G standards by Ericsson, the then-undisputed leader in wireless equipment.\nRelated \nStrong Smartphone Sales Drive Huawei Profit Growth New FCC Rule Would Step Up U.S. Fight Against China’s Huawei In U.S. Brawl With Huawei, Rural Cable Firms Are an Unlikely Loser Huawei, Seen as Possible Spy Threat, Boomed Despite U.S. Warnings Trial Over Theft of Wind Technology Spotlights U.S.-China Tensions Keyword: 5G Wireless Will Redraw the Wireless Industry Map: Who Stands to Lose? Huawei has been a leader in 5G-standards submissions to the specifications-setting consortium, according to early tallies. As of early 2017, it had submitted 234 contributions to 3GPP, compared with runner-up Ericsson’s 214, according to the latest data available from wireless-patent developer InterDigital Inc.\nHuawei said Friday its research-and-development budget rose 17% last year to $14.3 billion. That is more than the combined 2017 total for Ericsson and Nokia, which respectively spent $4.6 billion and $6 billion, though, unlike Huawei, neither has a major consumer business.\nU.S. leaders have made clear they are trying to prevent a world in which most telecom electronics are made by Huawei and its Chinese peers, fearing Beijing could spy , steal trade secrets or cast cyberattacks through them. A Huawei spokesman says the company is employee-owned and that no government has ever asked it to spy on or sabotage another country.\nA Trump administration panel stepped in earlier this month to block an attempt by Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd. to buy Qualcomm, saying a takeover could reduce Qualcomm’s research-and-development budget and the U.S. firm’s influence on 5G development. In a letter, the panel cited Huawei’s growing presence at meetings like the one in Chennai: “Chinese companies, including Huawei, have increased their engagement in 5G standardization working groups.”\nRelated Video The U.S. wireless industry is dominated by four major players: Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. Now that just about everyone has a cellphone, each operator is looking for new ways to grow. But how did we go from the days of one giant landline monopoly to four competitive cell companies? Illustration: Shaumbe Wright/WSJ After four days huddled over laptops in the conference rooms of a luxury hotel in Chennai, attendees set “new radio” specifications—standards that will dictate how the cellular towers of the future will talk to smartphones and other devices. About 400 telecom-industry representatives from 176 companies—mostly men, some sporting backpacks and short-sleeve dress shirts—hashed out the new rules between cigarette breaks in smoking rooms.\nWhile the group reached quick consensus on the radio specs, controversy flared over a procedural issue. Huawei and Ericsson representatives faced off over how many topics the conferences should tackle in meetings subsequent to a major gathering in June in San Diego.\nEricsson representatives argued the workload at the Chennai conferences was already too much, and submitted an official proposal to reduce the number of topics addressed in subsequent meetings. Huawei, meanwhile, proposed tackling more topics—a stance some attendees said works to the Chinese company’s advantage given the size of its delegation. \n“We don’t have the same amount of delegates,” Ericsson’s head of standardization, Jan Farjh, said in an interview this month prior to the meeting. “We do not intend to flood the process,” he said. “I think you compete with competence.”\nThe Huawei spokesman said the company “respects and follows the ... standardization principles where debate and disagreement among members are common.”\nEricsson and Huawei representatives each made their case to other delegates in the hotel hallways during breaks. By the time the major discussions ended and the hotel put on a traditional Indian dance performance, delegates had reached a compromise: They tentatively put about 20 topics on the group’s future agenda, according to attendees. That was more than Ericsson wanted, but fewer than Huawei had pushed.\nWrite to Newley Purnell at newley.purnell @wsj.com and Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com",
