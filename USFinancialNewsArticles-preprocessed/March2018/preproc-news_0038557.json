    "text": "Top News \nGSK and Pfizer \nGlaxoSmithKline has beaten a rival bid from Reckitt Benckiser for Pfizer’s healthcare business, according to a Financial Times report. The business, which includes products such as Advil painkillers and Centrum multivitamins, may be worth up to $20 billion, Pfizer hopes. It’s not clear if there were other bidders. GSK shares rose on the news, while Reckitt’s fell. FT \nNaspers and Tencent \nSouth Africa’s Naspers is selling 6% of its stake in the Chinese tech giant Tencent—a cash-in that’s worth a cool $10.6 billion. The media group has a 33.2% stake in Tencent, which will fall to 31.2%. Naspers made a very smart decision back in 2001 to put $32 million into the Chinese firm, giving it a stake that now has a value of $175 billion. Naspers said it will use the cash to “reinforce [its] balance sheet” and to invest in other things, like food delivery and fintech. Naspers \nYouTube vs. Guns \nYouTube has quietly introduced a ban on videos promoting or linking to sites that sell firearms and things like bump stocks. It’s also banned videos that show people how to assemble firearms. “While we’ve long prohibited the sale of firearms, we recently notified creators of updates we will be making around content promoting the sale or manufacture of firearms and their accessories,” the Google-owned platform said. Gun enthusiasts are not pleased. Bloomberg \nMusk’s Green Light \nTesla’s shareholders have approved Elon Musk’s controversial pay deal, which will see the CEO collect up to $2.6 billion if the company hits a series of valuation and sales targets. It also ensures that Musk will stay at the helm of Tesla for the next decade. The package attracted criticism from some investor groups over its size. The news of the approval sent Tesla’s shares up 3%. BBC Advertisement Around the Water Cooler \nThe Schrems Effect \nBloomberg has a pithy profile of Max Schrems, the young Austrian lawyer who has done more than any other individual to get companies such as Facebook—and really, Facebook in particular—to change their ways on the privacy front. It was Schrems who was responsible for sinking the transatlantic Safe Harbor data-sharing agreement, and he’s preparing fresh suits under his newly crowdfunded “None of Your Business” (NOYB) organization, once Europe’s new GDPR data protection law comes into effect in late May. Bloomberg \nAfrican Single Currency \nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa has backed the idea of a pan-African single currency. Ramaphosa said the move would help the continent wean itself off foreign currency. “We must rid ourselves of this colonial mentality that demands we rely on other people’s currency. Perhaps the day, the hour and the moment could have arrived for us to create a single African currency. Our focus should not be on our individual countries but the continent as a whole to unlock great opportunities and capabilities,” he told a meeting of the African Continental Free Trade Area business forum. Independent Online \nCryptocurrency Scrutiny \nThe U.K. government is launching a task force to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. The group will include the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority. Chancellor Philip Hammond said he is “committed to helping the sector grow and flourish.” The U.K. and Australia have also signed a “fintech bridge” agreement to let each other’s companies more easily access each other’s markets. CNBC \nSessions Probe \nBefore being sacked by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe reportedly authorized an investigation into whether Sessions lied to Congress. According to the Justice Department, Sessions didn’t know about the probe when he decided to fire McCabe. The investigation apparently ended without criminal charges.
