Wolfsburg striker Pernille Harder and Olympique Lyonnais midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsan, who finished behind Martens in the Player of the Year awards last year, were also in the team announced on International Women’s Day. “I am a little surprised that I received most votes of all players,” said Barcelona winger Martens. “Last year was very special. We achieved something beautiful with the Dutch national team. It says a lot that six Dutch players made the list of 55 most voted players.” Marozsan was one of four Lyon players in the list alongside England’s Lucy Bronze, and France’s Wendie Renard and Camille Abily. Germany’s Wolfsburg and U.S. side Orlando Pride had two representatives.

France’s Renard is the only player to feature in all three World XI teams so far.
