    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 9:26 AM / Updated 21 minutes ago Russia will remain a difficult partner for Europe: Maas Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russia will remain a difficult partner, said new German foreign minister Heiko Maas, reacting to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s re-election on Sunday and questioning its fairness. Poland's Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz and German counterpart Heiko Maas attend an European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, Belgium, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir The European Union must be able to continue to talk to Russia, despite a host of issues, he said. “The result of the election in Russia was as unsurprising to us as the circumstances of the election. We can’t talk about a fair political competition in all respects as we would understand it,” he told reporters, arriving at a monthly meeting of EU foreign ministers. “Russia will remain a difficult partner. But Russia will also be needed for solutions to the big international conflicts and so we want to remain in dialogue,” Maas said.
