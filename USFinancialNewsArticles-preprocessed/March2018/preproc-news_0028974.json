    "text": "0 COMMENTS STATUS UPDATES For @mansionsofthegildedage, Gary Lawrance digs up, and annotates, archival photos of opulent interiors and imposing exteriors of 19th- and early 20th-century homes built by Vanderbilts and Astors. A living chess game (humans in Middle Age regalia serve as pieces) at George “Jay” Gould’s estate epitomizes “the luxury and excess great wealth provided,” writes the Long Island architect and historian.\nONE-STORY HOUSES Realtor Sharlyn Anderson photographs long-in-the-tooth houses in her home state of Oregon, then writes dreamy first-person captions in the voice of fictional inhabitants at @weliveherenow_ . Of a house sporting a rooftop gargoyle, she writes, “My brother gifted him to me, for protection, but we all knew it was mostly a gag.”\nENTRANCEMENTS For @doortraits , German poster Pamuk Akkaya edits worldwide submissions to find arresting entryways. Then she pairs them with eerily apt ruminations on life and art from philosophers and painters, among others.\nFILM STILLS Enough people recognize the outré aesthetic of filmmaker Wes Anderson to supply Brooklynite Wally Koval photos from around the world to feed @accidentallywesanderson . A pastel pink neo-renaissance hotel against a pale blue Prague sky recalls 2014’s “Grand Budapest Hotel,” while a red-doored bungalow against snow-covered Canadian Rockies evokes 2012’s otherworldly “Moonrise Kingdom.” Explained Mr. Koval, “We look for images that embody a level of symmetry and a touch of color, whether a bold pop or an overall palette.”\nGREAT BARRIERS For @ihaveathingforwalls , photographers Martha Reyes and Katie Smith remind followers to look around, filtering global submissions of exterior walls that have been painted, graffitied or oddly weathered.\nMore in Design & Decorating\nFive Instagram Accounts for Design and Architecture Fans March 15, 2018 Succulents That Stun in the Snow: Start Planning Now March 9, 2018 Before and After: A Chinese Antique Gets Modernized March 9, 2018 The 5 Most Handsome Task Lamps Out There March 2, 2018 Practical, Chic Decor: When Family Matters More Than Fancy March 2, 2018",
