FILE PHOTO: Britain's Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, arrives at the BBC to appear on the Andrew Marr Show, in central London, Britain March 18, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo “The timing (of the attack in Salisbury) is probably more closely connected with the recent election in Russia,” he told a committee of lawmakers. “And as many non-democratic figures do when facing an election or facing some critical political moment, it is often attractive to conjure up in the public imagination the notion of an enemy.” Reporting by William James, writing by Elizabeth Piper; editing by Stephen Addison",
