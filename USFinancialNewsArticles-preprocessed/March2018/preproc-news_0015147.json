    "text": "DOWNERS GROVE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- In connection with the previously announced agreement to acquire Key Technology, Inc. (“Key Technology”) (NASDAQ: KTEC), Duravant LLC (“Duravant”) announced today that it has extended the expiration of its tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Key Technology’s common stock for $26.75 per share in cash, without interest, and net of applicable withholding of taxes. The tender offer is being extended to allow additional time to complete the marketing period for Duravant’s debt financing as contemplated by the merger agreement for the transaction.\nThe tender offer is now scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time), on Monday, March 19, 2018, unless it is further extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the merger agreement Duravant and Key Technology announced on January 25, 2018. The tender offer was previously scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time), on Thursday, March 8, 2018. All other terms and conditions of the tender offer remain unchanged. Duravant expects to complete the closing of the tender offer and the consummation of the merger promptly following the new expiration time, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to the tender offer and the merger.\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Co., LLC, the depositary and paying agent for the tender offer, has advised Duravant that as of the previous expiration time, approximately 5,354,086 shares of Key Technology’s common stock had been validly tendered in the tender offer, and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 82.8% of the total shares of common stock of Key Technology outstanding. In addition, 43,733 shares of Key Technology’s common stock subject to notices of guaranteed delivery for which such shares underlying the notices of guaranteed delivery have not been delivered to the depositary have been delivered, representing approximately 0.7% of the total shares of common stock of Key Technology outstanding. Shareholders who have already tendered their shares of Key Technology’s common stock do not have to re-tender their shares or take any other action as a result of the extension of the expiration of the tender offer.\nAbout Duravant\nHeadquartered in Downers Grove, IL, Duravant is a global automation and engineered equipment company with manufacturing, sales and service facilities throughout North America, Europe and Asia.
