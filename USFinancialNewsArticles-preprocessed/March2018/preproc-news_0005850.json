(NRG) to acquire the 154 MW Buckthorn Solar Project and the 527 MW Carlsbad Energy Center, funding for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) thermal project, and additional investments in the distributed generation partnerships Recorded $112 million in non-cash charges relating to a deferred tax asset write down from federal tax reform and asset impairment charges; financial performance of the projects remain within expectations\nPRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NRG Yield, Inc. (NYSE: NYLD, NYLD.A) today reported full year 2017 financial results including Net Loss of $23 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $933 million, Cash from Operating Activities of $516 million, and Cash Available for Distribution (CAFD) of $267 million.\n\"2017 was a very successful year for NRG Yield with strong results across our diversified portfolio as well as accretive capital deployment,\" said Christopher Sotos, NRG Yield's President and Chief Executive Officer. “As we work diligently to help facilitate a timely close of the NRG Transaction in the second half of 2018, we look forward to Global Infrastructure Partners becoming the Company’s new sponsor and reigniting long-term growth across the platform. NRG Yield also continues to execute on near-term growth with over $450 million in new capital commitments already in place.”\nOverview of Financial and Operating Results\nSegment Results 1\nTable 1: Net (Loss)/Income\n($ millions) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Segment 12/31/17 12/31/16 12/31/17 12/31/16 Conventional 33 45 120 153 Renewables (50 ) (163 ) 9 (86 ) Thermal 3 5 25 29 Corporate (84 ) (2 ) (177 ) (94 ) Net (Loss) Income (98 ) (115 ) (23 ) 2 1 In accordance with GAAP, 2016 results have been recast to include the March 2017 and November 2017 Drop Down Assets as if the combinations had been in effect from the beginning of the financial statement period\nTable 2: Adjusted EBITDA\n($ millions) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Segment 12/31/17 12/31/16 12/31/17 12/31/16 Conventional 84 84 305 309 Renewables 113 123 589 581 Thermal 12 13 58 58 Corporate (5 ) (6 ) (19 ) (16 ) Adjusted EBITDA 204 214 933 932 Table 3: Cash from Operating Activities and Cash Available for Distribution (CAFD)\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended ($ millions) 12/31/17 12/31/16 12/31/17 12/31/16 Cash from Operating Activities 142 128 516 577 Cash Available for Distribution (CAFD) 59 62 267 311 For the fourth quarter of 2017, NRG Yield reported a Net Loss of $98 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $204 million, Cash from Operating Activities of $142 million, and CAFD of $59 million. Fourth quarter Net Loss results were primarily due to the $68 million write down of the revaluation of the existing net deferred tax asset pursuant to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21% in accordance with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act and $31 million of non-cash asset impairments within NRG Wind TE Holdco at two separate wind projects: Elbow Creek located in Texas, and Forward Wind located in Pennsylvania. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA results were lower than 2016 primarily due to lower wind production in 2017 versus fourth quarter 2016, partially offset by growth in the distributed generation partnerships. CAFD results were lower than 2016 primarily due to Adjusted EBITDA results, partially offset by higher distributions received from Agua Caliente and distributed generation partnerships.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, NRG Yield reported a Net Loss of $23 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $933 million, Cash from Operating Activities of $516 million, and CAFD of $267 million. Full year Net Loss results were impacted by the write down of the existing net deferred tax asset and the non-cash asset impairments in the fourth quarter, as well as a $13 million impairment taken by NRG in the third quarter of 2017 in connection with the November 2017 Drop Down assets sale to NRG Yield. In accordance with common control accounting rules, NRG Yield recorded the impairment in its year-end financial statements as if the November 2017 Drop Down Assets were part of the Company from the beginning of the financial statement period. Adjusted EBITDA results were higher than 2016 primarily due to the full year contribution of the Utah solar assets which achieved commercial operation in 2016 and growth in the distributed generation partnerships. This increase was offset by lower renewable production in 2017 versus full year 2016. CAFD results were lower than 2016 primarily due to lower renewable production, additional debt service from both non-recourse project and corporate-level financings raised in 2016, and additional maintenance capital expenditures at the Walnut Creek facility. This decrease was partially offset by higher distributions received from the distributed generation partnerships.\nOperational Performance\nTable 4: Selected Operating Results\n(MWh and MWht in thousands) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended 12/31/17 12/31/16 12/31/17 12/31/16 Equivalent Availability Factor (Conventional) 98.3% 99.1% 93.4% 95.3% Renewables Generation Sold (MWh) 1,491 1,686 6,844 7,291 Thermal Generation Sold (MWht) 2\n484 479 1,961 2,037 In the fourth quarter of 2017, generation in the Renewables segment was below expectations and 12% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to weak wind resources across the portfolio. Renewable energy conditions during the first quarter of 2018 have continued to trend below expectations primarily from weak wind resources in the West Coast.\nDuring the first half of 2017, Walnut Creek experienced forced outages due to mechanical failures of turbine parts that caused downstream damage to several of the plant's units, primarily Unit 1. The repairs necessary to return Unit 1 to service were completed in the second quarter of 2017; the plant has performed reliably since then. The financial impact from the Unit 1 outage was approximately $2 million after recovery of insurance proceeds.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the Company, through the Walnut Creek project, executed an amendment to the contractual service agreement with the original equipment manufacturer to improve long-term reliability. The amendment provides for the original equipment manufacturer to perform all required, currently available and future turbine reliability upgrades in exchange for an investment of approximately $15 million that would be paid over the next five years, of which $8 million is expected to be paid in 2018.\nOn December 18, 2017, the Company amended the power purchase agreement for its 29 MW Forward Wind project in Berlin, PA, to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2022. The Forward Wind project is a part of the Company’s NRG Wind TE Holdco portfolio.\n2 Also includes Thermal MWh sold\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 5: Liquidity 3\n($ millions) 12/31/17 9/30/17 12/31/16 Cash and Cash Equivalents 148 179 322 Restricted Cash 168 144 176 Total Cash 316 323 498 Revolver Availability 366 427 435 Total Liquidity 682 750 933 Total liquidity as of December 31, 2017 was $682 million, a decrease of $251 million from December 31, 2016. This reflects a decrease in total cash of $182 million 4 resulting primarily from dividend payments paid and the successful deployment of growth investments in 2017. Revolver availability during the same period decreased by $69 million due to $55 million in cash borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2017 to primarily fund distributed generation partnership investments and increases in issued letters of credit.\nPotential future sources of liquidity include excess operating cash flow in the business, the $150 million at-the-market (ATM) program, of which $115 million remains available at the end of 2017, and availability under the corporate revolver.\nStrategic Sponsorship with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP)\nOn February 6, 2018, GIP entered into a purchase and sale agreement with NRG for the acquisition of NRG's full ownership interest in NRG Yield and NRG's renewable energy development and operations platform consisting of a robust pipeline of over 6.4 GW of backlog and development projects, as well as operational oversight of 2.4 GW across 17 states (the \"NRG Transaction\"). In connection with the NRG Transaction, NRG Yield entered into a Consent and Indemnity Agreement (the \"C&I Agreement\") with NRG and GIP setting forth the key terms and conditions of NRG Yield's Corporate Governance, Conflicts, and Nominating Committee's consent to the NRG Transaction. Refer to the Company's press release on February 7, 2018 for further details.\nFounded in 2006, GIP is an independent infrastructure fund with over $45 billion in assets under management that invests in infrastructure assets and businesses in both OECD and select emerging market countries. GIP targets investments in single assets and portfolios of assets and companies in power and utilities, natural resources infrastructure, air transport infrastructure, seaports, freight railroad, water distribution and treatment and waste management.\nGIP has a strong track record of investment and value creation in the renewable energy sector with a portfolio that now includes approximately $9 billion in equity committed or invested, 8 GW of operating renewable assets, and over 14 GW of renewable assets under construction or in development. Additionally, GIP has extensive experience with publicly traded yield vehicles and development platforms, ranging from Europe's first application of a YieldCo/DevCo model to the largest renewable platform in Asia-Pacific.\nThe NRG Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including customary legal and regulatory approvals. NRG Yield expects the NRG Transaction to close in the second half of 2018.\n3 In accordance with GAAP, 2016 results have been recast to include the March 2017 and November 2017 Drop Down Assets as if the combinations had been in effect from the beginning of the financial statement period\n4 See Appendix A-6 Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents for Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nGrowth Investments\nBuckthorn Solar Drop Down Transaction with NRG\nOn January 24, 2018, NRG Yield entered into a binding agreement to purchase the 154 MW Buckthorn Solar utility-scale project from NRG for cash consideration of $42.3 million, plus assumed non-recourse debt of approximately $131 million. Buckthorn Solar will sell power under a 25-year PPA to the city of Georgetown, Texas starting in July 2018 when it is expected to achieve commercial operation. The purchase price is expected to be funded via revolver borrowings and cash on hand and is expected to increase CAFD on an average annual basis by approximately $4 million 5 starting in 2019. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.\nCarlsbad Energy Center Drop Down Transaction with NRG\nOn February 6, 2018, NRG Yield signed a binding agreement to purchase the 527 MW Carlsbad Energy Center for cash consideration of $365 million, excluding working capital and other adjustments, plus assumed non-recourse debt of $601 million at completion. The agreement to acquire Carlsbad is subject to the closing of the NRG Transaction. The project is expected to increase CAFD on an average annual basis by approximately $40 million beginning in 2019.\nBecause the project is not expected to close until the fourth quarter of 2018, the Carlsbad transaction includes a number of other items and conditions, including adjustments to the purchase price subject to (a) final tested capacity, (b) final tested heat rate, (c) insurance costs, and (d) NRG Yield's stock price prior to funding.\nPer the C&I Agreement, GIP has committed to provide up to $400 million in financing support for the Carlsbad Energy Center drop down transaction. This commitment would be exercised if NRG Yield were unable to efficiently raise third party capital by the closing of the Carlsbad transaction and would entail GIP acquiring the project directly from NRG to be dropped down to NRG Yield in the future subject to similar terms and conditions.\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Thermal Project and Non-Recourse Thermal Financing\nOn October 31, 2016, NRG Business Services LLC, a subsidiary of NRG, and NRG Energy Center Pittsburgh LLC (NECP), a subsidiary of NRG Yield, entered into an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) agreement for the construction of an 80 MWt district energy system for NECP to provide steam, chilled water and emergency backup power service to UPMC. The initial term of the energy services agreement (under fixed capacity payments) with UPMC will be for a period of twenty years from the service commencement date. Pursuant to the terms of the EPC Agreement, NECP shall pay NRG Business Services LLC $88 million, subject to adjustment based upon certain conditions in the EPC Agreement, $84 million of which will be paid at substantial completion and $4 million of which will be paid at final completion. The project is expected to achieve commercial operations in the first half of 2018.\nIn connection with the UPMC project, NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC established shelf facilities for the anticipated issuances of $70 million of Series E notes and $10 million of Series F notes. The proceeds from the notes, if issued, will be utilized to make payments with respect to the EPC Agreement described above. The UMPC project, net of non-recourse financing, is expected to increase CAFD on an average annual basis by approximately $4 million 6 starting in 2019.\n5 CAFD average over the 5-year period from 2019-2023\n6 CAFD average over the 5-year period from 2019-2023\nInvestment Partnerships with NRG Energy\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, NRG Yield invested approximately $24 million in the existing business-renewable focused distributed solar partnerships bringing total capital invested to $208 million 7 in the distributed solar investment partnerships. As of December 31, 2017, through the existing partnership agreements, NRG Yield owns approximately 233 MW 8 of distributed solar capacity with a weighted average contract life by CAFD of approximately 20 years.\nAward to Provide Black Start Services at Marsh Landing\nOn December 1, 2017, the California Independent System Operator selected a proposal by NRG Yield's Marsh Landing project to provide black start capability in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. In partnership with NRG, the Company is evaluating options for the implementation of the service, which based on preliminary assessment, would require an investment between $10 and $12 million. The Company expects to make an investment decision by the third quarter of 2018.\nQuarterly Dividend Update\nOn February 15, 2018, NRG Yield’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on Class A and Class C common stock of $0.298 per share (approximately $1.19 per share annualized) payable on March 15, 2018, to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2018. This equates to a 3.47% increase over the prior quarter.\nSeasonality\nNRG Yield’s quarterly operating results are impacted by seasonal factors, as well as variability in renewable energy resources. The majority of NRG Yield’s revenues are generated from the months of May through September, as contracted pricing and renewable resources are at their highest levels in the Company’s core markets. The factors driving the fluctuation in Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Cash from Operating Activities, and CAFD include the following:\nHigher summer capacity prices from conventional assets; Higher solar insolation during the summer months; Higher wind resources during the spring months; Debt service payments which are made either quarterly or semi-annually; and Timing of maintenance capital expenditures and the impact of both unforced and forced outages.\nThe Company takes into consideration the timing of these factors to ensure sufficient funds are available for distribution on a quarterly basis.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nNRG Yield is reconfirming 2018 full year financial guidance. This financial guidance does not include growth investments under evaluation or not yet completed.

financial measures. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that NRG Yield’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nEBITDA represents net income before interest (including loss on debt extinguishment), taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented because NRG Yield considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes debt and equity holders frequently use EBITDA to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nEBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and Other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA differently than NRG Yield does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of NRG Yield’s business. NRG Yield compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. See the statements of cash flow included in the financial statements that are a part of this news release.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for mark-to-market gains or losses, asset write offs and impairments; and factors which we do not consider indicative of future operating performance. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons NRG Yield considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, the reader should be aware that in the future NRG Yield may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. This measure is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.\nAdditionally, Management believes that investors commonly adjust EBITDA information to eliminate the effect of restructuring and other expenses, which vary widely from company to company and impair comparability. As we define it, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for the effects of impairment losses, gains or losses on sales, dispositions or retirements of assets, any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, adjustments to exclude the Adjusted EBITDA related to the non-controlling interest, gains or losses on the repurchase, modification or extinguishment of debt, and any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items plus adjustments to reflect the Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments. We adjust for these items in our Adjusted EBITDA as our management believes that these items would distort their ability to efficiently view and assess our core operating trends.\nIn summary, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with our Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance.\nCash Available for Distribution (CAFD) is Adjusted EBITDA plus cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, cash receipts from notes receivable, less cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, maintenance capital expenditures, pro-rata Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates, cash interest paid, income taxes paid, principal amortization of indebtedness, Walnut Creek investment payments, and changes in prepaid and accrued capacity payments. Management believes cash available for distribution is a relevant supplemental measure of the Company’s ability to earn and distribute cash returns to investors.\nWe believe Cash Available for Distribution is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to make quarterly distributions. In addition, cash available for distribution is used by our management team for determining future acquisitions and managing our growth. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to cash available for distribution is cash from operating activities.\nHowever, cash available for distribution has limitations as an analytical tool because it does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and excludes the effect of certain other cash flow items, all of which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results from operations. Cash available for distribution is a non GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to cash from operating activities or any other performance or liquidity measure determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. In addition, our calculations of cash available for distribution are not necessarily comparable to cash available for distribution as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including cash from operating activities.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301005724/en/\nNRG Yield, Inc.\nMedia:\nSheri Woodruff, 609-524-4608\nMarijke Shugrue, 609-524-5262\nor\nInvestors:\nKevin L.
