    "text": "SEATTLE, NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO and LONDON, March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PitchBook , the premier data provider for the private and public equity markets, today announced the promotion of Patrick Ross from director of finance and accounting to vice president of finance. The promotion follows on the heels of a dynamic 2017, which involved the integration of new financial management protocols and systems used by Morningstar, PitchBook's parent company. A 13+ year finance veteran, Ross played an instrumental role in overseeing the transition amidst PitchBook's fast-growth. In his new position, Ross will continue overseeing foundational financial responsibilities, including accounting, financial planning & analysis, reporting and payroll, in addition to focusing on strengthening financial discipline and streamlining processes to support growth.\n\"As a fast-growing business, we need an experienced leadership team to help navigate growth, governance and compliance along the way,\" said John Gabbert, founder and CEO of PitchBook. \"Originally from one of the big four accounting firms, Patrick hit the ground running at PitchBook, tackling some big initiatives early on in his tenure. As VP, Patrick will continue leading the company through this period of rapid growth.\"\nRoss joined PitchBook in July 2017 as the director of finance and accounting and in his first year was tasked with building PitchBook's finance team, as well as overseeing the integration of Morningstar systems and development of a SOX program. At the same time, PitchBook experienced significant growth in terms of revenue and headcount, requiring strong financial acumen to seamlessly navigate the transition and scale growth. In 2017 alone, PitchBook grew revenue by 62% while headcount grew by 30%. With over a decade of experience in finance, Ross strengthened PitchBook's accounting and finance process workflow to unlock greater efficiencies and drive business value. As VP of finance at PitchBook, Ross will continue overseeing his business unit, in addition to expanding the team in conjunction with PitchBook's growth trajectory.\n\"PitchBook is growing at an impressive rate and to keep pace, it requires a solid framework for financial management and accounting policies and procedures, plus the ability to move quickly,\" said Patrick Ross. \"After a whirlwind 2017, I'm looking forward to implementing new best practices to help us surface actionable business intelligence, streamline processes and improve the accuracy of financial statements and execution of our SOX program.\"\nFor more information about PitchBook's leadership team, click here .\nAbout PitchBook\nPitchBook is a financial data and software company that provides transparency into the capital markets to help professionals discover and execute opportunities with confidence and efficiency.
