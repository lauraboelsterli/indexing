Mr. Preuss, a 25-year communications veteran, will lead the integrated, multi-agency team that works in close collaboration with Ford Communications, led by Mark Truby.\n\"Chris brings a wealth of experience and leadership to WPP's blended, public affairs team. We're very excited to have him back,\" said Mark Truby, vice president, communications.\nPreuss was most recently the senior vice present of marketing and communications for Aptiv (formerly Delphi Automotive), a position he has held since 2014. Prior to joining Delphi, Preuss was head of communications for the Americas and Global Product at Ford Motor Company, so Mr. Preuss knows the blue oval well.\nPreuss' career also includes more than a decade of experience at General Motors, where he held various leadership roles, including president and CEO of OnStar, GM's in-vehicle safety and security unit.\n\"Chris is a strategic and experienced communications pro.

Koops, who is also the global media practice chair for the newly merged Burson Cohn & Wolfe, will stay on as a key member of the team. \"We're thrilled Gary will continue his great work on the Ford business in addition to his unparalleled, ongoing counseling for our top clients,\" said Don Baer, chairman of Burson Cohn & Wolfe. \"He's one of the most respected professionals in the entire public relations world, so the team has only gotten stronger with Gary now working alongside Chris.\"\nPreuss will report directly to Satish Korde and be headquartered at GTB's offices in Dearborn, Michigan.\nAbout GTB\nHeadquartered in Dearborn, Michigan and founded in 2007, GTB is an industry-leading advertising and communications agency.
