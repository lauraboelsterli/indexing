    "text": "Republicans and Democrats struck a preliminary agreement Wednesday on some major points of contention in a bill to fund the government, a source familiar with the bill told CNBC.\nThe deadline for passing the spending bill that would keep the government running through September is midnight Friday. It was unclear as of Wednesday afternoon when leaders would release the text of final legislation. A GOP aide was noncommittal when CNBC asked whether there would be a House vote on a measure Thursday.\n , whose support for the proposal was unclear entering Wednesday, backs the spending bill, the White House said in a statement. He talked Wednesday afternoon with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan , with whom he discussed the \"shared priorities secured\" in the legislation, such as defense spending and funding for fencing on the U.S. border with Mexico. In a statement, Ryan spokesman Doug Andres reiterated the president's support, saying the Wisconsin Republican and Trump \"had a good conversation about the wins delivered for the president.\"\nUnder the agreement, spending on opioid treatment, prevention and research would increase by nearly $3 billion and on infrastructure by $10 billion. It also would authorize $1.57 billion in new border security funding, most of which would go toward technology. It would not cut funding to women's health care provider Planned Parenthood or pull money from so-called sanctuary cities, targets of conservatives.\nThe legislation would make funding available for the Gateway Project, a rail renovation plan that includes a New York-New Jersey commuter tunnel. Trump reportedly has threatened to veto it, though it is unclear if he would follow through with the threat. The funding would come through increases to Amtrak and other programs.\nIt would increase military funding by about $61 billion, including pay increases for service members, according to a source. Republicans have tried to build support for the plan by framing it as vital to national security.\nIn addition, lawmakers will attach a fix for the so-called grain glitch, an error in the GOP tax law passed in December that gives bigger tax breaks to grain producers selling to farm cooperatives than those selling to agricultural companies. Democrats were expected to push to expand the low-income housing tax credit in exchange for the fix.\nThe legislation is also expected to include a measure backed by bipartisan lawmakers to improve the existing gun sale background check system. A provision aiming to help schools prevent gun violence will also go into the bill.\nCongress needs to pass a funding bill by midnight Friday or see the government shut down for the third time this year. Leaders have not yet posted a spending plan, and House and Senate rules could slow the process even as lawmakers are expected to work through a snowstorm Wednesday.\nMcConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi met Wednesday morning in Ryan's office to hash out final details. Following the meeting, Schumer said the leaders had \"very, very good\" talks and hope to release a final plan \"in a few hours.\"\nPelosi said negotiators have \"a few language points to clear up\" but said they have \"made good progress.\"\n\"I think that we're going to present to our members something that they can comfortably support,\" she said.\nLast month, Congress reached a deal to bust through budget caps and increase military and domestic spending by $300 billion over two years. The legislation this week would actually allocate the money to specific programs and agencies.\nDisagreements over issues such as immigration, health care and infrastructure slowed the funding talks and left lawmakers scrambling to beat the Friday deadline.\nHere are some of the notable spending provisions expected to be in the bill, according to the source:\nOn the immigration front, it would include funds for about 33 miles of new border fencing. More than $1 billion would fund border security technology. Beds for immigrant detainees will not increase, as some Republicans had sought. The GOP has pushed for tougher border security. The $10 billion in new infrastructure funding would go toward grants as well as programs to improve airports, highways and railroads. It would also put funding toward high-speed broadband development. It would increase opioid treatment, prevention and research funding by nearly $3 billion. It would boost funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration by $1.4 billion, including $1 billion for state grants. It would put $500 million more into National Institutes of Health research into addiction. Fighting the nationwide epidemic is a priority for both parties. The plan would include an additional $2 billion for Veterans Administration hospital maintenance and construction backlogs. It would put nearly $700 million toward efforts to secure elections and combat Russian cyberattacks. A $307 million increase in FBI funding beyond the Trump administration's budget request would go toward counterintelligence to fight cyberattacks. Another $380 million would go toward state election technology grants to harden election systems. It includes $350 million for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which can ease the student loan burden on Americans who have public service jobs. It would boost Child Care and Development Block Grants by $2.37 billion. The program subsidizes child care for low-income families.",
