    "text": "Asian markets closed mixed Thursday in what proved to be a choppy session after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time this year.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.99 percent, or 211.02 points, to close at 24,591.99 and the broader Topix edged up by 0.65 percent, with the mining and oil sectors climbing 4.56 percent and 3.06 percent, respectively.\nElsewhere, South Korea's benchmark Kospi advanced 0.44 percent to close at 2,496.02, a seven-week high. The manufacturing sector closed mostly lower, but brokerages and oil-related stocks climbed, contributing to overall gains.\nIndex heavyweight Samsung Electronics also contributed to the move higher, closing up 1.41 percent.\nSymbol Name Price Change %Change NIKKEI --- HSI --- ASX 200 --- SHANGHAI --- KOSPI --- CNBC 100 --- Greater China markets gave up early gains, with the Hang Seng Index easing 0.61 percent by 3:00 p.m. HK/SIN. Most sectors fell, with technology names dragging on the index, although oil producers firmed.\nOver on the mainland, the Shanghai composite lost 0.52 percent to close at 3,263.83 and the Shenzhen composite edged lower by 0.49 percent to end at 1,849.60. The large-cap CSI 300 index finished the day down 1 percent.\nLosses on the mainland also came after Reuters reported the People's Bank of China raised the interest rate on seven-day reverse repurchase agreements, referred to as reverse repos, by 5 basis points. That move came after the Federal Reserve raised rates overnight.\nIn Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.22 percent in choppy trade to close at 5,937.20 as declines were seen in all sectors except energy, materials and gold producers.\nMining majors closed firmly in positive territory, while oil producers gained as oil prices steadied after soaring overnight. Woodside Petroleum gained 2.22 percent and Beach Energy advanced 2.78 percent.\nFed raises rates The Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis points to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent at the end of its policy meeting on Wednesday, as was widely expected.\nThe central bank indicated that it still expected two more hikes this year, but upgraded its projection for the benchmark rate in 2019 to 2.9 percent. Growth forecasts for this year and the next were also raised.\nThose moves showed that the FOMC was seeking \"to strike a balance between showing a need for more rate hikes in the long term ... but not rocking market sentiment too much with the median for 2018 staying at three hikes,\" Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a note.\nHe added that the lack of surprises on Wednesday meant that stock markets in the region would likely be relatively muted.\nU.S. stocks whipsawed in the last session, touching session highs shortly after the Fed made its announcement, but ultimately closed slightly below the flat line.\nFollowing the hike stateside, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Thursday also raised its base rate by 25 basis points due to the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback.\nMeanwhile, concerns over trade tensions were also in focus in the region, with President Donald Trump expected to announce tariffs against China during U.S. hours, Reuters said, citing a White House official.\nIn corporate news, tech giant Tencent Holdings fell 3.8 percent by 3:00 p.m. HK/SIN after signaling more investments were in the works. It had announced that net profit for the quarter ending Dec. 31 rose 98 percent to 20.8 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) on Wednesday, topping expectations.\nIn currencies, the dollar remained on the back foot after its overnight fall. Analysts indicated that one reason for the decline was due to some investors having expected the Fed's \"dot plot\" to reflect four rate hikes instead of the three that it maintained for this year.\nThe dollar index , which tracks the greenback against six rival currencies, stood at 89.602 at 2:57 p.m. HK/SIN. Against the yen , the dollar slipped further below the 106 handle to trade at 105.84.\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong dollar slid to a fresh 33-year low during the session.\nOn the commodities front, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude shed 0.05 percent to trade at $65.13 per barrel and Brent crude futures were off by 0.13 percent at $69.38. Oil prices had jumped overnight after data on Wednesday showed U.S. crude inventories declined instead of rising, as was expected.\nâ€” CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.",
