    "text": "SALISBURY, England, March 7 (Reuters) - British investigators will update an emergency response committee of senior ministers on Wednesday about the mystery illness that struck down a former Russian double agent and his daughter.\nSergei Skripal, once a colonel in Russia’s GRU military intelligence service, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found slumped unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre in the southern English city of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon.\nMore than two days later, both are critically ill in intensive care.\nPolice have sealed off parts of Salisbury including a pizza restaurant and a pub.\nCounter-terrorism police are now leading the investigation and Britain’s military research laboratory at Porton Down is trying to ascertain what may have poisoned Skripal, 66, and his daughter.\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd will chair the emergency response meeting.
