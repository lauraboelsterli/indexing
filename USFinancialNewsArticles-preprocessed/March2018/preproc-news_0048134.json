    "text": "NEW YORK, March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pareteum Corporation (NYSE American: TEUM) , (\"Pareteum\" or the \"Company\") , the rapidly growing Cloud Communications Platform company, announced today operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We achieved record revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Our key performance indicators of connections, backlog conversion, connection values, revenue per employee and churn are all favorable and trending in the right directions. This past year's focus of strengthening our management and operational teams to create and close sales opportunities based on our robust and proprietary technology has been highly successful. The hires and resulting build-up of our 36-month contractual revenue backlog sets us up for 2018 and beyond. Our balance sheet is dramatically improved as we successfully executed on capital raises in the fourth quarter that allowed us to pay off our debt and enter 2018 with a strong cash balance to fuel our future growth. We are well positioned for growth and profitability having structured our technology and operational platform to scale our business and are now focused in converting backlog to revenue, servicing our clients, selling into new geographical markets and industries and creating shareholder value,\" said Hal Turner, Pareteum's Founder, Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer.\nStrong 2017 Sequential Quarterly Improvements Across All Key Metrics\n(000's)\n2016\nQ1 2017\nQ2 2017\nQ3 2017\nQ4 2017\nREVENUE\n$ 12,856\n$ 2,795\n$ 3,239\n$ 3,499\n$ 4,015\nCOST OF SALES\n$ 3,659\n$ 842\n$ 946\n$ 792\n$ 1,105\nGROSS MARGIN\n$ 9,197\n$ 1,953\n$ 2,293\n$ 2,707\n$ 2,910\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n$ (3,798)\n$ (198)\n$ 463\n$ 603\n$ 708\nKey Business Highlights for Full Year 2017:\nAwarded 26 contracts totaling $118 million covering 45 countries Increased 36-month contractual revenue backlog from $50 million to $147 million at 12/31/17 Ended 2017 with 1,711,000 connections Pareteum Global Cloud Received IoT Evolution's 2017 IoT Excellence Award Added Blockchain Settlement for Cryptocurrency to its Global Cloud Platform Formed strategic alliance with Artilium to create and sell global solutions Partnered with AirFox whose AirToken is an Ethereum-based digital utility token that facilitates the transfer of mobile airtime, data and currency Subsequently appointed Denis McCarthy as Senior VP Corporate Development Appointed Ali Davachi as Chief Technology Officer and Chief Operating Officer Appointed and Promoted Rob Mumby as Chief Revenue Officer Appointed Ted O'Donnell as Chief Financial Officer\nKey Financial Highlights for Full Year 2017:\nRevenues increased by 5% to $13.5 million Gross margins increased 130 basis points to 72.8% Operating loss decreased by $10.1 million, or 54%, to $8.8 million EBITDA loss decreased by $4.8 million, or 53%, to $4.3 million Adjusted EBITDA profit of $1.6 million, from a loss of $3.9 million Raised $20 million in equity Subsequently paid off and eliminated all $10.1 million senior debt Increase in stockholders' equity from a deficit of ($9.4 million) to $15.4 million Increase in total assets from $13.0 million to $25.3 million Cash balance of $13.5 million Anticipated removal of the going concern language as of 12/31/17\n2018 Outlook:\nBased on our 36-month contractual revenue backlog of $147 million, as of December 31, 2017, and connections, we expect 2018 revenue to increase by at least 50% over 2017.
