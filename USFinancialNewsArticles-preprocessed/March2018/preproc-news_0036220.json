Customers leave a Mothercare shop in London October 11, 2008. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo This comes after Mothercare warned earlier this month that its full-year profit would likely come in at the lower end of its guidance and said it would need some financial covenants to be waived, adding to concerns about high-street retailers in Britain. Mothercare said it expected the discussions to conclude before May 17, when the company is set to announce its preliminary results. The company is also exploring additional sources of financing, it said, adding that it was engaged in preliminary discussions on securing such financing.
