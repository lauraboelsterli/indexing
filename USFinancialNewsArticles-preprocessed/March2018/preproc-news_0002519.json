    "text": "ATLANTA, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Veritiv Corporation (NYSE: VRTV), a North American leader in business-to-business distribution solutions, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"Our solid fourth quarter results brought to a close a challenging, but very important year for Veritiv. Once again led by growth in Packaging and Facility Solutions, our comparative reported quarterly and annual revenue performance was the strongest we have had since becoming a public company,\" said Mary Laschinger, Chairman and CEO of Veritiv Corporation. \"In the fourth quarter we also reported a nearly 20% increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA over the prior year quarter which was largely driven by strength in our Packaging business, and the impact of one extra shipping day.\"\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016:\nNet sales were $2.2 billion, an increase of 5.0% from the prior year. Net sales increased 2.7% from the prior year, excluding the positive effect of foreign currency (0.5%) and the positive effect of one more shipping day (1.7%) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income was $12.3 million, compared to net income of $4.2 million in the prior year. Net acquisition, integration and restructuring charges were $(4.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $11.5 million in the prior year. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.78 and $0.77, respectively, compared to $0.26 for basic and diluted earnings per share in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $60.0 million, an increase of 19.8% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 2.7%, an increase of 30 basis points from the prior year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\nNet sales were $8.4 billion, an increase of 0.5% from the prior year. Net sales increased 0.7% from the prior year, excluding the positive effect of foreign currency (0.2%) and the negative effect of one less shipping day (0.4%) in 2017. Net loss was $(13.3) million, compared to net income of $21.0 million in the prior year. Net acquisition, integration and restructuring charges were $53.2 million in 2017 and $38.3 million in the prior year. Basic and diluted loss per share was $(0.85), compared to $1.31 and $1.30 for basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively, in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $176.4 million, a decrease of 8.2% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 2.1%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year.\n\"We have now captured 90% of the high end of our expected synergies of $225 million established in 2014. The initial synergy capture is effectively complete and we consider it to be a success. Our operating system conversion and warehouse consolidations will be substantially complete by the end of 2018,\" said Stephen Smith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Veritiv Corporation. \"With the integration nearing completion during the second half of 2018, we plan to transition to the optimization element of our strategy.\"\nVeritiv Corporation will host a live conference call and webcast today, March 1, 2018, at 10 a.m. (ET) to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.

In addition, the credit agreement governing our asset-based lending facility permits us to exclude the foregoing and other charges in calculating \"Consolidated EBITDA\", as defined in the facility. We approximate foreign currency effects by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not an alternative measure of financial performance under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by, and not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, we consider and evaluate non-GAAP measures in connection with a review of the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures and to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Please see the following tables for reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nTable I\nVERITIV CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nNET INCOME (LOSS) TO ADJUSTED EBITDA; ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN\n(in millions, unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss)\n$\n12.3\n$\n4.2\n$\n(13.3)\n$\n21.0\nInterest expense, net\n9.1\n6.4\n31.2\n27.5\nIncome tax expense\n24.5\n1.4\n11.4\n19.8\nDepreciation and amortization\n14.3\n14.2\n54.2\n54.7\nEBITDA\n60.2\n26.2\n83.5\n123.0\nRestructuring charges, net\n(13.3)\n5.2\n16.7\n12.4\nStock-based compensation\n4.1\n1.1\n15.7\n8.3\nLIFO reserve increase\n3.7\n6.3\n7.1\n3.6\nNon-restructuring asset impairment charges\nâ\n3.7\n8.4\n7.7\nNon-restructuring severance charges\n2.0\n0.7\n3.5\n3.1\nNon-restructuring pension charges\nâ\n0.1\n2.2\n2.4\nAcquisition and integration expenses\n8.4\n6.3\n36.5\n25.9\nFair value adjustment on Tax Receivable Agreement contingent liability\n(11.0)\n0.1\n(9.4)\n4.9\nFair value adjustment on contingent consideration liability\n2.0\nâ\n2.0\nâ\nEscheat audit contingent liability\n3.0\nâ\n7.5\nâ\nOther\n0.9\n0.4\n2.7\n0.9\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n60.0\n$\n50.1\n$\n176.4\n$\n192.2\nNet sales\n$\n2,224.4\n$\n2,119.4\n$\n8,364.7\n$\n8,326.6\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales\n2.7\n%\n2.4\n%\n2.1\n%\n2.3\n%\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veritiv-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300606233.html\nSOURCE Veritiv Corporation",
