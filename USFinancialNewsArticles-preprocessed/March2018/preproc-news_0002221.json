    "text": "(Adds oil, gold settlement prices, European market close)\n* Dollar touches five-week high on U.S. rate outlook\n* Global shares slide, Tencent, Celgene lead decline\n* Oil falls on surprise U.S. gasoline stock build\nBy Herbert Lash\nNEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to five-week highs on Wednesday on the prospect of tighter monetary policy and an upbeat U.S. economic outlook from the Federal Reserve’s new chief, while global equity markets slid on declines in Celgene Corp and China’s Tencent.\nAlso pushing the dollar higher was euro zone inflation slowing to a 14-month low, which knocked the euro to six-week lows and underscored the European Central Bank’s caution in removing stimulus in the region.\nThe greenback in February was poised to post its best monthly performance since November 2016 as it also rose to a two-month high against the Canadian dollar and notched three-week highs against both the Swiss franc and sterling.\n“The dollar has found tailwinds in America’s sturdy economy and its hawkish central bank,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.\nThe dollar index rose 0.26 percent, with the euro down 0.21 percent to $1.2205. The Japanese yen firmed 0.58 percent versus the greenback at 106.71 per dollar.\nWorld stocks were set to snap a record 15-month winning streak, pulled lower by Chinese conglomerate Tencent Holdings because of its large stake in Singapore-based Sea Ltd , an online gaming and e-commerce firm, and Celgene.\nSea posted a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and the departure of its president - the public face of its U.S. listing last year. Sea fell 12.9 percent.\nCelgene said on Tuesday that U.S. health regulators rejected its application seeking approval of a key multiple sclerosis drug due to insufficient data. The surprise development will likely delay the entry to market of one of Celgene’s most important pipeline assets.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.72 percent to close at 1,487.20.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 147.92 points, or 0.58 percent, to 25,262.11, the S&P 500 lost 7.02 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,737.26 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.35 points, or 0 percent, to 7,330.71.\nLonger-dated yields slipped on expectations that a faster pace of Fed rate increases would cool U.S. inflation and economic growth.\nU.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought in the fourth quarter as the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years drew in imports and depleted inventories.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 10/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.8697 percent.\nEuro zone bond yields held near recent lows as inflation in the bloc slowed, potentially complicating the European Central Bank’s plan to remove monetary stimulus and move towards raising rates.\nU.S. oil prices fell more than 2 percent and gasoline futures tumbled after the U.S. government said crude inventories rose more than expected while gasoline stocks posted a big build instead of the draw that was forecast.\nU.S. crude inventories rose by 3 million barrels for the week ending Feb. 23, compared with analyst expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels.\nU.S. crude fell $1.37 to settle at $61.64 per barrel and Brent settled down $1.28 at $65.78.\nU.S. gold futures settled down 70 cents or 0.1 percent, at $1,317.90 per ounce.\nReporting by Herbert Lash Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ",
