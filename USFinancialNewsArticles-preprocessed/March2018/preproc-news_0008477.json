    "text": "Published: Mar 6, 2018 10:44 a.m. ET Share \nMove is a bid to please customers who want less-processed food Getty Images Even as McDonald’s added salads and wraps, competitors brought the focus back to burgers. Wendy’s, for instance, advertised the fresh beef it used to make its patties. \nBy Patrick McGroarty \nMcDonald’s Corp. is freshening up the Quarter Pounder. \nBy May, quarter-pound burgers at McDonald’s MCD, +0.13% restaurants in the contiguous U.S. will be made from fresh beef. The move to please customers who want less processed food will make supplying some 14,000 U.S. restaurants more complicated at a time when McDonald’s is also trying to position itself as the go-to chain for cheap breakfasts and sandwiches. In January, McDonald’s said changes to its value menu helped boost same-store traffic in 2017 for the first time in five years. \nRead: McDonald’s has worst-ever one-day dollar drop amid slow start for new value menu \nMcDonald’s is facing increasing competition from fast-casual chains such as Shake Shack Inc. and Smashburger Master LLC that have gained ground among customers willing to pay more for meals they see as higher quality. For the past two years, the fast-food giant has been working to win back fans of its most well-known products. \n“At the end of the day McDonald’s is a burger company, and there’s no more important place for us to focus on improving the quality of our food,” said McDonald’s USA President Chris Kempczinski. \nThat renewed focus on the burger comes after mixed success generating sales from other menu changes. Selling breakfast items like the Sausage McMuffin all day has been popular, and McDonald’s says its customers have also embraced the removal of artificial preservatives from chicken nuggets and breakfast items made from cage-free eggs.
