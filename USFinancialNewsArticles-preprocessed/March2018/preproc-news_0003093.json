    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Two people remain in critical condition after suspected exposure to an unknown substance in Salisbury, southwestern England, British police said on Tuesday, adding that one member of the emergency services also remained in hospital.\nWiltshire police said in a statement the Bishopâ€™s Mill pub in the shopping centre where the pair were found had been sealed off following the incident, but that there did not appear to be any immediate risk to public health.\nOne of the two people in critical condition is a former Russian double agent convicted of treason in Moscow for betraying dozens of spies to British intelligence, two sources close to the investigation told Reuters.\nReporting by Andy Bruce and Guy Faulconbridge; Writing by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
