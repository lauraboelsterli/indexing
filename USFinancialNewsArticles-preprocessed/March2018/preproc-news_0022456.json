    "text": "(Repeats story from Saturday)\nBEIJING, March 10 (Reuters) - China’s banking regulator has ordered shareholders that have acquired more than five percent stakes in commercial banks through the use of financial products like insurance and asset management schemes to reduce their holdings within a year.\nThe regulation, dated Feb. 2 but made public late on Friday, is the latest in a series of measures to control risk and excessive leverage in the financial system, with everything from doggy lending practices to shadow banking under the microscope.\nThe regulator also said in a separate online statement that it “strictly forbids shareholders from imposing inappropriate control over banks and seeking illegitimate interests”.\nThe China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) will target small and mid-tier banks’ shareholding structures and conduct on-site checks this year, it said.\nThe rules will force conglomerates like Anbang Insurance Group Co, which has built up stakes in commercial lenders through funds raised from short-term, high-yielding universal life insurance products, to trim their holdings.\nAs of Sept. 30, Anbang Insurance Group held a 15.54 percent stake in China Minsheng Banking Corp as a result of a direct stake held by Anbang Life and through two separate financial products, company filings show.\nThe Beijing-based insurer also held a greater than 13 percent interest in China Merchants Bank Co through its property and casualty insurance unit during the same period.\nThe CBRC said it would investigate whether commercial banks’ shareholders were using their own, legally obtained funds for investment and whether they were holding stakes for other parties.\nAny other existing stake purchase of more than five percent by investors and their related parties must seek approval by the CBRC within six months.\nThe new rules follow guidelines released in January that required major shareholders to disclose their ownership structures up to the ultimate beneficial holder.\nThe CBRC is drafting another set of new rules on shareholding custodianship to further increase transparency and standardise the management of banks’ shareholding structures, it added.
