    "text": "ZURICH, March 6 (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group is seeking a public listing for airline caterer Gategroup, the Swiss company said on Tuesday, potentially raising up to 350 million Swiss francs ($372.66 million) to help tackle HNA’s liquidity crunch.\nReuters reported in November that HNA, which bought Gategroup for $1.5 billion in 2016, was considering an initial public offering.\nThe move is the latest in HNA’s drive to restructure its far-flung operations, while raising cash by selling equity and real estate assets.\n$1 = 0.9392 Swiss francs Reporting by John Revill\n ",
