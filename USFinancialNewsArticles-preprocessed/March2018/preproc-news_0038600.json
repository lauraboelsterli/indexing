    "text": "LAS VEGAS, March 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Parking REIT, Inc. (the \"Company\") announced today that, on March 22, 2018, the board of directors of the Company (the \"Board\") unanimously authorized a suspension of the Company's cash distributions and stock dividends to holders of its common stock, effective immediately.\nThe Board is focused on preserving capital in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to continue to operate the business and maintain compliance with debt covenants, including minimum liquidity covenants, and to seek to enhance the value of the Company for stockholders through potential future acquisitions.\nThe Company has a pipeline of investment opportunities that the Board believes, if executed, will position the Company for potential future growth and value creation. The Company expects that cash retained by the suspension of cash distributions will allow the Company to continue to pursue investment opportunities while also preparing for a possible liquidity event in the future. The Board took into consideration the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity and the potential investment opportunities when considering this change in distribution policy.\nThe Board will continue to evaluate the Company's performance and expects to assess the Company's distribution policy quarterly. There can be no assurance that the Company will resume payment of distributions to common stockholders at any time in the future, that any acquisitions will be completed on an attractive basis, or at all, or that any liquidity event will occur or when such event may occur.\nAbout The Parking REIT, Inc.\nThe Parking REIT, Inc. (formerly known as MVP REIT II, Inc.) is a publicly registered, non-listed REIT that invests primarily in parking lots and garages in the United States. Its assets include 44 parking facilities located in 15 states. The Parking REIT is managed by MVP Realty Advisors, LLC.
