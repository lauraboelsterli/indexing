    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday that more than 130 people could have been exposed to the military-grade nerve agent that poisoned Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury earlier this month.\n“We assess that more than 130 people in Salisbury could have been potentially exposed to this nerve agent,” May said in a statement delivered to parliament.\nMay also said that Britain had information that indicated Russia over the last decade had investigated ways of delivering nerve agents, probably for assassination.\nShe added that Russia had covered up the use of chemical weapons in Syria by the Assad government.\nMoscow has denied being behind the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4.\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper, writing by Andy Bruce; editing by Guy Faulconbridge\n ",
