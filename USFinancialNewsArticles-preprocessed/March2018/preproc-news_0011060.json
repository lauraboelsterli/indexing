    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DIRTT Environmental Solutions Ltd. (\"DIRTT\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:DRT), an interior construction company using technology for client-driven design and manufacturing, will release its fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and year-end financial results on Wednesday, March 21, 2018 after markets close. The Company also provides an update on its strategic growth initiative, as announced January 17, 2018.\nStrategic Growth Initiative\nDIRTT retained a global strategic consulting firm, known for its successful work with Fortune 500 companies, to assist with enhancing its strategic plan. DIRTT’s focus is to pursue opportunities for increased growth, margins and profitability. This external firm is well suited to provide objective strategic insights to DIRTT’s plans and to assist the Company in navigating a path to capture significant share in the digital construction industry. A key element of the Company’s strategy will be to build upon its partner sales model and increase the Company’s effectiveness. The Company’s work is on track and it expects to provide more details during the fiscal year-end conference call. Details below.\nConference Call\nA conference call and webcast for the investment community is scheduled for Thursday, March 22, 2018 at 9 a.m. ET (7 a.m. MT) to discuss the fourth quarter and year-end results in greater detail. The call and webcast will be hosted by DIRTT interim president and CEO Michael Goldstein, and interim chief financial officer Peter Henry.\nTo access the conference call by telephone, dial +1 877.479.7708 (toll-free in North America). Please dial-in 10 minutes prior to the start of the call. In addition, a live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be available at: https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/gig3eqb4 .\nInvestors are invited to submit questions by email before and during the conference call.

These forward-looking statements are based upon information which is currently available to the Company and which is believed to be reasonable in the circumstances; however, such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements. In particular, the Company’s ability to predict future financial performance is highly uncertain due, in part, to the lumpy nature of customer orders, the variability of product mix, and the timing of the underlying construction projects that DIRTT is selling in to. The Company’s success will depend, in part, on its ability to maintain and manage growth effectively and for management to work cohesively. To take advantage of future growth opportunities and manage the growth of the Company’s operations and personnel, DIRTT will need to continue to improve its operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty in implementing products or securing customers and Partners; declines in quality or customer satisfaction; increases in costs; and difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties. Any of these difficulties could adversely impact the Company’s business performance and results of operations. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under the Company's continuous disclosure obligations.\nAbout DIRTT | www.DIRTT.net\nDIRTT Environmental Solutions uses its proprietary 3D software to design, manufacture and install fully customized, prefabricated interiors.
