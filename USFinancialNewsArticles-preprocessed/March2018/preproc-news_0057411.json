    "text": "EditorsNote: fixes “Hornqvist” in third graf\nSidney Crosby batted in his own rebound 19 seconds into overtime to give the Pittsburgh Penguins a 4-3 victory over the New Jersey Devils on Thursday night at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J.\nCrosby, coming in from the left side, clanged a shot off the right post which flew back in front of net where Crosby batted in the waist-high rebound past goalie Keith Kinkaid for his 28th goal of the season. It was Crosby’s 13th career game-winning goal in overtime.\nPatric Hornqvist and Kris Letang each had a goal and an assist and Conor Sheary also scored for the Penguins (44-28-6, 94 points) who moved into sole possession of second place in the Metropolitan Division, two points ahead of Philadelphia. Brian Dumoulin added two assists and Matt Murray finished with 28 saves as Pittsburgh defeated the Devils for the first time in four games this season.\nThe loss by New Jersey clinched a playoff spot for the idle Washington Capitals.\nBlake Coleman, Taylor Hall and Kyle Palmieri each scored New Jersey, currently in the eighth spot in the last wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. Kinkaid stopped 31 shots for the Devils, who saw the end of a three-game winning streak.\nPalmieri gave New Jersey a 1-0 lead at the 12:19 mark of the first period off a pass from Nico Hischier, who stole the puck along the boards at mid-ice and then found Palmieri racing in free down the right side where he fired a shot between Murray’s pad for his 24th goal of the season.\nPittsburgh tied it just 25 seconds later on Sheary’s 16th goal of the season off a cross-crease pass from Hornqvist. The Penguins then took a 2-1 lead at the 6:59 mark of the second period on Letang’s one-timer from the right circle off a feed from Carl Hagelin. Hall answered with his 34th of the season at 14:41 of the second, firing a wrist shot past a screen from the right circle that clanged in off the far post to tie it 2-2.\nColeman put the Devils back ahead 3-2 when he backhanded in his own rebound over Murray’s left pad 5:11 into the third period. Hornqvist then tied it just over six minutes later when he fired a shot from the high slot that fluttered through traffic in front of the net, hit the left post and then caromed in off the left leg of Kinkaid, setting the stage for Crosby’s game-winner in overtime.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
