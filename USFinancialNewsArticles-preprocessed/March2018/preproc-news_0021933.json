It also mostly shut down expectations by some that early 2019 rate hikes were in the cards.”\nSpain’s 10-year bond yield, just marginally higher at 1.41 percent, was set to end the week down around 13 bps — its biggest weekly fall since July last year.\nPortuguese bond yields, hovering close to Thursday’s six-week low around 1.79 percent, was set for its biggest weekly fall since September, of around 13 bps.\nThat left the gap between southern European bond yields and their top-rated peers tighter once more.\nThe gap between 10-year Italian and German bond yields was at 135 basis points, close to lows hit in the previous session.\nAnalysts said reports that Italy’s centre-right alliance was reaching out to lawmakers from the Democratic Party to seek support for a broad governing alliance after Sunday’s inconclusive election was also supporting Italian debt.\nU.S. President Donald Trump pressed ahead on Thursday with import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent for aluminium.\nNews that he is also prepared to meet North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in what would be the first face-to-face encounter between the two countries’ leaders helped ease fears about tensions in the Korean peninsula, denting safe-haven bonds.\nGermany’s 10-year bond yield was up 1 bps at 0.64 percent DE10YT-RR.
