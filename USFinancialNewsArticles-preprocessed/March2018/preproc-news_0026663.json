    "text": "ATLANTA, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 2Checkout (formerly Avangate), a leader in eCommerce, payments and subscription billing solutions, today announced it was named to two Constellation ShortLists™ in Q1 2018: Smart Services Digital Monetization Platforms and Matrix Commerce™ Campaign to Commerce . The company’s solution was previously named to both lists in 2016 and 2017 under the Avangate name, making this its third consecutive year on the Constellation reports.\nThe technology vendors included in each ShortList offer the key requirements for early adopters pursuing digital transformation initiatives.
