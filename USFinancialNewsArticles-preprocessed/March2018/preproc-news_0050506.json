    "text": "LOS ANGELES, March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nova LifeStyle, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVFY), a leading U.S.-based, innovative designer and distributor of modern LifeStyle home products, today announced ﻿outstanding ﻿financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights:\nFourth quarter revenues were $35.7 million, up 79.3%, compared to $19.9 million in the prior year period. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $8.3 million, up 186%, compared to $2.9 million in the prior year period. Fourth quarter Gross Margin was 23.4%, compared to 14.4% in the prior year period due to increased sales from uniquely designed, premium items. Income Before Income Taxes and Discontinuing Operations was $5.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights :\nNet Sales were $106.5 million, an increase of 14.9% compared to the prior year. Sales from high margin, proprietarily designed, premium products increased 71% in average selling prices. Gross profit was $20.4 million, an increase of 51% versus the prior year period. Profit margins expanded across nearly all product lines, benefiting from the Company’s adaption to trendy product designs and successful launches of a wide range of high-quality offerings. Income Before Income Taxes and Discontinuing Operations was $6.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to a loss before income taxes and discontinuing operations of $(1.1) million, or $(0.04) per diluted share in the prior year. Booked a one-time transition tax charge of $3.3 million (or $0.12 per share) in the fourth quarter for full year 2017 as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, based on the deemed repatriation to the United States of the Company’s share of previously deferred earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. For the full year 2017, GAAP-Net Income was $3.8 million (after the one-time tax impact of $0.12 per share), or $0.14 per fully diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(1.1) million or $(0.01) per diluted share in the prior year period.\nManagement Commentary\nTawny Lam, Chief Executive Officer of Nova LifeStyle, commented, \"Nova Lifestyle is pleased to announce outstanding 2017 financial results capped off by a fantastic fourth quarter. We anticipate the recently enacted U.S. tax law will bring considerable benefit to the Company going forward as our U.S. domestic sales are expected to expand rapidly. We have focused on trendy designed, high-end products in our catalogues, which are generating large orders from global customers, including those from as far as in Australia. Our growth is driven by increased customer interest towards our modern lifestyle furnishing solutions and increased online and mobile marketing efforts launched by the Company. Our drive towards uniquely designed, premium product mix since 2016 started to really pay off in 2017 as we experienced both record revenue growth and expanded profit margins.”\nOutlook for 2018: Revenues and Earnings Growth Momentum to Continue\nMs. Lam continued, “Nova LifeStyle entered 2018 with continuing growth momentum. We had a very successful Las Vegas Market show in late January 2018. The event featured attendance levels and customer interest not seen in many years, which reflects an uptrend for the entire home furnishings industry. We are seeing strong interest in our products such as the ‘Hollywood Glam’ collection, which has generated orders from customers throughout the United States and internationally. Our three-decades of experience learned from designing and marketing products for international markets has enabled us to develop the scale, logistics, marketing efficiency and design expertise that will serve our customers well in 2018 and beyond. We focus on designing and producing furnishing solutions that meet our changing customers’ lifestyles, adopting the latest design innovation and deeper brand penetration for our own Diamond Sofa brand. We are expecting robust sales and significant earnings growth in 2018.”\n$5 Million Share Repurchase Program to Initiate in 2018\nThe Company anticipates executing on the previously announced $5 million share repurchase program in 2018 through internal funding sources.\nAbout Nova LifeStyle\nNova LifeStyle, Inc., a NASDAQ Global Market listed company headquartered in California and founded nearly 30 years ago, is a fast growing, innovative designer and distributor of modern LifeStyle residential and commercial furniture products: sofas, dining rooms, cabinets, office furniture and related components, bedrooms, and various accessories in matching collections.
