    "text": "BELGRADE/PRISTINA (Reuters) - The party representing Kosovo’s Serb minority withdrew from the government coalition on Tuesday in protest at what it called “attacks on the people and representatives of Serbia” by the authorities in the ethnic Albanian majority country. \n\nPeople walk past a banner in front of Serbian parliament building in central Belgrade, Serbia, March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Marko Djurica A day earlier, police fired tear gas at nationalist Serb protesters and briefly detained a Serbian official in the northern town of Mitrovica, which lies in a volatile, mainly minority Serb pocket of Kosovo. \nThe Serb minority party, Serb List, held three ministerial positions, including that of deputy prime minister. All four resigned on Tuesday, prompting Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj to ask them to reconsider. \nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said she was flying to Belgrade on Tuesday, having urged a day earlier for calm and for Belgrade and Pristina to continue their dialogue. \n“After yesterday’s attack against people and representatives of Serbia, we cannot remain silent and we cannot be a decoration,” Goran Rakic, leader of the Serb List party said. \nOn Monday Kosovo police in Mitrovica used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters outside a meeting on improving relations between Serbia and Kosovo, its former province that went to war against repressive Serbian rule in the late 1990s. \nPolice also briefly detained Marko Djuric, the head of the Serbian government’s office for Kosovo. Djuric is banned from entering Kosovo over nationalist remarks Pristina regarded as inflammatory. He was later released at the border and crossed back into Serbia. \nIf Serb List’s 10 deputies also walk out, Haradinaj’s government would lose its parliamentary majority, though the PM ruled out snap elections. \n“I hope the Serb list will reconsider (their decision) again because unilateral decisions to leave the government are not a solution,” Haradinaj told reporters. \nHe denied the government was in danger of collapse but declined to say whether he would seek support from other parties. He also called on the Kosovo Serbs to return to dialogue. \n“It is not good to test anyone’s patience,” he said. \nNearly half of 120,000 Kosovo Serbs live in the north of the country and maintain strong economic, cultural and political links with Belgrade. Albanians make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo’s population of 1.8 million. \nKosovo police said nationalist Serb protesters had blocked roads with trucks and other heavy vehicles in Mitrovica on Tuesday. \nWhen he announced Serb List’s withdrawal from the government, Rakic said Kosovo Serbs would go ahead, even without Pristina’s consent, with forming a union of those municipalities where Serbs are in the majority, as agreed in an EU-sponsored dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina in 2013. \nThe agreement, which was designed to give Kosovo Serbs greater autonomy, was never implemented. \nKosovo won independence from Serbia after NATO bombed Serbian security forces to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians from the region in a counter-insurgency campaign. \nAlthough recognized by 116 nations, Kosovo is not a United Nations member because of objections from Serbia, some EU states, Russia and China. \nBut Belgrade is under pressure to normalize relations with Kosovo in order to help it progress toward EU accession. Both parties have committed to an EU-sponsored dialogue but little progress has been made. \nRussia’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it condemned the incident in Mitrovica, saying it was “aimed at intimidating Kosovan Serbs”. \nReporting by Ivana Sekularac in BELGRADE and Fatos Bytyci in PRISTINA,; Additional reporting by Denis Pinchuk in MOSCOW; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ",
