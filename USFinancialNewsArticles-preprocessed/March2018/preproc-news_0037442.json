    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass., March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Steel Connect, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: STCN), today announced financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2018 ended January 31, 2018. For a full discussion of the results, please see the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), which can be accessed through its Investor Relations website . Steel Connect will soon publish its updated Investor Presentation, which will be posted on the Investor Relations website and filed as an exhibit on Form 8-K with the SEC.\nAcquisition of IWCO Direct\nOn December 15, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of IWCO Direct for total consideration of approximately $469.2 million, net of purchase price adjustments. The Company financed the IWCO Direct acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from a $393.0 million term loan from Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, net of a $2.5 million receivable from escrow for working capital claims. Further information about the transaction can be found in the Company's Form 10-Q on file with the SEC. Additionally, as the acquisition closed on December 15, 2017, approximately half of the fiscal 2018 second quarter includes IWCO Direct results.\nExecutive Commentary\nCommenting on the Company's performance, Jim Henderson, Chief Executive Officer of Steel Connect stated, \"This was a transformative quarter for our Company in that we acquired a profitable, growing market-leader in IWCO Direct. Together with ModusLink, our supply chain management operating unit, Steel Connect, is well-positioned to bring more highly-demanded services to businesses around the globe. With IWCO Direct, we essentially double the size of our Company while adding significant earnings and free cash flow. While ModusLink's business is expected to be in a transition year due to certain planned client exits, on a consolidated basis, we expect to post positive EBITDA in fiscal 2018. We also see significant opportunities to drive growth and create value, both organically and through acquisitions in the years ahead.\"\nSecond Quarter Financial Results Summary\nNet Revenue\nThe Company reported net revenue of $151.1 million for the second quarter ended January 31, 2018, as compared to $117.6 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $33.6 million or 28.5%. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by the increase in revenue associated with the acquisition of IWCO Direct, offset by anticipated declines in the Supply Chain business due to planned client exits and end of life programs, primarily in the consumer electronics and consumer products industries.\nGross Margin\nGross margin for the second quarter ended January 31, 2018 was 11.2%, as compared to 9.5% for the same period in the prior year, an improvement of 170 basis points. This was primarily due to the acquisition of IWCO Direct and higher gross margins in ModusLink's Asian operations and e-Business. Note, IWCO Direct's gross margins were adversely impacted by a $7.0 million non-cash charge to cost of revenue related to a fair value \"step-up\" to work-in-process inventory, which was recognized in the fiscal 2018 second quarter.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the second quarter ended January 31, 2018 were $21.5 million, as compared to $12.7 million in the same period in the prior year, an increase of $8.8 million. Selling general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses for the quarter ended January 31, 2018 were $30.1 million, as compared to $11.9 million for the quarter ended January 31, 2017, an increase of $18.2 million, primarily due to additional SG&A costs associated with the Direct Marketing segment, higher professional fees associated with the acquisition of IWCO Direct and higher share-based compensation expense. The intangible asset amortization of $4.1 million during the three months ended January 31, 2018, relates to amortizable intangible assets acquired by the Company in connection with its acquisition of IWCO Direct, which includes trademarks, tradenames and customer relationships. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of real estate during the fiscal 2018 second quarter of $12.7 million.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nThe Company reported an operating loss of $4.6 million for the quarter ended January 31, 2018, as compared to an operating loss of $1.5 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was driven primarily by including SG&A expenses related to IWCO Direct, associated costs incurred with the IWCO Direct acquisition and share-based compensation, partially offset by a gain on the sale of property.\nNet Income (Loss)\nThe Company reported net income of $65.1 million for the quarter ended January 31, 2018, as compared to a net loss of $2.9 million in the comparable year-ago period. The biggest factor contributing to the year-over-year increase in net income was an income tax benefit of $77.7 million recognized in the fiscal 2018 second quarter. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.11 and $0.85, respectively, for the quarter ended January 31, 2018, as compared to a loss per share, both basic and diluted of $0.05 for the comparable year-ago period.\nDuring the second fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $77.7 million. The income tax benefit during the second fiscal quarter is primarily related to the reduction of the Company's valuation allowance associated with the IWCO acquisition of approximately $79.9 million, partially offset by income tax expense in certain jurisdictions where the Company operates, using the enacted tax rates in those jurisdictions.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nFor the three months ended January 31, 2018, the Company reported Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") of $1.8 million, as compared to EBITDA of $2.0 million for the same period in the prior year, a year-over-year decrease of $0.2 million. The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 million in the same period in the prior year, an increase of $3.1 million.\nSee EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included in this release.\nAbout Steel Connect, Inc.\nSteel Connect, Inc. is a publicly-traded diversified holding company (Nasdaq Global Select Market symbol \"STCN\") with two wholly-owned subsidiaries ModusLink Corporation and IWCO Direct that have market-leading positions in supply chain management and direct marketing.\nModusLink Corporation provides digital and physical supply chain solutions to many of the world's leading brands across a diverse range of industries, including consumer electronics, telecommunications, computing and storage, software and content, consumer packaged goods, medical devices, retail and luxury, and connected devices.

EBITDA represents earnings before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization of intangible assets. We define define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding net charges related to interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, SEC inquiry and restatement costs, strategic alternatives and other professional fees, executive severance and employee retention, restructuring, non-cash charge related to a fair value step-up to work-in-process inventory, share-based compensation, gain on sale of long-lived asset, impairment of long-lived assets, unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses, net, other non-operating (gains) losses, net, and (gains) losses on investments in affiliates and impairments.\nWe believe that providing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to investors is useful, as these measures provide important supplemental information of our performance to investors and permits investors and management to evaluate the operating performance of our core supply chain business. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors, determining a component of incentive compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our core supply chain business. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA financial measures assist in providing an enhanced understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage the core supply chain business, to evaluate performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nSee EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included in this release.\nSteel Connect, ModusLink and IWCO Direct are registered trademarks of Steel Connect, Inc.
