Northern League party leader Matteo Salvini poses at the end of a news conference, the day after Italy's parliamentary elections, in Milan, Italy March 5, 2018. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini Matteo Salvini replied “no”, when asked by reporters in Milan if he would be willing to make way for a candidate who may be able to garner more support in parliament. The League won around 17 percent of the vote at the election, ahead of about 14 percent for Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party). The centre-right coalition, which includes other smaller parties, took around 37 percent. That made it the biggest group in parliament, but left it short of an absolute majority, meaning it will need the support of other parties to govern.
