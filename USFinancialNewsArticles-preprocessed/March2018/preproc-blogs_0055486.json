    "text": "“The company is of such scale that the opportunities for future expansion in the U.S. are limited,” said \nNeil Saunders, \nmanaging director of GlobalData Retail, a consulting firm. “Moving onto this turf would give Walmart a whole new arena in which to expand,” at a time when retail margins are under pressure, he said. \nStill “the risks of becoming entangled in the complex U.S. health-care industry are considerable,” Mr. Saunders added. \nTaking over a health insurer would put the retailer into a complicated and highly regulated business. Humana’s business is particularly tied to the government because it focuses on Medicare coverage, at a time when health care is a political flashpoint. \nHumana, however, has withdrawn from the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges, after suffering losses, and the private Medicare plans it offers, known as Medicare Advantage, have recently been protected by both Republicans and Democrats. \nA Humana deal would also be a hefty expense for Walmart. Humana has a market value of $37 billion and a buyer would need to pay a premium. Walmart’s largest acquisition to date came in 1999 when it bought U.K.’s Asda Group PLC for $10.8 billion. Walmart ended its fiscal year with less than $7 billion in cash on hand. \nIn recent years, Walmart has expanded the pharmacy and health services it offers in stores, adding cheaper generic drugs for sale, procedures like vaccinations and urgent-care locations. It is part of an effort to give shoppers another reason to visit Walmart’s cavernous locations even as they buy more online. \nWalmart is also the largest seller of food in the U.S., putting it in a unique position to capitalize on shopper data or use a health insurer’s data to inform decisions on what products to carry in stores. The average age of a Walmart shopper is 50, according to Kantar Consulting, and it has gotten older over the last five years in line with the broader U.S. shopper population. \n“If I can get you in for your health care and your meds… then you are hopefully going to buy some blue jeans and laundry detergent,” said Steve Barr, consumer markets leader at PwC. \nWalmart and Humana have already partnered for over 10 years on a popular Medicare drug plan that lets customers fill prescriptions at Walmart pharmacies with low co-pays. \n“They’ve proven these two companies can work together in a retail setting,” said John Gorman, chairman of Gorman Health Group, a consulting firm focused on government health programs. A merged Walmart-Humana could create a Medicare plan that could be sold in Walmart stores and tap into Walmart’s other potential health offerings. \nIn addition, he said, Walmart’s heft as a major purchaser of goods including drugs might be able to generate savings for Humana and its members. Humana already owns its own pharmacy-benefit manager, but it is smaller than the giants in that business, such as",
