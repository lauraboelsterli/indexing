    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- STORE Capital Corporation (NYSE: STOR), an internally managed net-lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in S ingle T enant O perational R eal E state, today announced the closing of its first public offering of $350 million principal amount of investment grade-rated 4.50% senior notes (the “Notes”) due March 15, 2028.\nThe Notes were rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB by Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings. Net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes will be used to fund property acquisitions, to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facility, for working capital, and other general corporate purposes, or a combination of the foregoing.\n“It has always been our strategy to enter the public debt markets and we are excited to announce our inaugural issuance of public notes in the amount of $350 million,” said Christopher H. Volk, President and Chief Executive Officer of STORE Capital. “Our ability to issue corporate investment-grade term debt expands our borrowing capacity and flexibility. Going forward, we plan to continue to issue both secured debt under our S&P A+ rated Master Funding conduit and access the public unsecured debt market where the volume is greater and the efficiency is extremely high on a relative basis. Together, these will give us the ability to strategically source our debt capital and manage our cost of capital while maintaining well-laddered debt maturities and prudent leverage targets. We welcome our new debt investors and appreciate their support.”\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo Securities, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, KeyBanc Capital Markets and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey acted as joint book-running managers for the sale of the Notes. BMO Capital Markets, Capital One Securities and Regions Securities LLC acted as co-managers.\nAbout STORE Capital\nSTORE Capital Corporation is an internally managed net-lease real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is the leader in the acquisition, investment and management of S ingle T enant O perational R eal E state, which is its target market and the inspiration for its name.
