    "text": "MONTREAL, March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DAVIDsTEA Inc. (Nasdaq:DTEA) today provided an update on the strategic alternatives process following the receipt of a letter and press release from Rainy Day Investments Ltd. (“RDI”).\nOn March 19, 2018, RDI, a 46% shareholder of DAVIDsTEA Inc., announced a slate of director nominees to DAVIDsTEA for election to its Board of Directors at the annual meeting of shareholders expected to be held in June 2018.\nDAVIDsTEA’s board of directors is committed to respecting the proper corporate governance process and will review RDI’s proposed Board slate and interview the prospective candidates who are unknown to the Board. In parallel, the special committee continues to work with its financial advisor, William Blair & Company L.L.C., and its outside legal advisors Ropes & Gray LLP and Stikeman Elliott LLP to consider proposals for strategic alternatives including, but not limited to, a potential financing, refinancing, special dividend, restructuring, merger, acquisition, joint venture, divestiture or disposition of some or all of DTEA’s assets outside of the ordinary course of business. The company has not yet received a proposal from RDI.\n“As we review RDI’s proposal, we will continue to ensure that all shareholders are fairly represented on the Board. The process to explore strategic alternatives remains in place and represents the best way to assess the various options available for our shareholders. Of equal importance, we are working to ensure that DAVIDsTEA’s management team stays focused on improving the operational and financial performance of the company in order to maximize shareholder value,” stated DAVIDsTEA Chairman, Maurice Tousson.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements.
