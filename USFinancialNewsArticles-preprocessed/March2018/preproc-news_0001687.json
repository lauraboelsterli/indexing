    "text": "BRENTWOOD, Tenn., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- AAC Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AAC), announced today the completion of the acquisition of AdCare, Inc. (\"AdCare\") for total consideration of $85 million.\n\"We are thrilled to announce the closing of our acquisition of AdCare, which furthers our long-term strategy of diversifying our payor, region and treatment types,\" said Michael Cartwright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AAC Holdings. \"We look forward to adding AdCare's seasoned management team and dedicated employees to the AAC family and expanding our footprint in the Northeast, in order to build upon AdCare's over 30 years of exceptional clinical care and change the lives of those who seek our help.\"\nAdCare, founded in 1986, is one of the leading providers of addiction treatment in New England with approximately 8,000 hospital and residential admissions and over 116,000 outpatient visits per year. AdCare's facilities include a 114-bed hospital for substance abuse treatment, including detoxification and rehabilitation services, and five outpatient centers in Massachusetts and a 59-bed residential treatment center and two outpatient centers in Rhode Island. The acquisition also includes the purchase of 1-800-ALCOHOLâ„¢, a nationally recognized referral phone line, and other toll-free numbers that together generate approximately 50,000 calls per year.\nDavid Hillis, Sr., Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of AdCare added, \"Our leadership team and talented employees are very happy to be joining the team at AAC, which shares the same commitment to clinical excellence as AdCare and is the ideal partner to build upon the AdCare legacy. The opioid crisis in the Northeast continues to worsen, and there is an increasing need to deliver best in class treatment in in a variety of locations, types of treatments and payors. AAC's national reputation and financial and operational strength will allow our team to extend the number of patients we can serve.\"\nAdCare generated revenue, before the provision for bad debts, of $54 million and net income of $10 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017.\nIn connection with the acquisition of AdCare, AAC closed on the $65 million incremental term loan arranged by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities, BMO Capital Markets Corp. and Whitney Bank (d/b/a Hancock Bank).\n2018 Revised Outlook\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" a replacement of Revenue Recognition Topic 605. AAC adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018. Under ASC 606, the majority of our provision for doubtful accounts, which historically was reported as an operating expense, will now be reported as a direct reduction to revenue in 2018. This change in presentation will reduce revenues and operating expenses by the same amount and is not expected to have an effect on net income or earnings per share.\nAAC is revising its guidance for the full year 2018 to include AdCare from the March 1, 2018 acquisition date. Results for 2018 full year guidance as set forth below have been provided for the 10 months inclusive of ASC 606, and for comparability only, 2018 full year guidance has also been provided excluding the impact of ASC 606 (dollars in millions, except share data):\nFull Year 2018 Revised Guidance\nAs Currently\nReported\nAdjusted for\nAdoption of ASC 606\non January 1, 2018\nTotal Revenues\n$360 - $375\n$325 - $340\nResidential treatment facility revenue\n$285 - $290\n$262 - $266\nOutpatient and sober living facility revenue\n$44 - $50\n$40 - $46\nClient related diagnostic services revenue (includes point of care\ndrug testing and client related diagnostic laboratory services\nrevenue)\n$18 - $21\n$12 - $15\nNon-client related revenue (includes third-party marketing,\nlaboratory services and criminal justice services)\n$13 - $14\n$11 - $13\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$68 - $72\n$68 - $72\nAdjusted Earnings per Diluted Common Share\n$0.75 - $0.80\n$0.75 - $0.80\nAAC expects an annual effective tax rate of 24% to 26% and diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding of approximately 24.5 million for the year.\nThis outlook above does not include the impact of any future acquisitions, transaction-related costs, litigation settlement or expenses related to legal defenses.\nWith respect to the \"2018 Revised Outlook\" above, reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted common share guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts. This inability results from the inherent difficulty in forecasting generally and quantifying certain projected amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations. In particular, sufficient information is not available to calculate certain adjustments required for such reconciliations, including de novo start-up and other expense and acquisition-related expenses. We expect these adjustments may have a potentially significant impact on future GAAP financial results.",
