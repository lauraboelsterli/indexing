    "text": "TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (NYSE:OSG) (the “Company” or “OSG”) a provider of energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products in the U.S. Flag markets, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nHighlights\nIncome from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $53.6 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared with income from continuing operations of $64.7 million, or $0.74 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2016. Income from continuing operations for the full year 2017 was $56.0 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $1.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share for the full year 2016. Shipping revenues for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were $92.8 million and $390.4 million, down 19% and 16%, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016. Time charter equivalent (TCE) revenues (A) , a non-GAAP measure, for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were $82.8 million and $361.0 million, down 24% and 19%, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016. Fourth quarter and full year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA (B) , a non-GAAP measure, was $22.7 million and $111.1 million, down 54% and 37%, respectively, from $49.9 million and $176.2 million in the same periods in 2016. Total cash (C) , was $166.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Principal payment of $26.4 million plus accrued and unpaid interest of $514 thousand was made on December 27, 2017, on all of the outstanding 8.125% Notes in the fourth quarter, and as a result, the Company's obligations under the indenture was canceled and discharged.\nMr. Norton stated, “We witnessed a robust recovery of spot market rates during the fourth quarter. While still early days, we consider realized reduction in available supply and the emergence of the demand catalysts that we have been looking for - in particular in respect to demand for domestic crude oil transportation - as supportive of increased confidence in a progression towards a more balanced and normalized market environment.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nShipping revenues were $92.8 million for the quarter, down 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. TCE revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $82.8 million, a decrease of $26.8 million, or 24%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to lower average daily rates earned, which accounted for a $22.8 million decrease in TCE revenues and a 138-day decrease in revenue days for its fleet, excluding its modern lightering ATBs, driven by additional drydock and repair days resulting in a $4.0 million decrease in TCE revenues.\nA, B, C Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are included in the financial tables attached to this press release starting on Page 8.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.9 million, compared to operating income of $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income for the fourth quarter was $53.6 million, compared with net loss of $275.5 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $53.6 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared with a net income from continuing operations of $64.7 million, or $0.74 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2016. The increase reflects the income tax benefit primarily as a result of the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability to the newly enacted statutory rate of 21%.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $22.7 million for the quarter, a decrease of $27.1 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the decline in TCE revenues.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nShipping revenues were $390.4 million for the full year 2017, down 16% compared with the full year 2016. TCE revenues for the full year 2017 were $361.0 million, a decrease of $85.1 million, or 19%, compared with the full year 2016, primarily due to lower average daily rates, which accounted for a $75.2 million decrease in TCE revenues and a 278-day decrease in revenue days for its Jones Act fleet, excluding its modern lightering ATBs, driven by an increase in drydock days resulting in a $9.8 million decrease in TCE revenues.\nOperating income for the full year 2017 was $37.8 million, compared to operating loss of $31.5 million for the full year 2016.\nNet income for the full year 2017 was $56.0 million, compared with net loss of $293.6 million for the full year 2016. Income from continuing operations for the full year 2017 was $56.0 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $1.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share for the full year 2016. The increase reflects the income tax benefit primarily as a result of the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability to the newly enacted statutory rate of 21%.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $111.1 million for the full year 2017, a decrease of $65.1 million compared with the full year 2016, driven primarily by the decline in TCE revenues.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (“ET”) on Friday, March 9, 2018.\nTo access the call, participants should dial (844) 850-0546 for domestic callers and (412) 317-5203 for international callers.

Revenue days in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, totaled 2,029 compared with 2,167 in the prior year quarter. Revenue days in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, totaled 8,378 compared with 8,658 in the prior year.

Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the following non-GAAP measures may provide certain investors with additional information that will better enable them to evaluate the Company’s performance. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures are intended to provide supplemental information, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared with GAAP.\n(A) Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) Revenues\nConsistent with general practice in the shipping industry, the Company uses TCE revenues, which represents shipping revenues less voyage expenses, as a measure to compare revenue generated from a voyage charter to revenue generated from a time charter. Time charter equivalent revenues, a non-GAAP measure, provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with shipping revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because it assists Company management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of its vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. Reconciliation of TCE revenues of the segments to shipping revenues as reported in the consolidated statements of operations follow:\nThree Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended December 31, December 31, ($ in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 TCE revenues $ 82,754 $ 109,557 $ 361,036 $ 446,160 Add: Voyage Expenses 10,061 5,219 29,390 16,260 Shipping revenues $ 92,815 $ 114,776 $ 390,426 $ 462,420 Vessel Operating Contribution\nVessel operating contribution, a non-GAAP measure, is TCE revenues minus vessel expenses and charter hire expenses.\nOur “niche market activities,” which includes Delaware Bay lightering, MSP vessels and shuttle tankers, continue to provide a stable operating platform underlying our total US Flag operations. These vessels’ operations are insulated from the forces affecting the broader Jones Act market.\nThe following table sets forth the contribution of our vessels:\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Niche Market Activities $ 101,405 $ 106,410 $ 97,890 Jones Act Handysize Tankers 6,083 36,648 46,539 ATBs 26,057 69,928 74,678 Vessel Operating Contribution $ 133,545 $ 212,986 $ 219,107 (B) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net (loss)/income from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net (loss)/income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and (iii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used as a measure of operating results and performance, neither of them is necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. The following table reconciles net income/(loss) from continuing operations as reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended December 31, December 31, ($ in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income/(loss) from continuing operations $ 53,645 $ 64,678 $ 55,978 $ (1,059 ) Income tax benefit from continuing operations (59,679 ) (63,653 ) (57,627 ) (65,098 ) Interest expense 9,125 9,765 37,401 43,151 Depreciation and amortization 12,573 20,862 58,673 89,563 EBITDA 15,664 31,652 94,425 66,557 Severance costs — 10,758 16 12,996 Loss on disposal of vessels and other property, including impairments 5,847 6,623 13,200 104,532 Loss on repurchase of debt 1,238 456 3,237 2,988 Reorganization items, net (8 ) 393 190 (10,925 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 22,741 $ 49,882 $ 111,068 $ 176,225 (C) Total Cash\nDecember 31, December 31, ($ in thousands) 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents $ 165,994 $ 191,089 Restricted cash - current 58 7,272 Restricted cash – non-current 217 8,572 Total Cash $ 166,269 $ 206,933\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180309005347/en/\nOverseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nSusan Allan, 813-209-0620\nsallan@osg.com\nSource: Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.",
