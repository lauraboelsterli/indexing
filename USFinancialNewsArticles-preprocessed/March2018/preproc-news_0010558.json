    "text": "'Death Wish'@\nLOS ANGELES, March 4, ( Variety.com ) - Disney-Marvel's \"Black Panther\" is continuing its super-heroic run, grossing a stunning $501.1 million in North America in only 17 days and becoming the 10th highest grosser of all time.\n\"Black Panther,\" starring Chadwick Boseman, dominated domestic moviegoing in its third weekend with $65.7 million at 4,084 locations -- the third-highest weekend of all time after \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" at $90.2 million and \"Avatar\" at $68.5 million.\n\"Black Panther\" is now the second-highest grossing Marvel movie of all time at the domestic box office, surpassing \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" this weekend at $459 million and trailing only \"The Avengers\" at $623.4 million. \"Black Panther\" has a realistic shot at reaching that level in the coming weeks and may eventually top \"Jurassic World\" at $652 million and \"Titanic\" at $659 million for the third highest domestic total of all time.\nTwo new titles opened with moderate results that might have been higher without a must-see title like \"Black Panther\" in multiplexes. Jennifer Lawrence's spy thriller \"Red Sparrow\" launched with $17 million at 3,056 sites for Fox and Bruce Willis' \"Death Wish\" debuted with $13 million at 2,847 venues for MGM.\nWarner Bros.' second weekend of comedy thriller \"Game Night\" followed in fourth with $10.7 million from 3,502 sites, edging Sony's fourth weekend of CGI-live action \"Peter Rabbit\" with $10 million at 3,607 locations. \"Peter Rabbit\" has connected with family audiences for $84 million in its first 24 days.\nParamount's second weekend of \"Annihilation\" finished in sixth with $5.7 million at 2,112 venues, followed by Sony's 11th weekend of its sturdy action comedy \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" with $4.5 million at 2,313 sites. \"Jumanji\" has now grossed $393.2 million in 75 days.\nThanks to \"Black Panther\" and \"Jumanji,\" overall domestic box office for 2018 is up an impressive 10.9 percent to $2.12 billion, according to comScore.",
