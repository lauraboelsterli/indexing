    "text": "SANTA BARBARA, Calif., March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- QAD Inc. (Nasdaq: QADA) (Nasdaq: QADB), a leading provider of flexible, cloud-based enterprise software and services for global manufacturing companies, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year ended January 31, 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights:\nTotal revenue for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter increased 10 percent to $80.8 million, from $73.3 million for the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter. Subscription revenue for the fourth quarter represented 24 percent of total revenue and grew by 34 percent.\nAdditional fiscal 2018 fourth quarter financial highlights, versus the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter, include:\nSubscription revenue of $19.7 million, compared with $14.7 million. Subscription gross margin increased to 60 percent, compared with 53 percent. License revenue of $7.2 million, compared with $8.9 million. Professional services revenue of $22.1 million, compared with $17.9 million. Maintenance and other revenue of $31.9 million, compared with $31.8 million. GAAP pre-tax loss of $3 million, versus GAAP pre-tax income of $4.6 million. As previously disclosed, stronger than anticipated new cloud business bookings in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter resulted in higher commissions and bonuses without the associated revenue, as the company currently recognizes these expenses up front, while the revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period. Non-GAAP pre-tax loss of $927,000, versus non-GAAP pre-tax income of $6.3 million. GAAP net loss of $5.2 million, or $0.28 per Class A share and $0.23 per Class B share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $15.2 million, or $0.82 per Class A share and $0.68 per Class B share. Fiscal 2018 included a one-time tax expense of $2 million related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Fiscal 2017 included placement of a valuation allowance of $16.3 million against U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets.\n\"We are continuing to successfully drive our cloud business, resulting in 33 percent subscription growth year-over-year,\" said Karl Lopker, Chief Executive Officer. \"An ongoing strong global manufacturing environment, combined with the success of our Cloud offerings, sets the stage for continuing growth in the coming year.\"\nFiscal 2018 Full Year Results:\nFor fiscal 2018, total revenue grew 10 percent to $305 million, up from $278 million last year. Subscription revenue for the year grew 33% to $69.6 million from $52.2 million in the prior year. GAAP pre-tax loss was $4.2 million, versus GAAP pre-tax income of $3.8 million for fiscal 2017. GAAP net loss was $9.1 million, or $0.49 per Class A share and $0.41 per Class B share, for fiscal 2018, versus a GAAP net loss of $15.5 million, or $0.84 per Class A share and $0.70 per Class B share, last year. Non-GAAP pre-tax income was $5.2 million for fiscal 2018, compared with $12 million for fiscal 2017.\nIncome tax expense was $4.9 million in fiscal 2018 and incorporates the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted in December. This includes a one-time required transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings, partially offset by the re-measurement of deferred taxes using the new U.S. statutory tax rate. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on its anticipated results for fiscal 2019.\nQAD's cash and equivalents balance was $147 million at January 31, 2018, up from $145.1 million one year ago. Cash provided by operations was $10.4 million for the fiscal 2018 full year, compared with $18.7 million for the fiscal 2017 full year.\nFiscal 2018 Fourth Quarter Operational Highlights:\nReceived orders from 49 customers representing more than $500,000 each in combined license, subscription, maintenance and professional services billings, including 20 orders exceeding $1 million; Received license or cloud orders from companies across QAD's six vertical markets, including: Adient Limited, CCL Industries Inc., Ceva Sant√© Animale, Cultura Socultur SAS, Deerfield Imaging, Inc., Expanscience SA, Harada Industry Co.

GAAP pre-tax income of breakeven. Non-GAAP pre-tax income of approximately $2 million.\nFor the fiscal 2019 full year, QAD expects:\nTotal revenue of $328 to $332 million, including $90 to $92 million of subscription revenue.

These are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. QAD defines the non-GAAP measures as follows:\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA is GAAP net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA less stock-based compensation expense and the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins - Calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. Non-GAAP pre-tax income - GAAP income before income taxes not including the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets and the change in fair value of the interest rate swap. Cash taxes - Cash taxes are defined as GAAP total tax expense excluding changes in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits.\nQAD's management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the business and believes that presenting non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company's underlying business trends and performance of the company's ongoing operations as well as useful metrics for monitoring the company's performance and evaluating it against industry peers. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should be used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure in evaluating the company.\nTables providing a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this press release.\nQAD non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nStock-based compensation expense: The company has excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP pre-tax income calculations. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense which generally requires cash settlement by QAD, and therefore is not used by the company to assess the profitability of its operations. The company also believes the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a more useful comparison of its operating results to the operating results of its peers.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets: The company amortizes purchased intangible assets in connection with its acquisitions. QAD has excluded the effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets, which include purchased technology, customer relationships, trade names and other intangible assets, from its non-GAAP pre-tax income calculation, because doing so makes internal comparisons to the company's historical operating results more consistent. In addition, the company believes excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets provides a more useful comparison of its operating results to the operating results of its peers.\nChange in fair value of the interest rate swap: The company entered into an interest rate swap to mitigate its exposure to the variability of one-month LIBOR for its floating rate debt related to the mortgage of its headquarters. QAD has excluded the gain/loss adjustments to record the interest rate swap at fair value from its non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP pre-tax income calculations. The company believes that these fluctuations are not indicative of its operational costs or meaningful in evaluating comparative period results because the company currently has no intention of exiting the debt agreement early; and therefore over the life of the debt the sum of the fair value adjustments will be $0.\nAbout QAD ‚Äì The Effective Enterprise\nQAD Inc.
