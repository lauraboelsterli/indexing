(Nasdaq:CNSL) (the “Company”) reported results for the fourth quarter 2017 and will hold a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss its results today at 11 a.m. ET.\nFourth quarter 2017 Consolidated Communications financial summary:\nRevenue totaled $356.4 million Net cash from operating activities was $84.8 million Adjusted EBITDA was $133.2 million Dividend payout ratio was 64.6 percent Recognized $115.1 million net tax benefit, largely associated with recent tax reform legislation\n“2017 was a transformational year, one which has positioned the Company for future growth and opportunities,” said Bob Udell, president and chief executive officer of Consolidated Communications. “In the first half of the year, we executed on our organic growth strategy and closed the FairPoint acquisition. In the second half, we completed our organizational alignment, while we launched integration projects and fast-start initiatives to leverage our expanded fiber network and minimize customer pain points. We are recognizing the immediate financial and capital structure benefits of the merger and are excited about 2018 as we invest and expand our fiber network to position ourselves for future broadband and business growth.”\n“Last week we announced plans to increase broadband speeds to more than 500,000 residents and small businesses across our Northern New England service area by the end of 2018,” Udell added. “We have aggressive projects underway to expand our fiber network which will result in increased broadband speeds and improve network reliability.”\n“We are making great progress on our FairPoint integration and I am pleased to report we have completed the conversion of our ERP system and are now operating on a single, fully integrated platform for finance, supply chain and human resource functions,” said Bob Udell.\nPro Forma Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter\nThe pro forma results give effect to the FairPoint acquisition as if it had occurred as of Jan. 1, 2016.\nRevenues were $356.4 million, compared to adjusted revenue of $374.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, after excluding $5.4 million attributed to the equipment sales and service business, which the Company divested in 2016. Results continue to reflect expected declines in voice, subsidies and network access revenues, while commercial and carrier data and transport service revenue increased 1.4 percent or $1.2 million. Consumer broadband increased $200,000, while video, a low margin product, declined $1.6 million. Income from operations was $9.3 million, compared to $55.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year over year decline is primarily due to a $39.6 million non-cash pension benefit recognized by FairPoint in the fourth quarter of 2016. The one-time benefit resulted from the reduction in a post-retirement benefit obligation as a result of the elimination of certain post-employment healthcare benefits. The remaining decline was due to a decrease in operating revenue, which was partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses from synergy realization and efficiency improvements. Interest expense, net was $29.9 million, compared to $29.3 million for the same period last year. Cash distributions from the Company’s wireless partnerships were $8.0 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017, as compared to $8.9 million the prior year. Other income, net was $8.4 million, compared to $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a GAAP basis, net income was $101.7 million and GAAP income per share was $1.44. Net income was impacted by $112.9 million net tax benefit recorded as a result of the recent tax legislation. Adjusted diluted net income per share excludes certain items in the manner described in the table provided in this release. Adjusted diluted net income per share was ($0.04) in the fourth quarter, compared to $0.11 the same period last year. Additionally, net income per share has been impacted by approximately $0.11 due to increased depreciation and amortization associated with the preliminary valuation of the FairPoint assets. Adjusted EBITDA was $133.2 million compared to pro forma $138.3 million a year ago. The year over year decline is primarily due to lower revenues as well as the decline in wireless cash distributions, offset by declining expenses and synergies realized as a result of the FairPoint acquisition. The total net debt to pro forma last 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.34x, before giving effect to full targeted synergies of $55 million which are expected to be realized within the first two years from closing the FairPoint acquisition.\nFull-Year Pro Forma 2017 Results\nFor the full year 2017, pro forma operating revenue totaled $1,460.6 million, down 6.8 percent from fiscal 2016. Approximately 44 percent of the revenue decline is attributed to the divestiture of the equipment services business and the Iowa ILEC in 2016. The balance of the year over year decline is primarily due to continued erosion of legacy voice services and access revenues as well as the step down in transition funding in CAF II support. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was $536.2 million for fiscal 2017. The pro forma dividend payout ratio was 56.3 percent.\nCash Available to Pay Dividends, Capex\nFor the fourth quarter, cash available to pay dividends was $42.5 million, and the dividend payout ratio was 64.6 percent as compared to 78.2 percent in the fourth quarter a year ago. At Dec. 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $15.7 million. Capital expenditures were $61.9 million for the fourth quarter.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe Company is providing guidance for fiscal 2018 as follows:\n($ in millions) 2017 Pro Forma\nResults 2018 Guidance Cash interest expense 1 $ 112.9 $123 to $128 Cash income taxes/refund 2 $ 1.3 $1 to $3 Capital expenditures $ 227.2 $235 to $245 (1) 2017 Pro Forma cash interest expense is based on actual interest expense incurred since the July 3rd closing of the Fairpoint acquisition and pro forma for January 1, 2017 through July 3rd, 2017 calculated as if the merger was in effect at January 1. 2017. (2) Cash income taxes primarily include local and state income taxes as federal income taxes will be shielded by existing net operating losses and the benefit of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 tax reform legislation that was enacted in December, 2017. Dividend Payments\nOn Feb. 23, 2018, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.38738 per common share, which is payable on May 1, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2018. This will represent the 51 st consecutive quarterly dividend paid by the Company.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today at 11 a.m. ET / 10 a.m. CT to discuss fourth quarter earnings and developments with respect to the Company. The live webcast and replay can be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at http://ir.consolidated.com .

(NASDAQ:CNSL) is a leading broadband and business communications provider serving consumers, businesses of all sizes, and wireless companies and carriers, across a 24-state service area. Leveraging its advanced fiber optic network spanning more than 36,000 fiber route miles, Consolidated Communications offers a wide range of communications solutions, including: data, voice, video, managed services, cloud computing and wireless backhaul. Headquartered in Mattoon, Ill., Consolidated Communications has been providing services in many of its markets for more than a century.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release, as well as the conference call, includes disclosures regarding “EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA,” “cash available to pay dividends” and the related “dividend payout ratio,” “total net debt to last twelve month adjusted EBITDA coverage ratio,” “adjusted diluted net income per share” and “adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders,” all of which are non-GAAP financial measures and described in this section as not being in compliance with Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they should not be construed as alternatives to net cash from operating or investing activities, cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, net income or net income per share as defined by GAAP and are not, on their own, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, not all companies use identical calculations, and the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow.\nAdjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, adjusted for certain items as permitted or required by the lenders under our credit agreement in place at the end of each quarter in the periods presented. The tables that follow include an explanation of how adjusted EBITDA is calculated for each of the periods presented with the reconciliation to net income. EBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization on a historical basis.\nCash available to pay dividends represents adjusted EBITDA plus cash interest income less (1) cash interest expense, (2) capital expenditures and (3) cash income taxes; this calculation differs in certain respects from the similar calculation used in our credit agreement.\nWe present adjusted EBITDA, cash available to pay dividends and the related dividend payout ratio for several reasons. Management believes adjusted EBITDA, cash available to pay dividends and the dividend payout ratio are useful as a means to evaluate our ability to fund our estimated uses of cash (including interest on our debt) and pay dividends. In addition, we have presented adjusted EBITDA, cash available to pay dividends and the dividend payout ratio to investors in the past because they are frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, and management believes presenting them here provides a measure of consistency in our financial reporting. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available to pay dividends, referred to as Available Cash in our credit agreement, are also components of the restrictive covenants and financial ratios contained in our credit agreement that requires us to maintain compliance with these covenants and limit certain activities, such as our ability to incur debt and to pay dividends. The definitions in these covenants and ratios are based on adjusted EBITDA and cash available to pay dividends after giving effect to specified charges. In addition, adjusted EBITDA, cash available to pay dividends and the dividend payout ratio provide our board of directors with meaningful information to determine, with other data, assumptions and considerations, our dividend policy and our ability to pay dividends under the restrictive covenants in our credit agreement and to measure our ability to service and repay debt. We present the related “total net debt to last twelve month adjusted EBITDA coverage ratio” principally to put other non-GAAP measures in context and facilitate comparisons by investors, security analysts and others; this ratio differs in certain respects from the similar ratio used in our credit agreement. These measures differ in certain respects from the ratios used in our senior notes indenture.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, adjusted EBITDA does not represent the residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayment and interest payments are not deducted from such measure. Similarly, while we may generate cash available to pay dividends, we are not required to use any such cash to pay dividends, and the payment of any dividends is subject to declaration by our board of directors, compliance with applicable law and the terms of our credit agreement. Because adjusted EBITDA is a component of the dividend payout ratio and the ratio of total net debt to last twelve month adjusted EBITDA, these measures are also subject to the material limitations discussed above. In addition, the ratio of total net debt to last twelve month adjusted EBITDA is subject to the risk that we may not be able to use the cash on the balance sheet to reduce our debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Management believes these ratios are useful as a means to evaluate our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nWe present the non-GAAP measures adjusted diluted net income per share and adjusted diluted net income attributable to common stockholders because our net income and net income per share are regularly affected by items that occur at irregular intervals or are non-cash items. We believe that disclosing these measures assists investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating both our company over time and the relative performance of the companies in our industry.\nPreliminary Pro Forma Results\nEstimated pro forma results of operations presented herein gives effect to the acquisition of FairPoint Communications, Inc. as if it had occurred on Jan. 1, 2016. The estimated pro forma results include certain accounting adjustments related to the acquisition that are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results, including adjustments for depreciation and amortization of the acquired tangible and intangible assets acquired, interest expense on the debt incurred to complete the acquisition and to repay certain existing indebtedness of FairPoint, the exclusion of certain acquisition related costs and the tax impact of these pro forma adjustments. These adjustments and the related results are based on a preliminary valuation of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, which is subject to change upon the final assessment and such changes could be material. The estimated pro forma information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of the combined company that would have been obtained had the acquisition been completed as of the dates presented and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of the combined company.\nSafe Harbor\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions.
