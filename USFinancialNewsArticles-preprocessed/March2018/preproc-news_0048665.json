    "text": "China says US approach on trade sets bad precedent, may trigger domino effect China's commerce ministry said Thursday the U.S. approach on trade sets a bad precedent. The ministry warned that a unilateral trade approach could trigger a domino effect. Published 10 Hours Ago Reuters Nicolas Asfouri | AFP | Getty Images US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping leave a business leaders event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on November 9, 2017. \nChina's commerce ministry said on Thursday the U.S. approach on trade sets a bad precedent that could trigger a domino effect and the United States must avoid a unilateral approach. \nThe U.S. trade measures on China were typical trade protectionism and reflected a Cold War attitude, ministry spokesman Gao Feng told a regular briefing. A U.S. 301 probe on China was a blatant violation of World Trade Organization rules, Gao said. \nChina hopes the United States could take measures and resolve the conflicts through dialogue and hoped trade relations between the two countries could return to normal, Gao said. \nGao said China would take all possible steps to protect its interests and was confident in its ability to counter any trade and investment protectionism.",
