EBITDA came to €77.5 million in 2017, up 35.0% year on year. EBITDA margin improved significantly to 16.9% in 2017, compared with 13.4% a year earlier.\n2017 represents another positive milestone in the Group's transformation. The revamp of its business model continues, capacity for innovation has been bolstered and the organizational structure has been adjusted to make it even more agile. The disposal of Cegelease end-February 2018, completes the refocus initiated in 2015. 2017 results reflect the combined impact of good sales momentum and improved profitability.\nBoth operating divisions saw like-for-like revenue growth. Health Insurance, HR and e-services division revenues rose by 8.5% and Healthcare professionals division revenues increased by 1.4%.\nEBITDA growth is mainly due to the significant recovery posted by the Healthcare professionals division, itself mostly due to a favorable base effect\nSimplified income statement\n2017 2016 Chg. €m % €m % % Revenue 457.4 100.0 429.3 100.0 +6.6% EBITDA 77.5 16.9 57.4 13.4 +35.0% Depreciation (40.1) (8.8) (34.3) (8.0) +17.0% EBIT before special items 37.4 8.2 23.1 5.4 +61.8% Special items (18.9) (4.1) (24.1) (5.6) (21.8)% EBIT 18.5 4.1 (1.0) (0.2) n.m.

EPS before special items 0.9 - (1.5) - n.m. Earnings per share 0.8 - (1.9) - n.m. Consolidated revenues from continuing activities for 2017 amounted to €457.4 million, a 6.6% increase as reported. Excluding an unfavorable currency translation effect of 0.9% and a 1.6% boost from acquisitions, revenues rose 5.9%.\nBoth of the divisions grew their like-for-like revenues. Health insurance, HR and e-services division revenues rose by 8.5%, and Healthcare professionals division revenues rose by 1.4%.\nEBITDA increased significantly by €20.1 million, or 35.06%, to €77.5 million. The margin also rose, to 16.9% from 13.4% in 2016. The EBITDA performance was chiefly the result of lower purchased used and stable external expenses combined with a lower increase of personnel costs compare to revenue increase.\nDepreciation and amortization costs rose €14.3 million to €40.1 million in 2017 compared with €34.3 million in 2016. Most of the increase was due to the €4.2 million increase in the amortization of R&D expenses over the period.\nEBIT from recurring operations rose €14.3 million, or 61.8%, to €37.4 million. The margin improved to 8.2% in 2017 from 5.4% in 2016.\nExceptional items amounted to a charge of €18.9 million compared with a charge of €24.1 million in 2016. This decrease is chiefly due to the €3.1 million decline in restructuring costs over the period, to the fact that in 2017 there was no fine relating to the former activity sold in 2007, partially offset by a €1.8 million increase in the allowance for legacy software in the United States and France.\nNet cost of financial debt fell by €19.3 million, or 74.1%, to €6.7 million compared with €26.0 million in 2016. The decline reflects the positive impact of refinancing carried out in the first half of 2016.\nTax costs came to a charge of €4.7 million compared with a €2.3 million charge in 2016. The increase was chiefly due to an increase of €2.5 million at income taxes.\nThus, the profit attributable to the owners of the parent came to a profit of €11.1 million compared to a loss of €26.7 million in 2016. The consolidated net result from continuing activities came to a profit of €7.1 million compared with a loss of €29.5 million in 2016. Net profit before special items came to €0.9 profit per share compared with a €1.5 loss a year earlier. Earnings per share were a €0.8 profit compared with a €1.9 loss in 2016.\nAnalysis of business trends by division\nKey figures per division\nRevenue EBIT before special items EBITDA In € million FY 2017 FY 2016 FY 2017 FY 2016 FY 2017 FY 2016 Health insurance, HR and e-services 291.1 262.4 28.4 28.6 48.1 43.9 Healthcare professionals 162.5 163.6 10.4 (0.8) 25.0 12.8 Corporate and others 3.9 3.3 (1.3) (4.7) 4.4 0.7 Cegedim 457.4 429.3 37.4 23.1 77.5 57.4 Health insurance, HR and e-services\nThe division's 2017 revenues came to €291.1 million, up 10.9% on a reported basis. The November 2016 Futuramedia acquisition in France made a positive contribution of 2.6%. Currency translation had a negative impact of 0.2%. Like-for-like revenues rose 8.5% over the period. The division represented 63.6% of consolidated revenues from continuing activities, compared with 61.1% over the same period a year earlier.\nEBITDA rose in 2017, up 9.5%, to €48.1 million, compared with €43.9 million in 2016. EBITDA margin was 16.5% in 17, a decrease of 0.2 point compared with 2016.\nThe businesses that made the biggest contributions to this growth in revenue and EBITDA were C-MEDIA, merger of RNP and Futuramedia (ad at point of sales in pharmacies and health & wellness shops), Cegedim SRH (HR management solutions), Cegedim e-business (digitalization and data exchange), sales statistics for pharmaceutical products, and - in the field of health insurance - third-party payment flow management. EBITDA growth was partly offset by the health insurance software and services businesses' switch to SaaS format and by the launch of BPO offerings.\nHealthcare professionals\nThe division's 2017 revenues came to €162.5 million, down 0.7% on a reported basis. Currencies had a negative impact of 2.2%. There was virtually no impact from acquisitions or divestments. Like-for-like revenues rose 1.4% over the period.\nThe division represented 35.5% of consolidated Group revenues from continuing activities, compared with 38.1% over the same period a year earlier.\nEBITDA grew significantly by €95.4%, to €25.04 million, compared with €12.8 million in 2016. EBITDA margin was 15.4%, up 7.6 points compared with 2016.\nThe slight revenue growth combined with the sharp increase in EBITDA reflect the positive base effect on the computerization of doctors in the United States, Belgium and France, and of pharmacists in France. After a rather mixed start to the year, business in the United Kingdom saw a return to fourth quarter revenue growth rates.\nCorporate and others\nThe division's 2017 revenues came to €3.9 million, up 17.2% on a reported basis and like for like. There was no currency impact and no acquisitions or divestments. The division represented 0.8% of consolidated revenues from continuing activities in 2017 and 2016.\nEBITDA increased significantly by €3.7 million, to €4.4 million compared with a €00.7 million in 2016.\nThe positive EBITDA trend was principally due to a favorable base effect.\nFinancial resources\nAcquisition goodwill represented €167.8 million at December 3, 2017 compared with €199.0 million at end-2016. The €31.2 million decrease, equal to 15.7%, was mainly attributable to the classification as assets held for sale of €28.3 million in acquisition goodwill linked to the disposal of Cegelease and Eurofarmat. Acquisition goodwill represented 22.5% of the total balance sheet at December 31, 2017, compared with 28.1% on December 31, 2016.\nCash and equivalents decreased by €2.1 million to €18.7 million at December 31, 2017. This drop was principally due to the classification as assets held for sale of €5.2 million in cash linked to the sale of Cegelease.\nShareholders' equity rose €8.4 million to €197.3 million at December 31, 2017. This trend reflects the results of the €11.1 million net earnings profit attributable to owners of the parent partially offset by a €2.6 million decrease in group exchange gain/losses. Shareholders' equity represented 26.4% of the total balance sheet at end-December 2017, compared with 26.6% at end-December 2016.\nNet financial debt amounted to €236.2 million at end-December 2017, up €9.3 million compared with end-December 2016. It represented 119.7% of Group shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017, compared with 120.1% at December 31, 2016.\nFree cash flow from operation came to an inflow of €13.4 million compared with an outflow of €2.4 million. This €15.8 million euros increase came mainly from an increase from cash-flow before taxes and interest and a decrease in corporate tax paid partially offset by an increase in working capital requirement.\nOutlook\nCautiously optimistic for 2018\nWith a position in structurally buoyant markets and its strategic refocus complete, Cegedim boasts solid fundamentals, a balanced portfolio of complementary offerings, a diversified client-base, a widespread geographic footprint and the strength of an integrated group. This should enable it to continue its growth momentum and reach a new stage in its development, so it can deliver lasting, profitable growth.\nTo continue the initiatives it successfully implemented in 2017, Cegedim will maintain a strategy primarily focused on organic growth and driven by a robust innovation policy.\nThe Group is cautiously optimistic for 2018 and expects moderate organic revenue growth and a similar increase in EBITDA.\nIn 2018, the Group does not expect any significant acquisitions and is not issuing any earnings estimates or forecasts.\nPotential impact of Brexit\nIn 2017, the UK accounted for 10.9% of consolidated Group revenues from continuing activities and 14.0% of consolidated Group EBIT.\nCegedim deals in local currency in the UK, as it does in every country where it is present. Thus Brexit is unlikely to have a material impact on Group EBIT.\nWith regard to healthcare policy, the Group has not identified any major European programs at work in the UK and expects UK policy to be only marginally affected by Brexit.\nThe figures cited above include guidance on Cegedim's future financial performances.

Cegedim provides BPO services for human resources, Revenue Cycle Management in the US and management services for insurance companies, provident institutions and mutual insurers.\nBusiness model transformation: Cegedim decided in fall 2015 to switch all of its offerings over to SaaS format, to develop a complete BPO offering, and to materially increase its R&D efforts. This is reflected in the Group's revamped business model. The change has altered the Group's revenue recognition and negatively affected short-term profitability\nCorporate and others: This division encompasses the activities the Group performs as the parent company of a listed entity, as well as the support it provides to the three operating divisions.\nEPS: Earnings Per Share is a specific financial indicator defined by the Group as the net profit (loss) for the period divided by the weighted average of the number of shares in circulation.\nOperating expenses: Operating expenses is defined as purchases used, external expenses and payroll costs.\nRevenue at constant exchange rate: When changes in revenue at constant exchange rate are referred to, it means that the impact of exchange rate fluctuations has been excluded. The term \"at constant exchange rate\" covers the fluctuation resulting from applying the exchange rates for the preceding period to the current fiscal year, all other factors remaining equal.\nRevenue on a like-for-like basis: The effect of changes in scope is corrected by restating the sales for the previous period as follows:\nby removing the portion of sales originating in the entity or the rights acquired for a period identical to the period during which they were held to the current period; similarly, when an entity is transferred, the sales for the portion in question in the previous period are eliminated. Life-for-like data (L-f-l): At constant scope and exchange rates.\nInternal growth: Internal growth covers growth resulting from the development of an existing contract, particularly due to an increase in rates and/or the volumes distributed or processed, new contracts, acquisitions of assets allocated to a contract or a specific project. External growth: External growth covers acquisitions during the current fiscal year, as well as those which have had a partial impact on the previous fiscal year, net of sales of entities and/or assets.\nEBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. EBIT corresponds to net revenue minus operating expenses (such as salaries, social charges, materials, energy, research, services, external services, advertising, etc.). It is the operating income for the Cegedim Group.\nEBIT before special items: This is EBIT restated to take account of non-current items, such as losses on tangible and intangible assets, restructuring, etc. It corresponds to the operating income from recurring operations for the Cegedim Group.\nEBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is the term used when amortization or depreciation and revaluations are not taken into account. \"D\" stands for depreciation of tangible assets (such as buildings, machines or vehicles), while \"A\" stands for amortization of intangible assets (such as patents, licenses and goodwill). EBITDA is restated to take account of non-current items, such as losses on tangible and intangible assets, restructuring, etc. It corresponds to the gross operating earnings from recurring operations for the Cegedim Group.\nAdjusted EBITDA : Consolidated EBITDA adjusted, for 2016, for the €4.0m of negative impact from impairment of receivables in the Healthcare Professional division\nNet Financial Debt: This represents the Company's net debt (non-current and current financial debt, bank loans, debt restated at amortized cost and interest on loans) net of cash and cash equivalents and excluding revaluation of debt derivatives.\nFree cash flow: Free cash flow is cash generated, net of the cash part of the following items: (i) changes in working capital requirements, (ii) transactions on equity (changes in capital, dividends paid and received), (iii) capital expenditure net of transfers, (iv) net financial interest paid and (v) taxes paid.\nEBIT margin: EBIT margin is defined as the ratio of EBIT/revenue.\nEBIT margin before special items: EBIT margin before special items is defined as the ratio of EBIT before special items/revenue.\nNet cash: Net cash is defined as cash and cash equivalent minus overdraft.\nGlossary\nAbout Cegedim:\nFounded in 1969, Cegedim is an innovative technology and services company in the field of digital data flow management for healthcare ecosystems and B2B, and a business software publisher for healthcare and insurance professionals.
