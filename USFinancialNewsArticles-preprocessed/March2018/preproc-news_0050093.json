    "text": "Tweet Link \nTrump also repeatedly bashed the \"Amazon Washington Post\" on Twitter. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. \nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hinted in July the administration may soon take \"a position\" on Amazon's tax collection policy. \nAt a Senate hearing on July 26, Sen. Joe Manchin , D-W.Va., asked the Treasury secretary about his view on internet state sales taxes. \n\"So this is an issue that we've been looking at very carefully within the administration, and we expect to come out with a position shortly,\" Mnuchin said. \"I am encouraged that Amazon is now charging tax, I believe, on their own sales but not the marketplace. I'm not sure I understand the consistency on that, but I respect the states' ability that there's an awful lot of money that's not being collected.\" \nMnuchin was referring to e-commerce giant's \"third-party\" marketplace, where other firms sell goods on Amazon's website. In its \"first-party\" business, the internet company sell products directly to customers. \nMore recently, Mnuchin told the House Ways and Means Committee hearing in February that the administration \"feels strongly\" the government should institute a sales tax on internet e-commerce. \nBut there hasn't been much follow-up beyond these statements on the Amazon's tax treatment. \nSome states — like Washington, Minnesota and Rhode Island — have passed laws requiring online marketplaces to collect sales taxes on behalf of its \"third-party\" sellers. \nAmazon declined to comment.
