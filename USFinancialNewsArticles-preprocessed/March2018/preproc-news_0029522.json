NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg addresses a news conference at the Alliance headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman Stoltenberg said Britain could count on NATO’s solidarity, but said there has been no request by London to activate the alliance’s mutual defense clause, nor any request for help in the British investigation. “The attack in Salisbury happened against a backdrop of a pattern we have seen over many years,” he said, referring to Russia. “We are responding in many different ways,” he told a news conference.
