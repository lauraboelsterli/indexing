(Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Food and Drug Administration is taking the first step toward implementing a rule about the role flavors, including menthol, play in attracting users to certain tobacco products. The agency is publishing an advanced notice of proposed rule-making seeking public comment on the role that flavors in tobacco products play in attracting youth, as well as in helping smokers switch to potentially less harmful alternatives. The public comment period will be open for 90 days. The FDA banned certain flavors in cigarettes in 2009, but menthol was not included. The role of flavors has become increasingly scrutinized as adolescents and teenagers have adopted e-cigs with fruity variations. On the flipside, these products may appeal to smokers who are looking for a way to quit smoking cigarettes. The FDA, under Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, have adopted the idea that tobacco products exist on a continuum of risk, with cigarettes being the most deadly on the spectrum.",
