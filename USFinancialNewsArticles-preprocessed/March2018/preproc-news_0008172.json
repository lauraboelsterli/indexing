There is no rowing back so that gets us to a cautious start,” NAB’s Attrill added.\nNews over the weekend suggested that Trump was going ahead with his threat, while there was no indication that allies would be excluded from the tariffs planned on imported steel and aluminium.\nCanada and Mexico have threatened retaliation, and the European Union said it would apply 25 percent tariffs on about $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if Trump carried out his threat.\nChina said on Sunday it did not want a trade war with the United States but will defend its interests, adding policies based on“mistaken assumptions” will damage bilateral relations.\nSOFT SHARES Asian shares started the week on the defensive despite a late rebound on Wall Street on Friday as investors worried a U.S.-led trade war could derail economic momentum around the world.\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was a touch weaker, hovering near the lowest since mid-February. It ended last week down more than 2 percent.\nJapan’s Nikkei fell 0.4 percent while South Korea’s KOSPI faltered 0.3 percent and Australian shares declined 0.3 percent.\nU.S. stock futures did not inspire much confidence, with S&P E-Minis down 0.2 percent and Dow futures off 0.1 percent.\n“Despite staging a comeback, major U.S. indexes suffered their worst week since early February,” said James McGlew, executive director for corporate stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut.\n“A number of other fears linger as investors reassess the prospects for continued global growth, brace for the possibility of a broader trade war and await the outcome of a parliamentary election in Italy.”\nChinese shares were buoyant, with the blue-chip CSI 300 up 0.3 percent and Shanghai’s SSE Composite climbing 0.2 percent after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang predicted the country’s economy will expand by around 6.5 percent this year.\nIn commodities, oil prices rose ahead of meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms in Houston, raising expectations that oil producers would discuss further how to clear a global oil glut.\nBrent crude was up 42 cents at $64.79 a barrel while U.S. light crude edged up 40 cents to $61.65.\nSpot gold climbed 0.3 percent to $1,325.76.\nEditing by Kim Coghill and Sam Holmes\n ",
