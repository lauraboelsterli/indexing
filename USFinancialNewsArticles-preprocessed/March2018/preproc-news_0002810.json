Upon closing in December 2017, Tencent and JD.com beneficially owned, taking into account any existing holdings, approximately 7.0% and 5.5%, respectively, of Vipshop’s total issued shares. Concurrently with the share subscription agreement, Tencent and JD.com have entered into business cooperation agreements with Vipshop.\nIn February 2018, JD.com and Tencent announced a joint minority investment in Better Life, a leading multi-format regional retailer in southwest China. Combining Tencent’s massive social media traffic, JD’s e-commerce know-how and logistics capabilities, and Better Life’s offline retail chain, the three parties have established a strategic partnership to pursue “Boundaryless Retail Solutions” and to provide customers with integrated online and offline shopping experiences.\nIn January 2018, JD.com and Meili Inc. agreed to form a joint venture to explore social-commerce opportunities. The new venture will build and operate a social e-commerce platform leveraging resources on JD’s level-1 Weixin entry point, bringing innovative and interactive social-commerce features to shoppers, and helping small businesses reach a broader consumer base at lower cost.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, JD.com continued to expand its fashion offering on the JD platform with Bebe, an American contemporary fashion brand, and Cambridge Satchel, an iconic British handbag brand. TOPLIFE, JD.com’s independent online luxury platform which was launched during the quarter, also expanded its range of high-end brand partnerships through agreements with several well-known international luxury brands, including Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Derek Lam. TOPLIFE’s customized inventory facilities, premium delivery service and abundant product selections combine the best of offline luxury shopping with the convenience and precision of online shopping.\nIn November 2017, JD.com announced an agreement with the Stanford University Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL) to establish the SAIL-JD AI Research Initiative, a cooperative program to fund research areas such as machine learning, deep learning, robotics, natural language processing and computer vision.

Combining advanced technologies such as blockchain-based traceability, AI-enabled automated online product verification and valuation, identity verification and credit rankings alongside JD’s anti-counterfeit controls, JD is well positioned to solve key “pain points” in the second-hand goods market, namely, quality, authenticity and security, providing a trustworthy second-hand goods platform for Chinese consumers.\nIn February 2018, JD.com entered into definitive agreements for the financing of its logistics subsidiary, JD Logistics, with investors including Hillhouse Capital, Sequoia China, China Merchants Group, Tencent, China Life, China Development Bank Capital FOF, China Structural Reform Fund and ICBC International.

The financing is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nIn December 2017, JD opened its first offline fresh food market under the 7FRESH brand. Leveraging JD’s supply chain technology and scale as the country’s largest retailer, the hyper-premium market is stocked with thousands of fresh products, including fruit, flowers, imported meat and quality fresh seafood. Offering food preparation, catering service and free 30-minute delivery to customers within three kilometers, 7FRESH integrates advanced supply chain management know-how and cutting-edge store technologies to deliver a unique shopping experience.\nAs of January 31, 2018, JD.com’s joint venture, New Dada, had partnered with 163 Walmart stores and 388 Yonghui stores, among numerous other supermarkets and grocery stores, to provide a premium online fresh grocery shopping experience with one-hour home delivery service. New Dada is the largest crowdsourcing logistics provider and O2O grocery platform in China.\nDuring the fourth quarter, JD expanded its leadership position in fulfillment capabilities among China’s e-commerce companies.

The company has the largest fulfillment infrastructure of any e-commerce company in China.

JD.com is a member of the NASDAQ100 and a Fortune Global 500 company.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn evaluating the business, the company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP gross profit , non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net margin, free cash flow, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) per weighted average number of shares and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The company defines non-GAAP gross profit as the difference of net revenues and cost of revenue excluding revenue from business cooperation arrangements with equity investees and share-based compensation included in cost of revenues. The company defines non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations as income/(loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, revenue from business cooperation arrangements with equity investees and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The company defines non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, revenue from business cooperation arrangements with equity investees, gain on disposals of business, preferred shares redemption value accretion, income from non-compete agreement, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, net income attributable to mezzanine classified non-controlling interest shareholders, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments. The company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow adding back the impact from JD Finance related credit products included in the operating cash flow and less capital expenditures, which include purchase of property, equipment and software, cash paid for construction in progress, purchase of intangible assets and land use rights. The company defines non-GAAP EBITDA as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations plus depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions.\nThe company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP EBITDA reflect the company’s ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow enables management to assess liquidity and cash flow while taking into account the impact from JD Finance related credit products included in the operating cash flow and the demands that the expansion of fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform has placed on financial resources. The company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. The company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non-recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the company's core operating results and business outlook.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the company’s operations or not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The company encourages you to review the company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nCONTACTS:\nInvestor Relations\nRuiyu Li\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n+86 (10) 8912-6805\nIR@JD.com\nMedia\nJosh Gartner\nVP, International Corporate Affairs\nPress@JD.com\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.
