    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SUPERVALU INC. (NYSE:SVU) today confirmed that Blackwells Capital (“Blackwells”) has provided a notice of its intention to nominate six director candidates to stand for election to the Board of Directors at the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The date of the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting has not yet been announced.\nThe Company notes that Blackwells publicly and privately announced its intent to nominate three director candidates to the SUPERVALU Board last month. However, Blackwells has now proposed to replace six of nine Board members. Such an attempt effectively seeks control of the Company, without paying a premium to all stockholders, and clearly seeks representation that is highly disproportionate to Blackwells’ stake, which is approximately 2% of SUPERVALU shares when excluding out-of-the-money options held by Blackwells.\nThe SUPERVALU Board of Directors issued the following statement:\nSUPERVALU’s Transformation is Well Underway and Showing Results\nOver the last two years, SUPERVALU has been rapidly and strategically transforming its business to be the grocery supplier of choice for retailers throughout the United States. The Board and management team are committed to delivering value for all stockholders, have been and continue to proactively develop and pursue opportunities to create stockholder value, and remain open-minded regarding ideas that enhance stockholder value.\nThe execution of our Wholesale strategy is showing results, as we have added more than $5 billion in run rate sales in the last two years to bring our Wholesale business to nearly $13 billion, or approximately 75% of the Company’s total annual sales. We have appointed new leadership in Wholesale to drive operational improvements and ensure smooth integrations of two key acquisitions. We have also appointed new leadership in Retail to make fundamental changes to this business and better align initiatives with our Wholesale operations.\nFurther, our Board and management team have been strong stewards of the Company’s capital and assets. With the sale of Save-A-Lot for approximately $1.3 billion at the end of 2016, we immediately improved our balance sheet and created the flexibility needed to execute our transformation strategy. We have continued to move forward with our strategy, which was publicly announced prior to Blackwells’ involvement in the Company, and have significantly grown our Wholesale business, are working to monetize select real estate assets through sale leaseback transactions, and continue to pursue the optimization of our Retail portfolio. In fact, earlier this month, we signed definitive agreements to sell 21 of our 38 Farm Fresh Food & Pharmacy stores, demonstrating continued traction in the execution of our strategy.\nSUPERVALU Benefits from a Strong and Experienced Board\nThe Board has made refreshment a priority in recent years, with two of our nine highly qualified directors having joined the Board in the past two years, and six of our nine directors having served on the Board for less than five years. The Board is composed of proven leaders with diverse experience spanning the wholesale, retail, finance, accounting and food industries. With a mix of new and tenured directors overseeing the Company’s ongoing transformation, our directors collectively bring the skills, expertise and knowledge of SUPERVALU and our industry needed to oversee execution of the Company’s operational and strategic plans.\nSUPERVALU Has Attempted to Work Constructively With Blackwells\nThe Board and management team already have SUPERVALU’s transformation strategy well underway, and do not believe the changes to the Board proposed by Blackwells are necessary to ensure the continued execution of the Company’s initiatives to create stockholder value.\nAs previously disclosed, members of our Board and management team have had several discussions and meetings with representatives of Blackwells over the last several months to discuss overlapping objectives and attempt to reach a constructive path forward. Nonetheless, Blackwells has chosen to respond with a public campaign and an attempt to take effective control of the Company.\nHowever, and as previously announced, we are committed to Board refreshment and will consider Blackwells’ candidates as we would any other potential directors to assess their ability to add value to the Board and the Company for the benefit of all stockholders.\nThe Board’s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will present its formal recommendation regarding director nominations in the Company's definitive proxy materials, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in due course. SUPERVALU stockholders are not required to take any action at this time.\nAbout SUPERVALU INC.\n(The following information does not include Associated Grocers of Florida which became part of SUPERVALU on December 8, 2017)\nSUPERVALU INC. is one of the largest grocery wholesalers and retailers in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $16 billion.
