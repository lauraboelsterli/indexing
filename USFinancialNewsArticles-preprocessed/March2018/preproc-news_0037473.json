    "text": "11 Hours Ago | 02:34 \nThe mass production of electric vehicles is the next big investment opportunity in green technology, the chief executive of a private equity fund said on Monday. \n\"Solar technology has been there for a long time. China has gotten wholeheartedly into it, reduced the cost to a ridiculous level right now to break even on many areas, many regions,\" said Bo Bai, CEO of the U.S.-China Green Fund. \n\"Electric vehicles, it's similar. The technology has advanced to a certain stage with mass production and logistics management. The cost is reducing very substantially,\" Bai told CNBC at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong.
