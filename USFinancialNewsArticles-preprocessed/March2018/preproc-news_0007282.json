    "text": "NEW YORK, March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BNP Paribas is pleased to announce it has appointed Francisco Hernandez Lozano as Country Head for Mexico where the bank has a 50+ year presence. Francisco will be responsible for our Corporate and Institutional Banking activities, in addition to representing the BNP Paribas Group in Mexico and contributing to the development of all of its divisions. He reports to Lincoln Payton, Head of Hispanic LatAm.\nFrancisco brings close to 30 years’ experience in financial services in Mexico, predominantly in the Investment and Corporate Banking arena. Francisco joins from Deutsche Bank where he served from 2009-2017 as the Head of Mexico Corporate Client Coverage and previously held positions at Merrill Lynch & Co., Standard Bank and Finamex Casa de Bolsa.\nAs part of its CIB 2020 development plan BNP Paribas is launching a strategic growth plan for the Hispanic Latin America Territory with strong ambitions in Mexico.
