    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - A vegan in France who posted a Facebook message offering “zero sympathy” for a butcher killed by an Islamist militant during an attack last week has been arrested and could face prison for the remarks, police and prosecutors said.\nFILE PHOTO: A general view shows gendarmes and police officers at a supermarket after a hostage situation in Trebes, France, March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo The vegan was due to go before a judge on a charge of condoning terrorism on Thursday, two days after a left-wing activist received a one-year suspended sentence for hailing the death of another victim of the same attack, gendarme Arnaud Beltrame.\nCondoning terrorism carries a maximum jail sentence of five years and a fine of 75,000 euros ($92,000).\nFrance’s butchers federation said it had filed the legal complaint against the author of the Facebook post, which has been removed.\nThe vegan lives in Saint Gaudens, a village not far from the Pyrenees mountains and the town of Trebes, hit by last week’s attack.\nMoroccan-born Radouane Lakdim killed four people during his rampage, including three people in a supermarket in Trebes. Among the victims there were Beltrame and butcher Christian Medves.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday led a national tribute to Beltrame, who swapped places with a woman Lakdim had been holding hostage. A ceremony for the three civilians killed was held on Thursday morning.\nLakdim was shot dead by police.\nReporting By Brian Love and Emmanuel Jarry; Editing by Richard Lough and Andrew Roche\n ",
