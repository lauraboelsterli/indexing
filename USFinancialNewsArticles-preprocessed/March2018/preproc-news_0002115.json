The company did not reply to a request for comment.\nRussian steelmakers with sizeable exports to the United States would be protected from the impact of tariffs by their U.S. assets, analysts said.\nSteel producer Evraz, co-owned by Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, exports 0.4 million tonnes of steel slabs to the United States, but its North American assets sell 2.2 million tonnes on the U.S. market, VTB Capital analysts said. Domestic price rises would more than offset the new costs.\nEvraz shares were up 0.2 percent. The company did not reply to requests for comment.\nSimilarly, though the new tariffs would cost top Russian steel producer NLMK an additional $150 million, this would also be offset by the 2.2 million tonnes of steel it sells in the United States, VTB Capital said.\nNLMK, controlled by billionaire Vladimir Lisin, said in February that it had placed on hold a project to increase its U.S. rolling mill capacity until more information was available about the possible tariffs, after they were recommended by the U.S. Commerce Department.\nDespite warning that hardline U.S. tariffs could cause a“systemic shock” for the global steel market, NLMK said it had no plans to leave the United States.\nA representative of NLMK said on Friday the company was declining to comment until Washington makes an official decision.\nReporting by Polina Ivanova, Polina Devitt, Anastasia Lyrchikova and Diana Asonova Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Dale Hudson Editing by Katya Golubkova\n ",
