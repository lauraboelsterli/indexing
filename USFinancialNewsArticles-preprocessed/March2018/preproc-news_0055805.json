    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 12:27 AM / Updated 5 hours ago Japanese drugmaker Takeda shares tumble as company considers bid for Shire Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical ( 4502.T ) shares sank to their lowest level in almost a year on Thursday after Japan’s largest drugmaker said it was considering a bid for London-listed Shire ( SHP.L ) that could top $40 billion. Takeda Pharmaceutical's signboard is seen on its headquarters building in Tokyo, Japan January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nShares in Takeda fell more than 6 percent at one point in early morning trade, the lowest since last April, sharply underperforming the broader Tokyo market .TOPX , which was around 1 percent. \nTakeda said on Wednesday it was at a “preliminary and exploratory stage” of considering a bid for the rare disease specialist, adding that it had not approached Shire’s board. Shire said it noted Takeda’s statement, and confirmed it had not received an approach. FILE PHOTO: Vitamins made by Shire are displayed at a chemist's in northwest London, Britain, July 11, 2014. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo \nTakeda’s potential bid for Shire, most of whose employees are based in North America, immediately stoked expectations for another takeover battle in the deal-hungry pharma industry. \nShire’s shares ended 15.7 percent higher, valuing the group at about 32 billion pounds ($45 billion). \nShire sells treatments for rare diseases and attention deficit disorder. Takeda said buying it could create a global biopharmaceutical leader, boosting its position in the United States and in the fields of oncology, gastrointestinal diseases and neuroscience. \nThe drugs industry has seen a surge in dealmaking as large players look for promising assets to improve their product pipelines. \nIn recent months, France’s Sanofi ( SASY.PA ) agreed to buy U.S hemophilia specialist Bioverativ BIVV.O for $11.6 billion and Belgium’s Ablynx ( ABLX.BR ) for 3.9 billion euro ($4.8 billion). Before that, U.S.-based Celgene ( CELG.O ) bought cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics JUNO.O. \n($1 = 0.8125 euros)",
