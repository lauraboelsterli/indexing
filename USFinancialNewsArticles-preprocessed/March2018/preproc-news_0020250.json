    "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is likely to impose another cut to Monsanto ( MON.N ) royalties paid by domestic companies for its genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds, industry and government sources said.\nFILE PHOTO: Farmers harvest cotton in a field in Nana Viramgam village in the western Indian state of Gujarat February 9, 2015. REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Photo The latest reduction risks another row with the U.S. company, the world’s biggest seed maker, which threatened to leave India in 2016 when the government cut its royalties by more than 70 percent.\nThis time the government plans to reduce royalties by 20.4 percent to compensate Indian seed makers and also plans to cut prices of GM cotton seeds to help farmers whose fields have been ravaged by pest attacks, the sources said.\nThe government will finalize its decision soon, the sources said without giving precise timescale.\nA Monsanto spokesman said he wasn’t aware of any such government order.\nThe government is expected to lower the prices of GM cotton seeds by 7.5 percent to 740 Indian rupee ($11) for a packet of 450 grams, according to the industry and government sources, who asked not to be identified.\nFarmers buy GM cotton seeds from Indian seedmakers who pay to use Monsanto’s proprietary technology to produce them.\nCotton seed prices have come down drastically in the past few years, but fuel, labor and supply chain costs have risen sharply, squeezing margins of most seed makers, said Kalyan Goswami, director general of the National Seed Association of India producers’ body.\nSeed prices need to go up to sustain the GM cotton business in India, Goswami added.\nMore than 90 percent of India’s cotton crop is genetically modified. Last year the government kept both the royalties and the retail prices of GM cotton seeds unchanged.\nIn 2017/18 India’s cotton output is set to rise by 9.3 percent but still short of the record high predicted by industry analysts because boll worm caused damage in some regions.\nNew Delhi approved the first GM cotton seed trait in 2003 and an upgraded variety in 2006, helping to transform the country into the world’s top producer and second-largest exporter of the fiber.\nReporting by Mayank Bhardwaj; Editing by Susan Fenton and David Goodman\n ",
