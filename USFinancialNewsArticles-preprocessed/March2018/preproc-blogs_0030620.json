    "text": "David B. Gleason | Wikipedia The Pentagon \nCitigroup said a \" malicious actor\" attempted to gain access to several Citi credit card accounts tied to the Department of Defense. \nThe bank responded to CNBC's inquiry regarding an attempted credit card hack this past weekend. \n\"Through the monitoring of our systems, we detected an unsuccessful login attempt by a malicious actor; we locked a select number of cardholder accounts and also asked those cardholders to change their passwords as a precaution,\" Citi spokesman Danielle Romero-Apsilos told CNBC. \n\"There was no impact to Commercial Card services, nor was any customer data compromised,\" Romero-Apsilos said. \nCiti provides financial services for the Government Travel Charge Card, or GTCC, which is used by Department of Defense personnel to pay for authorized expenses when on official travel. \nCitiManager is the online portal used by the Department of Defense to view statements online, make payments, and confirm account balances. \nThe Pentagon's Defense Management Travel Office oversees the processing of the GTCC. \nThe Defense Department did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment.
