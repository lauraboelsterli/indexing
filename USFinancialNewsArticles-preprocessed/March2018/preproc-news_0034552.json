    "text": "Consumers in China will be able to buy mass-produced, 3D-printed electric cars for under $10,000 by Q2 2019.\nThe Italian company X Electrical Vehicle (XEV) will team up with Polymaker, a manufacturer of 3-D printing materials, to make the LSEV, which XEV claims will be the first mass-produced 3D-printed car. The company says it has already received more than 7,000 orders for the cars from the Italian postal service and from ARVAL, a vehicle-leasing service.\nThe cars top out at 70 kilometers per hour (a little under 45 MPH) and have a range of 150 kilometers (just over 90 miles). A designer for XEV told South China Morning Post that China was the biggest market for their cars, and the company is in talks to set up a production line on the mainland.\nLSEV is 3D-printed low-speed electric vehicle that's expected to go on sale next year. VCG VCG via Getty Images The cars reportedly take around three days to manufacture. Everything visible on the car except the windows, chassis, and seats is 3D printed.",
