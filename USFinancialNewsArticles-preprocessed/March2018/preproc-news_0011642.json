    "text": "Two top U.S. intelligence chiefs on Tuesday expressed skepticism of North Korea's offer to hold talks with the U.S. to end the regime's nuclear program and suspend missile testing.\n\"All efforts in the past have failed and have simply bought North Korea time to achieve what they want to achieve,\" Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday. \"Maybe this is a breakthrough. I seriously doubt it.\"\nThe remarks follow South Korea's announcement earlier Tuesday that North Korea would be willing to hold talks with the United States on denuclearization and will suspend nuclear tests while those talks are underway.\nU.S. Army Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, who is the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's proposition was \"kind of a show-me.\"\nIn his opening remarks at the Senate on Tuesday, Ashley said the North Korean leader \"shows no interest in walking away from his nuclear or ballistic missile programs.\" He added that Kim has \"pressed his nation down a path to develop nuclear weapons and deliver them with ballistic missiles that can reach South Korea, Japan, Guam and the United States.\"\nReacting to the news of possible negotiations with North Korea, President Donald Trump tweeted that the world is \"watching and waiting\" for the rogue nation's next move.\nTRUMP TWEET\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the remarks Coats and Ashley made on Tuesday.\nThe United Nations has imposed significant sanctions to pressure North Korea to denuclearize, and yet the regime carried out its sixth nuclear test in September 2017. North Korea remains the only nation in the world to test nuclear weapons this century.\nNorth Korea's rapidly expanding arsenal The acceleration and frequency of testing show not only Kim's nuclear ambitions but also that the nation has developed something of an arsenal.\nIn 2017 alone, North Korea launched 24 missiles and carried out its largest nuclear test.\nNorth Korea has three long-range missiles, two of which can hit the U.S., and will likely continue its nuclear and missile testing , Ashley wrote in a new worldwide threat assessment.\nAshley said he believes that \"additional missile launches — from short range to intercontinental range — are a near certainty\" as are further nuclear tests.\nIn addition, North Korea may have a stockpile of chemical agents , such as \"nerve, blister, blood, and choking agents.\"\nMeanwhile, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, or STRATCOM, Air Force Gen. John Hyten, said last week that \" Korea is the most uncertain threat and the most dangerous, near-term threat.\"\nHe also weighed in on the threat of a potential war with North Korea.\n\"Anyone that wears a uniform does not want war. Goodness knows you don't want a war on that peninsula,\" he said. \"If you've been there you know you don't want to go down that path.\"\nThe U.S. has approximately 28,500 troops in South Korea.",
