    "text": "WUHAN, China, March 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TMSR Holding Company Limited (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:TMSR) today announced that on March 12, 2018, the Company received notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") that, based upon the Company's non-compliance with the minimum 300 and 400 round lot holder requirements for its common stock and warrants, respectively, and the annual stockholders meeting requirement, the Company's securities would be subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel\"). The Company intends to timely request a hearing before the Panel, and that request will stay any delisting action by Nasdaq at least pending the issuance of the Panel's decision following the hearing and the expiration of any extension of time that may be granted to the Company by the Panel.\nAbout TMSR Holding Company Limited\nTMSR Holding Company Limited has two business divisions: Shengrong, which engages in the production and sales of solid waste recycling and comprehensive utilization equipments; and TJComex, which engages in provision of commodity exchange services and ship exchange consulting services.
