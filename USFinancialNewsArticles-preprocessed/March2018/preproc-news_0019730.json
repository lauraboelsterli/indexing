    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Short interest on the Nasdaq fell 0.3 percent in the second half of February, the exchange said on Friday.\nAs of Feb. 28, short interest fell to about 7.944 billion shares, compared with 7.967 billion shares as of Feb. 15.\nInvestors who sell securities ‘short’ borrow shares and then sell them, expecting the stock to fall so they can buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.\nShorting can also be part of a hedging strategy.\n ",
