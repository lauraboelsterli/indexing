(OTCPK: BIOA) (the \"Company\") announced that it has filed a Form 12b-25, Notification of Late Filing, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") regarding a delay in the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the \"Annual Report\") because of the additional time that the Company's independent auditors require to complete their audit of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company intends to file its Annual Report within the fifteen-day extension period provided by Form 12b-25 and continues to work diligently to finalize its financial statements.\nGiven the ongoing audit of the Company's financial statements by the Company's independent auditors and its audit committee, the Company announced that it is postponing its fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings release and conference call, previously scheduled for March 15, 2018 and March 16, 2018, respectively, until such audit is completed and the Company has filed its Annual Report.\nAbout BioAmber\nBioAmber (OTCPK: BIOA) is a renewable materials company.
