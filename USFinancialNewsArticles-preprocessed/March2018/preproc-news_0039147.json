    "text": "March 21, 2018 \nFoodmakers are finding dogs (and cats) to be their best friends. \nWhen General Mills recently announced an $8 billion deal for Blue Buffalo Pet Products, maker of some of the top natural pet food brands in the U.S., it became the latest food giant to turn to four-legged consumers for growth. \nIn 2017, Mars bought pet care provider VCA for $9 billion, after snapping up Procter & Gamble pet food brands like Iams in 2014 for $3 billion. It also followed J.M. Smucker , which bought Big Heart Pet Brands for $5.8 billion in 2015 in its largest deal ever. \nThe reason for all this kibble capital investment? The $30.6 billion U.S. pet food market is expected to grow 2.3% a year over the next five years, according to Euromonitor, easily outpacing the 1% clip for packaged human food. And much of that growth will come from the premium side of the business as humans project their gourmet appetites onto Fido and Felix. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
