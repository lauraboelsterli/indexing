Year-over-year share count reductions of at least 4%, which are seen as affecting EPS, held flat at 70 issues.\n\"Year-end buyback expenditures for Q4 2017 increased 6.0%, while the average corresponding stock price increased 5.5%,\" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices .\n\"Fewer index issues are experiencing a significant EPS tailwind, as share count reductions greater than 4% have yet to match the 20%+ levels from parts of 2015 and 2016.\n\"Buyback concentration slightly declined for the quarter.

JPM: $15.4 billion for full-year 2017, up from $9.1 billion for full-year 2016. C: $14.9 billion for full-year 2017, up from $9.6 billion for full-year 2016.

CHTR: $11.7 billion for full-year 2017, up from $1.6 billion for full-year 2016.\nThe five issues combined for $87.0 billion in share repurchases for full-year 2017 .\nTotal Shareholder Return:\nSilverblatt determined that total shareholder return , through regular cash dividends and buybacks, increased 5.0% to $246.4 billion for Q4 2017, up from $234.6 billion for Q3 2017. For the 12-month period ending December 2017, shareholder return totaled $939.2 billion, up 0.6% from $933.6 billion for the 12-month period ending December 2016.\nS&P 500 dividends posted a 3.8% increase for Q4 2017 to a record $109.5 billion, up from $105.4 billion for Q3 2017.

S&P 500 Industrial (Old), which consists of the S&P 500 less Financials, Transportations, Real Estate and Utilities, available cash and equivalent stood at $1.636 trillion, slightly above the $1.630 trillion level for Q3 2017; available cash stood at $1.478 trillion for Q4 2016.\n\"Repatriation frees up cash for companies to use, but also reduces the overall cash on hand since taxes will need to be paid on them,\" noted Silverblatt.\n\"For 2018, expectations are high for greater corporate expenditures, as lower income tax rates and repatriation should add to available funds and investors pressure companies to use it.\n\"Dividends, which are on track to set a seventh consecutive record annual payment for 2018, may return to double-digit gains last seen in 2015; 2016 posted a 5.4% gain and 2017 had a 7.0% gain.\n\"S&P 500 issues have increased the size of their dividends hikes this year an average of 14.04%, versus 11.36% for 2017 and 10.51% for 2016. No issues have lowered their rate and there are 128 increases so far for 2018.\n\"Combined, buybacks and dividends could put the S&P 500 over $1 trillion for total shareholder return this year.\"\nFor more information about S&P Dow Jones Indices, please visit www.spdji.com .\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nS&P 500, $ U.S. BILLIONS\n(preliminary in bold)\nPERIOD\nMARKET\nOPERATING\nAS REPORTED\nDIVIDEND &\nDIVIDENDS\nVALUE\nEARNINGS\nEARNINGS\nDIVIDENDS\nBUYBACKS\nDIVIDEND\nBUYBACK\nBUYBACK\n& BUYBACKS\n$ BILLIONS\n$ BILLIONS\n$ BILLIONS\n$ BILLIONS\n$ BILLIONS\nYIELD\nYIELD\nYIELD\n$ BILLION\n2017 Prelim.\n$22,821.24\n$1,072.06\n$940.95\n$419.77\n$519.40\n1.84%\n2.28%\n4.12%\n$939.17\n2016\n$19,267.93\n$919.85\n$818.55\n$397.21\n$536.38\n2.06%\n2.78%\n4.85%\n$933.60\n2015\n$17,899.56\n$885.38\n$762.74\n$382.32\n$572.16\n2.14%\n3.20%\n5.33%\n$954.47\n12/29/2017 Prelim.\n$22,821\n$294.65\n$230.12\n$109.46\n$136.97\n1.84%\n2.28%\n4.12%\n$246.43\n9/29/2017\n$21,579\n$268.69\n$243.77\n$105.45\n$129.17\n1.92%\n2.40%\n4.32%\n$234.61\n6/30/2017\n$20,762\n$261.39\n$231.40\n$104.01\n$120.11\n1.96%\n2.41%\n4.37%\n$224.12\n3/31/2017\n$20,276\n$247.32\n$235.65\n$100.86\n$133.15\n1.98%\n2.51%\n4.49%\n$234.01\n12/31/2016\n$19,268\n$240.11\n$207.93\n$103.82\n$135.29\n2.06%\n2.78%\n4.85%\n$239.11\n9/30/2016\n$18,742\n$247.98\n$219.46\n$98.43\n$112.20\n2.10%\n2.92%\n5.01%\n$210.63\n6/30/2016\n$18,193\n$222.77\n$201.79\n$98.30\n$127.50\n2.14%\n3.22%\n5.36%\n$225.81\n3/31/2016\n$17,958\n$208.99\n$189.37\n$96.67\n$161.39\n2.15%\n3.28%\n5.43%\n$258.05\n12/31/2015\n$17,900\n$201.95\n$163.76\n$99.39\n$145.88\n2.14%\n3.20%\n5.33%\n$245.27\n9/30/2015\n$16,917\n$224.14\n$204.58\n$95.07\n$150.58\n2.22%\n3.30%\n5.52%\n$245.66\n6/30/2015\n$18,219\n$230.84\n$201.35\n$94.45\n$131.56\n2.03%\n3.04%\n5.07%\n$226.01\n3/31/2015\n$18,303\n$228.45\n$193.05\n$93.41\n$144.13\n1.98%\n2.94%\n4.92%\n$237.54\n12/30/2014\n$18,245\n$237.14\n$202.31\n$92.80\n$132.63\n1.92%\n3.03%\n4.95%\n$225.43\n9/30/2014\n$17,519\n$262.92\n$244.00\n$89.02\n$145.19\n1.96%\n3.14%\n5.10%\n$234.22\n6/30/2014\n$17,404\n$260.50\n$240.96\n$86.65\n$116.17\n1.91%\n3.06%\n4.98%\n$202.82\n3/31/2014\n$16,700\n$243.67\n$221.82\n$81.96\n$159.28\n1.93%\n3.20%\n5.14%\n$241.24\n12/31/2013\n$16,495\n$252.10\n$236.31\n$84.98\n$129.41\n1.89%\n2.88%\n4.77%\n$214.40\n9/30/2013\n$14,960\n$239.50\n$219.13\n$79.26\n$128.16\n2.05%\n2.98%\n5.03%\n$207.42\n6/30/2013\n$14,310\n$234.84\n$221.56\n$76.67\n$118.05\n2.07%\n2.94%\n5.02%\n$194.72\n3/31/2013\n$13,979\n$229.57\n$215.76\n$70.86\n$99.97\n2.06%\n2.97%\n5.02%\n$170.82\n12/31/2012\n$12,742\n$206.84\n$184.50\n$79.83\n$99.15\n2.20%\n3.13%\n5.33%\n$178.98\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nS&P 500 SECTOR BUYBACKS\nSECTOR $ MILLIONS\nQ4,'17\nQ3,'17\nQ4,'16\n12MO DEC','17\n12MO DEC,'16\n5-YEARS\nConsumer Discretionary\n$20,775\n$24,242\n$20,604\n$83,570\n$89,528\n$417,110\nConsumer Staples\n$10,490\n$15,578\n$11,615\n$50,832\n$43,440\n$224,331\nEnergy\n$5,203\n$2,320\n$979\n$12,736\n$5,762\n$115,627\nFinancials\n$33,903\n$34,252\n$26,772\n$124,467\n$104,357\n$457,332\nHealthcare\n$15,814\n$9,523\n$28,898\n$64,982\n$87,588\n$344,917\nIndustrials\n$11,561\n$13,087\n$14,773\n$53,560\n$76,166\n$330,292\nInformation Technology\n$35,817\n$27,926\n$28,731\n$118,848\n$119,457\n$664,785\nMaterials\n$2,067\n$1,412\n$2,497\n$5,857\n$8,397\n$68,258\nReal Estate\n$1,314\n$806\n$303\n$3,844\n$759\n$4,603\nTelecommunication Services\n$9\n$3\n$69\n$485\n$529\n$24,369\nUtilities\n$17\n$22\n$51\n$216\n$399\n$5,176\nTOTAL\n$136,969\n$129,170\n$135,292\n$519,397\n$536,382\n$2,656,800\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nS&P 500 20 LARGEST Q4 2017 BUYBACKS, $ MILLIONS\nCompany\nTicker\nSector\nQ4,'17\n12MO Dec,'17\n12MO Dec,'16\n5-Year\n10-year\nIndicated\nBuybacks\nBuybacks\nBuybacks\nBuybacks\nBuybacks\nDividend\n$ Million\n$ Million\n$ Million\n$ Million\n$ Million\n$ Million\nApple\nAAPL\nInformation Technology\n$10,095\n$32,144\n$33,710\n$173,880\n$175,830\n$12,938\nCitigroup\nC\nFinancials\n$5,473\n$14,946\n$9,606\n$33,461\n$35,233\n$3,384\nBank of America\nBAC\nFinancials\n$4,869\n$12,814\n$5,112\n$25,195\n$25,213\n$5,007\nJPMorgan\nJPM\nFinancials\n$4,808\n$15,410\n$9,082\n$39,657\n$53,172\n$7,772\nCharter Communications\nCHTR\nConsumer Discretionary\n$3,967\n$11,715\n$1,562\n$13,349\n$14,099\n$0\nCisco Systems\nCSCO\nInformation Technology\n$3,862\n$7,771\n$4,133\n$31,575\n$58,884\n$6,526\nCelgene\nCELG\nHealthcare\n$2,908\n$3,833\n$2,160\n$15,000\n$19,625\n$0\nWells Fargo\nWFC\nFinancials\n$2,862\n$10,301\n$8,610\n$42,378\n$50,646\n$7,682\nWalgreens Boots Alliance\nWBA\nConsumer Staples\n$2,525\n$7,288\n$1,080\n$11,393\n$16,913\n$1,615\nAlphabet Inc.
