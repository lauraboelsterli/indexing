    "text": "PARIS, March 24 (Reuters) - Police arrested a second person overnight believed to be linked to an attack in southwestern France on Friday that led to the death of four people, a judicial source said on Saturday.\nAnother source said the man, a minor born in 2000, was a friend of the gunman, Redouane Lakdim, 25.\nPolice arrested a woman connected to the attacker on Friday, a French prosecutor said.\nLakdim, who was initially believed to have acted alone, held up a car, fired on police and seized hostages in a supermarket on Friday, in what President Emmanuel Macron called an act of “Islamist terrorism”.\nA gendarme who voluntarily took the place of a hostage during the siege has died, France said earlier on Saturday.
