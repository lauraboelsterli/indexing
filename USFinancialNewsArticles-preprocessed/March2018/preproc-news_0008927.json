    "text": "NEW YORK, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorney Advertising -- Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Ulta Beauty, Inc. (\"Ulta\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ULTA) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased Ulta securities during the period between March 30, 2016, and February 23, 2018, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/ulta .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company was engaged in the widespread practice of repackaging returned cosmetics and re-shelving them alongside unblemished products to sell at full retail price; and (2) that as a result of the foregoing, Ulta's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn February 9, 2018, post-market, media outlets reported that a consumer class action lawsuit had been filed against Ulta, alleging that the Company engaged in the \"widespread and surreptitious\" practice of repacking returned cosmetics and re-shelving them alongside unblemished products to sell at full price. On this news, Ulta's share price fell $9.07, or 4.15%, to close at $209.48 on February 12, 2018, the following trading day. On February 16, 2018, the law firm representing the plaintiff in the foregoing lawsuit issued a press release further publicizing the pendency of the lawsuit. On this news, Ulta's share price fell $2.87, or 1.41%, over the following two trading days, closing at $201.13 on February 20, 2018. Then, on February 23, 2018, CBS News published a story on its website entitled \"Former Ulta Beauty employee says she felt pressured to resell used products,\" reporting on statements, initially made on Twitter by at least one former Ulta employee, to the effect that Ulta store managers frequently pressured the Company's employees to clean and resell used products. Following publication of the CBS News article, Ulta's share price dropped $8.18 per share or 3.94%, to close at $198.93 on February 26, 2018.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
