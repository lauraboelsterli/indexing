(“APX Group”, “Vivint” or the “Company”) today reported financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“At the beginning of 2017, we established an operational plan to implement a number of significant initiatives across the Vivint platform,” said Todd Pedersen, Chief Executive Office of APX Group. “Flex Pay and our partnership with Citizens Bank would require a shift in our customer value proposition and a reengineering of our sales and marketing processes, but would fundamentally improve the cash flow dynamics of our business. In terms of sales channel expansion, we determined to establish a market presence in an assisted sale retail format, by agreeing to a national roll-out of a co-branded offering with Best Buy (NYSE: BBY). Finally, we set out to invest in key infrastructure related to product quality, customer experience and enterprise efficiency. While we realized these initiatives would be challenging, the longer-term benefits will strengthen our balance sheet, better retain our customers and provide a more competitive business model. At the end of the year, I would say that we’ve effectively achieved these objectives and gained valuable learnings that will be incorporated in our go-forward strategies and plans.”\nRevenue and Subscriber Data\nAPX Group reported total revenues of $235.8 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $31.3 million, or 15.3%, as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by $23.3 million in recurring and other revenues from an increase in Total Subscribers of 12.7% and the recognition of deferred product revenue and retail installment contract (“RIC”) imputed interest of $13.5 million. The increase in total revenues was partially offset by $8.0 million from a decrease in the Average Monthly Service Revenue per User of $1.86 attributable to the Company’s transition to Vivint Flex Pay.\nThe Company added 52,342 New Subscribers during the fourth quarter of 2017, a 31.5% increase compared to 39,805 New Subscribers during the same period in 2016. The large format retail sales channel contributed 11,627 New Subscribers during the quarter.\nAPX Group reported total revenues of $882.0 million for the full year period ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 16.4% or $124.1 million, as compared to 2016. The primary drivers of the increase were $87.0 million in recurring and other revenue driven by an increase in Total Subscribers and $28.7 million of deferred product revenue and RIC imputed interest associated with the Company’s transition to Vivint Flex Pay in early 2017.\nIn 2017, the Company originated 279,735 New Subscribers, with approximately 48% of the New Subscribers coming from the inside sales channel and the Company’s expansion into the large format retail sales channel and 52% from the direct-to-home channel.\nSummary of Quarterly Key Financial and Portfolio Metrics\n($ in millions, except for subscriber data)\nDecember 31,\n2016\nMarch 31,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\nTotal Revenues $ 204.5 $ 205.4 $ 212.1 $ 228.7 $ 235.8 Net Loss $ (71.2 ) $ (82.6 ) $ (84.2 ) $ (107.9 ) $ (135.4 ) Adjusted EBITDA (a) $ 118.3 $ 115.4 $ 120.5 $ 128.6 $ 125.9 Adj EBITDA Margin 57.8 % 56.2 % 56.8 % 56.2 % 53.4 % New Subscribers (1) 39,805 39,292 92,837 89,019 52,342 Total Subscribers (2) 1,146,746 1,151,453 1,215,056 1,270,478 1,292,698 Total Monthly Service Revenue (2) $ 65.6 $ 66.0 $ 68.5 $ 71.2 $ 71.0 Average Monthly Service Revenue per User (2) $ 57.23 $ 57.31 $ 56.40 $ 56.07 $ 54.92 Total Monthly Revenue (2) $ 65.6 $ 66.3 $ 70.9 $ 75.1 $ 75.4 Average Monthly Revenue per User (2) $ 57.23 $ 57.57 $ 58.31 $ 59.12 $ 58.29 Attrition Rate (3) 12.6 % 12.0 % 11.5 % 11.3 % 11.0 %\n(1) 6,245 New Subscribers from sales pilots are not included (2) Data excludes wireless internet business and pilot programs and are provided as of each period end (3) Attrition Rate is reported on an LTM basis for each period end and excludes wireless internet business and pilot programs “Looking back at 2017, I would call out several observations and assessments,” said Mark Davies, Chief Financial Officer of APX Group. “Arguably, and most importantly, our Vivint Flex Pay program generated $211 million of cash flow at point of sale, reducing our Net Subscriber Acquisition Costs from $1,996 in 2016 to $1,545 in 2017. We implemented the consumer financing component of the Flex Pay program with Citizens Bank early in the second quarter, so we would expect cash flows from Vivint Flex Pay to improve in 2018, from a full-year impact of the program. The implementation of Vivint Flex Pay had a negative impact on sales velocity, as our sales channels digested the change in the customer offerings, worked through process changes and developed updated training programs. Our inside sales channel was relatively efficient in this transition, growing New Subscribers 15% year over year, while our direct-to-home channel added 30,000 fewer New Subscribers during the year. Over time, we believe sales productivity will return to pre-Flex Pay levels. Despite these transitionary challenges, we grew 2017 revenue by 16.4%.”\nDavies continued, “Similar to prior investment cycles, we chose to increase our information technology and engineering resources in 2017. More specifically, in our Innovation organization, we invested in hardware, software and connectivity quality-related programs, which we believe will yield a better customer experience and eventually lower attrition and service costs. Our information technology investments centered on our proprietary Genie platform, which integrates sales, field service and customer support; Vivint Flex Pay functionality; channel expansion; and several other infrastructure programs, including an SAP ERP platform. From a service cost perspective, we saw a year-over-year increase of $0.97 per month in Net Service Costs per Subscriber, while still maintaining robust, healthy service margins of 72.1%. There are two primary elements to the increase in Net Service Costs per Subscriber; First, as we increase the number of smart devices in a customer’s home, we see an increase in the cost to service; Second, we chose to optimize customer experience by investing in field service responsiveness and tech support coverage. Best Buy was another investment during the year. Start up and productivity costs related to sales and installation were the primary driver for higher than normal subscriber acquisition and support costs. We expect to improved productivity and reduce costs in this channel over the next year.”\nCosts and Expenses\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $22.6 million to $91.7 million as compared to $69.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company’s expansion of new sales channels, primarily the large format retail sales channel, accounted for $10.7 million of the $22.6 million year-over-year increase. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter, excluding the $10.7 million, increased $11.9 million, or 17.2%. The primary drivers for the $11.9 million increase were $8.2 million of personnel and related support costs and $3.0 million in equipment and shipping costs to support the 145, 952 increase in Total Subscribers.\nFull year 2017 operating expenses increased 21.4% from $264.9 million in 2016 to $321.5 million in 2017, including $16.2 million of operating expenses directly associated with the Company’s efforts to expand its sales channels. Excluding the $16.2 million, operating expenses increased by 15.3% or $40.4 million, in line with full year revenue growth of 16.4%. The $40.4 million increase in operating expenses is primarily attributed to $28.0 million in personnel and related costs for field service and customer care, $8.7 million in equipment and shipping costs, $3.4 million for information technology related services and a $1.6 million increase in payment processing and bank fees associated with the increase in Total Subscribers and the Company’s introduction of Vivint Flex Pay, which requires a customer to use a credit or debit card as their payment method. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by $1.6 million in savings from facilities and other support costs.\nNet service cost per user was $15.69, which contributed to a net service margin of 72.1% for the full year 2017, as compared to $14.72 in 2016. The increase in net service cost per user is due to investments in service levels and overall customer experience, along with an increase in the number of smart home devices per customer.\nFourth quarter of 2017 selling expenses, net of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, were $63.5 million, compared to $32.6 million for the same period in 2016. The 94.8% year-over-year increase in selling expenses is primarily attributable to $25.2 million to support the Company’s sales channel expansion, mostly related to the large format retail sales channel. Selling expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the direct-to-home and inside sales channels increased by $5.7 million. The primary drivers of the $5.7 million increase relate to an increase of $3.1 million in facilities and IT costs and $1.8 million in personnel and related costs.\nSelling expenses for the full year 2017, net of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, were $198.3 million versus $131.4 in 2016. Selling expenses associated with the Company’s sales channel expansion, primarily the large format retail sales channel, accounted for $47.2 million of the year-over-year increase. The selling expenses in the direct to home and inside sales channels increased by $19.7 million, including a $6.2 million increase in personnel and related costs, a $5.7 million increase in housing and facilities costs, and $3.8 million increase in IT related cost, partially offset by a savings of $1.0 for employee licensing.\nThe Company’s Net Subscriber Acquisition Costs per New Subscriber was $1,594 in 2017 as compared to $1,996 for the same period in 2016. The Company’s introduction of Vivint Flex Pay in early 2017 increased the average proceeds collected at point of sale by approximately $732 per new subscriber.\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses, net of allocations, for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $61.2 million as compared to $40.6 million for the same period in 2016. The year-over-year increase of $20.6 million was primarily due to a litigation settlement of $10.0 million, $5.7 million in personnel and related costs, along with $3.1 million to support expansion of the Company’s large format retail sales channel.\nFull year 2017 G&A expenses, net of allocations, increased 30.739% to $188.4 million as compared to $144.2 million in 2016. The $10.0 million litigation settlement in the fourth quarter contributed 7.1% of the year-over-year increase. The remaining $35.2 million increase was primarily due to $15.8 million in personnel and related costs and $10.9 million in costs to support the Company’s expansion of the large format retail sales channel. Other costs associated with the year over year increase include $3.7 million for financial and legal services.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Net Loss\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $125.9 million and net loss was $135.4 million, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $118.3 million and net loss was $71.2 million for the same period in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year ended December 31, 2017, was $490.3 million and net loss was $410.2 million, as compared to $444.1 million and net loss of $276.0 million for the same period in 2016.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s liquidity position on a consolidated basis, defined as cash on hand, short-term marketable securities and available borrowing capacity under the Company’s revolving credit facility, was approximately $238 million.\nCertain Credit Statistics\nThe Company’s net leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA, was 5.8x at December 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nVivint Smart Home will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the quarterly results at 5:00 p.m. ET today, March 6, 2018.

This metric excludes subscribers originated under pilot programs.\nTotal Monthly Service Revenue (MSR) – the aggregate, contracted recurring monthly Service billings to our smart home and security subscribers, based on the number of Total Subscribers as of the end of a given period. This metric reflects billings on our Services and excludes monthly billings for the purchases of our Products.\nAverage Monthly Service Revenue per User (AMSRU) – MSR divided by the number of Total Subscribers as of the end of a given period.\nTotal Monthly Revenue (Total MR) – the aggregate, contracted recurring monthly service billings to our smart home and security subscribers, based on the Total Subscribers number as of the end of a given period, plus deferred product and interest revenue recognized during the last month of the period.\nAverage Monthly Revenue per User (AMRU) – Total MR divided by Total Subscribers at the end of a given period.\nAttrition Rate – the aggregate number of canceled smart home and security subscribers during the prior 12 month period divided by the monthly weighted average number of Total Subscribers, based on the Total Subscribers at the beginning and end of each month of a given period. Subscribers are considered canceled when they terminate in accordance with the terms of their contract, are terminated by us or if payment from such subscribers is deemed uncollectible (when at least four monthly billings become past due). If a sale of a service contract to third parties occurs, or a subscriber relocates but continues their service, we do not consider this as a cancellation. If a subscriber transfers their service contract to a new subscriber, we do not consider this as a cancellation.\nNet Service Cost per User – average monthly service costs for the period, including monitoring, customer service, field service and other service support costs, less total non-recurring product and service billings for the period divided by average monthly Total Subscribers for the same period.\nNet Service Margin – is the sum of the months-end MSR for the period, less total net service costs for the period divided by the sum of the months-end MSR for the period.\nNew Subscribers – the aggregate number of net new smart home and security subscribers originated during a given period. This metric excludes new subscribers acquired by the transfer of a service contract from one subscriber to another and subscribers originated under pilot programs.\nNet Subscriber Acquisition Costs per New Subscriber – the direct and indirect costs to create a new smart home and security subscriber divided by New Subscribers for a given 12 month period. These costs include commissions, equipment, installation, marketing, sales support and other allocations (general and administrative and overhead); less cash received from product sales associated with the initial installation, activation fees, installation fees and upsell revenue.\nAPX GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Years ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues: Recurring and other revenue $ 224,668 $ 195,528 $ 843,420 $ 724,478 Service and other sales revenue 8,475 6,013 26,988 22,855 Activation fees 2,703 2,971 11,575 10,574 Total revenues 235,846 204,512 881,983 757,907 Costs and expenses: Operating expenses 91,700 69,059 321,476 264,865 Selling expenses 63,454 32,565 198,348 131,421 General and administrative expenses 61,218 41,334 188,397 143,168 Depreciation and amortization 87,830 79,124 329,255 288,542 Restructuring and asset impairment recoveries - (752 ) - 1,013 Total costs and expenses 304,202 221,330 1,037,476 829,009 Loss from operations (68,356 ) (16,818 ) (155,493 ) (71,102 ) Other expenses (income): Interest expense 59,128 53,138 225,772 197,965 Interest income (26 ) (279 ) (130 ) (432 ) Other loss, net 9,178 1,951 27,986 7,255 Total other expenses 68,280 54,810 253,628 204,788 Loss before income taxes (136,636 ) (71,628 ) (409,121 ) (275,890 ) Income tax (benefit) expense (1,230 ) (460 ) 1,078 67 Net loss $ (135,406 ) $ (71,168 ) $ (410,199 ) $ (275,957 ) APX GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nDecember 31, December 31, 2017 2016 ASSETS Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,872\n$ 43,520 Accounts and notes receivable, net 40,721 12,891 Inventories 115,222 38,452 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 16,150 10,158 Total current assets 175,965 105,021 Property, plant and equipment, net 78,081\n63,626 Subscriber acquisition costs, net 1,308,558\n1,052,434 Deferred financing costs, net 3,099\n4,420 Intangible assets, net 377,451\n475,392 Goodwill 836,970\n835,233 Long-term investments and other assets, net 88,723\n11,536 Total assets $ 2,868,847 $ 2,547,662 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT Current Liabilities: Accounts payable $ 107,347\n$ 49,119 Accrued payroll and commissions 57,752\n46,288 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 74,321\n34,265 Deferred revenue 88,337\n45,722 Current portion of capital lease obligations 10,614\n9,797 Total current liabilities 338,371 185,191 Notes payable, net 2,760,297 2,486,700 Revolving Credit Facility 60,000 - Capital lease obligations, net of current portion 11,089 7,935 Deferred revenue, net of current portion 264,555 58,734 Other long-term obligations 79,020 47,080 Deferred income tax liabilities 9,041 7,204 Total liabilities 3,522,373 2,792,844 Total stockholders’ deficit (653,526 )\n(245,182 ) Total liabilities and stockholders’ deficit $ 2,868,847 $ 2,547,662 APX GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES\nSummary Cash Flow Data\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net cash used in operating activities $ (160,064 ) $ (140,917 ) $ (309,332 ) $ (365,706 ) Net cash used in investing activities (5,881 ) (5,274 ) (21,661 ) (15,147 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 54,190 (2,744 ) 291,213 422,280 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 60 16 132 (466 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (111,695 ) $ (148,919 ) (39,648 ) 40,961 Cash and cash equivalents: Beginning of period 115,567 192,439 43,520 2,559 End of period $ 3,872 $ 43,520 $ 3,872 $ 43,520 Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis earnings release includes Adjusted EBITDA, which is a supplemental measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense (net of interest income), income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization (including amortization of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs), further adjusted to exclude the effects of certain contract sales to third parties, non-capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, stock based compensation, the historical results of Solar and certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring and other items permitted in certain covenant calculations under the indentures and other agreements governing our notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain covenants in the indentures and other agreements governing our notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.\nSee the following table for a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss, which we believe is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAPX GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (unaudited) (In millions) Three Months Ended December 31, March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2016 2017 2017 2017 2017 Net loss $ (71.2 ) $ (82.6 ) $ (84.2 ) $ (107.9 ) $ (135.4 ) Interest expense, net 52.9 53.6 54.9 58.0 59.1 Other expense (income), net 2.0 12.0 (1.9\n)\n8.6 9.2 Income tax (benefit) expense, net (0.5\n)\n0.4 0.7 1.2 (1.2\n) Restructuring and asset impairment (i) (0.8\n)\n- - - - Depreciation and amortization (ii) 33.5 30.0 30.6 30.9 31.6 Amortization of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs 45.6 46.9 49.5 53.6 56.2 Non-capitalized subscriber acquisition costs (iii) 43.3 43.3 59.8 69.5 82.9 Non-cash compensation (iv) 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 Other Adjustments (v) 13.0 11.4 10.7 14.4 23.2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 118.3 $ 115.4 $ 120.5 $ 128.6 $ 125.9 Years Ended December 31, 2016 2017 Net loss $ (276.0 ) $ (410.2 ) Interest expense, net 197.5 225.6 Other (income) expense, net 7.3 28.0 Income tax expense 0.1 1.1 Restructuring and asset impairment (i) 1.0 - Depreciation and amortization (ii) 133.7 123.1 Amortization of capitalized creation costs 154.9 206.2 Non-capitalized subscriber acquisition costs (iii) 175.9 255.4 Non-cash compensation (iv) 4.0 1.4 Other Adjustments (v) 45.7 59.7 Adjusted EBITDA $ 444.1 $ 490.3\ni.
