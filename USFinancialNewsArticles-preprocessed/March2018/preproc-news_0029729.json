(TSX:EFN) (“Element” or the “Company”), a leading global provider of fleet management and fleet-focused business services, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Effective with the second quarter of 2017, Element adopted new segmentation of core fleet management and non-core assets. For more information, see the Company’s Management Discussion & Analysis (“MD&A”) for the three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2017. The table below sets out summary financial metrics for core fleet management and non-core assets.\nSummary Consolidated Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nIn millions, except per share amounts and where otherwise noted Core Fleet\nNon-Core\nTotal\nNet earning assets $12,229 $974 $13,203 Net revenue $221.3 $8.5 $229.8 Adjusted operating expenses $125.9 $1.3 $127.2 Share of loss from and provision in 19 th Capital - $60.8 $60.8 After-tax adjusted operating income $79.4 $2.7 $82.1 After-tax adjusted operating income\n(to common shareholders) $68.3 $2.7 $71.0 Adjusted basic EPS $0.18 $0.01 $0.19 Note: See the Company’s Management Discussion & Analysis (“MD&A”) for the three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2017 for more information.\n“Since completing our strategic review and providing the corporate update earlier this quarter, we have moved quickly to take the necessary steps to reign in operating expenses while optimizing the customer experience and positioning the company for a return to earnings growth in 2019,” said Dan Jauernig, Acting Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to expect core fleet adjusted operating income for 2018 to be within 3% to 5% of 2017 results on a currency adjusted basis. We expect financial results to build throughout the year, while continuing to generate strong cash flows, access capital markets, and execute on a solid pipeline of new business.”\nRecent Highlights\nCore fleet originations in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.46 billion compared to $1.44 billion in Q3 2017 and $1.43 billion in Q4 2016. Recent select customer wins include high quality commercial fleets in the car rental, healthcare services and construction industries. During the quarter, Element continued to make significant advances providing fleet management services to the ride sharing and car sharing sectors, launching its programs with General Motors’ car sharing platform, Maven, and with Splend, an Australian based company that provides vehicles for on-demand rideshare and delivery services. Element continues to maintain a strong financial position with approximately $4.7 billion of liquidity to finance future business. During the fourth quarter, Element completed the issuance of US$1 billion of rated term notes through its Chesapeake Funding II platform, bringing its total 2017 issuances to US$3.2 billion, the most in a year from any fleet asset-backed security (ABS) issuer. Element also extended the maturity of its senior credit facility by one year to November 2020.\nOperational Update\nOn February 5, 2018, the Company announced that it would seek to create long-term value by executing on its business plan focused on customers, efficiency and operational excellence. Recently enacted initiatives include the rationalization of office space, the curtailing of discretionary expenses and targeted headcount reductions. Element expects to incur a restructuring charge of approximately $40 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily related to employee severance, office closures and combinations, professional fees and other costs. The anticipated annualized run-rate savings from these initiatives are expected to be approximately $20 million, to be fully realized beginning in fiscal 2019. One-time strategic review costs of $11.9 million were recognized in the fourth quarter.\n\"As we indicated several weeks ago, we have begun the process of further optimizing our operations and rightsizing our expense structure,” said Mr. Jauernig. “While some of these decisions have been difficult, they are necessary and have support across the organization. We are grateful to our team members across the company for their ongoing efforts to streamline our processes while continuing to improve the customer experience.”\nCore Fleet Management Operations\nThe following summarizes results from the Company’s core Fleet Management operations:\nFor the three-month periods\nended For the 12-month periods\nended Results from continuing operations December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (in $000’s for stated values, except per share amounts) $ $ $ $ $ Net revenue Service and other revenue 140,970 134,902 122,983 547,707 535,388 Net interest and rental revenue 80,342 84,164 74,779 329,126 338,273 Net revenue 221,312 219,066 197,762 876,833 873,661 Adjusted operating expenses Salaries, wages and benefits 83,078 79,980 71,425 315,489 292,640 General and administrative expenses 38,234 34,558 37,679 148,236 160,510 Depreciation and Amortization 4,575 3,854 1,779 15,976 11,077 Adjusted operating expenses 125,887 118,392 110,883 479,701 464,227 Adjusted operating income 95,425 100,674 86,879 397,132 409,434 Provision for taxes 16,068 21,141 18,244 79,426 85,891 After-tax adjusted operating income 79,357 79,533 68,635 317,706 323,453 Cumulative preferred share dividends 11,068 11,068 8,912 41,301 35,648 After-tax adjusted operating income attributable to common shareholders 68,289 68,465 59,723 276,405 287,805 After-tax adjusted operating income per share [basic] 0.18 0.18 0.15 0.72 0.74 Services and other revenue was $141 million for Q4 2017, an increase of 5% sequentially and 15% compared to the same period in the prior year, respectively. The increases reflects higher remarketing fees, the introduction of accident services in Mexico, higher maintenance fees in Canada, and increased telematics revenues. Net interest and rental revenue of $80.3 million in Q4 2017 was 7.4% higher than the same period last year, and 4% lower than Q3 2017. Net interest and rental revenue margin (NIM) was 2.61% in Q4 2017 as compared with 2.32% in Q4 2016 and 2.77% in Q3 2017.\nNon-core Assets\nAt December 31, 2017, non-core operations represented approximately 6% of Element’s total assets and included the assets listed below.\nIn millions Category Description Sept. 30,\n2017 Dec. 31,\n2017 19 th Capital Group LLC Senior term loans (A&B) and revolver equipment loan $777.2 $775.7 19 th Capital Group LLC Equity ownership (49.99%) $69.0 $10.0 ECAF I Holding Ltd 32.5% interest in ECAF Holdings Ltd., an indirect owner of ECAF I Ltd., an issuer of rated pooled-aircraft ABS $122.3 $122.3 New Zealand Equipment Finance Portfolio Portfolio of various vehicles and equipment $29.7 $17.4 Heavy Duty Truck Portfolio Portfolio of Class 8 tractors and trailers in the U.S. $65.8 $58.8 Total $1,064.0 $984.2\nNon-Core operations contributed $9 million of net revenue and $0.01 in after-tax adjusted operating income per share in Q4 2017.\nElement expects to continue to execute on its strategy of maximizing the value of its remaining non-core assets to enhance its capital structure and return capital to shareholders.\n19 th Capital LLC Joint Venture Update\n19 th Capital continues to implement its strategic plan to improve its operations in the joint venture. This plan includes moving vehicles to corporate fleets, expediting the sale or trade-in of certain units, and optimizing the composition of the fleet to improve overall efficiency. The Company expects these actions to right-size the operating fleet, increase utilization rates, and improve cash flows over time through the operation of newer and more efficient vehicles. The Company’s share of operating losses in the joint venture was $14.1 million for Q4 2017, which reflects a one-time adjustment for accelerating depreciation of $4.0 million. In addition to operating losses, the Company’s share of losses on the disposition of certain assets in the joint venture was $17.8 million, net of the remaining reserve established in Q2. Also in Q4 2017, the Company established a provision for impairment of $29.0 million against its investment in the joint venture.\nDividends declared\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has authorized and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per outstanding common share of Element for the fourth quarter of 2017.

These dividends are designated to be eligible dividends for purposes of section 89(1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada).\nOn March 6, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared the upcoming dividends on Element’s preferred shares, payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 16, 2018.\nConference call\nA conference call to discuss these results will be held on Thursday, March 15, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
