Total mortgage application volume was essentially flat last week, up just 0.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the MBA. Volume was 5% lower than the same week one year ago. Mortgage applications to purchase a home also did not increase as much as one might expect, given that President's Day weekend was the unofficial start of the usually busy spring market. Volume fell 1% for the week and was just 1% higher than the same week one year ago. \"The average loan amount on purchase applications, at $320,100, was the highest since November 2017, as supply constraints likely continued to weigh down lower dollar purchase transactions,\" MBA economist Joel Kan said. More: Parents foot some bills for 1-in-4 Millennials working full-time: Report The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($453,100 or less) increased slightly, but hit its highest level since January 2014 — 4.65%, from 4.64%. Points decreased to 0.58 from 0.63 — including the origination fee — for 80% loan-to-value ratio loans. \"Rates inched higher overall last week driven by market concerns over potential U.S. trade tariffs, and Fed Chairman [Jerome] Powell's testimony outlining stronger economic growth and higher expected inflation in the near future,\" Kan said. But without a major move in rates, applications to refinance a home loan, which are most rate-sensitive, didn't move either. They were unchanged from the previous week and down 13% from a year ago, when rates were lower. Homebuyers today are less worried about mortgage rates than they are about the supply crisis, especially for entry-level, less expensive homes. Low inventory across the nation continues to push home prices higher at a fast clip. Property values were 6.6% higher in January from a year ago, according to property data firm CoreLogic. CLOSE According to Realtor.com, swapping out wall-to-wall carpet for hardwood floors can make your home much more attractive to buyers, because they are durable, easy to clean, and look great. Time \"Entry-level homes have been in particularly short supply, leading to more rapid home-price growth compared with more expensive homes,\" said Frank Nothaft, chief economist for CoreLogic. Homes with purchase prices that are less than 75% of the local area median had price growth of 9% during 2017, he said. High prices are likely the reason more borrowers are turning to adjustable-rate mortgages, which offer lower interest rates. ARMs were popular during the last housing boom in the mid-2000s. Last week, the ARM share of mortgage activity increased to 7.3% of total applications, its highest level since June. © CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
