These actions helped drive our first quarter net orders per community up 17%, to more than four per month. In addition, we extended our six-year trend of growth in quarterly revenues, and significantly lifted our housing gross profit margin. Excluding a previously announced one-time, non-cash charge for the impact of recent federal tax legislation, both our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share more than doubled from the year-earlier quarter.”\n“For the remainder of 2018, we plan to continue to execute on our Returns-Focused Growth Plan, and expect to benefit from favorable housing market dynamics,” said Mezger. “In particular, we believe our long history of primarily serving first-time homebuyers, along with offering products designed to meet their needs, will enable us to continue to successfully attract millennials, which currently represent the nation’s largest and fastest growing demand segment. Moreover, we anticipate our housing gross profit margin will continue to strengthen throughout the year as we deliver more homes from newer, higher-margin communities, realize additional improvements from our community-specific action plans, and generate greater operating leverage. With good sales momentum across our business, and a considerable number of planned new openings on the horizon, we believe we are on track to end 2018 with a slightly higher community count and are well positioned operationally and strategically for the opportunities ahead.”\nThree Months Ended February 28, 2018 (comparisons on a year-over-year basis)\nTotal revenues increased 6% to $871.6 million. Deliveries were flat at 2,223 homes. Average selling price rose 7% to $389,800. Homebuilding operating income grew 74% to $44.0 million. Homebuilding operating income margin increased 200 basis points to 5.1% from 3.1%. Excluding inventory-related charges of $5.0 million in the current quarter and $4.0 million in the year-earlier quarter, the homebuilding operating income margin also improved 200 basis points to 5.6%, from 3.6%. Housing gross profit margin expanded 150 basis points to 16.1%. Housing gross profit margin excluding inventory-related charges increased 160 basis points to 16.7%. Adjusted housing gross profit margin, a metric that excludes inventory-related charges and the amortization of previously capitalized interest, rose 150 basis points to 21.4%. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of housing revenues improved 50 basis points to 11.0%, a first quarter record low. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which the Company has achieved such a record. All interest incurred was capitalized, resulting in no interest expense, compared to $6.3 million of interest expense, which included a $5.7 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt. Total pretax income increased 115% to $46.0 million. The Company’s income tax expense of $117.3 million and effective tax rate of approximately 255% reflected a one-time, non-cash charge of $111.2 million for the impact of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), which included the accounting re-measurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets based on the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Excluding this charge, the Company’s adjusted income tax expense and adjusted effective tax rate were $6.1 million and approximately 13%, respectively. In addition to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, the adjusted income tax expense and adjusted effective tax rate reflected the favorable impacts of $4.0 million of federal energy tax credits the Company earned from building energy efficient homes, and $2.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as a result of the Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard related to share-based payments. Without these credits and benefits, the Company’s adjusted effective tax rate would have approximated 27%. In the 2017 first quarter, the Company’s income tax expense and effective tax rate of $7.2 million and approximately 34%, respectively, included the favorable impact of $1.1 million of federal energy tax credits. As a result of the one-time, non-cash charge for the TCJA impact, the Company reported a net loss of $71.3 million, or $.82 per diluted share. Excluding this charge, the Company’s adjusted net income was $39.9 million, or $.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.3 million, or $.15 per diluted share.\nBacklog and Net Orders (comparisons on a year-over-year basis)\nNet order value rose 8% to $1.17 billion on an 8% increase in net orders to 2,784. Three of the Company’s four regions posted year-over-year increases in net order value. Company-wide, net orders per community averaged 4.2 per month, up 17% from 3.6 per month. Ending backlog value grew 10% to $1.97 billion, with all regions posting year-over-year increases. This was the Company’s highest first quarter backlog value in 11 years. The number of homes in backlog increased 4% to 4,972. The cancellation rate as a percentage of gross orders improved to 20% from 23%. Average community count decreased 7% to 222. Ending community count was down 9% to 219.\nBalance Sheet as of February 28, 2018 (comparisons to November 30, 2017)\nThe Company had total liquidity of $1.02 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $560.3 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $141.7 million for the quarter, compared to $77.0 million. There were no cash borrowings outstanding under the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facility. Inventories increased 5% to $3.44 billion. Investments in land acquisition and development totaled $465.0 million for the quarter. Lots owned or controlled totaled 46,219, of which 79% were owned. Notes payable increased slightly to $2.36 billion from $2.32 billion. The ratio of debt to capital was 56.0%, while the ratio of net debt to capital was 49.3%, within the Company’s 2019 target range under its Returns-Focused Growth Plan. Stockholders’ equity of $1.85 billion decreased by $73.6 million due to the one-time, non-cash TCJA-related charge.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe conference call to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 earnings will be broadcast live TODAY at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are relevant and useful to investors in understanding its operations and the leverage employed in its operations, and may be helpful in comparing the Company with other companies in the homebuilding industry to the extent they provide similar information. However, because they are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be completely comparable to other companies in the homebuilding industry and, thus, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating performance and/or financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, these non-GAAP financial measures should be used to supplement their respective most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in order to provide a greater understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company’s operations.\nAdjusted Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s income tax expense, net loss, diluted loss per share and effective tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted effective tax rate, respectively:\nThree Months Ended February 28, 2018 2017 As Reported Adjustment for\nTCJA\nAs Adjusted As Reported Total pretax income $ 46,045 $ — $ 46,045 $ 21,459 Income tax expense (a) (117,300 ) 111,200 (6,100 ) (7,200 ) Net income (loss) $ (71,255 ) $ 111,200 $ 39,945 $ 14,259 Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (.82 ) $ .40 $ .15 Weighted average shares outstanding — diluted 87,155 101,401 96,273 Effective tax rate (a) 255 % 13 % 34 % (a) For the three months ended February 28, 2018, income tax expense and adjusted income tax expense, as well as the related effective tax rate and adjusted effective tax rate, include the favorable impacts of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, $4.0 million of federal energy tax credits the Company earned from building energy efficient homes, and $2.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as a result of the Company’s adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, “Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” effective December 1, 2017. The Company’s adjusted income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures, which the Company calculates by excluding a one-time, non-cash charge of $111.2 million recorded in the 2018 first quarter from its reported income tax expense, net loss, diluted loss per share and effective tax rate, respectively. This charge was primarily due to the Company’s previously announced accounting re-measurement of its deferred tax assets based on the above-noted reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate under the TCJA. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are the Company’s income tax expense, net loss, diluted loss per share and effective tax rate. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures are meaningful to investors as they allow for an evaluation of the Company’s operating results without the impact of the TCJA-related charge.\nAdjusted Housing Gross Profit Margin\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s housing gross profit margin calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measure of the Company’s adjusted housing gross profit margin:\nThree Months Ended February 28, 2018 2017 Housing revenues $ 866,540 $ 810,947 Housing construction and land costs (727,080 ) (692,787 ) Housing gross profits 139,460 118,160 Add: Inventory-related charges (a) 4,985 4,008 Housing gross profits excluding inventory-related charges 144,445 122,168 Add: Amortization of previously capitalized interest (b) 41,369 38,873 Adjusted housing gross profits $ 185,814 $ 161,041 Housing gross profit margin 16.1 % 14.6 % Housing gross profit margin excluding inventory-related charges 16.7 % 15.1 % Adjusted housing gross profit margin 21.4 % 19.9 % (a) Represents inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges associated with housing operations. (b) Represents the amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations. Adjusted housing gross profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure, which the Company calculates by dividing housing revenues less housing construction and land costs excluding (1) housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges (as applicable) recorded during a given period and (2) amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations, by housing revenues. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is housing gross profit margin. The Company believes adjusted housing gross profit margin is a relevant and useful financial measure to investors in evaluating the Company’s performance as it measures the gross profits the Company generated specifically on the homes delivered during a given period. This non-GAAP financial measure isolates the impact that housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges, and the amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations, have on housing gross profit margins, and allows investors to make comparisons with the Company’s competitors that adjust housing gross profit margins in a similar manner. The Company also believes investors will find adjusted housing gross profit margin relevant and useful because it represents a profitability measure that may be compared to a prior period without regard to variability of housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges, and amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations. This financial measure assists management in making strategic decisions regarding community location and product mix, product pricing and construction pace.\nRatio of Net Debt to Capital\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s ratio of debt to capital calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measure of the Company’s ratio of net debt to capital:\nFebruary 28,\n2018 November 30,\n2017 Notes payable $ 2,359,570 $ 2,324,845 Stockholders’ equity 1,852,722 1,926,311 Total capital $ 4,212,292 $ 4,251,156 Ratio of debt to capital 56.0 % 54.7 % Notes payable $ 2,359,570 $ 2,324,845 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (560,255 ) (720,630 ) Net debt 1,799,315 1,604,215 Stockholders’ equity 1,852,722 1,926,311 Total capital $ 3,652,037 $ 3,530,526 Ratio of net debt to capital 49.3 % 45.4 % The ratio of net debt to capital is a non-GAAP financial measure, which the Company calculates by dividing notes payable, net of homebuilding cash and cash equivalents, by capital (notes payable, net of homebuilding cash and cash equivalents, plus stockholders’ equity). The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of debt to capital. The Company believes the ratio of net debt to capital is a relevant and useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in the Company’s operations.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180322005431/en/\nKB Home\nJill Peters, Investor Relations Contact\n310-893-7456\njpeters@kbhome.com\nor\nSusan Martin, Media Contact\n310-231-4142\nsmartin@kbhome.com\nSource: KB Home",
