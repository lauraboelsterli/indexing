    "text": "FRISCO, Texas, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Addus HomeCare Corporation (NASDAQ: ADUS), a provider of comprehensive home care services, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet service revenues increased 8.0% for the quarter to $112.0 million from $103.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the quarter was $3.2 million, a decrease of 57.2% from $7.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $0.28 per diluted share, a decrease of 57.6% from $0.66 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income per diluted share increased 7.0% to $0.46 for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $0.43 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 excludes a non-cash increase in the provision for income taxes of $1.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, due to a write-down of net deferred tax assets pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; M&A expenses of $0.04; stock-based compensation expense of $0.04; and gain on sale and divestiture of $0.01. For the fourth quarter of 2016, adjusted net income per diluted share excludes prompt payment interest income from the state of Illinois of $0.17; M&A expenses of $0.02; reversal of prior estimated restructure charges of $0.03; severance and other costs of $0.01; reversal of stock-based compensation expense of $0.01; and the positive impact from normalization of effective tax rate of $0.04. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017 to $10.6 million from $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. (See page 7 for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures in this news release.)\nFor 2017, net service revenues were $425.7 million, up 6.2% from $400.7 million for 2016. Net income for 2017 increased 13.2% to $13.6 million from $12.0 million for 2016 and increased 10.4% to $1.17 per diluted share from $1.06 per diluted share. Adjusted net income per diluted share increased 9.6% to $1.60 for 2017 from $1.46 for 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14.6% to $36.8 million from $32.1 million in 2016.\n\"We are pleased with our operating and financial performance for the fourth quarter, which continued our positive trends for revenue growth, margin improvement and adjusted net income per diluted share that we have produced during 2017,\" remarked Dirk Allison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Addus. \"Our comparable-quarter revenue growth was driven by a solid increase in same-store revenue, which rose 4.1%, and the acquisition of Options Home Care, which provided its first full quarter of revenue. We further benefited from the October acquisition of a small private-pay home-care provider based in Arizona. Our revenue growth combined with our ongoing focus on operating efficiency has led to steady improvement in our operating leverage. As a result, combined with our solid gross margin of 27.4%, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 9.5% for the quarter, our third consecutive sequential-quarter increase.\"\nRevenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflected a 3.6% increase in billable hours per business day and a 4.2% increase in revenue per billable hour, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAt the end of 2017, the Company had cash of $53.8 million and bank debt of $44.4 million, while availability under its revolving credit facility was $105.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $10.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $52.8 million for the full year.\nMr. Allison concluded, \"We are well positioned to achieve further profitable growth for 2018. Our objectives for organic growth for the year again reflect our ongoing expectation for same-store revenue growth in our targeted range of 3% to 5%. In addition, our recent announcement of a definitive agreement to purchase Ambercare Corporation, which produced revenue of approximately $57 million for 2017, substantially strengthens the anticipated revenue and earnings contribution from our acquisition strategy for 2018. With our strong infrastructure and financial position, we are prepared to act on acquisition opportunities that fit our strategic plan.\"\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe information provided in this release includes adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net service revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company defines adjusted net income per diluted share as net income per diluted share, adjusted for interest income from the State of Illinois, M&A expenses, normalization of the effective tax rate, stock-based compensation expense, restructure charges, severance and other costs, write off of debt issuance costs, write down of deferred assets due to tax reform and gain on sale of ADS and JV divestiture. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, interest income, other non-operating income, taxes, depreciation, amortization, M&A expenses, stock-based compensation expense, restructure charges, severance and other costs, after tax earnings from discontinued operations, write off of debt issuance costs, write down of deferred assets due to tax reform and gain on sale of ADS and JV divestiture. The Company defines adjusted net service revenues as net service revenues adjusted for the closure of certain sites. The Company has provided, in the financial statement tables included in this press release, a reconciliation of adjusted net income per diluted share to net income per diluted share, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income and a reconciliation of adjusted net service revenues to net service revenues, in each case, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net service revenues are useful to investors, management and others in evaluating the Company's operating performance, to provide investors with insight and consistency in the Company's financial reporting and to present a basis for comparison of the Company's business operations among periods, and to facilitate comparison with the results of the Company's peers.\nConference Call\nAddus will host a conference call on Tuesday, March 6, 2018, beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.
