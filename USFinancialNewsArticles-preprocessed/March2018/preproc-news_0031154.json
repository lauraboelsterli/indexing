    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 7:55 PM / in 9 minutes Brazil links interest rate on existing BNDES loans to bond yields Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BRASILIA, March 16 (Reuters) - Brazil on Friday linked the interest rate used in existing loans by development bank BNDES to yields on inflation-linked bonds, another step in efforts to pare back credit subsidies. In a policy shift, the National Monetary Council, Brazil’s highest economic policy body, said it will now calculate the so-called TJLP benchmark rate based on the inflation target and on bond yields. In effect, the decision reduces the leeway policymakers have in determining the benchmark rate. For years, Brazil kept the TJLP lower than the nation’s benchmark Selic interest rate, in a bid to stimulate economic growth. Starting in 2018, the TJLP will be phased out in favor of a market-based rate known as TLP. The National Monetary Council’s move on Friday brings existing loans closer into line with that policy.
