    "text": "BELIZE CITY, Belize, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Despite being on opposite sides of the globe, Belize and Australia are connected as the home to the planet's two largest barrier reefs. These fragile habitats are under threat from environmental impacts and must be protected. To help, the Belize Tourism Board has partnered with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to create the Sister Reef Project , a campaign to raise awareness and funds for Australia's Great Barrier Reef and the Belize Barrier Reef.\nThe Sister Reef Project\nThe Sister Reef Project is an online fundraiser benefitting WWF. Travelers are encouraged to buy credits to enter to win multiple curious items and experiences in Belize, while simultaneously donating to a worthy cause. All funds from the project will go toward WWF to support its reef conservation efforts in both Belize and Australia.\n\"Belize is home to the world's second-largest barrier reef and we want to keep it that way,\" said Karen Bevans, Director of Tourism at the Belize Tourism Board. \"Belizeans know the importance of a healthy reef and many rely on it for their livelihood. Our economy is built on tourism, with reef-related tourism and fisheries supporting about 190,000 people. That's why Belizeans across the country—from hotels, tour operators, restaurants and more—are coming together and donating what valuable goods and services they can to support this effort.\"\nPrizes up for grabs as part of the Sister Reef Project include:\nAccommodations at more than a dozen resorts Roundtrip airline tickets Exclusive adventure and cultural experiences, like an aerial tour over the Great Blue Hole, luxury sailing excursion, diving and caving tours, and private culinary experiences Many more items and experiences\nHow to Donate\nStarting March 8, 2018 and continuing through March 29, 2018, U.S. travelers can visit SisterReefProject.com and make a donation to the online fundraiser. Every $5 USD donation can be applied to purchase credits that will allow them to enter for a chance to win many different curious Belize experiences, while simultaneously donating to a worthy cause. Participants may come away with one of more than 40 prizes or experiences worth over $37,000 USD. But because the reef promises the unexpected, the prizes will be too—all listed items will initially be hidden and will be unlocked as individual donations occur.\nTo view auction items, donate and learn about reef conservation, visit SisterReefProject.com .\nThe Belize Barrier Reef\nSpanning 185 miles of the country's coastline, the Belize Barrier Reef is the largest reef system in the Northern Hemisphere, second only in the world to Australia's Great Barrier Reef. It comprises seven key marine reserve zones, over 400 cayes (islands) and three atolls. Home to more than 500 species of fish and marine life, 70 hard coral and 30 soft coral, the Belize Barrier Reef is a world-class diving and snorkeling destination, attracting visitors from around the globe. It was dedicated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nFor more information on traveling to Belize, visit TravelBelize.org , and join the community on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\nAbout the Belize Tourism Board\nThe Belize Tourism Board (BTB) is a statutory body within the Belize Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, and it is governed by a Board of Directors appointed Tourism Industry Association and Belize National Tour Operators Association.
