FILE PHOTO - British businessman Arron Banks, who has funded the Leave.EU campaign, is seen during the opening day of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) annual conference at Doncaster Racecourse in Doncaster, northern Britain September 25, 2015. REUTERS/Andrew Yates \nBanks said he was asked to provide information as part of the Information Commissioner’s investigation into whether data analytics were used to sway public opinion during the 2016 referendum on whether to leave the European Union. \nThe Information Commissioner “appears to have joined the ‘wild unicorn’ chasing pack of ‘Remainers’ ..,” Banks said in a statement. \nThe watchdog is investigating the work of the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica and whether the company misled the public about work it did for a pro-Brexit group run by Banks before the vote to leave the EU.
