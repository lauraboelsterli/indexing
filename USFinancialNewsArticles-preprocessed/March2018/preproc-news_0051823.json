    "text": "Q1 2018 Backlog Additions of $212 Million for the Utility T&D Segment Willbros shares are now traded on the OTC under the symbol WGRP Due to the Recent Transaction Announcement with Primoris Services Corporation,\nNo Conference Call will be Held\nHOUSTON, Willbros Group, Inc. (OTC:WGRP) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. The company reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $55.0 million, or $(0.89) per diluted share, on revenue of $217.9 million, compared to a net loss of $14.2 million, or $(0.23) per diluted share, on revenue of $164.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, the company reported a net loss of $108.1 million, or $(1.74) per diluted share, on revenue of $850.0 million, compared to a net loss of $47.8 million, or $(0.77) per diluted share, on revenue of $731.7 million for the full year of 2016.\nOperating loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $49.1 million, compared to an operating loss of $27.8 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $12.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in the operating loss of $21.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a significant increase in losses associated with three mainline pipeline construction projects in the Oil & Gas segment. For the full year 2017, the company reported an operating loss of $91.3 million compared to a full year 2016 operating loss of $30.7 million. In January 2018, the company completed the sale of its tank services business and also reached agreement to sell assets comprising its mainline pipeline construction business.\nOn March 28, 2018, the company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Primoris Services Corporation (NASDAQ:PRIM) (“Primoris”). The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, is not subject to a financing condition, and is anticipated to close during the second quarter of 2018, subject to approval by the requisite vote of the Company’s stockholders and certain other closing conditions.\nMichael J. Fournier, President and CEO, commented, “We look forward to working with Primoris to complete the transaction. The announced sale and additional liquidity of up to $20 million adds stability to the company as we move towards closing of this transaction.”\nSegment Operating Results\nUtility T&D\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Utility T&D segment reported an operating loss of $9.6 million on revenue of $109.9 million compared to an operating loss of $7.5 million on revenue of $129.9 million in the third quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter 2017 operating results were impacted by losses on two large discrete projects. These discrete projects were completed in the first quarter of 2018. For the full year 2017, the segment reported an operating loss of $5.3 million on revenue of $507.0 million. For the full year 2016, the segment reported operating income of $15.6 million on revenue of $418.4 million.\nOil & Gas\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Oil & Gas segment reported an operating loss of $35.0 million on revenue of $75.2 million compared to an operating loss of $14.8 million on revenue of $75.3 million in the third quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter 2017 operating results were impacted by a significant increase in losses associated with three mainline pipeline construction projects. Two of these projects have reached mechanical completion and the company reached a settlement to conclude the work on the third project in the first quarter of 2018. For the full year 2017, the segment reported an operating loss of $60.5 million on revenue of $221.9 million. For the full year 2016, the segment reported an operating loss of $16.8 million on revenue of $170.4 million.\nCanada\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Canada segment reported operating income of $1.3 million on revenue of $32.9 million, compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million on revenue of $35.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. The $1.6 million increase was primarily driven by high productivity on an integrity dig project and gross margin increases on the close-out of other discrete projects. For the full year 2017, the segment reported an operating loss of $4.0 million on revenue of $121.2 million. For the full year 2016, the segment reported an operating loss of $0.7 million on revenue of $143.1 million.\nCorporate\nFor the full year 2017, the company recorded $21.5 million of corporate overhead costs compared to $28.8 million of corporate overhead costs for the full year 2016.\nBacklog\nAt December 31, 2017, the company reported total backlog of $616.3 million compared to $741.3 million at September 30, 2017. Twelve-month backlog of $477.1 million at December 31, 2017 decreased $66.8 million from September 30, 2017. The decrease in total and twelve-month backlog is primarily related to a reduction in discrete projects in the Oil & Gas segment, as well as a reduction in MSA backlog in the Utility T&D segment due to the overall timing of renewal.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Utility T&D segment received $212 million in contract extensions or new awards, including a one-year contract extension with one of our key clients amounting to approximately $180 million. The remaining $32 million in awards consists of multiple MSA contract extensions and small discrete projects.\nLiquidity\nTotal liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents plus revolver availability) was $48.8 million at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $33.5 million at December 31, 2017. As a result of the operating loss we incurred in the fourth quarter 2017, we have had a significant reduction in our liquidity during the first quarter of 2018. In order to address this decrease in liquidity, in March 2018 we obtained additional liquidity up to $20.0 million through an amendment to our Term Credit Agreement. This additional liquidity was provided by Primoris and is repayable if the transaction does not close.\nIn addition, in March 2018, we entered into forbearance agreements with our lenders as a result of noncompliance with certain default provisions, including the inability to deliver audited financial statements without a going concern explanation and the inability to meet certain future financial covenants. The forbearance agreements provide that our lenders will refrain from pursuing any remedies with respect to certain events of default under our credit agreements for a limited period as we work to complete the merger transaction and provided we comply with the provisions of the agreements.\nConference Call\nAs a result of Willbros’ pending transaction with Primoris, the company will not hold a conference call to discuss quarterly and full year results.\nAbout Willbros\nWillbros is a specialty energy infrastructure contractor serving the oil and gas and power industries with offerings that primarily include construction, maintenance and facilities development services.

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a supplemental performance measure for comparing normalized operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry and for presentations made to analysts, investment banks and other members of the financial community who use this information in order to make investment decisions about us. Backlog is anticipated contract revenue from uncompleted portions of existing contracts and contracts whose award is reasonably assured. Master Service Agreement (\"MSA\") backlog is estimated for the remaining term of the contract. MSA backlog is determined based on historical trends inherent in the MSAs, factoring in seasonal demand and projecting customer needs based on ongoing communications. Backlog is not a term recognized under U.S. GAAP; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. (2)\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is not a financial measurement recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Because all companies do not use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies CONTACT\nStephen W.
