REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “A trade war has no winners and if it does not happen for the better, then we can work with our American friends and other allies on the core issue of this problem, overcapacity,” European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstrom said on Wednesday.\n“But if it does happen we will have to take measures to protect European jobs,” she added.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop and Samantha Koester; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek\n ",
