    "text": "Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz was formally charged Wednesday with 17 counts of first-degree murder, which could mean a death sentence if he's convicted.\nA grand jury in Fort Lauderdale returned the indictment against the 19-year-old Cruz for the Valentine's Day massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in which 17 people died and 16 were wounded.\nThe indictment also charges Cruz with 17 counts of attempted murder.\nCruz's public defender has said Cruz will plead guilty if prosecutors take the death penalty off the table, which would mean a life prison sentence. The Broward County state attorney hasn't announced a decision on the death penalty.",
