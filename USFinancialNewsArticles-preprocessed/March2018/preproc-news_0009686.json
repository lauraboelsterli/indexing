    "text": "NEW ORLEANS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pan-American Life Insurance Group (PALIG), a leading provider of insurance and financial services throughout the Americas, announced today that Stephen Batza is retiring from his role as President of U.S. Life and President and CEO of Mutual Trust Life Insurance Company. He will remain a member of PALIG’s Board of Directors.\nMr. Batza became President and CEO of Mutual Trust Insurance Company in 2007 and joined the Pan-American Life organization following the 2015 merger of Pan-American Life and Mutual Trust Financial Group’s mutual holding companies. Since the merger, he led Pan-American Life’s individual business in the United States as President of U.S. Life, and was responsible for guiding the development and execution of sales strategies and product innovation. Mr. Batza continued serving as President and Chief Executive Officer of Mutual Trust Life Insurance Company during that period. Prior to assuming the leadership role at Mutual Trust, he was Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Individual Life Business Unit at Liberty Mutual Group.\n“We are very supportive of Steve’s decision and are pleased that he will remain on our Board. Although I only had the opportunity to work directly with him for a short time, I have known Steve for many years and have always appreciated his courageous leadership and his ability to communicate complex issues in understandable terms,” said José S. Suquet, Chairman of the Board, President and CEO of Pan-American Life Insurance Group. “Steve led the Mutual Trust organization through a difficult period and made the bold choice to move forward with our merger. What he has done to set up our Life business in the United States for current and future success is truly invaluable.”\nThe company also announced the appointment of PALIG’s President of International Life Bruce Parker as President of the newly consolidated Global Life business unit and as Chief Executive Officer of Mutual Trust Life Insurance Company.\nMr. Parker has been a member of Pan-American Life’s executive management team since joining the company in 2009. Most recently, he has led all of Pan-American Life’s individual life and personal accident insurance business in Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, as Chairman of Pan-American International Insurance Corporation (PAIIC) and Pan-American Assurance Company International, Inc. (PAACII) he oversees the Group’s Private Client Life businesses.\nPALIG also announced the promotion of Geri Gaughan to President and Chief Operating Officer of Mutual Trust Life Insurance Company. Ms. Gaughan was previously Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Mutual Trust Life Insurance Company.\nPrior to joining Mutual Trust in 2005, she was Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel for Life and Group Operations at CNA Financial Corporation, Chicago, Illinois. Ms. Gaughan started her career at Washington National Insurance Company where she spent 13 years in various roles.\n“The appointments of Bruce Parker and Geri Gaughan to senior positions in our Global Life Organization are a recognition of the contributions they have made to our business and their strong leadership qualities,” added Suquet. “Their strategic perspective and depth of expertise position us to deliver on our core mission and we look forward to their tenures in their new roles.”\nAbout Pan-American Life Insurance Group\nPan-American Life Insurance Group is a leading provider of insurance and financial services throughout the Americas that has been delivering trusted financial services since 1911.
