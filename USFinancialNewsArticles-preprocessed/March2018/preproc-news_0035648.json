    "text": "Proposed Tech Export Bill Goes Way Too Far By Commercial   \nMarch 18, 2018 one:34 p.m. ET \nPertaining to \nRep. Robert Pittenger’s \n“ How China Pushes the Limits on Navy Technologies Transfer ” (WSJ.com op-ed, March 14): Couple Us residents would argue towards steps to make this region a lot more protected, and most would agree that safeguarding nationwide security requires the good resources. Nevertheless, numerous a lot more would agree that remaining factual when discussing this subject matter is unquestionably vital. \nLaws recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these web pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some required advancements to the Committee on Overseas Investment decision in the U.S. (Cfius). For illustration, the evaluate would grow the capacity of the government to block the purchase of structures or other actual estate in close proximity to military services installations. \nBut Mr. Pittenger’s bill—the Overseas Investment decision Hazard Evaluate Modernization Act—goes a lot, a lot farther. It would greatly grow the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing less than government evaluate countless global product sales and licensing transactions by U.S. organizations. \nThe new remit of Cfius would consist of such points as typical computer system support and assistance contracts, technological know-how manuals required to run machinery obtained by international prospects and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that under no circumstances have been considered delicate by the Protection Department or that have been prolonged in the past eliminated from management by the U.S. and its allies would be matter to new and opaque regulation by Cfius. \nExtra about is that Mr. Pittenger’s monthly bill would do all of this unilaterally—without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative systems. Congress can impose all the limits it would like on U.S. companies. But, if America does not get the job done with allies to enact very similar controls, we will are unsuccessful to protect both nationwide security and our economic competitiveness. \nIn generating his scenario to grow Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technological know-how marketed overseas by IBM and other organizations that the U.S. government by itself prolonged in the past ruled have been nonsensitive and ready to be freely marketed all around the planet with no a government license. In simple fact, almost everything IBM has finished globally complies with U.S. and international export-management guidelines. For occasion, sharing commonly posted, open up-source application, or technological know-how to assemble computer system servers that are years at the rear of state of the art, isn’t threatening and as a result not lawfully managed for export. But assisting with China’s higher-general performance computing job is rightly prohibited by U.S. regulation, and the assertion that IBM has finished so is flatly untrue. \nRather of putting hundreds of nonsensitive transactions less than evaluate by a smaller committee that has neither the employees nor the expertise to cope with them, the superior approach would be to update the export-management technique we presently have. A bipartisan monthly bill introduced by Reps. \nEd Royce \nand \nEliot Engel, \nleaders of the Dwelling Overseas Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging troubles. \nCongress could also need that technological know-how controls be retained up-to-day. The Departments of Commerce and State—which are right now liable for administering controls on twin-use and military services technologies—have involving them 500 professionals, a transparent system of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Important Technologies Listing, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to management, hasn’t been up-to-date by the Protection Department since 2011. \nAs modern heritage has revealed, managing delicate technological know-how will work best when finished internationally, with a sharp target on those people systems that are the most vital. Casting way too wide a web on regime enterprise risks shedding target on the actual threats. Producing a new paperwork, as a substitute of modernizing the a person we presently have, would be misguided. \nRep. Pittenger must get his facts straight. And Congress must act, both to strengthen Cfius and to update export controls, but it must use the good resources for the good occupation. \nChristopher Padilla \nIBM \nWashington \nMr. Padilla is vice president for government and regulatory affairs at IBM. He was assistant secretary of commerce liable for export controls from 2006-2007.",
