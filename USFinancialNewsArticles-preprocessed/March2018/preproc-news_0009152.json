    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The LoRa Alliance ™, the global association of companies backing the open LoRaWAN™ standard for Internet of Things (IoT) low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), announced that it has appointed Donna Moore as the new CEO & Chair of the LoRa Alliance. Moore brings a strong track record of securing market adoption for new technologies and ramping up product certification. Moore will replace current Chair Geoff Mulligan, who has led the organization since its inception in 2015.\n“Donna was identified amongst a strong field of potential candidates to lead the Board and LoRa Alliance operations to fulfill our vision, and we look forward to working with her,” said Bertrand Waels, Board Member of the LoRa Alliance and Head of Radio Access Alternative Technologies at Orange. “We have achieved great success as an Alliance with rapid growth. Moving forward, the LoRa Alliance will be highly focused on wider technology adoption and increasing the volume of certified devices to make LoRaWAN one of the most globally-adopted low-power wide-area networking (LPWAN) technologies. Donna’s expertise and experience in these areas will prove invaluable as we enter our next stage of development.”\n“The unique differentiators of LoRaWAN technology position the LoRa Alliance well in the LPWAN market,” said Donna Moore, incoming CEO & Chair of the LoRa Alliance. “Member enthusiasm for the LoRaWAN protocol is incredibly inspiring. There are already a wide variety of real-world LoRaWAN implementations across multiple industries in use today. These adoptions are a clear breakthrough for IoT connectivity and demonstrate that LoRaWAN can solve business intelligence requirements, deliver a strong ROI for implementers, and offer confidence and longevity to end-users. The LoRa Alliance has a fantastic opportunity now to cement its leadership position in the IoT space through increased certification, and rapidly increasing adoption. I look forward to leading the organization through this exciting growth phase that has global, market-changing implications.”\n“The Board of Directors sincerely thanks Geoff for the significant role he played in our success to date with phenomenal member growth and global adoption,” said Olivier Beaujard, Sr. Director LoRa Alliance for the Wireless and Sensing Products Group at Semtech and a Board Member of the LoRa Alliance. “The foundation he helped to create allows for Donna to focus on the future and the realization of LoRaWAN as the de facto LPWAN technology.”\nMoore has nearly two decades of experience in launching new companies and growing businesses across a variety of industries and competitive environments. Most recently, she was CEO of SpireSpark, a company that designs, builds and manages worldwide certification, compliance and conformance programs. Prior to that, she served as the executive director of the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA), she successfully led the global market adoption of DLNA with 4 billion certified devices deployed worldwide, established strategic alliances across industries, doubled Alliance membership, and increased member participation. She holds a Bachelor of Science degree from San Diego State University.\nAbout LoRa Alliance\nThe LoRa Alliance is an open, nonprofit association that has grown to more than 500 members since its inception in March 2015, becoming one of the largest and fastest-growing alliances in the technology sector. Its members closely collaborate and share experiences to promote the LoRaWAN protocol as the leading open global standard for secure, carrier-grade IoT LPWAN connectivity. With the technical flexibility to address a broad range of IoT applications, both static and mobile, and a certification program to guarantee interoperability, the LoRaWAN protocol has already been deployed by major mobile network operators globally and connectivity is available in over 100 countries, with continuing expansion ongoing.\nFor information about joining the LoRa Alliance, please visit www.lora-alliance.org , or check out our 2017 End of Year Report .\nLoRa Alliance Contact Emma Pearce +44 7920 493438 emma.pearce@lora-alliance.org Media Contact Eric Lawson +1 480 276-9572 elawson@kiterocket.com\nSource:LoRa Alliance",
