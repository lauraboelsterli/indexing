Among other changes, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, and required a one-time transition tax on previously unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result, the company recorded a provisional income tax expense of $41.5 million during Q4 FY 17. The provisional amount includes $13 million related to the transition tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings and $28 million due to the re-measurement of the company’s deferred tax balances at the lower tax rate. The company continues to analyze the Tax Act and the provisional amounts will be finalized in FY 18.\nSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDEND INCREASE\nDuring FY 17, we repurchased 4.1 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $48.43 per share and a total cost of approximately $196 million.

As announced in a separate release today, our Board of Directors authorized a $0.04, or 10%, increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.43 per share, and increased the amount available for repurchases under our existing stock repurchase program to $500 million.\nFISCAL YEAR 2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE\n1st Quarter 2018 Financial Guidance*\nTotal Net Revenues (millions)\n$1,135 – $1,170\nComparable Brand Revenue Growth\n2% – 5%\nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS\n$0.55 – $0.60\nFiscal Year 2018 Financial Guidance*\nTotal Net Revenues (millions) $5,475 – $5,635 Comparable Brand Revenue Growth 2% – 5% Non-GAAP Operating Margin 8.2% – 9.0% Non-GAAP Diluted EPS $4.12 – $4.22\nNon-GAAP Income Tax Rate 24.0% – 26.0% Capital Spending (millions) $200 – $220 Depreciation and Amortization (millions) $185 – $195 *We have not provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP\nmeasures on a forward-looking basis due to the potential variability of discrete items.\nStore Opening and Closing Guidance by Retail Concept**\nFY 2017 ACTUAL FY 2018 GUIDANCE Total New Close End Williams Sonoma 228 5 (15) 218 Pottery Barn 203 4 (3) 204 West Elm 106 9 (3) 112 Pottery Barn Kids 86 - (9) 77 Rejuvenation 8 2 - 10 Total 631 20 (30) 621 ** Included in the FY 17 store count are 19 stores in Australia and two stores in the UK.\nFY 18 guidance includes one additional UK store.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST INFORMATION\nWilliams-Sonoma, Inc. will host a live conference call today, March 14, 2018, at 2:00 P.M.

definition of Operating Income/(Expense) and Operating Margin.\nSEC Regulation G – Non-GAAP Information – These tables include non-GAAP SG&A, operating income, operating margin, earnings before income taxes, income taxes, effective tax rate, net earnings and diluted EPS. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information for investors regarding the performance of our business and facilitate a meaningful evaluation of our quarterly actual results on a comparable basis with prior periods. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business from quarter to quarter. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nNotes to Exhibit 1:\n1 During Q4 17 we incurred approximately $6.2 million of expense related to the acquisition of Outward and its ongoing operations, of which approximately $5.9 million is related to SG&A and $0.3 million is related to gross margin. We have excluded the gross margin impact from our non-GAAP reconciliations due to its immateriality.\n2 During Q1 17 and Q4 17 we incurred approximately $5.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, for severance-related reorganization expenses primarily in our corporate functions, which is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses within the unallocated segment. During Q1 16 and Q3 16, we incurred severance-related reorganization expenses due to headcount reduction primarily in our corporate functions totaling approximately $14.4 million, which were recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses within the unallocated segment.\n3 During Q4 17 we incurred provisional income tax expense of approximately $41.5 million resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n4 During Q1 17 we recorded income tax expense of approximately $1.4 million and, during Q4 17, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $1.7 million associated with the adoption of new accounting rules related to stock-based compensation.\n5 During Q4 16 we incurred a benefit of approximately $7.7 million from a one-time favorable tax adjustment. Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”)\nWe believe ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficient and effective use of capital, and is an important component of long-term shareholder return. We define ROIC as non-GAAP net operating profit after tax (NOPAT), divided by our average invested capital. NOPAT is defined as non-GAAP operating income, plus rent expense, less estimated taxes at the company’s effective tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the two-year average of total assets less current liabilities, plus annual rental expense multiplied by 6, less cash in excess of $200 million.\nROIC is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining ROIC may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180314006096/en/\nWILLIAMS-SONOMA, INC.\nJulie P.
