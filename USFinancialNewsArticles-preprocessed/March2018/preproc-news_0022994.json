    "text": "CHICAGO, March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein denied Breitburn Energy Partners LP’s bid to end a two-year bankruptcy on Friday, saying that the plan of reorganization unfairly discriminates against certain bondholders.\nIn a written ruling following a four-day court hearing, Bernstein also said that equity holders, who had argued over the company’s valuation, are “out of the money.” (Reporting by Tracy Rucinski Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n ",
