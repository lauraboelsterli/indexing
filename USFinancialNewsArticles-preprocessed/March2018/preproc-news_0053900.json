    "text": "TEPIC, Mexico, March 27 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The founder of U.S.-based self-help groups faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted on charges of sex trafficking, according to authorities who say he ran a secret society that enslaved women and branded them with his initials.\nKeith Raniere, who was arrested in Mexico, was due to appear in court in Texas on Tuesday for a formal reading of charges against him.\nU.S. authorities say Raniere created a secret society of women, forcing them to have sex and branding them with his initials.\nHe coerced them by threatening to release personal information and taking their assets, according to a complaint filed in New York federal court.\n“As alleged, Keith Raniere displayed a disgusting abuse of power in his efforts to denigrate and manipulate women he considered his sex slaves,” William Sweeney, FBI assistant director in charge, said in a statement.\n“He allegedly participated in horrifying acts of branding and burning them,” he said. “We are putting an end to this torture today.”\nRaniere, 57, has run a network of self-help groups based in Albany, New York called Nxivm over the past 20 years, according to the court complaint.\nA secret society within Nxivm consisted of female “slaves” required to have sex with Raniere, according to unnamed women cited in the complaint.\nThe women, who numbered as many as 50, were branded with symbols including Raniere’s initials and forced to adhere to strict diet to stay thin, said the complaint.\nUpon joining, they were required to provide information about family and friends, nude photographs and rights to their assets — so-called collateral used to threaten them if they left, the complaint said.\nThe women were taught membership in the secret society would empower them and eradicate their weaknesses, the complaint said.\nRaniere, who was arrested on Sunday at a luxury villa near the Mexican resort of Puerto Vallarta, was deported to Texas for his court appearance in Fort Worth.\nHe faces charges of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy.\nIf convicted, Raniere faces the possibility of 15 years to life in prison.\nOn its website, Nxivm calls itself “a community guided by humanitarian principles that seek to empower people and answer important questions about what it means to be human.”\nIn an undated letter on the website, Raniere said he was “deeply saddened” and “there is no merit to the allegations that we are abusing, coercing or harming individuals.”\nLocal media on Tuesday reported FBI agents raided a home in upstate New York near Albany owned by a co-founder of Nxivm.\nReporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.
