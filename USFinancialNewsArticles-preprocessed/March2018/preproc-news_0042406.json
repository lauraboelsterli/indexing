    "text": "ELMA, N.Y., Servotronics, Inc. (NYSE MKT: SVT) a designer and manufacturer of servo-control components and other advanced technology products announced today the results of its operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 was $1,317,000 (or $0.58 per share Basic and $0.57 Diluted) on revenues of $41,444,000 as compared to net income for the same period of 2016 of $1,753,000 (or $0.79 per share Basic and $0.76 Diluted) on revenues of $38,587,000. Excluding certain non-recurring items related to the death benefits under the employment agreement for the Company's late founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and arbitration expense, each net of tax, the Company's adjusted net income increased approximately 1.1% from $1,753,000 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016 to $1,772,000 for the same period of 2017.\nGross profit for 2017 was $10.8 million, or 26.1% of revenue, compared with $10.0 million, or 26.0% of revenue for 2016. The increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the mix of product sold, as well as the realization of certain expected operational efficiencies attributable to increased production volumes at our Ontario Knife Company subsidiary. EBITDA for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 was $3,027,000 as compared to $3,355,000 for the same period of 2016. EBITDA for 2017, adjusting certain non-recurring items, was $3.7 million, or 9.0% of revenue, compared to $3.4 million, or 8.7% of revenue for 2016.\n\"We are pleased with our financial results for 2017, which were in line with our expectations,\" observed Kenneth D. Trbovich, CEO and Chairman of the Board. \"We again achieved record annual sales with a 4.4% increase in revenues from 2016. Our ability to be successful in this competitive market environment requires efficient operations and a skilled workforce. We continue to invest in our employees as well as our facilities and equipment to allow us to focus on quality and continuous improvement as we pursue our strategic and operational goals. We thank our employees for their continued support and commitment and look forward to building on our most recent success as we grow the Company in the future.\"\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (\"GAAP\"). The Company's management uses the non-GAAP measure \"adjusted net income\", EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in their analysis of the Company's performance. The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and such measure is used to evaluate and compare the core operating performance of the Company from period to period. Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA reflect changes in financial results associated with the non-recurring charges and income items highlighted below. Management believes the presentation of these financial measures provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company from period to period by removing nonrecurring items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results. This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income determined in accordance with GAAP.\nIncluded below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to reported amounts ($000's omitted):\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nAdjusted Net Income Reconciliation\n2017\n2016\nAs reported net income\n$ 1,317\n$ 1,753\nNon-GAAP adjustments, net of tax\nNon-recurring employment contract expense\n284\n-\nNon-recurring arbitration expense\n171\n-\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income\n$ 1,772\n$ 1,753\nPer share amounts:\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income per share (basic)\n$ 0.78\n$ 0.79\nBasic weighted average common shares\n2,267\n2,215\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n2017\n2016\nAs reported net income\n$ 1,317\n$ 1,753\nAdd/(Subtract) back:\nOther income, net\n(10)\n(11)\nInterest Expense\n77\n73\nDepreciation and amortization\n885\n823\nProvision for income taxes\n758\n717\nEBITDA\n3,027\n3,355\nNon-recurring employment contract expense\n449\n-\nNon-recurring arbitration expense\n270\n-\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA\n$ 3,746\n$ 3,355\nThe Company is composed of two groups â€“ the ATG and the CPG. The ATG primarily designs, develops and manufactures servo controls and other components for various commercial and government applications (i.e., aircraft, jet engines, missiles, manufacturing equipment, etc.). The CPG designs and manufactures cutlery, bayonets, pocket knives, machetes and combat knives, survival, sporting, agricultural knives and other edged products for both commercial and government applications.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain paragraphs of this release contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as those pertaining to the Company's planned growth efforts and expectation of new business and success in its entry into new product programs.
