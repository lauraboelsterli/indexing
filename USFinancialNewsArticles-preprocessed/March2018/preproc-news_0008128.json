    "text": "BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LaSalle Hotel Properties (NYSE: LHO) today reported that, since February 26, 2018, it has repurchased 1,876,900 common shares of the Company at a cost of $46.5 million and a weighted average price of $24.76 per share under the Company’s previously announced share repurchase program. The Company has approximately $523 million of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization.\n“The Board and management team are confident that LaSalle shares represent an extremely compelling investment opportunity,” said Michael D. Barnello, President and Chief Executive Officer of LaSalle Hotel Properties. “Given LaSalle’s solid balance sheet, we have the financial flexibility to return substantial capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to be disciplined and opportunistic in our approach to capital allocation, and we are confident that we are taking the right steps to create significant long-term value for all LaSalle shareholders.”\nThe timing, manner, price, and actual number of shares acquired under the Company’s share repurchase program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions, and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be suspended, modified, or terminated at any time for any reason without prior notice.\nAbout LaSalle Hotel Properties\nLaSalle Hotel Properties is a leading multi-operator real estate investment trust. The Company owns 41 properties, which are upscale, full-service hotels, totaling approximately 10,400 guest rooms in 11 markets in seven states and the District of Columbia. The Company focuses on owning, redeveloping and repositioning upscale, full-service hotels located in urban, resort and convention markets. LaSalle Hotel Properties seeks to grow through strategic relationships with premier lodging groups, including Access Hotels & Resorts, Accor, Benchmark Hospitality, Davidson Hotel Company, Evolution Hospitality, HEI Hotels & Resorts, Highgate Hotels, Hilton, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, IHG, JRK Hotel Group, Inc., Marriott International, Noble House Hotels & Resorts, Outrigger Lodging Services, Provenance Hotels, Two Roads Hospitality, and Viceroy Hotel Group.\nThis press release, together with other statements and information publicly disseminated by the Company, contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and includes this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe the Company's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words “will,” \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" “may,” “plan,” “seek,” “should,” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, among others, statements about the Company’s capital allocation strategies, dividends, and share repurchase program. You should not rely on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond the Company's control and which could materially affect actual results, performances or achievements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, (i) risks associated with the hotel industry, including competition for guests and meetings from other hotels and alternative lodging companies, increases in wages, energy costs and other operating costs, potential unionization or union disruption, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, any type of flu or disease-related pandemic and downturns in general and local economic conditions, (ii) the availability and terms of financing and capital and the general volatility of securities markets, (iii) the Company’s dependence on third-party managers of its hotels, including its inability to implement strategic business decisions directly, (iv) risks associated with the real estate industry, including environmental contamination and costs of complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, and similar laws, (v) interest rate increases, (vi) the possible failure of the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT and the risk of changes in laws affecting REITs, (vii) the possibility of uninsured losses, (viii) risks associated with redevelopment and repositioning projects, including delays and cost overruns, (ix) the risk of a material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of the Company’s or the hotel managers’ information technology networks and systems, and (x) the risk factors discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in its Quarterly Reports. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Company's expectations will be realized. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, the Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to publicly release any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein (or elsewhere) to reflect any change in the Company’s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nFor additional information or to receive press releases via e-mail, please visit our website at www.lasallehotels.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301006561/en/\nLaSalle Hotel Properties\nKenneth G.
