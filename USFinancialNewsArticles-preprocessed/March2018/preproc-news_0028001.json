    "text": "ANN ARBOR, Mich., March 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arotech Corporation (Nasdaq:ARTX) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Summary:\nU.S. $ in thousands, except per share data Twelve months ended December 31, Three months ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Measures Revenue $ 98,723 $ 92,976 $ 28,996 $ 21,489 Net income (loss) from continuing operations $ 3,834 $ (1,480 ) $ 4,409 $ (2,034 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share – continuing operations $ 0.15 $ (0.06 ) $ 0.17 $ (0.08 ) Non-GAAP Measures (reconciliation to GAAP measures appears in the tables below) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations $ 7,595 $ 7,070 $ 3,230 $ 757 Adjusted EPS from continuing operations $ 0.17 $ 0.17 $ 0.08 $ 0.01 Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Business Highlights :\nFourth quarter revenue of $29 million is up 35% over the prior year.\nU.S. Power Division delivers Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Sources (MEHPS) products to the U.S. Marine Corps for testing.\nTraining and Simulation Division sets second consecutive annual sales record for Arotech’s MILO Range use of force training products with sales of $14 million.\nCommercial vehicle simulation group delivers a bus simulation demonstrator to New Flyer and strengthened Arotech’s new partnership with an order from the San Francisco MTA for three new simulators.\nIsrael Power Division begins work on a new battery development for an autonomous underwater vehicle program and field trials on its lithium-ion 6T tank batteries.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted late in 2017 reduced corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, which required remeasurement of Arotech’s deferred taxes and resulted in a $3.2 million one-time benefit in 2017, raising net income results (GAAP measures only).\nArotech also reported that its Board of Directors appointed Dean Krutty, who had been acting CEO since January 2017, to the position of President and CEO of Arotech. “2017 was a year of transition for Arotech,” noted Chairman of the Board Jon B. Kutler. “While still not satisfied with the Company’s results, I believe the Board and Dean have made significant progress towards setting the Company on the right path. We have cut costs, restructured the corporate culture, and invested in the programs, technologies, and people required to support future growth. As one of the Company’s largest shareholders, I am extremely focused on the need to create sustainable improvements in shareholder value,” concluded Mr. Kutler.\n“Our fourth quarter continued the improvement shown in Q3 and delivered a strong second half performance that we had been expecting,” commented CEO Dean Krutty. “We continue to see broad based support for our products, especially in our Training and Simulation Division, which improved our performance over the fourth quarter of 2016 and the previous three quarters of 2017. We anticipate continued revenue growth as our recent sales of simulation products to the U.S. military improves the outlook for 2018.”\n“Within our Power Systems Division, the delivery of our MEHPS product in the fourth quarter marked an important milestone for our U.S. power subsidiary, UEC. While the MEHPS project was more costly than we had anticipated, we believe that the future market for these hybrid power systems will ultimately more than justify the investment that we have made. We look forward to supporting the U.S. Marine Corps in system testing during 2018,” concluded Mr. Krutty.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Summary\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $98.7 million, compared to $93.0 million for 2016, an increase of 6.2%.
