    "text": "FOURTH-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nVolumes of 3.4 million tons, with Proppant Solutions volumes of 2.8 million tons Revenues of $273.9 million, with Proppant Solutions revenues of $245.2 million\nFULL-YEAR HIGHLIGHTS\nNet income of $53.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share Full-year Adjusted EBITDA of $206.3 million\nCHESTERLAND, Ohio, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fairmount Santrol (NYSE:FMSA), a leading provider of high-performance sand and sand-based product solutions, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth-Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal Company volumes sold were 3.4 million tons for the quarter, down 3% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 38% from 2.4 million tons in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 revenues were $273.9 million, down 2% from $280.1 million in the third quarter of 2017 and nearly double from $140.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor fourth-quarter 2017, the Company had net income of $19.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared with net income of $34.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017. Net loss for fourth-quarter 2016 was $19.9 million, or $(0.09) per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $63.8 million compared to the Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2017 of $73.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Adjusted EBITDA was $11.7 million.\nFull-Year 2017 Results\nTotal volumes sold in 2017 were 12.8 million tons, compared with 8.9 million tons in 2016. Full-year 2017 revenues were $959.8 million, compared with $535.0 million in 2016. The increase in revenues was mainly driven by greater demand for proppants in 2017, higher pricing throughout the year and greater sales of higher-priced value-added products in both the Proppant Solutions and Industrial and Recreation segments.\nNet income for full-year 2017 was $53.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $140.2 million, or $(0.78) per diluted share, in 2016.\nFull-year Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 totaled $206.3 million and included $2.4 million in costs related to plant start-ups and $4.6 million of freight charges to move railcars into the Company’s active fleet. The full-year Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 was a loss of $4.9 million. Inventory write-downs of $10.3 million, restructuring charges of $1.2 million and $17.1 million in professional fees from debt refinancing and equity offerings were not excluded from 2016 Adjusted EBITDA.\n“Proppant demand remained robust during the fourth quarter. As anticipated, however, our volumes were impacted by continued capacity constraints, seasonal weather conditions and holiday shutdowns,” said Jenniffer Deckard, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our Industrial & Recreational segment continued its positive 2017 momentum, particularly in selling more value-added products, which contributed to its year-over-year profitability growth. While our overall fourth-quarter earnings were impacted by seasonal items, I am extremely pleased with the Company’s ability to execute on multiple initiatives and to deliver strong profitability growth during 2017.”\nBusiness Segments\nProppant Solutions Segment\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Proppant Solutions volumes were 2.8 million tons, a decrease of 2% from the third quarter of 2017 and more than 50% greater than the prior-year period. Raw frac sand volumes were 2.6 million tons and coated proppant volumes were 213,000 tons, which represent a 2% and 1% sequential decline, respectively, but represent a 47% and 110% increase, respectively, compared with the prior-year period.\nProppant Solutions revenues were $245.2 million in fourth-quarter 2017, a 2% decline compared with $249.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, and a 116% increase compared with $113.4 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in Proppant Solutions revenues was due to the impact of slightly lower volumes and a higher percentage of sales sold directly from the mine.\nProppant Solutions gross profit decreased to $77.2 million, or $28 per ton, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $85.1 million, or $30 per ton, in the third quarter of 2017. Proppant Solutions gross profit was lower in the fourth quarter due mainly to a higher cost position as a result of seasonal factors and process engineering changes as well as a mix shift toward trial well sales for Propel SSP®. Gross profit for the segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $17.1 million, or $9 per ton.\nIndustrial and Recreational Products Segment\nIndustrial and Recreational volumes were 582,000 tons in fourth-quarter 2017, down slightly from the prior year’s fourth quarter. The decrease in volumes over the prior-year period was driven by a shift in sales efforts toward value-added products and away from certain higher-volume, low-margin sales.\nRevenues for the segment were $28.7 million in fourth-quarter 2017, a 6% increase from $27.1 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. The increase in revenue was due to annual price increases and a continued focus on higher-priced and higher-margin products. For full-year 2017, Industrial and Recreational revenues were $125.0 million, a 5% increase from $118.9 million for the prior-year period.\nGross profit for the segment was $12.4 million, or 43% of sales, in fourth-quarter 2017, compared with $11.2 million, or 41% of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2016. For full-year 2017, Industrial and Recreational gross profit was $56.0 million, or 45% of sales, compared to $48.8 million, or 41% of sales, in 2016. The Industrial and Recreational segment delivered strong quarterly and year-over-year improvement in gross margin as a result of higher pricing, reductions in operating costs per ton and a continued mix shift toward higher-margin products.\nBalance Sheet and Other Information\nFor full-year 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $144.8 million, which was due to higher operating results offset by a use of cash for working capital. Net cash used in financing activities was $112.6 million, which included debt prepayments of $132.7 million in the second and fourth quarters of 2017 and $13.3 million in costs to refinance the term debt in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures, including stripping costs, were $69.6 million for 2017 and, in addition, the Company made $30.0 million in leasehold interest payments for our Kermit, Texas, mine site during the year. As of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $128.0 million, and total debt was $748.9 million.\nConclusion\nDeckard concluded, “2017 was a year of significant accomplishments for our organization, driven by the excellent work of our team to both commercially capitalize on improving market dynamics and to enhance our capital structure. We are poised to continue this positive momentum in 2018 following the signing of a long-term lease and construction of a Permian Basin sand facility in Kermit and the announcement of our definitive agreement to merge with Unimin Corporation. We look forward to working with Unimin to create a premier provider of proppant and industrial materials solutions, which we believe will be well positioned for long-term success and higher value for our shareholders.”\nUse of Certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before non-cash stock-based compensation, asset impairments, and certain other income or expenses. The Company believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow management to more effectively evaluate our operational performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing costs or capital structure.\nConference Call\nFairmount Santrol will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors today, March 8, 2018, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company's 2017 fourth-quarter and full-year financial results.
