    "text": "PLANO, Texas, March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nQ4 net sales increased 25%; comparable store sales increased 5.7% Q4 EPS of $0.15; pro forma adjusted EPS (1) increased 79% to $0.50 Fiscal 2018 net sales increased 24%; comparable store sales increased 6.5% Fiscal 2018 EPS increased to $0.50; pro forma adjusted EPS (1) increased 59% to $0.94 Fiscal 2019 outlook at the midpoint assumes 22% net sales growth, 144% net income growth and 33% pro forma adjusted net income (1) growth\nAt Home Group Inc. (NYSE: HOME), the home décor superstore, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 27, 2018.\nLee Bird, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"We ended fiscal 2018 on a very strong note, delivering our 15 th consecutive quarter of over 20 percent net sales growth and our 16 th consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales increases. Our full year net sales growth of 24% was propelled by the record performance of our fiscal 2018 class of new stores and a comparable store sales increase of 6.5%. Our merchandising and marketing initiatives, along with the broad appeal of our value price points, continue to resonate with customers. In addition to our top line performance, we invested in our top priorities of marketing and new store growth while driving consistent gross margins and meaningful adjusted operating margin 1 expansion.\nWe expect fiscal 2019 to be another great year for At Home from both a top and bottom line perspective. With the potential to grow to four times our current footprint, we are in the early innings of progress on many long-term opportunities. As we further expand across both new and existing markets, we remain committed to executing on our strategies to increase brand awareness, elevate our in-store experience, and provide customers with fresh, trend-right home décor at a great value.\"\nFor the Thirteen Weeks Ended January 27, 2018\nNet sales increased 25.2% to $293.7 million from $234.5 million in the quarter ended January 28, 2017 driven by the net addition of 26 stores since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and a comparable store sales increase of 5.7%. We expanded our store footprint by opening five new stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. We ended the quarter with 149 stores in 34 states, which represents a 21.1% increase in store count since January 28, 2017. Gross profit increased 31.2% to $99.4 million from $75.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin expanded by 150 basis points to 33.8% from 32.3% in the prior year period as we delivered product margin improvement and leveraged store occupancy costs through higher sales growth. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 included a reduction in product-related costs partially offset by distribution costs associated with inventory investments. Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") increased 30.4% to $58.9 million from $45.2 million in the prior year period primarily due to the net addition of 26 stores, a $2.2 million increase in advertising costs as we continue to grow consumer brand awareness, and a $1.7 million increase in preopening expenses related to the number and timing of new store openings. Adjusted SG&A 1 increased 29.6% to $55.1 million compared to $42.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted SG&A 1 as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 18.7% primarily due to increases in advertising costs, preopening expenses, and incentive compensation that were partially offset by corporate overhead expense leverage. Operating income increased to $36.5 million compared to $29.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 12.4% of net sales as a result of increased advertising costs, preopening expenses, and stock-based compensation costs related to our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), as well as an impairment charge following the resolution of a legal matter. We offset most of these costs through gross margin expansion and corporate overhead expense leverage. Adjusted operating income 1 increased 33.8% to $42.7 million from $31.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expanded adjusted operating margin 1 by 100 basis points to 14.6% of net sales primarily through gross margin expansion and corporate overhead expense leverage that were partially offset by increased advertising costs and preopening expenses. Interest expense increased to $5.8 million from $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to increased borrowings in fiscal 2018 to support our growth strategies. Income tax expense was $20.8 million compared to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. A revaluation of net deferred tax assets related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), partially offset by excess tax benefits recognized from adopting new accounting guidance for the treatment of stock-based compensation (\"ASU 2016-09\"), increased our effective tax rate to 67.9% from 36.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Net income was $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which included non-cash charges of $16.7 million in tax expense triggered by the Tax Act and a $2.4 million pre-tax impairment. Net income was $15.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Pro forma adjusted net income 1 grew 85.6% to $32.3 million from $17.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. EPS was $0.15 compared to $0.25 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Pro forma adjusted EPS 1 grew 78.6% to $0.50 from $0.28 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. As a result of the implementation of ASU 2016-09, exercises of stock-based awards triggered excess tax benefits of $5.7 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Net of payroll taxes incurred, exercises contributed $5.6 million to net income, $7.0 million to pro forma adjusted net income 1 , $0.09 to EPS, and $0.11 to pro forma adjusted EPS 1 . Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 35.6% to $58.1 million from $42.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended January 27, 2018\nNet sales increased 24.1% to $950.5 million from $765.6 million in fiscal 2017 driven by the net addition of 26 stores and a comparable store sales increase of 6.5%. Gross profit increased 24.0% to $307.0 million in fiscal 2018 from $247.5 million in fiscal 2017. Gross margin of 32.3% was consistent in both fiscal years. In fiscal 2018, we delivered product margin improvement and leveraged store occupancy costs through higher sales growth. These improvements offset increases in distribution costs associated with inventory investments and occupancy costs resulting from third quarter fiscal 2017 and 2018 sale-leaseback transactions. SG&A increased 23.7% to $211.1 million from $170.6 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the net addition of 26 stores as well as increased advertising costs, IPO-related stock-based compensation costs, and preopening expenses. Adjusted SG&A 1 increased 20.6% to $198.3 million compared to $164.4 million in fiscal 2017. We improved adjusted SG&A 1 as a percentage of net sales by 60 basis points to 20.9% primarily through leverage of labor and corporate overhead expenses that was partially offset by increased advertising costs and preopening expenses. Operating income increased to $87.4 million compared to $72.7 million in fiscal 2017. Operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 9.2% of net sales as a result of increased advertising costs, preopening expenses, and IPO-related stock-based compensation costs, as well as an impairment charge following the resolution of a legal matter. We partially offset these costs through leverage of labor and corporate overhead expenses. Adjusted operating income 1 increased 30.1% to $102.5 million from $78.8 million in fiscal 2017. We expanded adjusted operating margin 1 by 50 basis points to 10.8% of net sales through leverage of labor and corporate overhead expenses that was partially offset by increased advertising costs and preopening expenses. Interest expense improved to $21.7 million from $27.2 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the repayment in full of our $130.0 million second lien term loan in fiscal 2017 utilizing net proceeds from our IPO that was partially offset by increased borrowings in fiscal 2018 to support our growth strategies. Income tax expense was $33.8 million compared to $15.7 million in fiscal 2017. A revaluation of deferred tax assets related to the Tax Act, partially offset by excess tax benefits recognized from adopting ASU 2016-09, increased our effective tax rate to 51.5% from 36.7% in fiscal 2017. Net income was $31.8 million in fiscal 2018, which included non-cash charges of $16.7 million in tax expense triggered by the Tax Act and a $2.4 million pre-tax impairment. Net income was $27.1 million in fiscal 2017. Pro forma adjusted net income 1 grew 64.0% to $59.8 million in fiscal 2018 from $36.5 million in fiscal 2017. EPS increased to $0.50 from $0.48 in fiscal 2017. Pro forma adjusted EPS 1 increased by 59.3% to $0.94 in fiscal 2018 compared to $0.59 in fiscal 2017. As a result of the implementation of ASU 2016-09, exercises of stock-based awards triggered excess tax benefits of $5.8 million during fiscal 2018. Net of payroll taxes incurred, exercises contributed $5.6 million to net income, $7.0 million to pro forma adjusted net income 1 , $0.09 to EPS, and $0.11 to pro forma adjusted EPS 1 . Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 27.3% to $160.8 million from $126.3 million in fiscal 2017.\nBalance Sheet Highlights as of January 27, 2018\nNet inventories increased 10.7% to $269.8 million compared to $243.8 million as of January 28, 2017, primarily due to a 21.1% increase in the number of open stores. Total liquidity (cash plus $77.8 million of availability under our revolving credit facility (\"ABL Facility\")) was $86.3 million. Total debt was $299.5 million compared to $310.2 million as of January 28, 2017. There was $162.0 million outstanding under the ABL Facility as of January 27, 2018.\nSubsequent Events\nIn February 2018, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction pursuant to which we sold four properties for a total of $50.3 million and contemporaneously leased them back for cumulative initial annual rent of $3.4 million, subject to annual escalations.\nOutlook & Key Assumptions\nChief Financial Officer Judd Nystrom stated: \"We look forward to delivering another strong year of growth and progress on our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2019. Our outlook assumes net sales growth of 21% to 22%, pro forma adjusted net income growth of 30% to 36%, and a 20% effective tax rate driven by the recent changes to tax legislation and the accounting treatment for stock-based compensation. We expect that direct sourcing benefits, coupled with the fixed cost leverage inherent in our high-growth financial model, will enable us to invest in the future of our business through lower prices, incremental store labor, enhanced marketing programs, the largest planned new store class in our history, and a second distribution center to support our long-term plans.\" Below is an overview of our outlook and related assumptions for selected first quarter and fiscal year 2019 financial data.\nFor fiscal 2019, we expect:\nNet sales of $1.154 billion to $1.161 billion, representing annual growth of 21 to 22%, based on 35 gross and 31 net new store openings and an assumed comparable store sales increase of 2.5% to 3.5%, which would represent a 9.0% to 10.0% increase on a two-year comparable store sales basis. Slight adjusted operating margin 1, 2 expansion driven by gross margin improvement Interest expense of approximately $25 million. An effective tax rate of 20%, which includes an estimated 400 basis point rate benefit related to changes in the accounting for stock-based compensation.

Net capital expenditures of $170 million to $190 million, net of approximately $110 million of assumed sale-leaseback proceeds.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect:\nNet sales of $254 million to $257 million based on 9 gross and 7 net new store openings and an assumed comparable store sales increase of 1.5% to 2.0%, which would represent an 7.3% to 7.8% increase on a two-year comparable store sales basis. Modest gross margin contraction due to increased occupancy costs as a result of sale-leaseback transactions. Interest expense of $5.6 million. An effective tax rate of 16.5%, which includes an estimated 750 basis point rate benefit related to changes in the accounting for stock-based compensation.

We present Adjusted EBITDA and Store-level Adjusted EBITDA, which are not recognized financial measures under GAAP, because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, such as interest, depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and taxes. We present adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income, Adjusted Net Income, pro forma adjusted net income, pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding and pro forma adjusted EPS, which are not recognized financial measures under GAAP, because we believe investors' understanding of our operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of selling, general and administrative expenses, operating income, net income, diluted weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per diluted share adjusted for nonrecurring charges associated with events such as our IPO and refinancing transactions.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. In particular, Store-level Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect costs associated with new store openings, which are incurred on a limited basis with respect to any particular store when opened and are not indicative of ongoing core operating performance, and corporate overhead expenses that are necessary to allow us to effectively operate our stores and generate Store-level Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures in the future, and any such modification may be material. In addition, comparable store sales, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income, Adjusted Net Income, pro forma adjusted net income, pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding, pro forma adjusted EPS and Store-level Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nComparable store sales, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income, Adjusted Net Income, pro forma adjusted net income, pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding, pro forma adjusted EPS and Store-level Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using comparable store sales, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income, Adjusted Net Income, pro forma adjusted net income, pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding, pro forma adjusted EPS and Store-level Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information.\nAT HOME GROUP INC.\nSupplemental Information - Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThe tables below reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income, Adjusted Net Income, pro forma adjusted net income, pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding, pro forma adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Store-level Adjusted EBITDA to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliation of selling, general and administrative expenses as reported to adjusted SG&A\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 27, 2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nJanuary 27, 2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as reported\n$\n58,898\n$\n45,157\n$\n211,057\n$\n170,556\nAdjustments:\nStock-based compensation related to special one-time IPO bonus grant (a)\n(3,117)\n(2,610)\n(11,273)\n(5,318)\nTransaction costs (b)\n(726)\n(72)\n(1,450)\n(797)\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n55,055\n$\n42,475\n$\n198,334\n$\n164,441\nReconciliation of operating income as reported to adjusted operating income\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 27, 2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nJanuary 27, 2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nOperating income as reported\n$\n36,470\n$\n29,266\n$\n87,361\n$\n72,677\nAdjustments:\nImpairment charges\n2,422\n—\n2,422\n—\nStock-based compensation related to special one-time IPO bonus grant (a)\n3,117\n2,610\n11,273\n5,318\nTransaction costs (b)\n726\n72\n1,450\n797\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n42,735\n$\n31,948\n$\n102,506\n$\n78,792\nAdjusted operating margin\n14.6%\n13.6%\n10.8%\n10.3%\nReconciliation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding as reported to pro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 27, 2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nJanuary 27, 2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding\n65,042,226\n61,670,379\n63,712,003\n56,892,183\nAdjustment for issuance of shares at IPO (c)\n—\n—\n—\n4,952,731\nPro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding\n65,042,226\n61,670,379\n63,712,003\n61,844,914\nReconciliation of net income as reported to pro forma adjusted net income\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 27, 2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nJanuary 27, 2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nNet income\n$\n9,855\n$\n15,258\n$\n31,812\n$\n27,066\nAdjustments:\nImpairment charges\n2,422\n—\n2,422\n—\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n—\n2,715\nLoss on modification of debt (d)\n—\n—\n179\n—\nStock-based compensation related to special one-time IPO bonus grant (a)\n3,117\n2,610\n11,273\n5,318\nTransaction costs (b)\n726\n72\n1,450\n797\nTax impact of adjustments to net income (e)\n(847)\n(975)\n(4,003)\n(3,244)\nDeferred tax impact related to Tax Act (f)\n16,694\n—\n16,694\n—\nAdjusted Net Income\n31,967\n16,965\n59,827\n32,652\nAdjustments for comparability between periods:\nInterest on Second Lien Term Loan (g)\n—\n—\n—\n6,054\nTax impact of adjustments to Adjusted Net Income (e)\n—\n—\n—\n(2,224)\nTax rate adjustments (h)\n350\n446\n—\n—\nPro forma adjusted net income\n$\n32,317\n$\n17,411\n$\n59,827\n$\n36,482\nPro forma diluted weighted average shares outstanding\n65,042,226\n61,670,379\n63,712,003\n61,844,914\nPro forma adjusted EPS\n$\n0.50\n$\n0.28\n$\n0.94\n$\n0.59\n(a)\nNon-cash stock-based compensation associated with a special one-time initial public offering bonus grant to senior executives, which we do not consider in our evaluation of our ongoing performance.
