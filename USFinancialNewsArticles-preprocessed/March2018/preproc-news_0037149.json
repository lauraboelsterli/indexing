    "text": "Following news of a massive data scandal involving more than 50 million Facebook users, Mark Zuckerberg is likely having a very bad day.\nThe Facebook’s co-founder and CEO lost $6.06 billion in stock value, according to CNBC , when reports that Cambridge Analytica, a firm hired by Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, improperly used the social network’s user data.\nThe 33-year-old may not consider himself too scathed as a result of the loss — he and his affiliated organizations still own approximately 403 million shares of Facebook stock worth around $68.5 billion, an Equilar research director told CNBC. Zuckerberg remains fourth on Bloomberg’s Billionaire’s Index and sixth on a similar list by Forbes.\nBut Facebook as a whole has still taken a financial hit as a result of the reports, losing $35 billion in market value, Fortune reported earlier Monday. The company’s shares dropped by 6% for a market capitalization of roughly $502.6 billion.\nOn Friday, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and its parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories from the platform. Facebook says that contrary to reports, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” and that “no systems were infiltrated.” Zuckerberg has yet to personally address the reports.",
