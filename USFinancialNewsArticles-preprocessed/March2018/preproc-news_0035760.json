    "text": "March 20, 2018 / 1:13 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago India, U.S. to bilaterally discuss steel import curbs - minister Reuters Staff 1 Min Read NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will bilaterally discuss import curbs on steel with the United States, Trade Minister Suresh Prabhu said on Tuesday, amidst growing concerns of an escalating trade war over tariffs. FILE PHOTO: A worker rides his bicycle past steel rims in a dockyard at Mumbai Port Trust in Mumbai November 17, 2014. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/File Photo Prabhu told reporters that the U.S was committed to the World Trade Organisation, even as Washington has raised concerns about the functioning of the WTO and asked for reforms. U.S. President Donald Trump has pressed ahead with import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent for aluminium, but exempted Canada and Mexico and offered the possibility of excluding other allies, backtracking from an earlier “no-exceptions” stance.
