    "text": "NEW YORK, March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Paradigm Spine, LLC, a leader in providing motion preservation solutions for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis, today announced that it has substantially expanded its leadership team with the appointments of Francis Magee, DVM as Chief Technology Officer, Charlie Gilbride as EVP, Sales & Marketing, Tim Hein as Vice President, Sales, and Lisa Denison as Vice President of Marketing. Dr. Magee will lead the product and technology development strategy and execution while Mr. Gilbride, Mr. Hein and Ms. Denison will lead the marketing and sales initiatives to drive increased U.S. adoption and use of lead product coflex 速 Interlaminar Stabilization 速 , the only posterior lumbar motion preservation solution with proven long-term outcomes for durable pain relief and stability for patients with moderate to severe spinal stenosis.\n\"With published datasets of long-term Level 1 evidence from two prospective, randomized, controlled clinical studies, comparing coflex versus decompression plus fusion and more recently coflex versus decompression alone, we have entered a major inflection point for the company where we can conclusively show that coflex demonstrates composite clinical success for patients with spinal stenosis,\" said Marc Viscogliosi, Chairman and CEO of Paradigm Spine. \"Based on this, and the recent NASS Coverage Recommendation for coflex for interlaminar stabilization, it becomes of paramount importance to strengthen both our technology development and sales and marketing teams to help educate surgeons, practices, patients, their families and the broader spine community on coflex as the motion-preserving lumbar option. We welcome these highly experienced members to our team and look forward to their results-driven strategies to increase awareness of coflex among our key audiences and enable market access for even more patients.\"\nDr. Magee has 25 years of experience working exclusively to develop devices in orthopedics and spine. He has managed the successful commercialization of many Class 2 and Class 3 products in the U.S. and OUS, and was responsible for all functional areas, including design, development, regulatory, surgeon training and manufacturing. Previously, he served as the Chief Technology Officer for Orthologic, Spine Solutions and Synthes Spine, as well as the Head of Experimental Surgery at the Harrington Arthritis Research Center.\nMr. Gilbride has more than 20 years of experience in medical device sales, marketing and reimbursement, most recently as the Vice President of U.S. Product Marketing for LDR Spine (acquired by Zimmer Biomet Spine). Previously, he held positions in the spine industry in both venture capital funded start-ups and mid-sized public companies. Mr. Gilbride earned his B.S. in Biology from Boston College and his MBA from The Wharton School.\nMr. Hein has been in the medical device industry for 20 years, with leadership experience in creating high performing sales teams specialized in high growth with innovative product lines. Previously, he held positions at Zimmer Biomet Spine, LDR Spine, Medtronic, DePuy Spine, and Ethicon Endo-Surgery. Mr. Hein earned his B.S. in Engineering from the United States Military Academy at West Point and his MBA from Pacific Lutheran University.\nMs. Denison has worked in orthopedic and spine marketing and medical education for more than 20 years, including 14 years dedicated to implantable spinal devices. Prior experience includes positions at Sulzer Orthopedics, Abbott Spine, and LDR Spine, serving as the marketing lead on more than eight U.S. and four international medical device commercializations, four of which involved class III devices that underwent full IDE clinical trial and PMA processes. Ms. Denison earned her B.S. in Kinesiology/Biology from the University of North Texas and her MBA from Baylor University.\nAbout Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS)\nLumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), affecting 1.6 million patients annually in the United States, is a debilitating and degenerative disease often associated with significant leg and back pain, leg numbness and weakness, and significant reduction in an active lifestyle. Historically, the two traditional surgical treatment options for LSS included decompression alone or decompression with lumbar fusion. Decompression alone has proven effective at relieving pain symptoms caused by lumbar spinal stenosis, however, patients may not experience long term symptomatic relief, resulting in subsequent epidural injections for pain management, or additional surgeries for conversion to a fusion. Decompression with fusion has proven to provide pain relief and stabilize the diseased segment, but may lead to adjacent level disease requiring subsequent surgeries.\nAbout Paradigm Spine, LLC:\nParadigm Spine, LLC, founded in 2004, is a privately held company and remains focused on the design and development of solutions for the disease management of spinal stenosis. The Company's signature product is the coflex 速 Interlaminar Stabilization 速 device, which is currently used in over 50 countries worldwide. coflex is the only lumbar spinal device that has produced Level I evidence in two separate prospective, randomized, controlled studies against two different control groups, changing the standard of care for lumbar spinal stenosis treatment.
