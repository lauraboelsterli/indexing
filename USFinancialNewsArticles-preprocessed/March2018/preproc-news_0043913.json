    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Germany has approved the construction and operation of the Russia-built Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, its operator and the German maritime authority said on Tuesday.\nThe Nord Stream 2 operator said it expected that other four countries along the route of the undersea gas pipeline – Russia, Finland, Sweden and Denmark – will issue permits in the coming months.\nThe “scheduled construction works are to be implemented in 2018 as planned” it added.\nGermany’s maritime authority BSH said in a statement on Tuesday that it had approved the building of the 31-kilometre section that runs through its waters since it posed no danger to shipping or the environment.”\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin and Thomas Escritt in BERLIN, editing by Louise Heavens\n ",
