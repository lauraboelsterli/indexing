The agency is seeking input on what that level should be and guidance on whether to implement that new standard all at once or gradually.\nGottlieb said the FDA wants to transition smokers to \" modified risk tobacco products \" — which are said to pose lower health risks — or have them quit altogether.\n\"It's really the first step in the rule-making process to try to pursue regulations that will ultimately lead to a reduction in nicotine levels in cigarettes,\" Gottlieb said Friday.\nIn 2016, more than 2 million U.S. middle and high school students used e-cigarettes over a 30 day period, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The CDC cautions that nicotine exposure can harm adolescents' brain development, which can continue into their 20s.\nGottlieb, who previously served as a senior policy advisor for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President George W. Bush , said if adults want access to nicotine, the preferred route from the agency is through medicinal products.\n\"We're taking a lot of steps try to increase the pathway towards medicinal nicotine products, like a patch or a gum,\" Gottlieb said.\nLast year, the FDA announced a plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation , to the surprise of some tobacco companies, with the goal of encouraging the development of new products that are less dangerous than cigarettes.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
