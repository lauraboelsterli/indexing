    "text": "SAN LEANDRO, Calif., March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Recovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: ERII), the leader in pressure energy technology for industrial fluid flows, today announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the company to purchase up to $10 million of the company's outstanding common stock.\nEnergy Recovery's President and CEO Chris Gannon stated, \"Our business performed exceedingly well in 2017, generating positive cash flow to add to our already strong balance sheet. We view implementing a share buyback as the most advantageous method at present to return cash to our shareholders and drive future returns.\"\nUnder the newly authorized repurchase program, purchases of shares of common stock may be made from time to time in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions, in compliance with applicable state and federal securities laws. The timing and amounts of any purchases will be based on market conditions and other factors including price, regulatory requirements, and capital availability. The share buyback program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares in any period, and may be expanded, extended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nPayment for shares repurchased under the program will be funded using the Company's cash on hand.\nAbout Energy Recovery\nEnergy Recovery, Inc.
