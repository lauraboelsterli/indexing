(NASDASQ: INNT), Geron Corporation (NASDASQ: GERN), Leap Therapeutics, Inc.

This factor led to self-regulation causing an increase in M&A and drug approvals.\nSome interesting biotechnology companies to take a look at include: Propanc Biopharma Inc. (OTCQB: PPCB), Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDASQ: INNT), Geron Corporation ( NASDASQ: GERN), Leap Therapeutics, Inc.
