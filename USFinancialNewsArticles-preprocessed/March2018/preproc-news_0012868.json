    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pacific Ethanol, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEIX), a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels and high-quality alcohol products in the United States, announced its agreement with Airgas USA, LLC, an Air Liquide company, and the leading U.S. supplier of industrial gases, welding technologies, and safety products, to sell CO2 from the Pacific Ethanol Stockton plant located in Stockton, CA. Airgas plans to construct a liquid CO2 production plant adjacent to the Stockton facility.\nNeil Koehler, Pacific Ethanol's president and CEO, said: \"The opportunity to utilize the CO2 from our ethanol production process as another co-product for sale further diversifies our revenues and improves Pacific Ethanol's profitability. We anticipate Airgas’s new CO2 processing plant in Stockton to begin operations by the end of 2018 and to contribute at least $1.0 million a year in operating income.\"\nAbout Pacific Ethanol, Inc.\nPacific Ethanol, Inc.
