    "text": "SAN ANTONIO, March 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rush Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:RUSHA) (Nasdaq:RUSHB), which operates the largest network of commercial vehicle dealerships in North America, today announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase of $35 million to its existing stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $75 million of its shares of Class A common stock, $.01 par value per share, and/or Class B common stock, $.01 par value per share. This increase follows the Company nearing the original authorization limit of $40 million. “We see further opportunities to enhance shareholder value through this $35 million increase to our stock repurchase program, which reflects our continued confidence in the Company’s strategic plan and future growth opportunities,” said W.M. “Rusty” Rush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company.\nRepurchases will be made at times and in amounts as the Company deems appropriate and may be made through open market transactions at prevailing market prices, privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The actual timing, number and value of repurchases under the new stock repurchase program will be determined by management in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, stock price and other factors, including those related to the ownership requirements of its dealership agreements with Peterbilt. The stock repurchase program expires on November 29, 2018, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nAbout Rush Enterprises, Inc.\nRush Enterprises, Inc. is the premier solutions provider to the commercial vehicle industry.
