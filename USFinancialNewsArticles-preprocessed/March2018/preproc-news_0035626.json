    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 9:06 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Kroger's Fred Meyer plans to phase out firearms business Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - Kroger Co’s ( KR.N ) Fred Meyer said it would exit its firearms business, two weeks after deciding to stop selling guns and ammunition to buyers under the age of 21. FILE PHOTO: A logo of Kroger is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Earlier this month, Kroger joined other U.S. retailers such as Walmart Inc ( WMT.N ) and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc ( DKS.N ) to bar sale of firearms to buyers under 21, following a deadly shooting at a Florida high school. Fred Meyer said it was working on plans to phase out sales of firearms and ammunition. The firearm business generated about $7 million annually, the company said, also highlighting “softening consumer demand”. The company operates 133 stores in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington and sells firearms in 43 of them. Reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila",
