    "text": "The California Supreme Court on Monday set out a method for calculating state law overtime rates for workers who get flat-sum bonuses that is more favorable to employees than the formula under federal law.\nIn its unanimous decision reviving a proposed class action against Dart Container Corp of California, the high court said a flat-sum bonus should be divided by the total number of non-overtime hours worked when calculating pay rates to insure the overtime rate reflects all forms of regular compensation. Federal law divides such bonuses by the total hours worked.\nTo read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/2FtjfPm\n ",
