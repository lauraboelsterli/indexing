    "text": "* NSE index down 0.49 pct, BSE index 0.50 pct lower\n* Private-sector lenders ICICI Bank, Axis Bank fall\n* Volatility seen ahead of derivatives contracts expiry\nBy Jessica Kuruthukulangara\nMarch 28 (Reuters) - Indian shares slipped on Wednesday, dragged down by private-sector lenders such as ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd, with risk appetite hurt by a fall in global equities.\nAsian shares outside Japan fell more than 1 percent after Wall Street retreated overnight.\nIndian stocks are expected to have a volatile session, ahead of the expiry of derivatives contracts and an extended holiday.\n“Towards the close, we may see some buying coming in as today is the last day for the financial year,” said Krish Subramanyam, co-head and equity adviser at Altamount Capital, adding that the market is expected to stage a recovery in April.\nThe broader NSE index was down 0.49 percent at 10,134.25 as of 0600 GMT, but was still on track to post a weekly gain of 1.26 percent.\nThe benchmark BSE index was 0.50 percent lower at 33,007.07, but was also set to post a weekly gain of 1.23 percent.\nThe indexes were on track to post a monthly loss of about 3.5 percent, their steepest drop for the month of March since 2015.\nICICI Bank and Axis Bank slipped as much as 2 percent, after gaining in the last two sessions.\nThe Nifty private bank index fell as much as 0.8 percent, on track to snap a two-day gaining streak.\nShares of IDBI Bank Ltd fell as much as 3.5 percent after the lender disclosed fraudulent loan disbursals to the tune of 7.72 billion rupees ($118.7 million).\nPersistent Systems Ltd slid as much as 9.9 percent to its lowest in nearly two months after the software services provider forecast weak fourth-quarter revenue.\nIndian markets will remain closed on Thursday and Friday on account of public holidays.
