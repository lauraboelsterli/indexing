(NYSE:TDW) announced today a net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 (Successor), of $23.6 million, or $1.02 per common share, on revenues of $104.5 million. For the five month period from August 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 (Successor), the net loss was $39.3 million, or $1.82 per common share, on revenues of $178.8 million.\nAs more fully explained in the company's Form 10-K for the nine month transition period ended December 31, 2017, upon emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 31, 2017, the company adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with applicable accounting and reporting regulations, which resulted in the company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes on July 31, 2017. References herein to \"Successor\" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized company subsequent to July 31, 2017, while references to \"Predecessor\" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the company through July 31, 2017.\nIncluded in the $23.6 million ($1.02 per common share) net loss for the three months ending December 31, 2017 (Successor) were the following:\n$16.8 million ($0.72 per common share) in non-cash asset impairment charges that resulted from impairment reviews undertaken during the three months ended December 31, 2017. $2.4 million ($0.10 per common share) of reorganization items related to the company's Chapter 11 proceedings.\nIncluded in the $39.3 million ($1.82 per common share) net loss for the five month period from August 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 (Successor) were the following:\n$16.8 million ($0.78 per share) in non-cash asset impairment charges that resulted from impairment reviews undertaken during the five month period ended December 31, 2017. $4.3 million ($0.20 per share) of reorganization items related to the company's Chapter 11 proceedings.\nConsolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 (Successor), which excludes reorganization items and asset impairment charges, but includes $2.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, was $13.3 million. EBITDA for the five month period from August 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 (Successor), which excludes reorganization items and asset impairment charges, but includes $3.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.2 million of vessel operating lease expense for vessels returned to their respective owners in connection with the company's Plan of Reorganization, was $17.7 million. (See disclosures related to Non-GAAP measures in other fleet and financial data beginning on page 13 herein.)\nJohn Rynd, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tidewater stated, \"The extended weakness in the offshore supply vessel market continued to be reflected in our fourth quarter financial results. While improvements in oil prices are encouraging, our customers have not yet committed to a meaningful increase in offshore exploration and development spending. As we continue to navigate a market that we expect to remain challenging in 2018, the management team remains focused on executing its post-restructuring business plan, including additional cost reductions, a targeted rationalization of the owned fleet, preserving a low-leverage balance sheet and maintaining a strong liquidity position.\"\nTom Bates, Chairman of the Board of Directors, added, \"I would like to again thank Larry Rigdon for his leadership of the business during his tenure as interim President and Chief Executive Officer. Significant progress has been made in achieving the company's near-term objective of reaching a cash flow breakeven. John, Larry and I look forward to working with our fellow directors on behalf of all Tidewater stakeholders.\"\nTidewater will hold a conference call to discuss results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 on Thursday, March 15, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time.

Offsetting these reorganization charges is a gain on settlement of liabilities subject to compromise of $767.6 million.\nFor the following tables for illustrative purposes, the company has combined the Successor and Predecessor results to derive combined results for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The combination was generated by addition of comparable financial statement line items. However, because of various adjustments to the consolidated financial statements in connection with the application of fresh-start reporting, including asset valuation adjustments and liability adjustments, the results of operations for the Successor may not be comparable to those of the Predecessor.\nTIDEWATER INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS (LOSS) – QUARTERLY DATA\n(Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\nRevenues:\nVessel revenues\n$\n101,313\n104,911\n112,257\n156,905\n125,120\nOther operating revenues\n3,140\n5,652\n2,849\n3,844\n4,095\n104,453\n110,563\n115,106\n160,749\n129,215\nCosts and expenses:\nVessel operating costs\n68,201\n84,966\n83,773\n80,845\n82,358\nCosts of other operating revenues\n1,519\n3,036\n1,585\n2,689\n2,714\nGeneral and administrative (M)\n30,373\n25,019\n33,059\n41,727\n34,151\nVessel operating leases\n91\n1,747\n5,542\n8,443\n8,441\nDepreciation and amortization\n12,195\n19,302\n36,287\n37,592\n41,302\nGain on asset dispositions, net\n(6,612)\n(376)\n(3,189)\n(6,064)\n(6,139)\nAsset impairments\n16,777\n21,325\n163,423\n64,857\n253,422\n122,544\n155,019\n320,480\n230,089\n416,249\nOperating loss\n(18,091)\n(44,456)\n(205,374)\n(69,340)\n(287,034)\nOther income (expenses):\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\n(349)\n(2,082)\n(1,157)\n664\n2,970\nEquity in net earnings of unconsolidated\ncompanies\n825\n1,574\n4,517\n2,841\n1,557\nInterest income and other\n1,898\n1,577\n1,680\n1,588\n1,437\nReorganization items (M)\n(2,419)\n(1,085,609)\n(313,176)\n—\n—\nInterest and other debt costs\n(7,769)\n(5,814)\n(10,605)\n(21,008)\n(18,587)\n(7,814)\n(1,090,354)\n(318,741)\n(15,915)\n(12,623)\nLoss before income taxes\n(25,905)\n(1,134,810)\n(524,115)\n(85,255)\n(299,657)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(2,706)\n3,216\n295\n1,717\n(2,884)\nNet loss\n$\n(23,199)\n(1,138,026)\n(524,410)\n(86,972)\n(296,773)\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests\n374\n142\n24\n7,883\n903\nNet loss attributable to Tidewater Inc.\n$\n(23,573)\n(1,138,168)\n(524,434)\n(94,855)\n(297,676)\nBasic loss per common share\n$\n(1.02)\n—\n—\n—\n—\nDiluted loss per common share\n$\n(1.02)\n—\n—\n—\n—\nWeighted average common shares outstanding (N)\n23,137,909\n—\n—\n—\n—\nDilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nAdjusted weighted average common shares\n23,137,909\n—\n—\n—\n—\nVessel operating margin\n$\n33,112\n19,945\n28,484\n76,060\n42,762\nNote (M): Restructuring-related items:\nRestructuring-related professional services\ncosts included in general and administrative\nexpenses\n$\n—\n—\n6,709\n16,805\n5,188\nRestructuring-related professional services\ncosts included in reorganization items\n2,031\n23,494\n5,165\n—\n—\nRestructuring-related sale leaseback vessel\nredelivery costs included in reorganization\nitems\n388\n1,244\n—\n—\n—\nTotal\n$\n2,419\n24,738\n11,874\n16,805\n5,188\nNote (N): Weighted average shares outstanding include 924,125 shares issuable upon the exercise of Jones Act-related New Creditor Warrants held by U.S. citizens.

Restructuring-related professional services and sale leaseback redelivery costs have been separately presented in the above table. Restructuring-related professional services costs incurred prior to May 17, 2017 were included in general and administrative expenses and such costs incurred subsequent to May 17, 2017 were included in reorganization items in the company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss).\nNote (AA): Consolidated EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017, March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016 includes non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $2,558, $2,554, $326, $(888), and $1,538, respectively.\nNote (AB): Consolidated EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017, March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 includes vessel operating lease expense of $91, $1,747, $5,542, $8,443, and $8,441, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe disclose and discuss EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure in our public releases, including quarterly earnings releases, investor conference calls and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We define EBITDA as earnings (net income) before interest and other debt costs, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, reorganization items, asset impairments, and restructuring-related professional services costs included in general and administrative expenses. Our measure of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nWe view EBITDA both as a performance and liquidity measure and, as such, we believe that the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to it are net income and net cash provided (used) in operating activities, respectively. Because EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or loss, cash provided (used) in operating activities, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA is widely used by investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental financial measure that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe EBITDA provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ability to service debt, pay taxes and fund drydocking and survey costs and capital expenditures. We also believe the disclosure of EBITDA helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our cash flow generating capacity from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nEBITDA is also a financial metric used by management (i) as a supplemental internal measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; (ii) to compare to the EBITDA of other companies when evaluating potential acquisitions; and (iii) to assess our ability to service existing fixed charges and incur additional indebtedness.\nFor illustrative purposes, the company has combined the Successor and Predecessor results to derive combined results for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The combination was generated by addition of comparable financial statement line items. However, because of various adjustments to the consolidated financial statements in connection with the application of fresh-start reporting, including asset valuation adjustments and liability adjustments, the results of operations for the Successor may not be comparable to those of the Predecessor.\nLogo - http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/563905/Tidewater_Inc_Logo.jpg\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tidewater-reports-results-for-the-three-months-ended-december-31-2017-and-the-nine-month-transition-period-from-april-1-2017-through-december-31-2017-300614260.html\nSOURCE Tidewater Inc.",
