    "text": "HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Plastec Technologies, Ltd. - (OTCBB:PLTYF), (the “Company”) , today reported audited financial results for the fiscal 2017 year ended December 31, 2017. See financial tables at the end of this release in Hong Kong dollars (HKD). All other amounts in this press release are presented in U.S. dollars (USD) with conversion rates of US$1.0: HK$7.8 and US$1.0: RMB6.3, respectively.\n2016 Sale of Assets\nThe Company’s financial results reflect the closing of the October 11, 2016 Share Transfer Agreement (“Agreement”) with Shanghai Yongli Belting Co., Ltd. (“SYB”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Shanghai Yongjing Investment Management Co., Ltd. As a result, the Company no longer owns Plastec International Holdings Limited (“Plastec”) or its integrated plastic manufacturing operations, all being disposed of to SYB.\nSince closing of the divestiture transaction, the Company, as a holding company, has been focused on:\ncompleting the construction of its manufacturing plant in Kai Ping, China, which is at the final stage and intended to be disposed of to SYB in the near future prior to its official operation at a price equivalent to the capital used for its construction, subject to terms and specifics to be agreed and finalized upon by the parties concerned; collecting rental income from certain property it owns and that is being leased to one of Plastec’s subsidiaries; collecting any payments it may receive upon Plastec achieving the performance target for the year ended December 31, 2018 of HK195,408,000, or USD $25,052,308; and exploring any investment opportunities arising.\nImpact of Sale of Assets on the Company’s Latest Financial Statements\nThe disposal of Plastec represents a strategic shift and has a major effect on the Company’s results of operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and cash flows related to the disposed business lines have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015, the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect this strategic shift.\nConfirmation of Plastec’s Achievement of Performance Target for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nSYB has confirmed and acknowledged that Plastec’s audited net profit (on a consolidated basis, after deducting noncurrent gains and losses) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was HK$183,124,000, which is in excess of the performance target for the year ended December 31, 2017, set at HK$177,088,000 in the Agreement, by HK$6,036,000, or approximately 3.4%.\nAccordingly, the Company shall be paid a further sum of RMB124,380,000, or approximately $19,742,857, in due course and in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.\nCurrent Balance Sheet Highlights\n$71.7 million in working capital at December 31, 2017, compared to $78.3 million at December 31, 2016. Book value per share was $7.62 at December 31, 2017, compared to $7.75 at December 31, 2016.\nDeclaration of Final 2017 Cash Dividend to Shareholders\nThe Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a final 2017 cash dividend for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 of US$1.50 per ordinary share. The dividend will be payable on or about April 19, 2018 to shareholders of record as of April 12, 2018.\nIncluding this final cash dividend for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company has distributed approximately US$12.80 per ordinary share in dividends in aggregate as a measure of rewarding shareholders for their continued support since 2014.\nManagement Comments\nMr. Kin Sun Sze-To, Chairman of the Company, stated, “We continue to evaluate potential opportunities to leverage our strong capital position while also rewarding our shareholders as we unwind the legacy business. We are pleased to announce a final 2017 cash dividend for fiscal 2017, which is well justified by the achievement of the performance target by the disposed line of business for the same period.”\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results.
