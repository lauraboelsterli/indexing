    "text": "NOT FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES OR FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES\nHALIFAX, Nova Scotia, March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOVA LEAP HEALTH CORP. (TSXV:NLH) (\"Nova Leap\" or “the Company”), is pleased to announce that it has executed a definitive agreement (“the Agreement”) to acquire a home care services company (“the Target”) located in New England. The Target reported unaudited revenues of approximately $1.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $0.315 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts are in United States dollars (“USD”) unless otherwise specified.\nThe acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive. Upon closing of the acquisition, which is targeted for early in the second quarter of calendar 2018, Nova Leap’s annual revenue run rate is expected to approach $9 million, an approximate 28% increase over current revenue run rate. Upon closing, Nova Leap is expected to approach 352,000 annualized recurring home care service hours, an approximate 25% increase from current levels.\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the acquisition is to be made for total consideration of $1.2 million of which $1.0 million is payable with cash on closing and $0.2 million is by way of a promissory note repayable over a two-year period. Closing the acquisition will be subject to financing, final due diligence and TSX Venture Exchange approval. The Company expects to raise a combination of debt and equity to fund the transaction.\n“We feel fortunate that we continue to attract very good opportunities in an area we want to support,” said Chris Dobbin, President & CEO of Nova Leap. “This will be our second acquisition in New England this year and we expect to be profitable on a consolidated basis beginning in Q4 2018. We’ve come a long way in a short period of time, but we benefit from working with wonderful people throughout the region.”\nAbout Nova Leap\nThe Home Care Providers industry is becoming one of the fastest growing healthcare industries in Canada and the United States. Home care saves patients billions of dollars every year by treating them in their own homes instead of in hospitals. An aging population, the prevalence of chronic disease, growing physician acceptance of home care, medical advancements and a movement toward cost-efficient treatment options from public and private payers have all fostered industry growth. Nova Leap is focused on a highly fragmented market of small privately-held companies providing patients one on one care in their homes. Nova Leap's post-acquisition organic growth strategy is to increase annual revenue per location through a combination of increased employee investment, including training, focused sales and marketing efforts, billing rate increases, expansion of geographical coverage, and improved referral sources.\nFORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION:\nCertain information in this press release may contain forward-looking statements.
