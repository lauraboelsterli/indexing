    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Broadcom Limited (NASDAQ: AVGO) (\"Broadcom\") today pledged the following commitments regarding its offer to acquire Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) (\"Qualcomm\"):\nOur Pledge to Leading 5G\nBroadcom has a successful 50-year heritage of building leading communications technologies including Wi-Fi, broadband access, network switching and routing. With its proven track record of investing in and growing core franchises, Broadcom is committed to making the U.S. the global leader in 5G.\nBroadcom acquires companies to focus resources and strengthen leadership in their core franchises. In the case of Qualcomm, this will be 5G cellular.\nOur Pledge to Accelerate Innovation and R&D\nBroadcom has a proven track record of managing R&D for maximum impact and investing in core franchises. Broadcom will not only maintain the R&D resources Qualcomm devotes to 5G and innovation in future wireless standards â€“ we will also focus R&D spend to those critical technologies that are essential to the U.S.\nConsistent with our commitment, Broadcom is pledging to create a new $1.5 billion fund with a focus on innovation to train and educate the next generation of engineers in the U.S. This will ensure America's lead in future wireless technology.\nImportantly, Broadcom will fund enhanced R&D through lawful business practices rather than predatory and anticompetitive behavior. There is no truth to Qualcomm's argument that its anticompetitive licensing practices are needed to fund a robust R&D effort.\nOur Pledge to Creating a Stronger Combined American Company\nBroadcom is in every important respect an American company, with a lineage of great American technology icons like Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, Broadcom Corp., and Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. We are now in the final stages of redomiciling to the United States, and that process will be complete no later than May 6, 2018. When we complete our acquisition of Qualcomm, we expect to have more than 25,000 employees in the U.S., working to make Broadcom the leading communication semiconductor company in the world.\nMoelis & Company LLC, Citi, Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities are acting as financial advisors to Broadcom. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Latham & Watkins LLP, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and O'Melveny & Myers LLP are acting as legal counsel.\nAbout Broadcom\nBroadcom Limited is a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of digital and analog semiconductor connectivity solutions. Broadcom Limited's extensive product portfolio serves four primary end markets: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial & other. Applications for our products in these end markets include enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (including within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended) concerning Broadcom.
