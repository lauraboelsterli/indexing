    "text": "MELROSE PARK, Ill., March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Convenience Valet ( www.cvalet.com ), a Weinberg Capital Group portfolio company, is moving from its Melrose Park, IL location to Glendale Heights, IL to better serve growing business needs. The Glendale Heights location will officially be in use as of March 26 th , 2018.\nThe company's expansion is due to business growth and the need for more space â€“ both warehouse operations and office. Convenience Valet has outgrown its warehouse of the last 17 years and the new facility is 150,000 square feet, thus providing a 50% increase in space over its current location. With 11 loading docks as opposed to the current 4, Convenience Valet greatly increases its capacity for smooth shipments and deliveries. The new offices are also an open, collaborative space allowing for a better work environment for current and future employees.\nSteve Jungmann, the company's CEO & President, explains, \"The decision to expand our warehouse and office space is the logical next step in our growth strategy. It sets us up to expand and grow in many new ways, while still delivering our excellent customer service. \"\nJim Blosser, EVP of Sales and a 20-year veteran adds, \"This is a huge milestone for our company.
