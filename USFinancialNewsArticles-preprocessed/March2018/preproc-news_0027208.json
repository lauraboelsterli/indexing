    "text": "March 14, 2018 / 1:58 PM / Updated 44 minutes ago Hungary sentences Syrian migrant to seven years for border riot Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A Hungarian court sentenced a Syrian-Cypriot man to seven years in prison for illegally crossing the border and being an accomplice in a terrorist act during clashes with police in September 2015, state news agency MTI reported on Wednesday. Ahmed Hamed was part of a group that crossed illegally into Hungary on Sept. 16, 2015 and also spoke to the crowd using a loudspeaker before hundreds of migrants forced open the border gate and police fired water cannon and teargas. A Reuters photographer in the courtroom at the court in the southern town of Szeged said the man, who was guarded by masked police, received the sentence calmly.
