    "text": " 36 AM / Updated 5 minutes ago Syrian rebel group denies reports they will leave Douma   \nBEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian rebel group Jaish al-Islam denied reports on Friday it would leave Douma near Damascus, after Russia said it had reached an agreement by which insurgents would leave the town. A man walks on rubble of damaged buildings in the besieged town of Douma, Eastern Ghouta, in Damascus, Syria March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh \n“Our position is still clear and firm and it is rejecting forced displacement and demographic change in what remains of eastern Ghouta,” the Jaish al-Islam military spokesman Hamza Birqdar said in a message posted on his Telegram feed.
