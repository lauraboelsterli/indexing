Stainless steel wire rolls are seen at TIM factory in Huamantla, in the Mexican state of Tlaxcala October 11, 2013. REUTERS/Tomas Bravo/Files Production hit 48.1 million tonnes last year, with 11 percent gains in the United States, which accounts for nearly 6 percent of global output, ISSF data showed. China, the worldâ€™s largest stainless steel producer, continued to account for a little more than half of global production, though it raised output by only 4.7 percent last year. Stainless steel prices in east Asian ports fell 5 percent last year, in marked contrast to Chinese steel rebar prices, which surged by nearly 50 percent.
