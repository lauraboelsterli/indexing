    "text": "(Adds details of release, background)\nOTTAWA, March 8 (Reuters) - Canadian new home prices were unchanged for the second month in a row in January, in part due to weakness in Toronto, the countryâ€™s single largest market, Statistics Canada said on Thursday.\nAnalysts in a Reuters poll had expected prices to rise by 0.1 percent from December. January marked the first time in exactly three years that home prices have stayed flat for two consecutive months.\nIn Toronto, which represents 27.9 percent of the overall market in Canada, prices slipped by 0.1 percent, the first decline since July 2014.\nLast April the Ontario provincial government announced measures to cool the market in the city and surrounding areas. Statscan said higher mortgage rates may also have helped moderate prices nationally.\nIn Vancouver, another hot market where authorities have intervened, prices were flat.\nThe new housing price index excludes apartments and condominiums, which the government says are a particular cause for concern over overheated prices and which account for one-third of new housing.\nReporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Frances Kerry\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
