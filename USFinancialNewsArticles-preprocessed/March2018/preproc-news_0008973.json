    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission on Monday voted to continue anti-dumping and subsidy investigations into imports of large-diameter welded pipe from Canada, China, Greece, India, South Korea and Turkey, it said in a statement.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department said last month it was examining whether manufacturers from those countries are selling the pipe in the United States at below-market rates or are being unfairly subsidized by their governments. Imports of the pipe, used to build oil and gas pipelines, in 2016 totaled $441.4 million from the six countries, department data show.
