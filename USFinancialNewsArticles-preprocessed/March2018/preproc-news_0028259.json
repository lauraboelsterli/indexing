    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla., March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Orangetheory® Fitness, the scientifically backed and fast-growing fitness franchise , announced today Mike Mettler has joined the company as senior vice president of domestic franchise development. In his new role, Mettler will be responsible for overseeing the company's domestic growth and expansion, as well as providing strategic leadership to assist the leading fitness franchise in achieving its goal of having more than 1,100 open studios worldwide by the end of 2018.\nThis announcement comes on the heels of the outstanding success Orangetheory Fitness has achieved over the past several years, which has fueled a surge in franchise development and reinforced its position as the leader of the franchise fitness studio segment.\n\"The explosive growth Orangetheory Fitness has experienced is unparalleled in the franchise fitness industry, and we know we're just getting started. We're thrilled to welcome Mike to the team and have no doubt his wealth of development experience will be a tremendous asset as we accelerate this momentum and continue driving the brand's unstoppable potential,\" said Dave Long, chief executive officer of Orangetheory Fitness.\nAn industry veteran, Mettler brings more than 12 years of experience in leading franchise development efforts for widely recognized brands, including Dairy Queen and Domino's Pizza. Most recently, Mettler served as the vice president of franchise development for Dairy Queen, where he was responsible for propelling the brand's growth and driving its footprint throughout the U.S. and Canada. In addition to fueling Orangetheory Fitness' expansion through franchising, Mettler will also be responsible for building a high performance sales culture and providing strategic leadership to the company's domestic franchise sales, real estate and construction teams.\n\"In less than 10 years, Orangetheory Fitness has built a brand which stands at the forefront of fitness trends and emerged as an industry trailblazer. These achievements are a direct reflection of the company's strong corporate leadership, and I'm proud to be joining the team and helping the brand continue its global domination of the fitness segment,\" said Mettler.\nIn 2017, Orangetheory Fitness signed 291 franchise development agreements, including its 1000 th milestone franchise agreement, as well as opened 294 new studios worldwide. This explosive growth landed Orangetheory Fitness a #1 ranking on Franchise Times' 2018 Fast & Serious list, naming the company the smartest-growing brand in the industry. This year, the leading fitness franchise is on track to achieve $1 billion in system-wide revenue and open more than 270 additional new studios.\nOrangetheory Fitness launched its first studio in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. in March 2010, and has transformed into one of the world's top fitness franchises, with more than 915 studios in 49 states and 17 countries. Based on excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), the science-based workout uses heart-rate monitoring technology to measure members' performance and improvement over time.

Backed by the science of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), Orangetheory's heart-rate-monitored workouts are designed to get participants within the target-training zone of 84 percent to 91 percent of their maximum heart rate, which greatly stimulates metabolism and increases energy. Led by highly skilled coaches, each Orangetheory Fitness workout incorporates endurance, strength and power elements through a variety of equipment including treadmills, rowing machines, TRX® suspension training and free weights. The end result is more energy, visible toning and the 'Orange Effect' – where participants keep burning calories for up to 36 hours post-workout (the Orangetheory Fitness 'afterburn') for an average of 500+ total calories burned per every 60-minute workout. The company was ranked #1 on Franchise Times' 2018 Fast & Serious list, #60 in Inc. magazine's Fastest Growing Private Companies list, #11 on Entrepreneur magazine's Fastest Growing Franchises list and #48 in Entrepreneur's 2018 Franchise 500® list of the top franchises in the world.
