    "text": "Oil OPEC, Russia consider 10-20 year oil cooperation: Saudi Crown Prince OPEC is seeking a 10-20 year deal to cooperate on oil output controls with Russia and other non-OPEC producers, said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The crown prince said a flotation of 5 percent of state Saudi oil company Aramco could take place at the end of 2018 or early 2019. Published 7 Hours Ago Reuters Pavel Golovkin | AFP | Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) shakes hands with Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman during a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow on May 30, 2017. \nOPEC and Russia are working on a long-term deal to cooperate on oil supply curbs that could extend controls over world oil supplies by major exporters for many years to come. \nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering extending an alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after oil prices crashed. \nWe are working to shift from a year-to-year agreement to a 10-20 year agreement, the crown prince told Reuters in interview in New York. \nWe have agreement on the big picture, but not yet on the detail. \nTop OPEC producer Saudi Arabia recruited Russia and other producers to collaborate with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries when oil prices collapsed from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016. \nCrude has recovered to $70 but fast-rising output from U.S. shale producers has capped prices. \nRussia, never a member of OPEC, has worked alongside OPEC during previous oil gluts, dating back to 1990, but a 10-20 year deal between the two would be unprecedented. \nThe crown prince said a flotation of 5 percent of state Saudi oil company Aramco could take place at the end of 2018 or early 2019, depending on market conditions.
