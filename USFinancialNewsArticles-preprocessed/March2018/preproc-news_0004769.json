    "text": "ZURICH, March 1 (Reuters) - Adecco posted better-than-expected profit during the fourth quarter of 2017 but revenue growth slowed at the start of 2018, the worldâ€™s biggest staffing company said on Thursday.\nAdecco, whose results like other staffing companies are often seen as a proxy for the health of the broader economy, said net profit rose 38 percent to 297 million euros ($362 million). The figure beat estimates for a net profit of 203 million euros in a Reuters poll.\nRevenue increased 3 percent to 6.057 billion euros, better than the 6.01 billion euros expected in the poll. The increase when adjusted for trading days and currency effects was 7 percent, but slowed to a 5 percent rise in January and February, the Swiss company said.\nIt proposed a dividend of 2.50 Swiss francs, up from 2.40 francs a year earlier.
