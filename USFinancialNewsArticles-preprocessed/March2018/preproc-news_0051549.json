    "text": "YEHUD, Israel, March 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Magal Security Systems, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MAGS) today announced its financial results for the three month and full year period ended December 31, 2017. Management will hold an investors' conference call later today (at 11:30am Eastern Time) to discuss the results.\nFOURTH QUARTER RESULTS SUMMARY\nRevenue of $23 million, up 68% sequentially and 14% year over year; Net income of $0.3 million, versus a net loss of $0.2 million in the prior quarter EBITDA of $2.3 million compared with breakeven EBITDA in the prior quarter and a 20% improvement year over year; Strong bookings in the fourth quarter (and beyond) leading to expectations of strong revenue and profitability growth in 2018.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $23.0 million, an increase of 14% compared with revenues of $20.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.7 million, or 47% of revenues, an increase of 7% compared with gross profit of $10.0 million or 50% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The change in gross margin between quarters is a function of the revenue mix between projects executed and products and services sold.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.8 million, an increase of 18% compared to operating income of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFinance and Tax expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.5 million and $1 million, respectively, compared to $0.5 million in finance income and $0.9 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe finance expenses in 2017 are mostly related to non-cash, foreign currency valuation changes, primarily due to the increase in value of the Israeli shekel versus the US dollar, impacting Magal's US dollar denominated deposits, while in 2016 the reverse was true. The tax expense in 2017 includes a $0.3 million adjustment of the Company's deferred tax asset in the United States which is a non-cash charge, as a result of the recent US tax reforms. In 2016, Magal recognized a net tax asset, contributing to the significant tax benefit recorded in the quarter.\nNet income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share, compared with net income of $2.9 million, or $0.13 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nEBITDA in the fourth quarter was $2.3 million, an increase of 20% compared with EBITDA of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFULL YEAR 2017 RESULTS\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $64.3 million, a 5% decrease compared with $67.8 million in 2016.\nGross profit for 2017 was $31.3 million, representing 49% of revenues, compared with $33.3 million, representing 49% of revenues in 2016.\nOperating loss for 2017 was $1.2 million, compared with operating income of $1.5 million in 2016.\nNet loss for 2017 was $6.9 million, or $0.30 per share, compared with net income of $1.0 million, or $0.06 per share, in 2016.\nCash, short term deposits and restricted deposits, net of bank debt, as of December 31, 2017, were $52.3 million, or $2.27 per share, compared with cash and short term deposits, net of bank debt, of $52.5 million, or $2.29 per share, at December 31, 2016.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENT\nCommenting on the results, Mr. Saar Koursh, CEO of Magal, said, \"We ended 2017 with a strong fourth quarter, despite 2017 being a challenging year with net losses in the first three quarters. In mid-2017 we took some important steps to improve our operating efficiencies, including the full amalgamation of our product and VMS operations. I am encouraged by the improvement in our business in the fourth quarter, as reflected by the strong growth and improvement in profitability and the strong order momentum in recent months as reported in early 2018.\"\nINVESTORS' CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION:\nThe Company will host a conference call later today, March 28, 2018, at 11:30am Eastern Time and 6:30pm Israel time.\nTo participate, please call one of the following teleconferencing numbers:\nUS: 1 866 860 9642; Israel: 03 918 0687; UK: 0 800 051 8913; Intl.: +972 3 918 0687\nIf you are unable to connect using the toll-free numbers, please try the international dial-in number.\nA replay of the call will be available on the Company's website for three months from the day after the call.
