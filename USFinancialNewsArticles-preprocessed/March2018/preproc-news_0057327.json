    "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday froze more than $200 million in funds for recovery efforts in Syria as his administration reassesses Washington’s role in the long-drawn conflict there, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing officials.\nTrump called for the freeze after reading a news report noting that Washington had recently committed an additional $200 million to support early recovery efforts in Syria, the Journal reported.\nThe decision is in line with Trump’s declaration on Thursday when he said that America would exit Syria, according to officials, the Journal reported.\nAn additional aid of $200 million was pledged by departing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in February in Kuwait at a meeting of the global coalition against Islamic State.\nReporting by Bhanu Pratap in Bengaluru; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
