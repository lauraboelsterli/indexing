It declined to say how many birds are slaughtered at that plant or how much of its production is destined to export markets.\nEarlier in March more than 1,000 BRF workers were placed on leave at its Mineiros plant, one of the units involved in the food safety investigation.\nBRF said there was “no information available” regarding the possibility of adjusting production at any other units.\nThe Brazilian Agriculture Ministry also temporarily interrupted production and certification of BRF’s poultry exports to the European Union this month.
