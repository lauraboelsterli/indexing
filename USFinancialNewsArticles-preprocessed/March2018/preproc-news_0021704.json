    "text": "Khris Middleton had 30 points on 11-for-16 shooting and Giannis Antetokounmpo had 28 points and 10 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks defeated the visiting New York Knicks 120-112 on Friday night at BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.\nTim Hardaway Jr. had 26 points on 10-for-20 shooting and Troy Williams added 18 points off the bench to lead the Knicks, who lost their sixth straight game and for the 14th time in their last 15 games.\nThe Bucks snapped a two-game losing streak by scorching the New York defense. Milwaukee finished 41-for-73 from the field (56.2 percent) and hit 8 of 18 from 3-point range as it won for just the second time in eight games.\nThe Bucks led by as much as nine in the first quarter and 16 in the second as Middleton had 12 first-half points.\nJohn Henson had 14 points for the Bucks with Jabari Parker and Tyler Zeller each adding 12 points off the bench. Sterling Brown was the third Bucks backup who scored in double digits as he had 11 points.\nEmmanuel Mudiay had 19 points and Enes Kanter added 16 points and eight rebounds for New York, which shot 48 percent from the field but just 25 percent from 3-point range. Kyle O’Quinn added 14 points off the bench for the Knicks.\nNew York cut Milwaukee’s lead to 93-91 with 11:33 left in the game, but the Bucks went up by 10 less than two minutes later, as Antetokounmpo had six quick points. Milwaukee went up by as much as 16 down the stretch before the Knicks made it respectable late in the game.\nThe Bucks outrebounded the Knicks 42-39 and had 29 assists, including eight by Eric Bledsoe and five from Antetokounmpo.\nMilwaukee heads out on the road for a two-game set at Memphis and at Orlando on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.\nNew York will face Toronto to begin a five-game homestand on Sunday before hosting Dallas, Philadelphia, Charlotte and Chicago.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
