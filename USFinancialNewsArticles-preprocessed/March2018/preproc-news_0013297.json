Trump imposed import tariffs on steel and aluminium, while softening his stance by announcing exemptions for Canada and Mexico, and leaving open the chance for other countries to obtain their own.\n“There are a lot of potential exemptions, so I think safe haven flows into the yen have abated,” said Roy Teo, investment strategist for LGT Bank in Singapore.\nThe U.S. dollar had tumbled to 16-month lows against the safe-haven yen late last week as concerns about a trade war gripped markets after Trump initially announced his plan for tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminium.\nThe euro nursed its losses after falling on Thursday as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, while acknowledging faster growth in Europe, said regional inflation remained subdued and rising protectionism is a risk.\nDraghi expressed his view on these issues at his news conference after a central bank policy meeting. It overshadowed the ECB’s dropping of a long-standing pledge to increase its bond purchases if needed, a move that briefly spurred buying of the single currency.\nThe euro held steady at $1.2310, after falling 0.8 percent on Thursday.\nThe yen showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy steady on Friday, as widely expected.\nLater on Friday, market participants will turn their attention to U.S. February jobs data.
