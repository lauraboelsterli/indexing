We will build upon the momentum that Tom and the team have established in our medical products business and advance our organization to develop the next generation of exoskeleton products. I look forward to working with our exceptional team to take Ekso to the next phase of its corporate evolution.”\nThe company also announced that Howard Palefsky and Amy Wendell stepped down from the Board of Directors effective March 9, 2018.
