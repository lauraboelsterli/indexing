    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Some references to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, were removed from documents related to a controversial sale of state-owned land, according to documents submitted to parliament by the ministry of finance.\nFILE PHOTO - Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (L) and his wife Akie at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan February 28, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo One reference was to Akie’s visit to the school at the heart of a suspected cronyism scandal, according to the documents seen by Reuters on Monday.\nAbe has repeatedly denied he or his wife did favors for school operator Moritomo Gakuen, which bought the land, and has said he would resign if evidence were found that they had.\nThe issue last year sharply eroded Abe’s popularity.\nSuspicions of a cover-up could slash Abe’s ratings and dash his hopes of a third term as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in an election in September.\nReporting by Takaya Yamaguchi; Writing by Chang-Ran Kim; Editing by Michael Perry\n ",
