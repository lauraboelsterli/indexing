REUTERS/Borut Zivulovic “I am very happy that it happened today,” Hirscher told Eurosport.“To me (the title) comes as a little bit of a surprise as I haven’t been thinking about it; I was just thinking about the race.”\nKristoffersen was full of praise for his rival, saying:“Marcel is in his own league. He is the best racer.”\nSlideshow (5 Images) The Austrian is set to win an unprecedented seventh straight overall World Cup crown. He has 1,394 points to Kristoffersen’s 1,125 and 716 for Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal.
