    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. Anyone who has run their company’s social media pages has probably experienced that stomach-flipping moment when they almost tweet or “like” something they weren’t supposed to. So many of you will probably have some sympathy for Roy Jones, a social media manager who was fired from Marriott after he used an official account to like a post on Twitter from a Tibetan separatist group, which had applauded the hotel chain for listing Tibet as a country, rather than part of China, in an online survey. Marriott said the country listing, which had offended Chinese authorities, was a mistake, and Mr. Jones said the same of his liking of the post. Mr. Jones paid for the error with his job.\nPushing the Envelope Sunday’s Oscars marked the first Academy Awards show post-Weinstein and many of the speeches and montages touched upon themes of inclusiveness and the #MeToo movement. That theme continued into the ad breaks, too. Twitter’s debut Oscars ad used words from poet Denice Frohman to show how it has become a platform for supporting women’s voices, through movements such as #TimesUp and #MeToo. Nike enlisted Serena Williams to send a message that “there’s no wrong way to be a women.” Google ran a spot showing a dad using its Nest technology to teach his son to be respectful to his female prom date. And Walmart signed up three female directors to create 60-second short films inspired by its delivery boxes.\nSafety Net YouTube’s brand safety issues don’t appear to be going away, in spite of its efforts to hire more content checkers and make more controls available to advertisers. CNN reports a number of brands suspended their ads on Alex Jones’s InfoWars YouTube channels after CNN reporters informed them their ads had appeared there. Advertisers including Nike, Paramount Network and Acer told CNN they had been under the impression that filters they had set surrounding sensitive content should have prevented this from happening. YouTube had reprimanded InfoWars recently for violating its community guidelines by posting a video that claimed Parkland, Fla., shooting survivor and anti-gun activist David Hogg “can’t remember his lines in [a] TV interview.” YouTube declined to comment, beyond saying that it recently notified Mr. Jones that advertisers had asked to be removed from his channels. Meanwhile, Mr. Jones tweeted , “CNN is openly lobbying for my voice to be silenced across the web.”\n—Rank and File—\nSeparate, but related: Video analytics firm Delmondo and artificial intelligence company Uru last week released an analysis of the top 17 most-subscribed-to YouTube influencers, ranked in order of brand safety . Of the videos in the analysis, 67% contained unsafe language and 61% included “negative sentiment,” although the content on those channels was more likely to be brand-safe than brand-unsafe. While it isn’t clear whether all the videos analyzed carried ads (and many brands don’t have a problem with risqué language on other mediums, like TV), it’s always worth remembering to keep those blacklists and whitelists up-to-date.\nLocation, Location, Location In our advertising and media bubble, it’s often easy to forget some of the generally accepted practices of this industry that might make people feel uncomfortable. Take location data and the reams of apps that gather information on users’ whereabouts and use it for targeted advertising or sell it to data brokers, as Christopher Mims explores in his latest WSJ column . “Old news!,” you might declare, but, just as Russian election interference has brought tools like Facebook’s Custom Audiences to mainstream attention, it is new news for some people, especially those who might have been wondering why their phone battery keeps draining so quickly. Plus, as location advertising grows, there’s also the concern that location data could become a high-value target for hackers, despite most data vendors saying they go to great lengths to anonymize full identity profiles.\nPass the Tissues Less than a week after WPP reported lackluster results and Martin Sorrell rued “2017 was not a pretty year,” we now know the holding company is being forced to defend a major account after consumer-goods giant Kimberly-Clark put its creative roster up for review , Adweek reports. The owner of Kleenex, Huggies and Kotex hasn’t had the best of years itself, announcing plans last month to cut about 13% of its global workforce and $2 billion in costs by 2021, having ended the year with flat sales and predicting just 1% growth for 2018. If recent moves by rivals Procter & Gamble and Unilever are anything to go by, it wouldn’t be a surprise if the ax also falls on some agency fees. During its fourth-quarter earnings call, Kimberly-Clark executives said the company is investing more in its brands and “harder hitting” messaging in 2018, having noted that its advertising was not as strong in the fourth quarter as it needed to be. Adweek reports WPP’s Ogilvy remains in the review, but JWT was eliminated in the early rounds, while VML wasn’t involved in the pitch.\nBest of the rest A startup co-founded by media entrepreneur Steve Brill and L. Gordon Crovitz, a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal, will use journalistically trained analysts to “nutrition label” around 7,500 news brands to give users more information about the publishers’ viewpoints or whether they are purveyors of fake news. Publicis Groupe is the lead investor in NewsGuard, which will produce a whitelist of legitimate news publishers so advertisers can avoid fake news sites. [ WSJ ]\nFacebook is pitching a brand-safe video ad program for advertisers who commit to spend $750,000 over three months. But some buyers say Facebook is only giving them limited control over where their ads will appear. [ Digiday ]\nTwitter is testing integration of third-party programmatic ad-buying platforms and agency trading desks. [ Ad Age ]\nUnivision is doing away with the traditional upfront this year and is instead planning a two-day experiential event, featuring performances and other interactive experiences. [ Adweek ]\nSnap reportedly plans to release the second version of its Spectacles wearable hardware this year, and a more ambitious version of the glasses featuring two cameras is planned for 2019. [ Cheddar ]\nMore brands are appealing to country music fans, a growing cohort of consumers who have money to spend. [ Adweek ]\nA fun dive into Milwaukee’s efforts to overhaul its city flag, which has been described as a “hot mess” by one design expert.
