That whopper of a tab is near double the average of $57,617 needed by home buyers nationwide.\nMore from Advisor Insight: \nWhy investors can't gauge their own risk tolerance \nCrazy tax moves clients wanted advisors to try for 2018 \nDon't put all your financial eggs in one investment basket \nSan Franciscans have to bring home $164,666 in bacon to buy their own digs, while just a few miles south, San Jose residents catch a relative $33,000 break by only need a measly $131,503. In the Big Apple, New Yorkers can expect their home costs to take a $111,662 bite.\nOwning a home in many of the other 12 biggest U.S. cities studied, however, is far more affordable, said SmartAsset. The firm found that, in 10 of the total 15 cities analyzed, median household income suffices to afford the median home. Otherwise debt-free Indianapolis residents, for instance, only need to earn $21,955 to afford monthly home payments after making a 20 percent down payment. See the chart below for all of SmartAsset's findings.\n(Source: SmartAsset) \nSign Up for Our Newsletter Your Wealth Weekly advice on managing your money SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
