    "text": "BANGOR, Maine and COLEBROOK, N.H., Bangor Bancorp, MHC, parent company of Bangor Savings Bank and Colebrook, New Hampshire-based First Colebrook Bancorp, Inc. (\"First Colebrook\") (OTCQX: FCNH), parent company of Granite Bank, jointly announced today that First Colebrook stockholders have approved the previously announced merger transaction, whereby Granite Bank will merge with and into Bangor Savings Bank, at a special meeting of First Colebrook stockholders held March 14, 2017, with 97.21% of the shares present voting in favor and 81.56% of issued and outstanding shares represented at the meeting. No vote by the corporators of Bangor Bancorp, MHC is required, and Bangor Bancorp, MHC, as the sole shareholder of Bangor Savings Bank, has already approved the proposed merger.\nIn addition, the transactions were approved by the Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions, the New Hampshire Banking Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nUnder the terms of the merger, stockholders of First Colebrook will receive $45.00 in cash in exchange for each share of First Colebrook stock for a transaction valued in aggregate at approximately $45 million. The transaction is expected to close on April 6, 2018.\nScott A. Cooper, President and Chief Executive Officer of First Colebrook and Granite Bank, said, \"We are excited about the potential benefits of the merger for our stockholders, customers and the communities we serve as well as for our employees.\"\n\"We're excited to welcome Granite Bank to the Bangor Savings Bank family,\" said Bangor Savings President and Chief Executive Officer Bob Montgomery-Rice. \"Our banks share a culture of developing real relationships with customers, and making their banking life easier. As a mutual bank, our structure enables us to focus on serving our customers, communities and employees. Because of that, we've been able to retain the personal approach and local perspective of a smaller bank. At the same time, we have the resources to invest in new branches, state-of-the-art technology, and new products and services.\"\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains statements that may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
