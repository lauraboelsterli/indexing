    "text": "PITTSBURGH, March 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX) (\"CNX\" or the company) and CNX Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: CNXM) (\"CNXM\") jointly announced today that CNXM has completed its previously announced acquisition of a 95% interest in the Shirley-Pennsboro gathering system (\"Shirley-Pennsboro System\") from CNX.\nThe Shirley-Pennsboro System gathers and transports gas in the core wet gas region of the Marcellus Shale in West Virginia across Doddridge, Tyler, Ritchie, and Pleasant counties and currently has approximately 180 million cubic feet equivalent per day of flowing production. At the closing, the Shirley-Pennsboro System, which was previously held in CNX's 95% owned subsidiary, CNX Midstream DevCo III, was transferred to CNXM's 100% owned subsidiary, CNX Midstream DevCo I.\nCNXM financed the transaction with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of their 6.500% senior notes due 2026, which also closed on March 16, 2018.\nAbout CNX Resources\nCNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX) is one of the largest independent natural gas exploration, development and production companies, with operations centered in the major shale formations of the Appalachian basin. CNX deploys an organic growth strategy focused on responsibly developing its resource base. As of December 31, 2017, CNX had 7.6 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves. CNX is a member of the Standard & Poor's Midcap 400 Index. Additional information may be found at www.cnx.com .\nAbout CNX Midstream Partners\nCNX Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: CNXM) is a master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires gathering and other midstream energy assets to service natural gas production in the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. CNXM's assets include natural gas gathering pipelines and compression and dehydration facilities, as well as condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization facilities. More information is available on CNXM's website www.cnxmidstream.com .\n* * * * *\nThis press release serves as a qualified notice to nominees as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b). Nominees should treat one hundred percent (100.0%) of CNX Midstream's distributions to non-U.S. investors as being attributed to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, CNX Midstream's distributions to non-U.S. investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate. Nominees, and not CNX Midstream, are treated as withholding agents responsible for withholding on the distributions received by them on behalf of non-U.S. investors.\nImportant Information about Company Names and Stock Trading Symbols\nEffective November 28, 2017, the company known as CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX) separated its gas business (GasCo or RemainCo) and its coal business (CoalCo or SpinCo) into two independent, publicly traded companies by means of a separation of CoalCo from RemainCo.\nThe gas business, CNX Resources Corporation (RemainCo, GasCo or CNX), continues to be listed on the NYSE, retaining the ticker symbol \"CNX\". Information regarding CNX and its natural gas business is available at www.cnx.com . The coal business, CONSOL Energy Inc. (SpinCo, CoalCo or CONSOL), is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol: \"CEIX\". CoalCo owns, operates and develops coal assets, including the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, the Baltimore Marine Terminal, and approximately one billion tons of greenfield coal reserves. Information regarding the new CONSOL Energy and its coal business is available at www.consolenergy.com . The master limited partnership that was named CNX Coal Resources LP (NYSE: CNXC) has changed its name to CONSOL Coal Resources LP and trades on the NYSE under a new ticker symbol: \"CCR\".

Information regarding CONSOL Coal Resources LP is available at www.ccrlp.com . Following the closing of CNX's purchase of Noble Energy's 50% interest in CNX Gathering LLC, which occurred on January 3, 2018, the master limited partnership that was named CONE Midstream Partners, LP has changed its name to CNX Midstream Partners LP and now trades on the NYSE under a new ticker symbol: \"CNXM\".
