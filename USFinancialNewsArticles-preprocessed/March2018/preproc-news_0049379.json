    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 6:37 AM / Updated 37 minutes ago Kenyan minister, police chief fined in mounting standoff with courts Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nNAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s interior minister and police chief were both fined for contempt of court on Thursday for failing to obey a judge’s order to free a opposition politician, in a sharp escalation in a standoff between the government and the judiciary.

REUTERS/Stephen Mdunga \nHigh court judge George Odunga said both men had “conducted themselves in a most despicable manner not expected in this constitutional era”- an unprecedented rebuke of such senior figures. \nInterior minister Fred Matiang’i and police inspector general Joseph Boinnet were each fined 200,000 Kenyan shillings ($1,985) for their part in the detention of opposition politician Miguna Miguna this week. \nThe minister would appeal, his ministry said. There was no immediate comment from the police. \nOpposition groups and activists have repeatedly accused the government failing to respect the authority of the courts in political matters - a charge the government denies. \nMiguna - who holds dual Canadian citizenship - was detained after he flew into Nairobi on Wednesday and held at the airport, he and his lawyer said.

MOSES KURIA /via REUTERS \nA court ordered his release and then, when his detention continued, found both the minister and police chief guilty of contempt of court on Thursday for ignoring its ruling. \nHours later, Miguna was placed on an Emirates flight to Dubai, his lawyer said - the second time he has been deported this year. \nOn Thursday, the politician said he had been dragged, assaulted and drugged during the forced deportation. “I’m sick. I need medical treatment ... I need urgent help here,” he said on Twitter. \nKenyan authorities initially deported Miguna in February, saying he had rescinded his Kenyan citizenship when he acquired Canadian nationality but a court ruled he should be allowed back. \nThe ministry had denied that Miguna was being held illegally this week and said he had failed to follow arrival procedures when he landed in Kenya.
