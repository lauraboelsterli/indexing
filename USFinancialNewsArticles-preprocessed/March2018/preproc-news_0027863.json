    "text": "NEW ALBANY, Ohio, March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"CVG\") (NASDAQ: CVGI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter\n2017\n2016\n(millions except EPS)\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP\nRevenues\n$188.3\n$188.3\n$150.0\n$150.0\nOperating Income\n$8.6\n$8.2\n$3.9\n$5.1\nNet (Loss) Income\n$(7.2)\n$3.7\n$0.4\n$0.7\nBasic/Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per Share\n$(0.24)\n$0.12\n$0.01\n$0.02\n(See Appendix A for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures)\nPatrick Miller, President and CEO, stated, \"All of our end markets present opportunities in 2018. Fourth quarter 2017 class 8 truck builds in North America were up 40% year over year and net orders in January were 48,700 units, the highest level since 2006. Furthermore, medium duty truck orders look favorable so far in 2018 likely indicating another strong year in that segment, and the global construction industry continues to accelerate.\"\nMiller added, \"Our global organization is making progress with digital innovation in both processes and products. Close collaboration exists with our core customers as we continue to ramp new platform launches that started in 2017 and 2018. We completed our two-year restructuring program prior to year-end, stabilized our North America wire harness business, and are looking forward to capitalizing on the higher volumes in 2018.\"\nTim Trenary, Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"As compared to the prior year period, revenues in the fourth quarter 2017 were up 26% and operating income, adjusted for special items, improved to $8.2 million, or by 100 basis points. This progress reflects the upswing in the global economy and higher build volumes in our end markets. However, rising commodity prices, tightening labor markets and costs associated with the sharp acceleration in build volumes adversely impacted conversion of the higher revenues into operating income. We have actions underway to mitigate the impact of commodity prices and costs associated with the build volumes.\"\nTrenary continued, \"Interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the prior year period was down approximately 33%, a reflection of our successful debt refinancing in the second quarter and lower outstanding borrowings. Finally, earnings in the fourth quarter 2017 were adversely affected by the new federal tax legislation; however, we expect this legislation to result in a lower effective tax rate and lower cash taxes for CVG going forward.\"\nConsolidated Results\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $188.3 million compared to $150.0 million in the prior year period, an increase of 25.6 percent primarily resulting from an increase in heavy-duty truck production in North America and improvement in the construction equipment markets we serve. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted fourth quarter revenues by $3.7 million, or 2.5 percent. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.6 million compared to $3.9 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of higher revenues partially offset by rising commodity prices, costs associated with the sharp acceleration in North American truck build and tightening labor markets. The fourth quarter 2017 results include a $0.4 million net gain associated with restructuring actions. The fourth quarter 2016 results include costs associated with restructuring actions of $1.2 million. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 were negatively impacted by an $11.2 million charge associated with the implementation of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Fourth quarter 2016 results benefited from a $0.7 million insurance settlement. Earnings per share, as adjusted for special items, were $0.12 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $0.02 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nFull Year\n2017\n2016\n(millions except EPS)\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP\nRevenues\n$755.2\n$755.2\n$662.1\n$662.1\nOperating Income\n$31.4\n$35.7\n$25.4\n$29.5\nNet (Loss) Income\n$(1.7)\n$13.6\n$6.8\n$8.7\nBasic/Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per Share\n$(0.06)\n$0.44\n$0.23\n$0.29\n(See Appendix A for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures)\nRevenues in fiscal year 2017 were $755.2 million compared to $662.1 million in the prior year, an increase of 14.1 percent resulting primarily from an increase in heavy-duty truck production in North America and improvement in the construction equipment markets we serve. The 2017 North American heavy-duty truck production was 256,000 units compared to 228,000 units in 2016. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted fiscal year 2017 revenues by $0.5 million, or 0.1 percent. Operating income in fiscal year 2017 was $31.4 million compared to $25.4 million in the prior year. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of higher revenues partially offset by rising commodity prices, costs associated with the sharp acceleration in North American truck build and tightening labor markets. We incurred approximately $10 million in costs associated with a labor shortage in our North American wire harness business in 2017. Results in 2017 and 2016 include restructuring and other charges of $4.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively. Net loss was $1.7 million in fiscal year 2017, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2016. In the second quarter of 2017, the Company refinanced its debt thereby reducing outstanding debt to $175 million and increased the revolving credit facility to $65 million. Net income in fiscal year 2017 was burdened with $3.2 million of costs associated with this refinancing. In addition, net loss for fiscal year 2017 reflects an income tax provision of $15.4 million compared to an income tax provision near zero in the prior year. The increase in the income tax provision was primarily the result of the $11.2 million charge associated with the implementation of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net Income in fiscal year 2016 benefited from a $0.7 million insurance settlement. Earnings per share, as adjusted for special items, were $0.44 per diluted share in fiscal year 2017 compared to $0.29 per diluted share in the prior year.\nIn fiscal year 2017, the Company did not have any borrowings under its revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2017, the Company had liquidity of $110.8 million; $52.2 million of cash and $58.6 million availability from its revolving credit facility.\nSegment Results\nGlobal Truck and Bus Segment (GTB)\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenues for the GTB Segment in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $113.7 million compared to $91.6 million in the prior year period, an increase of 24.1 percent primarily resulting from an increase in heavy-duty truck production in North America. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted fourth quarter 2017 revenues by $0.7 million, or 0.7 percent. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.3 million compared to $6.3 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of higher revenues partially offset by rising commodity prices, costs associated with the sharp acceleration in North American truck build and tightening labor markets. The fourth quarter 2017 results include a $0.6 million gain associated with restructuring actions. The fourth quarter of 2016 results include costs associated with restructuring actions of $1.0 million.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nRevenues for the GTB Segment in fiscal year 2017 were $457.8 million compared to $416.3 million in the prior year, an increase of 10.0 percent primarily resulting from an increase in heavy-duty truck production in North America. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted fiscal year 2017 revenue by $1.1 million, or 0.3 percent. Operating income in fiscal year 2017 was $40.0 million compared to $30.9 million in the prior year. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of higher revenues partially offset by rising commodity prices, costs associated with the sharp acceleration in North American truck build and tightening labor markets. Results in 2017 and 2016 include restructuring charges of $0.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\nGlobal Construction and Agriculture Segment (GCA)\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenues for the GCA Segment in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $78.5 million compared to $60.4 million in the prior year period, an increase of 30.0 percent primarily as a result of improvement in the construction equipment markets we serve. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted fourth quarter 2017 revenues by $3.3 million, or 5.4 percent. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.9 million compared to $2.5 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of higher revenues offset by rising commodity prices and tightening labor markets. The fourth quarter 2017 and 2016 results include restructuring charges of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nRevenues for the GCA Segment in fiscal year 2017 were $309.7 million compared to $254.0 million in the prior year, an increase of 21.9 percent primarily as a result of improvement in the construction equipment markets we serve. Foreign currency translation adversely impacted fiscal year 2017 revenue by $0.8 million, or 0.3 percent. Operating income in fiscal year 2017 was $14.3 million compared to $15.7 million in the prior year. The decrease in operating income was the result of costs associated with a labor shortage in our North American wire harness business in 2017. Results in 2017 and 2016 include restructuring charges of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this release is included as Appendix A to this release.\n2018 End Market Outlook\nManagement estimates that 2018 North American Class 8 truck production will be in the range of 300,000 to 325,000 units and 2018 North American Class 5-7 truck production will be favorable. We believe the construction markets we serve in Europe, Asia, and North America have improved, and that the global agriculture markets are trending upwards.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss the contents of this press release is scheduled for Tuesday, March 13, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. ET.

In general, the non-GAAP measures exclude items that (i) management believes reflect the Company's multi-year corporate activities; or (ii) relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company's performance, engage in financial and operational planning and to determine incentive compensation.\nManagement provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on the Company's financial and operating results and in comparing the Company's performance to that of its competitors and to comparable reporting periods. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth above should be carefully evaluated.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/commercial-vehicle-group-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2017-results-300612500.html\nSOURCE Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc.",
