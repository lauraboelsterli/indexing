    "text": "NEW YORK, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Infor , a leading provider of industry-specific cloud applications, today announced that seven Infor solutions were named to the Constellation ShortList™ portfolio in Q1 2018. The technology vendors included in the Constellation ShortList offer solutions designed to help early adopters pursuing digital transformation initiatives.\nSpecifically, solutions that were recognized include Infor Talent Management, Infor Configure Price Quote: , Birst cloud analytics, Infor CloudSuite HCM, Infor Cloudsuite Financials & Supply Management, Infor CRM and Infor Pricing Science.\n\"One of the keys to success for any company is being able to gather data, analyze it, and share it in a way that is digestible, so people and processes can work more efficiently,\" said Stewart Applbaum, senior vice president and group manager, Infor. \"At Infor, we strive to develop modern, industry-specific applications to help organizations navigate daily business challenges -- whether that means reaching customers in a more timely manner with more personalized communications, organizing a warehouse database, or helping managers hire better talent. We believe being named to the Constellation ShortList across so many solution lines this quarter demonstrates our unique ability to help meet the various needs of both IT and business users – by delivering the speed, self-service and agility that front-line business workers demand and the scale and control designed to help meet rigorous corporate data standards.\"\nNotably, Birst, an Infor company, was named to Constellation ShortList for cloud-based business intelligence and analytics platforms for the fourth consecutive time. Birst's networked approach to BI and analytics is designed to enable a single view of applicable data, eliminating data silos. Decentralized teams and individual users can augment the corporate data model with their own local data, without compromising data governance. Consistency comes from a unified semantic layer, which maintains common definitions and key metrics, no matter where users sit. The Birst platform can also make it possible for enterprises to create their own analytics products or monetize their data. The platform can pre-integrate data management, visual language and analysis in one place and provides applicable utilities designed to help companies embed that information into applicable business applications.\n\"Boardrooms and their executive suites must be cognizant of the business extinction events and the exponential technologies that will transform their industries,\" said R \"Ray\" Wang, chairman and founder at Constellation Research. \"Each Constellation ShortList, researched and curated by our analysts, is designed to help guides early adopters in identifying the right technologies to support new business models and improve engagement. Leaders now have a list of the top technology partners who can co-innovate and co-create with customers to help them thrive and dominate digital disruption.\"\nConstellation advises leaders on leveraging disruptive technologies to achieve business model transformation. Products and services named to each Constellation ShortList meet the threshold criteria for each category as determined through client inquiries, partner conversations, customer references, vendor selection projects, market share and internal research. The Constellation ShortList portfolio is frequently updated as market conditions change.\nDisclaimer\nConstellation Research does not endorse any solution or service named in its research.\nAbout Infor\nInfor builds business software for specific industries in the cloud.
