    "text": "Akos Stiller | Bloomberg | Getty Images Gold bars at Solar Capital Gold Zrt. in Budapest, Hungary, on March 10, 2016. Russian news reports say the hatch of a cargo plane carrying precious metals accidentally flew open upon takeoff â€” scattering at least 3 tons of gold on the runway.\nAn investigation is underway after the incident Thursday at the airport in the far east city of Yakutsk, according to the Tass news agency. \nAn An-12 plane operated by the airline Nimbus took off for Krasnoyarsk carrying 9.3 tons of gold and other precious metals, according to a statement from the state Investigative Committee quoted by Tass. Damage to a door handle caused it to fly open and spill some of the metal. \nAuthorities recovered 172 gold bars weighing 3.4 tons, Tass quoted Interior Ministry officials as saying. \nNo one was hurt in the incident. Images circulating on social media showed gold bars scattered across a runway. ",
