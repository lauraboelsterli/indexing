    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Big Lots, Inc. (NYSE: BIG) today reported income of $104.8 million, or $2.46 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ended February 3, 2018. This result includes a provisional tax expense of $4.5 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, associated with the revaluation of deferred tax assets resulting from new corporate tax legislation (impact described later in this release). Excluding this expense, adjusted income totaled $109.3 million, or $2.57 per diluted share (see non-GAAP table included later in this release), which exceeds our previously communicated guidance of income of $2.35 to $2.40 per diluted share, and represents a 14% increase compared to adjusted income of $102.0 million, or $2.26 per diluted share (non-GAAP), for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 included an extra week of operations as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 due to a shift in the retail calendar. We estimate the impact of the extra week was approximately $0.09 per diluted share. Comparable store sales decreased 0.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to our guidance of flat to an increase of 2%. Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were $1,642.1 million compared to $1,579.2 million for the same period last year with the increase resulting from the extra week, partially offset by a lower store count year-over-year.\nFOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nAdjusted income of $2.57 per diluted share (non-GAAP), a 14% increase compared to last year's adjusted income of $2.26 per diluted share (non-GAAP) Seventeenth consecutive quarter of EPS equal to or better than guidance\nEarnings per Share\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nEarnings per diluted share\n$2.46\n$1.99\n$4.38\n$3.32\nImpact of write down of deferred tax assets (1)\n$0.11\n-\n$0.10\n-\nImpact of gain from insurance recoveries (1)\n-\n-\n($0.04)\n-\nImpact of legacy pension costs (1)\n-\n$0.32\n-\n$0.37\nImpact of gain on sale of real estate (1)\n-\n($0.05)\n-\n($0.05)\nEarnings per diluted share - adjusted basis\n$2.57\n$2.26\n$4.45\n$3.64\n% change to LY\n+14%\n+22%\n(1) Non-GAAP detailed reconciliation provided in our statements below.\nFISCAL 2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nAdjusted income of $4.45 per diluted share (non-GAAP), a 22% increase compared to fiscal 2016 adjusted income of $3.64 per diluted share (non-GAAP) Returned $195 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases\nFISCAL 2017\nFor fiscal 2017, income totaled $189.8 million, or $4.38 per diluted share. Excluding a gain on insurance recoveries reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and the provisional expense associated with the revaluation of deferred tax assets noted above, adjusted income for the full year period ended February 3, 2018, totaled $192.5 million, or $4.45 per diluted share (non-GAAP), a 22% increase compared to adjusted income of $167.2 million, or $3.64 per diluted share (non-GAAP), for fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales increased 0.4% for fiscal 2017. Net sales for fiscal 2017 were $5,271.0 million compared to $5,200.4 with the increase resulting from the extra week of operations partially offset by a lower store count year-over-year. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP amounts to the most comparable GAAP amounts is provided later in this release.\nInventory and Cash Management\nInventory ended fiscal 2017 at $873 million, a 1.6% increase compared to $859 million for fiscal 2016. Inventory levels per store increased 3% compared to last year, partially offset by a lower store count year-over-year.\nWe ended fiscal 2017 with $51 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents and $200 million of borrowings under our credit facility compared to $51 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents and $106 million of borrowings under our credit facility as of the end of fiscal 2016. Cash flow (cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was focused on returning cash to our shareholders.\nTotal Cash Returned To Shareholders\nFor fiscal 2017, we returned $195 million of cash to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividend payments totaling $45 million and share repurchases totaling $150 million.\nImpact of Corporate Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Job Act was enacted into law with new tax provisions effective January 1, 2018. The legislation reduces the U.S. corporate tax rate which lowered the Big Lots blended tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2017, and in the future. As a result of the lower tax rate, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax assets resulting in a provisional tax expense of $4.5 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company also expects to realize a cash benefit from a lower tax rate in fiscal 2018 and is planning to reinvest into the business approximately 70% of the expected benefit while returning approximately 30% of the expected benefit to shareholders. In terms of reinvestment, the Company plans to strategically focus our reinvestment primarily toward our Associates to increase engagement, improve competitive positioning, and enhance our comprehensive benefits offering with the goal of becoming more of an employer of choice.\nFISCAL 2018 GUIDANCE\nForecasting fiscal 2018 income in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per diluted share representing a 7% to 11% increase compared to fiscal 2017 adjusted income of $4.45 per diluted share (non-GAAP) Forecasting comparable store sales to increase in the low single digit range Forecasting cash flow of approximately $120 to $130 million Forecasting cash returned to shareholders of approximately $150 million, including share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments\nWe estimate fiscal 2018 income will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per diluted share, compared to adjusted income of $4.45 per diluted share (non-GAAP) for fiscal 2017. This guidance is based on a comparable store sales increase in the low single digit range and total sales flat to up slightly. We estimate this financial performance will result in cash flow of approximately $120 to $130 million.\nOn March 7, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (\"2018 Share Repurchase Program\") providing for the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common shares. The $100 million authorization is expected to be utilized to repurchase shares in the open market and/or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. Common shares acquired through the 2018 Share Repurchase Program will be available to meet obligations under equity compensation plans and for general corporate purposes. The 2018 Share Repurchase Program is eligible to begin on March 12, 2018 and will continue until exhausted.\nAs announced in a separate press release earlier today, on March 7, 2018, the Board of Directors increased the Company's quarterly dividend payment rate approximately 20% by declaring a quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $0.30 per common share. This dividend is payable on April 6, 2018, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 23, 2018.\nFiscal Q1 2018 Guidance\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we estimate income in the range of $1.15 to $1.22 per diluted share representing flat to a 6% increase compared to last year's income of $1.15 per diluted share. This guidance assumes a comparable store sales increase in the range of flat to slightly negative.\nQ1\nFull Year\n2018 Guidance\n2017\n2018 Guidance\n2017 (1)\nEarnings per diluted share\n$1.15 - $1.22\n$1.15\n$4.75 - $4.95\n$4.45\n(1) Non-GAAP detailed reconciliation provided below.\nCOMPANY UPDATES CEO STATUS\nAs previously announced, the Company noted that David Campisi, President and CEO, took a medical leave of absence in early December 2017 and remains on leave. During his medical leave, Mr. Campisi's executive responsibilities are continuing to be overseen by Lisa M. Bachmann, Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising & Operating Officer, and Timothy A.

Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating performance.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/big-lots-reports-record-q4-eps-exceeding-expectations-300611297.html\nSOURCE Big Lots, Inc.",
