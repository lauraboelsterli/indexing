    "text": "Inclusion riders have been a hot topic ever since Best Actress winner Frances McDormand gave them a shout-out at this year‚Äôs Oscars ceremony, but one Hollywood director says she‚Äôs fostering diversity without them.\nOn Monday morning, a Twitter user asked Ava DuVernay, the director of the just-released blockbuster A Wrinkle in Time , whether inclusion riders‚Äî contractual clauses that call for certain hiring targets ‚Äîwere behind the diverse group of people who worked on the movie. DuVernay, who‚Äôs been sharing Instagram photos of the film‚Äôs premieres, responded: ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Instead, she said, she had simply hired ‚Äúgreat people of all kinds and colors.‚Äù\nHey @ava were Inclusion Riders how you ensured a diverse crew on #WrinkleInTime or what was the specific process you went through to make that happen? Loved seeing it on your insta story.\n‚Äî Shane Anderson (@ShaneM_Anderson) March 12, 2018\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nNope. Just hired great people of all kinds and colors. xo https://t.co/NVH61eQdEg\n‚Äî Ava DuVernay (@ava) March 12, 2018\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nA Wrinkle in Time, starring Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, and Storm Reid, helped make box-office history this weekend when it brought in $33 million, second only to Black Panther ‚Äòs $41 million for the weekend. This marks the first time that two movies with black directors and budgets of $100 million or more have held the top two box-office spots.\nMs @ava ‚Äòs brain is an Inclusion Rider üôåüèæ\n‚Äî Sareeta Domingo (@SareetaDomingo) March 12, 2018\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nIn addition to A Wrinkle in Time‚Äôs diversity , DuVernay told to The New Yorker ‚Äòs Jelani Cobb in 2017 that every episode of her television show Queen Sugar is directed by a woman. She said it was ‚Äúin the DNA‚Äù of the show and explained, ‚ÄúIn my view it‚Äôs righting a wrong. Someone came up to me and said ‚Äòyou know, you may want to be careful with this because, you know, people could see it as discrimination,‚Äô and I took a deep breath and said ‚ÄòI would welcome that conversation, I would welcome that lawsuit.‚Äô‚Ä¶ there are some shows that are using this platform as a corrective measure to highlight and to incubate and to bring more women into the industry, an industry that has shut us out.‚Äù",
