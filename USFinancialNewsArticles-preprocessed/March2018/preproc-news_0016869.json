(NASDAQ:NCSM) (“NCS” or the “Company”), a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies, today announced its results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Review\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues were $50.2 million for the quarter, an increase of $14.7 million or 42% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of sales of our completions products and services due to higher customer drilling and well completion activity, a full quarter of revenue from Spectrum Tracer Services, LLC (“Spectrum”) as well as the contributions from Repeat Precision, LLC (“Repeat Precision”). Total revenues decreased by 10% as compared to the third quarter of 2017 with a 51% increase in the U.S. offset by a 27% decrease in Canada and a 71% decrease in other countries.\nNet loss was $(3.3) million, or $(0.08) per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which included a net expense of $5.0 million ($3.7 million after tax, or $0.09 per diluted share) related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration and certain other items. Adjusted net income, which excludes these items, was $0.4 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. This compares to a net loss of $(0.9) million, or $(0.03) per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016, which included a net benefit of $0.2 million ($0.1 million after tax, or $0.00 per diluted share) related to restructuring charges, professional expenses incurred in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock (“IPO”) and acquisitions and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses. Adjusted net loss, which excludes these items, was $(1.1) million or $(0.03) per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $10.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $3.6 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 21%, as compared to 19% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenues of $201.6 million, an increase of $103.2 million, or 105% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compares to a net loss of $(17.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted net income was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an adjusted net loss of $(14.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA of $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was an increase of $35.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNCS completed its initial public offering of its common stock on May 3, 2017. Therefore, a portion of the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects a period during which the Company was privately-owned.\nCapital Expenditures and Liquidity\nThe Company received $0.1 million in proceeds from sales of property and equipment, net, during the fourth quarter of 2017. Total capital expenditures, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.0 million. These expenditures were made to support the growth of the business.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $33.8 million in cash, total availability under its revolving credit facility of $55.0 million and $27.0 million in total debt.\nReview and Outlook\nNCS’s Chief Executive Officer, Robert Nipper, commented, “Our fourth quarter results capped off a very eventful and successful year for NCS, highlighted by our IPO, our Repeat Precision Joint Venture and the Spectrum acquisition. During the quarter, our U.S. operations returned to sequential growth, driven by the full quarter contribution from our tracer diagnostic services offering and an increase in sliding sleeve sales. Our Canadian business outperformed our initial expectations for the quarter as well.\nWe increased our revenue for the full year by 105% compared to 2016, with strong growth from the U.S., Canadian and international markets, grew our Adjusted EBITDA to $49.5 million, a 25% margin, and again delivered positive free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment.\nWe have been encouraged by overall customer activity levels thus far in 2018, and continue to expect that we will be able to grow our revenues by 35% to 45% this year, as we continue to add to our customer base and deliver technology to our clients that helps them optimize well performance and field development strategies in a way that enhances their return on capital.”\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share are non-GAAP financial measures. For an explanation of these measures and a reconciliation, refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 results on Friday, March 9, 2018 at 7:30 a.m. Central Time (8:30 a.m. Eastern Time).

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance or which, in the case of share-based compensation, are non-cash in nature. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance. Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) divided by our diluted weighted average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share are important measures that exclude costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, certain costs associated with our capital structure. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share are key metrics that management uses to assess the period-to-period performance of our core business operations. We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share enables investors to assess our performance from period to period using the same metrics utilized by management and that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net (Loss) per Diluted Share enable investors to evaluate our performance relative to other companies that are not subject to such factors.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share (our “non-GAAP financial measures”) are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), are not measures of net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and are subject to important limitations. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial performance as reported under GAAP and they should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity.\nThe tables below set forth reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measure of financial performance calculated under GAAP:\nADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Effect on\nNet (Loss) Income\n(After-Tax) Impact on\nDiluted (Loss)\nEarnings Per Share Effect on\nNet Loss\n(After-Tax) Impact on\nDiluted Loss\nPer Share Effect on\nNet Income\n(After-Tax) Impact on\nDiluted Earnings\nPer Share Effect on\nNet Loss\n(After-Tax) Impact on\nDiluted Loss\nPer Share Net (loss) income attributable to\nNCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. $ (3,343 ) $ (0.08 ) $ (931 ) $ (0.03 ) $ 2,102 $ 0.05 $ (17,927 ) $ (0.53 ) Adjustments (after tax) Write-off of debt issuance costs (a) — — — — 936 0.02 — — Restructuring charges (b) — — (17 ) — — — 185 0.01 IPO-related professional expense (c) 32 — 835 0.02 1,517 0.03 1,091 0.03 Acquisition and merger costs (d) (18 ) — 184 0.01 669 0.02 822 0.02 Realized and unrealized (gains) losses (e) 49 — (1,124 ) (0.03 ) (169 ) — 1,690 0.05 Change in fair value of contingent consideration (f) 3,657 0.09 — — 3,638 0.08 — — Adjusted net income (loss) attributable\nto NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. $ 377 $ 0.01 $ (1,053 ) $ (0.03 ) $ 8,693 $ 0.20 $ (14,139 ) $ (0.42 )\nIncludes the remaining debt issuance costs of $1,422 related to the prior credit agreement that were expensed when the debt was repaid with a portion of our net proceeds from the IPO during the second quarter of 2017.
