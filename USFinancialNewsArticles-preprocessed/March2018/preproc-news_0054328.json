    "text": "MOSCOW, March 29 (Reuters) - Russia is watching closely ideas floated by British Prime Minister Theresa May to limit London’s role in marketing Russian debt to investors, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.\nSpeaking to reporters, Peskov said such ideas of limiting access to Russian debt, if implemented, would be harmful for Britain’s relations with other investors.\nAsked about a suggestion that Austria could mediate between Russia and Britain in the case of a spy poisoning in England earlier this month, Peskov told a conference call that Russia needed “any voices that can help London see sense.” (Reporting by Andrey Ostroukh Editing by Gareth Jones)\n ",
