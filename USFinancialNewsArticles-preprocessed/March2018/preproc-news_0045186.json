    "text": "(Reuters) - American Brice Garnett overcame challenging conditions to clinch a four-stroke victory at the Corales Puntacana Championship in the Dominican Republic on Sunday.\nGarnett teed off with a two-shot lead and never gave his rivals a chance by picking up three early birdies.\nHe carded an assured 70 to finish at 18-under-par 270 in strong, gusty winds and rain squalls at the Corales Golf Club.\n“Hard day but, man, this is fun,” the 34-year-old Garnett said in a greenside interview after claiming his first victory in his 88th start on the PGA Tour.\n“I felt great all day. I got off to a great start and then I was just trying to pound the greens the rest of the way in.”\nGarnett receives a two-year tour exemption for his victory.\nFellow American Kevin Mitchell carded 67 to claim second place on 14 under.\nCanadian Corey Conners, who started the day in second place, faded with a 76 to tie for 13th on 10 under, a double-bogey at the last compounding his misery.\nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Clare Fallon\n ",
