UCLA beat the Wildcats in Tucson on Feb. 8 in their only meeting this season, the Wildcats’ only home loss.\nThe Wildcats led by three points with 13 minutes remaining before taking control with a 14-0 run fueled by eight points from Ristic and two Trier free throws after a technical foul on the Colorado bench for a 58-41 lead with 10:30 remaining. They led by as many as 18.\nColorado played the final 13:08 without freshman point guard McKinley Wright IV, who had eight points, five assists and four rebounds before suffering an apparent ankle injury during a scramble for a rebound under the Colorado basket.\nWright had 16 points and 10 assists in the Buffaloes’ 80-77 victory over Arizona in Boulder on Jan. 6, and he had 20 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds in a 97-85 first-round victory over Arizona State.\nTrier made 10-of-10 free-throw attempts, and Ristic had his seventh double-double. He has scored in double figures in 13 of his last 15 games.\nThe Wildcats, third in NCAA Division I with a 51.0 shooting percentage, made only 43.9 percent from the field but had a 36-27 rebounding advantage and forced 15 turnovers. They committed eight.\nAyton, who joined Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Kevin Love as the only Pac-12 players to win player of the year and freshman of the year, made only 4-of-14 field-goal attempts and had six rebounds in 25 minutes before fouling out.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
