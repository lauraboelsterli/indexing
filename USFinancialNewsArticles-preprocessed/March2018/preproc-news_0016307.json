    "text": "EditorsNote: Update: Oregon will meet Utah in quarters, not Oregon State\nOregon guard Payton Pritchard scored 18 and made the go-ahead layup with 28 seconds remaining in overtime and MiKyle McIntosh added 18 points when the sixth-seeded Ducks advanced to the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 tournament with a sluggish 64-62 victory over Washington State at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Wednesday.\nElijah Brown had 10 points and Troy Brown had eight points and 11 rebounds for the Ducks (21-11), who did not lead until McIntosh made a layup with 59.7 seconds remaining in regulation while avenging a two-point loss to the Cougars last Thursday.\nMalachi Flynn had 22 points and Robert Franks had 16 for the Cougars (12-19), who had won two of four.\nFlynn’s 3-pointer with 31 seconds remaining sent the game into overtime at 53, and his jumper and free throw gave the Cougars a 62-59 lead with 1:20 left in overtime before the Ducks scored the final five points.\nTroy Brown made a layup to get the Ducks close, Pritchard’s layup with 28 seconds left put the Ducks ahead 63-62.\nKenny Wooten blocked a Flynn drive at the other end before Pritchard missed two free throws with nine seconds left. Troy Brown was fouled as he got the offensive rebound, and he made one two free throws with 6.8 seconds.\nWooten blocked a layup by Milan Acquaah in the final seconds to end the game.\nOregon, the defending Pac-12 tournament champion and a Final Four participant last season, will meet Utah in the quarterfinals.\nFranks’ jumper gave Washington State a 32-21 lead, their biggest of the game.\nOregon went to a full-court press with 17 minutes remaining and gradually got back into the game.\nAcquaah had 11 points and Drick Bernstine had nine rebounds for the Cougars, but Acquaah’s 3-pointer with 8:44 remaining in regulation was their last field until Flynn tied the game.\nThe Cougars were 7-of-22 from 3-point range and made a school record 341 threes, third in Pac-12 history.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
