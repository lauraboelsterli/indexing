Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), arrives to speak during the \"Europe Lecture\" of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin, Germany, March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke “We see no such risks,” Lagarde told daily la Repubblica. She also urged Italy’s next government to be fiscally responsible and understand that “revenues are just as important as expenditures.” “Those who govern understand the risk of creating instability,” she said.
