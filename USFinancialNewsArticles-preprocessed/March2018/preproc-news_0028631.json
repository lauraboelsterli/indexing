    "text": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Endocyte, Inc. (Nasdaq:ECYT), a biopharmaceutical company developing targeted therapeutics for personalized cancer treatment, today announced the nomination of Dawn Svoronos for election to its Board of Directors at the upcoming annual stockholders meeting.\n“We are excited to have Dawn stand for election to join our Board of Directors,” said Mike Sherman, president and CEO of Endocyte. “She has an outstanding track record of leadership at Merck and significant experience as a Board Director at several life science companies. Her success in global commercial leadership roles will be particularly valuable as we prepare for potential commercialization of 177 Lu-PSMA-617.”\nMs. Svoronos has more than 30 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry, including her tenure as President of Merck & Company's Europe/Canada region. Additionally, her previously held positions with Merck include President of Merck in Canada, Vice President of Asia Pacific and Vice President of Global Marketing for the Arthritis, Analgesics and Osteoporosis franchise. Ms. Svoronos previously served on the board of Medivation Inc., where she also acted as interim Chief Commercial Officer as the company successfully marketed Xtandi ® in advanced prostate cancer. She is currently Chair of the Board of Directors for Theratechnologies, Inc. and is a member of the Board of Directors at Xenon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., PTC Therapeutics, Inc., and AgNovos Healthcare Company.\nBoard Succession Process\nFollowing the successful repositioning of the company through the recent in-license of global rights to PSMA-617 and the anticipated initiation of a Phase 3 registration trial, the Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has been conducting a succession planning review of the Board’s composition and tenure, including discussions with Board members about their individual plans. As part of that process, three of Endocyte’s current directors, Keith E. Brauer, Ann F. Hanham and Peter D. Meldrum, each of whom are members of Class II of the Board and whose current term expires at the Company’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, informed the Committee that in support of Board succession plans, they would not stand for re-election at the 2018 annual meeting. Patrick Machado, a current Class II director, and Dawn Svoronos will stand for election in this class, along with Dr. Lesley Russell, currently a Class I director. Subject to her election as a Class II director, Dr. Russell will resign as a Class I director in order to balance the company’s three director classes.\n“I would like to thank Pete, Ann and Keith for their outstanding service to our Board and playing important roles on Board committees,” said John Aplin, Chairman of the Board. “Their leadership has been instrumental in positioning the company with exciting programs in the fields of radioligand and adaptor-controlled CAR T-cell therapies. Their support in this Board transition will facilitate our ongoing efforts to ensure Endocyte’s Board brings fresh perspectives and capabilities that align with our preparation for potential commercial opportunities.”\nWebsite Information\nEndocyte routinely posts important information for investors on its website, www.endocyte.com , in the “Investors & News” section.
