Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. THE GLOBE AND MAIL ** An online protest against Mountain Equipment Co-op last weekend was a small one but it quickly led to a big decision: On Thursday, the outdoor-gear retailer cut ties with brands that make water bottles and stand-up paddleboards but are owned by a U.S. company that also sells assault rifles and ammunition. )( tgam.ca/2F5ENlz ) ** Calgary-based Tervita Corp, which handles energy-industry waste as well as industrial contracts, is combining with Newalta Corp, which focuses on servicing heavy-oil clients, in an all-stock deal. ( tgam.ca/2CSGJrV ) ** Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has sent out a memo to its mortgage specialists that said, as of Feb. 1, it has ended its Foreign Income Program and will introduce more stringent requirements for foreign clients. ( tgam.ca/2CShu90 ) NATIONAL POST ** U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports left Canadian companies in a cloud of uncertainty Thursday, jolting stock prices and leaving experts to parse how the punitive action might be enforced.
