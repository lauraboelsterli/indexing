    "text": "BOSTON, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Battery Ventures, a global technology investment firm, announced it has acquired Plixer, a 19-year old company based in Kennebunk, ME that makes mission-critical technology to help companies better analyze their computer network traffic in today’s cloud and hybrid-cloud environments, including information flows related to security breaches. As part of the transaction, Battery General Partner Russell Fleischer; Battery Principal Jordan Welu; and Battery Vice President Sabrina Chiasson are joining Plixer’s board. Specific terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nBattery also announced that longtime networking-industry executive Jeff Lindholm will join Plixer as CEO. Lindholm was most recently the senior vice-president of worldwide sales at Brocade Communications, and previously held senior sales and marketing roles at Arbor Networks and Juniper Networks.\nPlixer’s two founders, Michael Patterson and Marc Bilodeau, will remain active with the business. The company’s employees—almost all of whom work out of an office on Main Street in Kennebunk—will remain in their current locations.\n“We are thrilled to partner with Plixer, a bootstrapped company that Michael and Marc have built into a robust business attuned to solving the complex networking and security challenges modern companies face,” said Battery’s Fleischer. “We look forward to working with them, and Jeff, to augment the company’s growth organically and through potential acquisitions. We’re also excited to back a growing technology firm based nearby in New England.”\nLindholm said: “I’m also excited to partner again with Battery, which was an investor in Arbor Networks. Specifically, I look forward to tapping the firm’s networking and enterprise-IT expertise to further innovate and expand Plixer’s product line, align with new technology partners, aggressively attract new clients and further enhance the value we are delivering to existing customers.”\nPlixer—known for easy-to-deploy, highly intuitive and effective networking software--helps companies identify reasons for slowness in their networks, as well as potential security breaches and hacks.
