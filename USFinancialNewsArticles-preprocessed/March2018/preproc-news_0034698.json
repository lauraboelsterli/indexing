    "text": " Canadian Banc Corp. (The \"Company\") declares its monthly distribution of $0.11483 for each Class A share and $0.04167 for each Preferred share.\nUnder the distribution policy announced in September 2013, the monthly dividend payable on the Class A shares is determined by applying a 10% annualized rate on the volume weighted average market price (VWAP) of the Class A shares over the last 3 trading days of the preceding month. As a result, Class A shareholders of record on March 29, 2018 will receive a dividend of $0.11483 per share based on the VWAP of $13.78 payable on April 10, 2018. The yield will remain stable at 10.00% (based on the VWAP) under this distribution policy.\nPreferred shareholders continue to receive prime plus 0.75% with a minimum rate of 5.00%.\nSince inception Class A shareholders have received a total of $13.52 per share and Preferred shareholders have received a total of $6.77 per share inclusive of this distribution, for a combined total of $20.29.\nThe Company invests in a portfolio of six publicly traded Canadian Banks as follows: Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank. Shares held within the portfolio are expected to range between 5-20% in weight but may vary at any time. To generate additional returns above the dividend income earned on the portfolio, The Company engages in a selective covered call writing program.\nDistribution Details Class A Share (BK) $0.11483 Preferred Share (BK.PR.A) $0.04167\nLocal: 416-304-4443\nwww.canadianbanc.com\ninfo@quadravest.com\nSource:Canadian Banc Corp.",
