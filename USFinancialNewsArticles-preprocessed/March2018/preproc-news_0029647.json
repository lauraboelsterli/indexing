    "text": "Otto Porter Jr. led six Washington players in double figures with 19 points and the Wizards cooled off the New Orleans Pelicans with a 116-97 victory Friday night at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.\nThe Pelicans had won a franchise-record 10 games in a row, but were playing without All-Star forward Anthony Davis because of a sprained ankle he suffered two nights earlier in a victory at Sacramento.\nMarkieff Morris added 17 points, Bradley Beal scored 16, Mike Scott had 14, Kelly Oubre Jr. had 11 and Jodie Meeks 10 for Washington, which played its 18th consecutive game without star guard John Wall, who is recovering from knee surgery.\nDarius Miller came off the bench to lead led the Pelicans with 20 points, Cheick Diallo scored 14, Rajon Rondo had 11 and DeAndre Liggins scored 10. Nikola Mirotic started in Davis’ place and finished with nine points, making 3-of-11 shots and missing all four 3-pointers, and 12 rebounds. Jrue Holiday, who entered the game averaging 19.4 points, finished with four on 2-of-8 shooting. The Pelicans bench outscored the starters, 59-38.\nNew Orleans entered the game averaging 112.5 points per game, third-highest in the NBA, but struggled to score without Davis.\nThe Wizards led by 15 at halftime and Porter made a 3-pointer to help them increase the lead to 18 early in the third quarter.\nBeal made two 3-pointers and Porter Jr. made one as Washington expanded the margin to 80-53 before taking an 83-62 lead after three quarters.\nLiggins gave New Orleans a brief lift in the fourth with eight points to cut the deficit to 18, but the Wizards rebuilt the lead to 25 midway through the quarter.\nBoth teams were 0 for 4 on 3-pointers in a low-scoring first quarter that ended with Washington holding a 22-19 lead behind Porter’s eight points.\nMiller scored four points as New Orleans edged in front, 27-26, before going cold.\nScott scored seven points and Porter scored six as the Wizards surged to a 47-31 lead.\nRondo gave the Pelicans a lift with six points but Washington maintained a 53-38 lead at halftime.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
