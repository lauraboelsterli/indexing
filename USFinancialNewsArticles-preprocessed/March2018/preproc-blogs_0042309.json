    "text": "The Times reported that Trump was angry that Dowd, who had originally claimed to be speaking on the president's behalf in that call, had backtracked by claiming he was actually not speaking for Trump. Jin Lee | Bloomberg | Getty Images John Dowd \nMueller is investigating the role Russians played in trying to illegally influence the presidential election and is looking into whether associates of Trump colluded with Russians. \nTrump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. \nThe president has also scoffed at reports that he was unhappy with Dowd. Tweet \nDowd is leaving just three days after former federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova was added to Trump's legal team for that probe. \nDiGenova has claimed, without providing solid evidence, that the FBI and Justice Department cooked up evidence to make Trump look bad in an effort to help the presidential candidacy of Hillary Clinton . \n\"There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn't win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,\" diGenova told Fox News in January. \n\"Make no mistake about it: A group of FBI and DOJ people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.\" \nOn Tuesday, after a Washington Post report that Trump wanted to add high-powered lawyer Theodore Olson to his legal team , a partner at Olson's firm tweeted that Olson would not be representing the president. \nOther top-tier attorneys, such as Robert Bennett and Emmet Flood, both of whom represented President Bill Clinton, have reportedly turned down chances to join Trump's defense team. \nLast week, the Federal Election Commission notified Trump's 2020 presidential campaign that Dowd was one of 108 donors to that campaign who had given more money than is legally allowed. \nDowd had contributed $3,000, which is $300 above the limit, according to the FEC's tally. \nTrump campaign treasurer Bradley Crate told CNBC the campaign had sent Dowd refund check for the $300 in January, after the time period whose records were cited by the FEC. \nâ€” Additional reporting by CNBC's Eamon Javers WATCH: Dowd wishes Trump well show chapters",
