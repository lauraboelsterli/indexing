    "text": "Jon Elmore scored 23 points as Marshall knocked off No. 24 Middle Tennessee 76-67 and ended the Blue Raiders’ 11-game winning streak Saturday night at the Murphy Center in Murfreesboro, Tenn.\nC.J. Burks added 20 points as the Thundering Herd (21-10, 12-6 Conference USA) completed a season sweep of the Blue Raiders.\nElmore made only 6 of 17 from the field and missed 8 of 10 3-point attempts but made 9 of 12 free throw tries. Burks shot 7 of 12 from the floor and made all four 3-point attempts.\nJannson Williams added 13 points for Marshall, which shot 47.2 percent and made 81.5 percent (22 of 27) from the free throw line.\nBrandon Walters led Middle Tennessee (24-6, 16-2) with 20 points and Nick King added 18. Giddy Potts was held to 11 on 4-of-13 shooting as the Blue Raiders shot 41.7 percent and missed 13 of 26 free throws in their first loss since a 10-point defeat at Marshall on Jan. 18.\nThe teams were locked in a 54-all deadlock when Potts drained a corner 3-pointer with 9:14 left. Middle Tennessee’s last lead was 57-56 on two free throws by Potts with 8:28 remaining after Marshall coach Dan D’Antoni was called for a technical foul\nMarshall never trailed after Elmore hit two free throws with 8:28 remaining and hiked its lead to 69-61 on two more free throws by Elmore with 72 seconds remaining. A jumper by Tyrik Dixon cut the deficit to 72-67 with 30 seconds remaining but Elmore hit two free throws with 23 seconds left after Blue Raiders coach Kermit Davis was called for a technical foul.\nThe Blue Raiders trailed at halftime for the first time since the previous meeting with Marshall as they faced a 36-33 deficit. The Blue Raiders held a 23-22 lead on a basket by King with 5:44 left but Elmore’s 3-pointer capped an 8-0 run with 3:45 remaining.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
