    "text": "JERSEY CITY, N.J., March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SITO Mobile Ltd. (NASDAQ:SITO), an insights-driven Consumer Behavior and Location Sciences™ company, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full- 2017.\nFourth Quarter Financial and Recent Business Highlights\nFourth quarter media placement revenues more than doubled to $14.7 million compared to media placement revenues of $7.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016\nNet loss of $6.9 million in fourth quarter compared to a net loss of $1.5 million in the corresponding period of 2016. The net loss reflects, among other things, (i) a $3.5 million expense related to the settlement of litigation and termination of the IP revenue sharing agreement with TAR SITO LendCo LLC and (ii) a $2.2 million expense relating to the accrual of bonuses earned by the Company’s executive management team under their respective employment agreements with the Company, in connection with the achievement of certain performance-based targets\nGenerated Adjusted EBITDA* loss of $38,700 for the fourth quarter of 2017\nSubsequent to quarter-end, closed a $14.8 million public equity offering, strengthening SITO’s capital position and balance sheet\nSubsequent to quarter-end, terminated IP revenue sharing agreement with TAR SITO LendCo LLC and settled all related litigations for $3.5 million\nSubsequent to quarter-end, appointed Bruce Rogers, former Chief Insights Officer and veteran of Forbes Media, as SITO’s Head of Marketing\n“2017 was a transformative year for SITO and with a new leadership team and insights-driven strategy firmly in place, we are well positioned to further accelerate growth in 2018,” said Tom Pallack, SITO’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are advancing efforts to reposition SITO’s location-based, proprietary, data-driven mobile solutions to larger customers. During the fourth quarter we launched paid confirmation pilot programs with an increasing number of Fortune 500 brands, designed to test and validate our offering which is an important milestone ahead of the contracting phase for multi-year opportunities with potential customers.”\n“Our fourth quarter results were highlighted by record revenues and strong bookings in our core media business,” Pallack added. “In addition, the deployment of new consumer insight-driven programs with existing customers provided an initial base of syndicated and recurring, data-driven revenues that will scale as we continue to roll-out programs with customers in the first quarter in 2018 and beyond.”\nPallack concluded, “We entered 2018 with strong business momentum and following the recent capital raise, we are now in a stronger position to advance new customer engagements and larger deals. Based on our bookings to date, we expect to generate at least $10.0 million in media placement revenue in the first quarter of 2018 (compared to $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2017).”\nFourth Quarter Financial Summary\nTotal revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased 97%, or $7.2 million, to $14.7 million compared to $7.5 million in the corresponding period of 2016. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of campaigns as the Company continues to expand its direct sales force and increase its customer base.\nGross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $6.8 million, or 46% of total revenue, compared to $3.7 million, or 50% of total revenue, in the corresponding period of 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by change in our advertising mix year over year.\nLoss from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $6.9 million, which reflects, among other things, (i) a $3.5 million expense related to the settlement of litigation and termination of the IP revenue sharing agreement with TAR SITO LendCo LLC and (ii) a $2.2 million expense relating to the accrual of bonuses earned by the Company’s executive management team under their respective employment agreements with the Company, in connection with the achievement of certain performance-based targets.\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $6.9 million, or ($0.31) per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.5 million, or ($0.07) per basic and diluted share, in the corresponding period of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA* for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was a loss of $38,700 compared to a loss of $531,700 in the corresponding period of 2016.\n* SITO Mobile has presented Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, because many of our investors use these non-GAAP measures to monitor the Company’s performance. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a quantitative assessment of a Company’s performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. It should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measures as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance .\nFull-Year Financial Summary\nTotal revenue for the full- 2017 increased 46%, or $13.7 million, to $43.1 million compared to $29.4 million in 2016. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in the number of campaigns as the Company continues to expand its direct sales force and increase its customer base.\nGross profit for the full-year 2017 was $20.9 million, or 48% of total revenue, compared to $15.7 million, or 53% of total revenue, in 2016. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by increased revenues. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by a change in our advertising mix year over year.\nLoss from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $14.3 million, which reflects, among other things, a $6.8 million increase in general and administrative costs, $6.7 million of certain non-recurring expenses primarily related to litigation and other legal matters and a $4.1 million increase in sales and marketing expense related to expansion of the direct sales force and customer management personnel, which trends in line with the increase in media placement revenue. This was partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $5.1 million.\nNet loss for the full-year 2017 was $14.6 million, or ($0.69) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.4 million, or $(0.08) per basic and diluted share, for 2016. The decline in net income was primarily due to a $6.8 million increase in general and administrative costs excluding $6.7 million of certain non-recurring expenses primarily related to litigation and other legal matters, a $4.1 million increase in sales and marketing expense related to expansion of the direct sales force and customer management personnel, which trends in line with the increase in media placement revenue, and a $2.2 million increase in the loss from discontinued operations, which was partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $5.1 million.\nCash used in operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $3.1 million compared to $889,000 for 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA* for full-year 2017 was a loss of $133,800 compared to positive Adjusted EBITDA of $939,200 in 2016.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nThe Company ended the year with $3.6 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $8.7 million at December 31, 2016. Subsequent to December 31, 2017 the Company closed a $14.8 million public offering; and terminated the IP revenue sharing agreement with TAR SITO LendCo LLC and settled all related litigations for $3.5 million. The net effect of these subsequent events strengthens SITO’s capital position and balance sheet. Management believes current cash levels and cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the next 12 months.\nConference call information:\nDate: Wednesday, March 21, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET)\nDial in Number for U.S. & Canadian Callers: 877-407-8293\nDial in Number for International Callers (Outside U.S. & Canada): 201-689-8349\nThe conference call will also be webcasted live on the Investor Relations section of SITO’s IR web site at http://ir.sitomobile.com/ir-calendar .\nA replay will be available for two weeks starting on March 21, 2018 at approximately 8 p.m. ET.

We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and Adjusted EBITDA, as EBITDA before stock based compensation, certain non-recurring professional expenses related to pending or threatened contested solicitations of the Company’s shareholdlers, investigations of former executives, defense of certain class action lawsuits and implementation of a section 382 rights plan. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful performance measures used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance and earnings on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) can provide alone. The non-GAAP measures included in this release, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the financial tables included below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Certain Forward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains .
