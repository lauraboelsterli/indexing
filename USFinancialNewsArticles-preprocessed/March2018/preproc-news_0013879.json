It will be held under a canvas tent emblematic of Graham’s 1949 Los Angeles revival that marked his breakthrough as an evangelist.\nTrump, a Republican, will take his place among about 2,300 invited guests, along with first lady Melania Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, organizers said. Ahead of the funeral, Trump met with Graham’s family, pool reports said.\nGraham became the de facto White House chaplain to several U.S. presidents, most famously Richard Nixon. He also met with scores of world leaders and was the first noted evangelist to take his message behind the Iron Curtain.\nGraham’s son, the Reverend Franklin Graham, will deliver the eulogy at the funeral service.\nGraham's headstone will carry his name, dates of birth and death and the inscription \"Preacher of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ\" above the Bible reference \"John 14:6.\" bit.ly/2oBKayV\nAccording to his ministry, Graham preached Christianity to more people than anyone else in history.\nBut Graham found himself at times in controversy over his disapproving stand on gay rights, as well as over a secretly recorded conversation with Nixon in which the cleric complained that Jews had too much influence on the U.S. media.\nAdditional reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington and Jeff Mason in Charlotte, North Carolina; writing by Ian Simpson and Jon Herskovitz; editing by Cynthia Osterman and Jonathan Oatis\n ",
