    "text": "Pre-tax, pre-provision income up 14% compared to last year\nAdjusted cash earnings per common share of $0.75 up 23% from last year\nPositive operating leverage and common share dividend increase\n“CWB is off to a great start in fiscal 2018. Strong first quarter financial performance included record pre-tax, pre-provision income, record common shareholders’ net income and 23% growth of adjusted cash earnings per share from the first quarter last year. We also delivered positive operating leverage and strong credit quality, including a lower balance of gross impaired loans compared to last quarter and a provision for credit losses at the low end of our historical range,” said Chris Fowler, President and CEO. “With continued strong execution of CWB’s Balanced Growth strategy, and supported by our very strong capital position, we’re pleased to deliver to our shareholders another common share dividend increase this quarter.”\n“We were also excited to close our largest ever portfolio acquisition on the last day of the quarter. The $850 million of assets we acquired are right on strategy and we expect the transaction to be accretive immediately. With more than 75% of the portfolio originated in Central and Eastern Canada, this transaction moves us further toward our strategic goal to grow CWB’s Ontario loans to 30% of our total. Most importantly, the acquisition allows us to introduce 3,000 business owners to CWB Financial Group, with the opportunity to develop full-service relationships with targeted clients across the country. We are already working hard to deliver exceptional experiences to these prospects, and I want to thank our people for their teamwork and dedication in bringing this important deal over the finish line.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights (1) (compared to the same period in the prior year)\nVery strong operating performance with record common shareholders’ net income of $62 million, up 25%, record pre-tax, pre-provision income of $107 million, up 14%, and strong 10% growth of total revenue to $193 million. Diluted and adjusted cash earnings per common share of $0.69 and $0.75, both 23% higher. One-time gains related to the appointment of successor trustees for certain Canadian Western Trust (CWT) accounts contributed approximately $0.03 to adjusted cash earnings per common share. Operating leverage of 3.9%. Strong execution of CWB’s balanced growth strategy with 11% loan growth, including approximately $850 million of business lending assets acquired on January 31, 2018; the acquired assets are broadly diversified across Canada in the equipment finance and leasing, and general commercial lending sectors. Strong execution of CWB’s funding diversification strategy, with 4% growth of branch-raised deposits, including 14% growth of fixed term funding, as well as increased use of both securitization and capital markets funding. Of note, CWB completed the asset purchase at quarter end with no increase in broker-sourced deposits as a proportion of total funding. Net interest margin of 2.52%, up six basis points. Strong credit quality, with the provision for credit losses as a percentage of average loans at 18 basis points, down from 27 basis points last year and 20 basis points last quarter. Gross impaired loans represented 0.57% of total loans, consistent with last year and down from 0.72% in the previous quarter. Very strong Basel III regulatory capital ratios under the Standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets of 9.4% common equity Tier 1 (CET1), 10.6% Tier 1 and 12.3% Total capital, including the impact of the assets acquired on January 31, 2018.\nCommon share dividend declared on March 7 of $0.25 per share, up two cents, or 9%, from the dividend declared one year ago and one cent, or 4%, from the dividend declared last quarter.\n(1) Highlights include certain non-IFRS measures – refer to definitions following the table of Selected Financial Highlights on page 21.\nEDMONTON, Alberta, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Canadian Western Bank (TSX:CWB) (CWB) today announced very strong operating performance with record common shareholders’ net income of $62 million and record pre-tax, pre-provision income of $107 million, up 25% and 14%, respectively, from the first quarter last year. Total revenue of $193 million was up 10% from last year, including a 10% increase in net interest income and 13% growth in non-interest income. Of note, first quarter total revenue includes pre-tax gains of approximately $3 million related to the process to appoint successor trustees for clients holding certain securities within CWT self-directed accounts. Further such appointments may occur but related gains on sale are not expected to be material. Net interest margin of 2.52% was up six basis points from last year. Total loans increased 11%, with 3% contributed from the January 31 acquisition of approximately $850 million of business lending assets in the equipment finance and leasing and general commercial segments. Credit quality was strong, with the provision for credit losses representing 18 basis points of average loans compared to 27 basis points last year. These factors were partly offset within common shareholders’ net income by increases in non-interest expenses and acquisition-related fair value changes. Diluted and adjusted cash earnings per common share of $0.69 and $0.75 were both up 23% from last year. The CWT-related gains contributed approximately $0.03 of adjusted cash earnings per common share this quarter.\nCompared to the prior quarter, common shareholders’ net income and pre-tax, pre-provision income were up 2% and 3%, respectively. Total revenue was down 1%, as growth of net interest income was offset by lower non-interest income. Lower non-interest income mainly reflects smaller gains this quarter related to the process to appoint successor trustees for CWT accounts holding certain securities. Total loans increased 4%, or 1% excluding assets acquired on January 31. Net interest margin was down 11 basis points, mainly reflecting conservative funding and liquidity management in anticipation of the asset purchase at quarter end. The provision for credit losses of 18 basis points of average loans was down from 20 basis points last quarter. Non-interest expenses were 6% lower, while acquisition-related fair value changes increased with sustained strong performance of CWB Maxium. Diluted and adjusted cash earnings per common share were both 1% higher than last quarter, during which the CWT-related gains contributed approximately $0.06 of adjusted cash earnings per common share.\nExecution of CWB Financial Group’s Balanced Growth strategy\nBalanced Growth Objective Strategic Execution Full-service client growth with a focus on business owners, including further geographic and industry diversification\n11% annual loan growth including the acquisition of approximately $850 million of assets, and 3,000 relationships with business borrowers concentrated in Central and Eastern Canada. 8% organic loan growth, including 15% growth outside of Alberta. Proportion of loan portfolio in Central and Eastern Canada increased to 26% from 20% one year ago, with Ontario up to 21% from 16%. Increased business diversification with 23% annual growth of general commercial loans and 22% growth of equipment financing and leasing. Growth and diversification of funding sources\n4% growth of branch-raised deposits, including 14% growth of fixed term funding and stable balances of lower cost demand and notice deposits. Increased use of securitization, with the acquired portfolio primarily funded through CWB’s established securitization channels. Increased use of debt capital markets with two successful senior deposit note issuances totaling $600 million in the first quarter. Optimized capital management through transition to the Advanced Internal Ratings Based Approach (AIRB) On track for transition to the AIRB approach in 2020, subject to regulatory approval. Balanced Growth of assets and funding sources\nTotal loans at January 31, 2018 of $24,393 million were up 11% from last year and 4% from the prior quarter. This includes the approximately $850 million portfolio acquired on the last day of the first quarter. The composition of year-over-year loan growth was consistent with CWB’s Balanced Growth strategy, including further industry and geographic diversification. Approximately 80% of the acquired portfolio is comprised of equipment financing and leasing exposures, with the remaining 20% made up of general commercial loans. More than 75% of the acquired assets are concentrated in Central and Eastern Canada, with Ontario representing approximately 60%. Ontario accounted for 70% of CWB’s loan growth from last year, reflecting the combined impact of acquired growth and ongoing strong performance from CWB’s previously established businesses with a national footprint, including CWB Maxium, CWB Optimum Mortgage, National Leasing, and CWB Franchise Finance. Central and Eastern Canada now account for 26% of CWB’s total loan portfolio, up from 20% last year. British Columbia represents 34%, and Alberta comprises 32% of the total.\nCWB also continues to execute on key strategic objectives to grow and diversify core funding sources. Total deposits increased 10% from January 31, 2017. Branch-raised deposits were up 4% on an annual basis, including very strong 14% growth of branch-raised term deposits. Lower-cost branch-raised demand and notice deposit balances were relatively stable compared to the first quarter last year. We doubled the balance of outstanding securitization funding compared to one year ago, and increased the proportion of total funding from capital markets to 12% from 9%. Increased securitization primarily reflects our success in funding the January 31 asset purchase mainly through CWB’s existing securitization channels. Of note, there was no increase in broker-sourced deposits as a proportion of total funding this quarter. Growth of funding from capital markets reflects the impact of four successful senior deposit note issuances totaling $1.3 billion over the past twelve months.\nOngoing enhancements to CWB’s client experience in support of full-service client relationships\nCWB continues to deliver enhanced client experiences through a number of targeted initiatives. We were excited to launch the pilot phase of our Virtual Branch this quarter, which promises to be a differentiated remote banking experience for business owners. CWB’s Virtual Branch offers access to high-touch, personal client service from experienced commercial banking relationship managers and cash management specialists. This unique approach to remote service delivery is complemented by convenient on-line banking options, including our recently deployed remote deposit capture technology. We also further improved CWB’s on-line wire transfer capabilities this quarter to enable business owners to send payments in over 130 currencies to more than 200 countries. This will complement the introduction of next generation online banking tools for businesses, which will allow clients to house their business and personal banking on a common platform. These are key steps to enhance CWB’s full-service banking experience for business owners. Together we expect these initiatives to improve our client experience and support development of broader client relationships across the country.\nStrong Credit Quality\nStrong overall credit quality continues to reflect CWB’s secured lending business model, disciplined underwriting practices and proactive loan management. Gross impaired loans this quarter totaled $137 million and represented 0.57% of total loans. This compares to $124 million, or 0.57%, last year and $168 million, or 0.72%, last quarter. While Alberta-based loans comprised 32% of CWB’s total portfolio at January 31, 2018, Alberta-based impaired loans accounted for 58% of total impairments this quarter, up from 41% in the same period last year and down from 63% last quarter. The relative concentration of impaired loans in Alberta continues to reflect the lagging impacts of the 2015 – 2016 regional recession, and is consistent with management’s expectations. Gross impairments outside of Alberta represented 0.36% of total non-Alberta loans, compared to 0.52% last year and 0.40% in the prior quarter.\nThe first quarter provision for credit losses of 18 basis points of average loans was down from 27 basis points in the same period last year and 20 basis points in the prior quarter. The level of the provision in each of the last three quarters is consistent with CWB’s traditional range of 18 – 23 basis points.\nAlthough periodic increases in the balance of impaired loans may occur, loss rates on current and future impaired loans are expected to be consistent with CWB’s prior experience, where write-offs have been low as a percentage of impaired loans. We continue to carefully monitor the loan portfolio for signs of weakness.\nEfficient operations and positive operating leverage\nThe first quarter efficiency ratio of 44.6%, which measures non-interest expenses, excluding the pre-tax amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, divided by total revenue, compares favourably with 46.2% in the same period last year and 46.8% in the previous quarter.\nOperating leverage, which is calculated as the growth rate of total revenue less the growth rate of non-interest expenses, excluding the pre-tax amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, over the same period last year was positive 3.9%, compared to 2.4% last year and 1.0% in the prior quarter.\nPrudent capital management and dividends\nAt January 31, 2018, CWB’s capital ratios were 9.4% CET1, 10.6% Tier 1 and 12.3% Total capital. With a very strong capital position under the more conservative Standardized approach for calculating risk weighted assets, CWB is well-positioned to create value for shareholders through a range of capital deployment options consistent with our balanced growth strategy. Ongoing support and development of each of CWB’s businesses will remain a key priority, and we will continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions.\nWe evaluate common share dividend increases every quarter against our dividend payout ratio target of approximately 30% of common shareholders’ net income, the current strength of our capital position, as well as capital requirements under the Standardized approach to support ongoing strong and balanced asset growth. The common share dividend declared yesterday of $0.25 per share is up two cents, or 9%, from the dividend declared one year ago and one cent, or 4%, from the dividend declared last quarter. While the dividend payout ratio this quarter was approximately 34%, we expect earnings growth to result in migration of this metric toward 30% while supporting our track record of dividend increases over the medium-term.\nMedium-term Performance Target Ranges\nCWB’s performance target ranges for key financial metrics reflect the objectives embedded within CWB’s strategic direction and a time horizon consistent with the longer-term interests of our shareholders. These targets are based on expectations for moderate economic growth and a relatively stable net interest margin environment in Canada over the three- to five-year forecast horizon. Our target ranges are presented in the following table:\nKey Metrics (1)\nMedium-term\nPerformance Target\nRanges\nCurrent Context\nAdjusted cash earnings per common share growth 7 - 12% Exceeded target at 23%. Adjusted return on common shareholders’ equity 12 - 15% Met target at 12%. Operating leverage Positive Met target at positive 3.9%. Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the Standardized approach Strong Delivered a very strong ratio of 9.4%. Common share dividend payout ratio ~30% Delivered 34%, with an increase in the quarterly common share dividend declared to $0.25.

Statements of this type are included in the Annual Report and reports to shareholders and may be included in filings with Canadian securities regulators or in other communications such as press releases and corporate presentations. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about CWB’s objectives and strategies, targeted and expected financial results and the outlook for CWB’s businesses or for the Canadian economy. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”, “may increase”, “may impact”, “goal”, “focus”, “potential”, “proposed” and other similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will”, “should”, “would” and “could”.\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, which give rise to the possibility that management’s predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations and conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that its assumptions may not be correct and that its strategic goals will not be achieved.\nA variety of factors, many of which are beyond CWB’s control, may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, general business and economic conditions in Canada, including the volatility and level of liquidity in financial markets, fluctuations in interest rates and currency values, the volatility and level of various commodity prices, changes in monetary policy, changes in economic and political conditions, legislative and regulatory developments, legal developments, the level of competition, the occurrence of natural catastrophes, changes in accounting standards and policies, the accuracy and completeness of information CWB receives about customers and counterparties, the ability to attract and retain key personnel, the ability to complete and integrate acquisitions, reliance on third parties to provide components of business infrastructure, changes in tax laws, technological developments, unexpected changes in consumer spending and saving habits, timely development and introduction of new products, and management’s ability to anticipate and manage the risks associated with these factors. It is important to note that the preceding list is not exhaustive of possible factors.\nAdditional information about these factors can be found in the Risk Management section of CWB’s annual Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). These and other factors should be considered carefully, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as a number of important factors could cause CWB’s actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements. Unless required by securities law, CWB does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or verbal, that may be made from time to time by it or on its behalf.\nAssumptions about the performance of the Canadian economy over the forecast horizon and how it will affect CWB’s businesses are material factors considered when setting organizational objectives and targets. In determining expectations for economic growth, CWB primarily considers economic data and forecasts provided by the Canadian government and its agencies, as well as an average of certain private sector forecasts. These forecasts are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may be general or specific. Where relevant, material economic assumptions underlying forward looking statements are disclosed within the Outlook sections of this MD&A, and/or Outlook sections of CWB’s MD&A for the year ended October 31, 2017.\nStrategic Transactions\nOn October 30, 2017, CWB entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to acquire for cash approximately $900 million of equipment loans and leases, and general commercial lending assets. The transaction closed on January 31, 2018, and totaled approximately $850 million. The loans and leases acquired are fully aligned with CWB’s balanced growth strategy, including strategic objectives for industry and geographic diversification. The portfolio is primarily comprised of assets concentrated within the transportation, construction and healthcare industries, with approximately three quarters of the exposures distributed across Central and Eastern Canada. CWB expects the transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings per common share and return on common shareholders’ equity, with positive contributions beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to net interest margin and operating leverage. Management expects the acquired portfolio to contribute at least $0.10 of adjusted cash earnings per common share in both fiscal 2018 and 2019, while contributing to a slight increase in the provision for credit losses as a percentage of average loans. CWB’s common equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) ratio remained in a very strong position upon closing, with approximately 25 basis points of existing CET1 capital deployed as part of the purchase. Management funded the portfolio primarily through its securitization facilities.\nOn August 16, 2017, CWB announced that Canadian Western Trust (CWT) will focus its activities within business lines that are most aligned with the strategic objectives of CWB Financial Group, and will no longer offer self-directed account services to holders of certain securities, and CWT initiated a process to appoint successor trustees for these accounts. As a result of this process, CWB realized pre-tax gains on sale of approximately $6 million, or $0.06 of adjusted cash earnings per common share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and approximately $3 million, or $0.03 of adjusted cash earnings per common share, this quarter. Annual revenue associated with the transferred accounts to date was approximately $3 million. In aggregate, approximately $93 million of CWT branch-raised deposits and $3 billion of assets under administration has transferred to the successor trustees. Further transfers of deposits and assets under administration related to this process, with associated gains on sale, may occur in forthcoming periods, but are not expected to be material.\nOverview of Financial Performance\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nRecord common shareholders’ net income of $62 million and record pre-tax, pre-provision income of $107 million were up 25% and 14%, respectively. Strong earnings growth reflects the combined positive impact of 10% growth of total revenue to $193 million and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses and increased acquisition-related fair value changes. Net interest income of $171 million was up 10%, reflecting the benefits of 7% loan growth, on an average balance basis, and a six basis point increase in net interest margin to 2.52%. Non-interest income increased 13%, primarily due to pre-tax gains of approximately $3 million from the strategic transactions within CWT. Wealth management performance was also strong, with a 17% increase in revenue from this business line. Credit related fee income and trust services revenue were each lower, with the latter reflecting the above-mentioned CWT strategic transactions. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of average loans improved to 18 basis points, down from 27 basis points in the same period last year. Non-interest expenses were up 6%. Acquisition-related fair value changes increased 14% reflecting continued strong performance from CWB Maxium. Growth of diluted and adjusted cash earnings per common share to $0.69 and $0.75, respectively, was very strong, with both metrics up 23%. The CWT-related gains contributed approximately $0.03 of adjusted cash earnings per common share (2017 – nil).\nQ1 2018 vs. Q4 2017\nCompared to the prior quarter, common shareholders’ net income and pre-tax, pre-provision income were up 2% and 3%, respectively. Total revenue was down 1%, as 1% growth in net interest income was offset by an 11% decline in non-interest income. Moderate sequential growth of net interest income reflects the combined impact of 2% loan growth, on an average balance basis, and lower net interest margin. The decrease in non-interest income primarily reflects lower gains related to strategic transactions within CWT this quarter. Gains related to the CWT process contributed approximately $3 million to non-interest income this quarter, or $0.03 of earnings per common share, compared to approximately $6 million, or $0.06 of earnings per common share, in the prior quarter. Excluding these gains in both quarters, non-interest income increased 2%. The provision for credit losses was down two basis points from last quarter and non-interest expenses were 6% lower. Diluted and adjusted cash earnings per common share were both up 1%.\nAdjusted ROE and ROA\nThe first quarter adjusted return on common shareholders’ equity (ROE) of 12.0% was up 160 basis points from the same period last year and unchanged from the prior quarter. Strong year-over-year growth of profitability reflects effective execution of CWB’s Balanced Growth strategy, with well-diversified loan growth, strong growth and diversification of funding sources, higher net interest margin, a normalized credit experience and disciplined control of non-interest expense growth. The CWT-related gains on sale also contributed to higher profitability.\nReturn on assets (ROA) of 0.91% was 13 basis points higher than last year’s 0.78% driven by the same factors mentioned above. ROA was down three basis points sequentially as growth of common shareholders’ net income was more than offset by the increase in total assets.\nOutlook for Profitability Ratios\nOver the medium-term, management expects CWB’s earnings growth and profitability to benefit from the expansion of existing client relationships through exceptional service and enhanced client experiences, the attraction of new full-service clients and the planned transition to the AIRB methodology for managing credit risk and calculating risk-weighted assets. The assets acquired on January 31, 2018, offer relatively higher yields at a lower average risk-weighting than CWB’s overall portfolio. Incorporating the expected credit performance of these assets, their estimated contribution to earnings per common share in fiscal 2018 is expected to be accretive to overall profitability beginning in the second quarter.\nTotal Revenue\nFirst quarter total revenue of $193 million, comprised of net interest income and non-interest income, increased 10% compared to the same quarter last year. Compared to the previous quarter, total revenue was down 1%.\nNet Interest Income\nOf note, commencing this quarter, CWB has discontinued the use of taxable equivalent basis (teb) non-IFRS measures as the teb adjustment is no longer of material significance to CWB’s results. Previously, teb increased interest income and the provision for income taxes to what they would have been had certain tax-exempt securities been taxed at the statutory rate. Comparative figures have been restated to conform with the current period presentation.\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nNet interest income of $171 million increased 10%, reflecting the combined benefits of 7% loan growth, on an average balance basis, and a six basis point increase in net interest margin to 2.52%. The increase in net interest margin primarily reflects higher asset yields, mainly due to an increase in the average prime rate of more than 50 basis points, which more than offset higher funding costs.\nQ1 2018 vs. Q4 2017\nNet interest income was up 1%, reflecting the combined impact of 2% loan growth, on an average balance basis, and an 11 basis point decline in net interest margin. Within net interest margin, the benefit of higher asset yields was more than offset by changes in asset and funding mix. Of note, elevated average balances of cash and securities compared to the prior quarter reflect conservative funding and liquidity management in anticipation of the asset purchase on January 31, 2018.\nInterest rate sensitivity\nNote 15 to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements summarizes CWB’s exposure to interest rate risk as at January 31, 2018. The estimated sensitivity of net interest income to a change in interest rates is presented in the table below. The amounts represent the estimated change in net interest income that would result over the following 12 months from a one-percentage point change in interest rates. The estimates are based on a number of assumptions and factors, which include:\na constant structure in the interest sensitive asset and liability portfolios; interest rate changes affecting interest sensitive assets and liabilities by proportionally the same amount, except floor levels for various deposit liabilities and certain floating rate loans, and applied at the appropriate repricing dates; and, no early redemptions.\n($ thousands) January 31\n2018 October 31\n2017 January 31\n2017 Estimated impact on net interest income of a 1% increase in interest rates 1 year $ 1,427 $ 8,324 $ 7,230 1 year percentage change 0.21 % 1.39 % 1.17 % Estimated impact on net interest income of a 1% decrease in interest rates 1 year $ (6,115 ) $ (13,226) $ (4,016) 1 year percentage change (0.90 ) % (2.21) % (0.65) % In addition to the projected changes in net interest income noted above, it is estimated that a one-percentage point increase in all interest rates at January 31, 2018 would increase unrealized losses related to available-for-sale securities and the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as hedges, and result in a reduction in other comprehensive income of approximately $90 million, net of tax (January 31, 2017 – $80 million).\nIt is estimated that a one-percentage point decrease in all interest rates at January 31, 2018 would have the opposite effect, increasing other comprehensive income by approximately $88 million, net of tax (January 31, 2017 – $82 million). Management maintains the asset liability structure and interest rate sensitivity within CWB’s established policies through pricing and product initiatives, as well as the use of interest rate swaps.\nOutlook for net interest margin\nCWB’s Balanced Growth strategy targets growth of lower-cost funding sources along with selective, geographically diversified loan growth in higher yielding portfolios with an acceptable risk profile. The combined positive impact of successful strategic execution, including the expected contributions of assets acquired at the end of the first quarter, and the higher interest rate environment is expected to support incrementally higher net interest margin in fiscal 2018 compared to last year. The impact of higher average balances of cash and securities with a lower average yield on net interest margin is expected to be less prevalent in the second half of this year, partly as a result of expected loan growth. Management may periodically increase balance sheet liquidity in the event of macroeconomic or financial market volatility, and in preparation for upcoming maturities and/or transactions. Acceleration of loan growth in 2018 may require increased utilization of the relatively higher-cost broker deposit funding channel. Competitive pressure on loan yields is expected to remain apparent, and deposit costs are expected to move incrementally higher this year, due to both competitive factors and expectations for impacts from the Bank of Canada’s rate increases in both 2017 and this year.\nNon-interest Income\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nNon-interest income of $22 million was up 13% ($3 million) from last year, primarily due to gains of approximately $3 million recorded within ‘other’ non-interest income from the CWT strategic transactions. Wealth management revenue increased 17% ($1 million) with strong 11% growth of assets under management. These factors were partially offset by lower credit related fees and trust services revenue. The decrease in credit related fees partly relates to the shift in organic loan growth to emphasize general commercial loans, which tend to be associated with lower fees as compared to real estate loans with more complex structures, while the change in trust services revenue primarily reflects the above-mentioned appointment of successor trustees for certain CWT accounts.\nQ1 2018 vs. Q4 2017\nNon-interest income was down 11% ($3 million) sequentially. Strong performance from wealth management was more than offset by factors related to the strategic transactions within CWT, as well as lower credit related fee income. Gains related to the CWT process contributed approximately $3 million to non-interest income this quarter, compared to approximately $6 million in the prior quarter, and trust services revenue also declined with the transfer of accounts. Lower credit related fee income mainly reflects the same factors noted in the year-over-year comparison above.\nOutlook for non-interest income\nGrowth of non-interest income is expected to reflect CWB’s strategy to extend and deepen relationships with both new and existing business owner clients. This includes a continued focus to deliver strong, high-quality loan growth with associated fee income, as well as enhanced transactional capabilities in cash management and other retail services, including CWB’s relationship-based, branch-raised deposit franchise. Credit related fee income may be somewhat volatile in view of the factors noted above. Management expects further increases in wealth management revenue to result over the medium term from solid performance within CWB Wealth Management, including organic growth of discretionary investment services, and further growth of proprietary investment products. Trust services revenue will likely be lower this year compared to 2017 as a result of the appointment of successor trustees for certain accounts. Further gains related to this process may occur, but are not expected to be material. Based on the current composition of the securities portfolio, net gains/losses on securities are not expected to contribute materially to non-interest income in fiscal 2018; however, the magnitude and timing of gains or losses are dependent on market factors that are difficult to predict. CWB may realize gains on the sale of residential mortgage portfolios as opportunities become available. Such gains are anticipated to be a recurring, although sporadic, source of ‘other’ non-interest income.\nAcquisition-related Fair Value Changes\nThe change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of CWB Maxium was $5 million this quarter, compared to $4 million in the same quarter last year and $5 million last quarter. Quarterly changes approximately similar in magnitude through the remainder of the three-year earn out period would represent the maximum amount available through the purchase agreement.\nThis quarter CWB paid the second annual instalment of the contingent consideration, reflecting very strong operating performance of CWB Maxium since the acquisition was completed on March 1, 2016.\nNon-interest Expenses\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nNon-interest expenses of $88 million were up 6% ($5 million), primarily due to a 7% ($4 million) increase in salaries and benefits. Higher salaries and benefits mainly reflected hiring activity to support overall business growth and annual salary increments. Premises and equipment expenses increased 4% ($1 million), primarily reflecting ongoing investment in technology infrastructure to position CWB for future growth.\nQ1 2018 vs. Q4 2017\nNon-interest expenses were down 6% ($5 million), mainly due to the customary seasonal increase across most categories of non-interest expenses last quarter. The 20% ($4 million) decline in ‘other’ expenses primarily reflects an expected seasonal decrease in advertising expenses, along with lower regulatory costs and consultant fees.\nEfficiency ratio and operating leverage\nThe first quarter efficiency ratio of 44.6%, which measures non-interest expenses, excluding the pre-tax amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, divided by total revenue, compares favourably to 46.2% in the same period last year and 46.8% in the previous quarter. The difference compared to both prior periods primarily reflects revenue growth associated with CWB’s strong strategic execution, in combination with disciplined control of non-interest expenses.\nOperating leverage, which is calculated as the growth rate of total revenue less the growth rate of non-interest expenses, excluding the pre-tax amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, over the same period last year was 3.9%, compared to 2.4% last year and 1.0% last quarter.\nOutlook for the efficiency ratio and operating leverage\nCWB’s medium-term targets for growth of adjusted cash earnings per share and positive operating leverage incorporate expectations for strong business growth supported through strategic investment in people, technology and infrastructure, along with effective control of expense growth. Management anticipates CWB will deliver positive operating leverage over the medium-term, albeit at a considerably more moderate rate than was apparent this quarter. CWB’s average annual efficiency ratio over the past three years is approximately 46%, and the efficiency ratio is expected to continue to fluctuate around this level.\nIncome Taxes\nThe first quarter effective income tax rate was 26.7%, compared to 27.6% last year. The difference compared to last year’s effective rate mainly relates to the tax treatment of the CWT-related gains.\nOutlook for income taxes\nCWB’s expected income tax rate for 2018 is approximately 27.5%.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (OCI), all net of income taxes.\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nComprehensive income of $41 million was relatively consistent with the same period last year, as a $15 million decrease in OCI was partially offset by $12 million higher net income.\nChanges in OCI, all net of tax, mainly resulted from decreases in the change in fair value of available-for-sale securities ($11 million) and derivatives designated as cash flow hedges ($4 million). CWB’s portfolio of available-for-sale securities is comprised of debt securities and investment grade preferred shares. Fluctuations in value are generally attributed to changes in interest rates, movements in market credit spreads and shifts in the interest rate curve. The difference compared to last year primarily reflects the impact on market values of government debt securities from three successive Bank of Canada rate increases, both in respect to the level of interest rates and the shape of the interest rate curve, as well as lower unrealized losses on preferred shares.\nBalance Sheet\nThe quarter end balance of total assets of $27,914 million was up 12% from last year and 6% from last quarter.\nCash and Securities\nCash and securities totaled $3,062 million at January 31, 2018, compared to $2,552 million last year and $2,709 million last quarter. CWB maintains prudent liquidity levels at all times while remaining compliant with the Liquidity Adequacy Requirements guideline established by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). CWB’s liquidity management is based on an internal stressed cash flow model, with the level of cash and securities driven primarily by the term structure of both assets and liabilities. Higher average balances of cash and securities compared to last quarter mainly reflect conservative funding and liquidity management in anticipation of the asset purchase on January 31, 2018.\nThe cash and securities portfolio is comprised of high quality debt instruments and investment grade preferred shares that are not held for trading purposes and, where applicable, are typically held until maturity. Net unrealized losses on cash and securities recorded on the balance sheet of $52 million were up from $43 million last year and $40 million last quarter. The benefit of higher market values of preferred shares compared to both the same quarter last year and last quarter was more than offset by lower market values of government debt securities.\nNet realized gains/losses on securities were negligible in all periods. Based on the current composition of the securities portfolio, net gains/losses on securities going forward are not expected to have a material impact on non-interest income, although debt security and preferred share market conditions are inherently unpredictable in the short-term.\nLoans\nTotal loans, excluding the allowance for credit losses, of $24,393 million increased 11% ($2,510 million) from last year and 4% ($1,047 million) from the prior quarter. Total loan growth this quarter included the portfolio acquisition on January 31 of approximately $850 million, with approximately 80% of the acquired total comprised of equipment financing and leasing exposures, and 20% comprised of general commercial loans. Organic loan growth was 8% from last year and 1% from the prior quarter.\nJanuary 31\n2018 October 31\n2017 January 31\n2017 (unaudited)\n(millions) % Change\nfrom\nJanuary 31\n2017 General commercial loans $ 6,769 $ 6,307 $ 5,500 23 % Personal loans and mortgages 4,786 4,726 4,178 15 Equipment financing and leasing 4,534 3,892 3,711 22 Commercial mortgages 4,265 4,267 4,126 3 Real estate project loans 3,939 4,030 4,195 (6) Oil and gas production loans 100 124 173 (42) Total loans outstanding (1) $ 24,393 $ 23,346 $ 21,883 11 % (1) Total loans outstanding by lending sector exclude the allowance for credit losses.\nYear-over-year growth by lending sector was consistent with CWB’s Balanced Growth strategy, including increased industry and geographic diversification. The general commercial category led growth by lending sector in dollar terms with an increase of $1,269 million, including approximately $190 million of acquired growth. Growth of $823 million in equipment financing and leasing, included approximately $660 million from the portfolio acquisition. Growth of personal loans and mortgages of $608 million was also strong, mainly reflecting continued strong performance from CWB Optimum Mortgage. Commercial mortgages were up $138 million from last year. Real estate project loans contracted $256 million, with net growth in British Columbia more than offset by the impact of successful project completions and payouts in Alberta and Ontario. Lagging impacts of the 2015 – 2016 regional recession have resulted in fewer new real estate project lending opportunities in Edmonton and Calgary. CWB maintained a proactive approach in managing its small portfolio of oil and gas production loans over the past year, reducing outstanding balances by $73 million.\nOn a sequential basis, total loan growth was led by equipment financing and leasing ($642 million), mainly reflecting the portfolio acquisition, followed by general commercial loans ($462 million) and personal loans and mortgages ($60 million). Outstanding balances of real estate project loans and loans to oil and gas producers contracted from last quarter, while commercial mortgages were relatively stable.\nJanuary 31\n2018 October 31\n2017 January 31\n2017 (unaudited)\n(millions) % Change\nfrom\nJanuary 31\n2017 British Columbia $ 8,258 $ 8,145 $ 7,691 7 % Alberta 7,835 7,728 7,822 - Ontario 5,032 4,397 3,458 46 Saskatchewan 1,344 1,343 1,319 2 Manitoba 745 737 716 4 Other 1,179 996 877 34 Total loans outstanding (1) $ 24,393 $ 23,346 $ 21,883 11 % (1) Total loans outstanding by province exclude the allowance for credit losses.\nMore than 75% of the portfolio acquired on January 31 is comprised of exposures in Central and Eastern Canada, with Ontario accounting for approximately 60%. Partly on this basis, Ontario continued to lead loan growth by province in dollar terms ($1,574 million) from last year. Increased exposure within Central and Eastern Canada reflects the geographic diversification objectives clearly defined within CWB’s Balanced Growth strategy. With further support from the portfolio acquisition this quarter, this objective is underpinned by ongoing strong performance from CWB’s businesses that have a national footprint, including CWB Maxium, CWB Optimum Mortgage, National Leasing, and CWB Franchise Finance. This combination of organic and acquired growth drove a 43% increase in CWB’s outstanding loans within Central and Eastern Canada. This region now accounts for 26% of CWB’s total loan portfolio, up from 20% one year ago. British Columbia, which represents 34% of CWB’s total loan balances, also delivered strong annual growth of $567 million, while outstanding loans in Saskatchewan and Alberta increased $24 million and $13 million, respectively.\nCompared to the prior quarter, the same geographic diversification trends are apparent, with Ontario and British Columbia accounting for more than 80% of CWB’s growth in dollar terms. Alberta also delivered growth of $107 million on a sequential basis.\nCWB Optimum Mortgage\nNet of portfolio sales, total loans of $2,826 million within CWB Optimum increased 18% ($427 million) year-over-year and 3% ($80 million) compared to the prior quarter. Growth for the quarter was driven almost exclusively by alternative mortgages secured via first mortgages carrying a weighted average loan-to-value at initiation of approximately 68%. The book value of alternative mortgages represented 95% of CWB Optimum’s total portfolio at quarter end, compared to 92% last year and unchanged from the prior quarter. At approximately 56% of the total, Ontario represents the largest geographic exposure by province within CWB Optimum’s portfolio, followed by Alberta at 18% and British Columbia at 17%. The average size of CWB Optimum mortgages originated in the first quarter was approximately $340,000, and the average size of mortgages outstanding at January 31, 2018 was $290,000.\nOutlook for loans\nCWB will continue to support high-quality borrowers with a focus on business owners operating within targeted industry segments across Canada. Management remains committed to delivering double-digit annual loan growth whenever prudent. This includes a continued focus on secured loans that offer an appropriate return and acceptable risk profile. Loan growth is expected to be strong across most of CWB’s national geographic footprint. Business opportunities within Alberta and Saskatchewan are expected to gain momentum as these provincial economies continue to recover from two years of recession in 2015 and 2016.\nWithin Ontario, growth is expected to continue to benefit from increasing contributions of CWB Maxium and CWB Franchise Finance, as well as ongoing strong activity within National Leasing and CWB Optimum Mortgage. The portfolio acquired on January 31 is also expected to provide incremental growth over the long-term through retention and renewal of client relationships that are consistent with management’s risk appetite. However, in view of the acquired portfolio’s relatively short, approximately two-year weighted average duration, some degree of near-term run-off is expected. Management expects the outstanding balance of the acquired portfolio to be approximately $600 – $700 million at October 31, 2018.\nIn respect to housing-related growth opportunities, revisions to OSFI’s Guideline B-20: Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and Procedures are expected to somewhat curtail market activity and reduce the pace of home price increases across the country. In particular, the 200 basis point qualifying stress test and limits on co-lending arrangements could make it more difficult for certain prospective buyers to qualify for uninsured mortgages, and have a negative impact on originations within CWB Optimum; however, the changes may also result in increased renewals with existing borrowers, as well as incremental lending opportunities within the alternative mortgage space as all federally-regulated mortgage lenders are affected by revisions to the guideline. Management will also continue to assess the potential impact of further macroprudential measures introduced through the British Columbia government’s recently released budget and plan for housing affordability. In consideration of the full scope of regulatory changes affecting residential mortgages, management expects the growth rate for CWB Optimum to more closely resemble overall growth across the rest of the loan portfolio going forward. This includes the expected moderating impact of changes to Guideline B-20 and the above-mentioned measures recently introduced in British Columbia, as well as CWB’s overall risk appetite for Alt-A mortgages as a proportion of total loans. Compared to fiscal 2017 quarterly originations, originations within CWB Optimum this quarter were consistent with these expectations.\nWhile CWB does not expect changes to Guideline B-20 to have a material impact on growth opportunities within its real estate project lending portfolio, management will continue to assess the potential impact of the new measures in British Columbia on future construction-related opportunities in that province. In general, CWB expects to continue to identify opportunities to finance well-capitalized developers on the basis of sound loan structures and acceptable pre-sale/lease levels.\nSubsequent to January 31, 2018, CWB amended its Credit Risk Concentration policy to increase the single risk exposure lending limit to $75 million from $50 million. The single risk exposure Credit Risk Concentration policy was last revised in 2005, when shareholders’ equity was less than $0.5 billion, compared to nearly $2.5 billion at January 31, 2018. For certain quality connections that confirm debt service capacity and loan security from more than one source, the connection limit was amended to $150 million from $100 million. The policy to limit exposure to connected borrowers to not more than 10% of CWB’s shareholders’ equity is unchanged.\nCredit Quality\nStrong overall credit quality continues to reflect CWB’s secured lending business model, disciplined underwriting practices and proactive loan management.\nFor the three months ended (unaudited)\n($ thousands) January 31\n2018\nOctober 31\n2017 January 31\n2017 Change from\nJanuary 31\n2017 Gross impaired loans, beginning of period $ 168,261 $ 168,684 $ 127,212 32 % New formations 22,525 54,214 31,486 (28) Reductions, impaired accounts paid down or returned to performing status (46,646 ) (37,132) (20,554) 127 Write-offs (6,946 ) (17,505) (13,705) (49) Total (1) $ 137,194 $ 168,261 $ 124,439 10 % Balance of the ten largest impaired accounts $ 57,420 $ 70,935 $ 55,544 3 % Total number of accounts classified as impaired (2) 239 237 228 5 Gross impaired loans as a percentage of total loans 0.57 % 0.72 % 0.57 % - bp (3) (1) Gross impaired loans include foreclosed assets held for sale with a carrying value of $4,093 (October 31, 2017 –1,983 and January 31, 2017 – $2,419).\n(2) Total number of accounts excludes National Leasing.\n(3) bp – basis point change.\nThe dollar level of gross impaired loans this quarter totaled $137 million, compared to $124 million last year and $168 million in the prior quarter. The dollar level of gross impaired loans represented 0.57% of total loans at quarter-end, unchanged from last year and down from 0.72% in the previous quarter. Gross impaired loans within Alberta this quarter totaled $80 million and accounted for 58% of total impairments, compared to $51 million or 41% of gross impairments in the same period last year and $106 million or 63% of total impairments last quarter. The relative concentration of impaired loans in Alberta continues to reflect the lagging impacts of the 2015 – 2016 regional recession, and is consistent with management’s expectations. Gross impairments outside Alberta represented 0.36% of total non-Alberta loans, compared to 0.52% last year and 0.40% last quarter.\nThe level of gross impaired loans fluctuates as loans become impaired and are subsequently resolved, and does not directly reflect the dollar value of expected write-offs given tangible security held in support of lending exposures. The overall loan portfolio is reviewed regularly with credit decisions undertaken on a case-by-case basis to provide early identification of possible adverse trends.\nAs at January 31, 2018, the total allowance for credit losses (collective and specific) was $142 million, compared to $130 million one year ago and $136 million last quarter. The total allowance for credit losses represented 114% of gross impaired loans at quarter end, compared to 104% last year and 81% in the prior quarter. The collective allowance for credit losses increased 4% over the past twelve months and was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe first quarter provision for credit losses of 18 basis points of average loans was down from 27 basis points in the same period last year and 20 basis points in the previous quarter. The level of the provision in each of the last three quarters is consistent with CWB’s traditional range of 18 – 23 basis points. CWB will adopt IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, the new accounting standard for loan losses and impairment, and begin to calculate the provision for credit losses using the expected credit loss methodology on November 1, 2018.\nOutlook for credit quality\nOverall credit quality is expected to continue to reflect CWB’s secured lending business model, disciplined underwriting practices and proactive loan management. Periodic increases in the balance of impaired loans may occur across the portfolio, and gross impaired loans within CWB Optimum may increase in the event of a material correction of residential home prices. Loss rates on current and future impaired loans are expected to be low. This expectation is consistent with CWB’s prior experience, where write-offs have typically been low as a percentage of impairments.\nDeposits and Funding\nCWB continues to execute on key strategic objectives to grow and diversify core funding sources. Total deposits increased 10% from last year ($2,129 million) and 4% ($909 million) from the previous quarter. Branch-raised deposits were up 4% on an annual basis, including very strong 14% growth of fixed term deposits. Lower-cost, branch-raised demand and notice deposit balances were relatively stable compared to last year and the prior quarter. CWB doubled the balance of outstanding securitization funding compared to one year ago and raised $600 million of senior deposit notes through two successful capital markets issuances during the first quarter. Increased use of securitization this quarter reflects success in funding the January 31 asset purchase primarily through CWB’s existing securitization channels, with no increase in broker-sourced deposits as a proportion of total funding this quarter.\nTotal deposits by type and source are summarized below:\nAs at Change from\nJanuary 31\n2017 (unaudited) January 31\n2018 October 31\n2017 January 31\n2017 ($ millions) Deposits by type Demand and notice deposits $ 7,579 $ 7,641 $ 7,615 - % Term deposits 12,469 12,098 11,292 10 Capital markets 2,764 2,164 1,776 56 Total Deposits $ 22,812 $ 21,903 $ 20,683 10 %\nAs at Change from\nJanuary 31\n2017 (unaudited) January 31\n2018 October 31\n2017 January 31\n2017 ($ millions) Deposits by source CWB Group branch-raised $ 11,916 $ 11,816 $ 11,414 4 % Deposit brokers 8,132 7,923 7,493 9 Capital markets 2,764 2,164 1,776 56 Total Deposits $ 22,812 $ 21,903 $ 20,683 10 % Personal deposits represented 60% of total deposits at January 31, 2018, compared to 63% last year and 61% last quarter. Total branch-raised deposits accounted for 52% of total deposits at quarter end, down from 55% in the same period last year and 54% in the prior quarter. Demand and notice deposits comprised 33% of total deposits, compared to 37% last year and 35% last quarter, partly reflecting the impact of $22 million of branch-raised demand and notice deposits transferred to the successor trustees for certain CWT accounts in the first quarter, and a total of $93 million transferred since January 31, 2017. Changes in the proportion of funding derived from branch-raised sources also reflect efforts to diversify funding sources through issuance of capital markets deposits. Total funding raised through the debt capital markets of $2.8 billion represented 12% of total deposits at January 31, 2018, up from 9% last year and 10% last quarter. The deposit broker network remains an efficient source for raising insured fixed term retail deposits and has proven to be a reliable and effective way to access funding and liquidity over a wide geographic base. CWB raises only fixed-term broker deposits, with terms to maturity between one and five years, and does not offer a High Interest Savings Account (HISA) product. Term deposits raised through the broker network represented 36% of total funding at quarter end, unchanged from both last year and last quarter.\nSecuritization\nSecuritized leases, loans and mortgages are reported on-balance sheet with total loans. The gross amount of securitized leases and loans at January 31, 2018 was $1,816 million, compared to $996 million one year ago and $1,212 million last quarter. The gross amount of mortgages securitized under the National Housing Act Mortgage Backed Securities (NHA MBS) program was $460 million (Q1 2017 – $381 million). Total funding from the securitization of leases, loans and mortgages in the first quarter was $743 million (Q1 2017 – $83 million), with the increase mainly reflecting success in funding the January 31 asset purchase primarily through securitization, as noted above.\nOutlook for deposits and funding\nCWB’s strategic focus to grow and diversify funding sources will continue. This includes a goal to increase relationship-based branch-raised deposits, with particular emphasis on demand and notice deposits. This funding segment is typically lower cost and provides associated transactional fee income. Continued growth in the proportion of branch-raised funding is also a key strategic objective because it reflects success in strengthening targeted multi-product client relationships.\nThe capabilities of CWB’s new core banking system support various growth initiatives related to branch-raised funding over the medium term. Continued development of new and more effective products, along with an ongoing strategic focus on business transformation and process improvement, are expected to enhance CWB’s client experience and strengthen CWB’s competitive position. CWB’s growing market presence to support strong performance against these goals will include further development of digital banking capabilities and may also include periodic expansion of full-service branches.\nFor example, CWB launched the pilot phase of its Virtual Branch this quarter, which promises to be a differentiated remote banking experience for business owners. CWB’s Virtual Branch offers access to high-touch, personal client service from experienced commercial banking relationship managers and cash management specialists. This unique approach to remote service delivery is complemented by convenient on-line banking options, including our recently deployed remote deposit capture technology. CWB also further improved its on-line wire transfer capabilities this quarter to enable business owners to send payments in over 130 currencies to more than 200 countries. This will complement the introduction of next generation online banking tools for businesses, which will allow clients to house their business and personal banking on a common platform. These are key steps to enhance CWB’s full-service banking experience for business owners. Management expects these initiatives to improve CWB’s client experience and support development of broader client relationships across the country.\nContinued diversification of funding sources is also expected to include increased utilization of both debt capital markets and CWB’s growing securitization capabilities. Securitization of leases through National Leasing and residential mortgages through the National Housing Administration Mortgage Backed Security (NHA MBS) program and the Canada Mortgage Bonds (CMB) program this year is expected to continue, and will increase over the medium–term.\nOther Assets and Other Liabilities\nOther assets totaled $584 million at January 31, 2018, compared to $490 million last year and $509 million last quarter, with the difference primarily due to a commodity tax receivable related to the asset purchase at quarter end.\nOther liabilities totaled $533 million at January 31, 2018, relatively unchanged from last year and down from $604 million last quarter.\nOff-Balance Sheet\nOff-balance sheet items include assets under administration and assets under management. Total assets under administration, which are comprised of trust assets and third-party leases under administration, as well as mortgages under service agreements, totaled $9,027 million at January 31, 2018, compared to $11,120 million one year ago and $10,408 million last quarter. Approximately $3,042 million of assets under administration have transferred to successor trustees for certain CWT accounts over the past two quarters. Further transfers related to this process may occur in forthcoming periods, but are not expected to be material. Assets under management were $2,187 million at quarter end, up 11% from $1,971 million a year earlier and $2,115 million last quarter.\nOther off-balance sheet items are comprised of standard industry credit instruments (guarantees, standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit). CWB does not utilize, nor does it have exposure to, collateralized debt obligations or credit default swaps. For additional information regarding other off-balance sheet items refer to Note 13 of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the period ended January 31, 2018, as well as Note 21 of the audited consolidated financial statements in CWB’s 2017 Annual Report.\nCapital Management\nOSFI requires Canadian financial institutions to manage and report regulatory capital in accordance with the Basel III capital management framework. CWB currently reports its regulatory capital ratios using the Standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets, which requires CWB to carry significantly more capital for certain credit exposures compared to requirements under the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) methodology. For this reason, regulatory capital ratios of banks that utilize the Standardized approach are not directly comparable with the large Canadian banks and other financial institutions which utilize the AIRB methodology. CWB’s required minimum regulatory capital ratios, including a 250 basis point capital conservation buffer, are 7.0% common equity Tier 1 (CET1), 8.5% Tier 1 and 10.5% Total capital.\nCWB is well-positioned to continue to execute against its Balanced Growth strategy with a very strong capital position, including 9.4% CET1, 10.6% Tier 1 and 12.3% Total capital ratios at January 31, 2018. The portfolio acquisition at quarter end reduced CWB’s CET1 ratio by approximately 25 basis points, consistent with management’s expectations. This change was partially offset by contributions to retained earnings from strong growth of common shareholders’ net income. CWB’s Basel III leverage ratio of 8.0% at quarter end remains very conservative.\nA normal course issuer bid (NCIB) authorizing CWB to purchase for cancellation prior to September 30, 2018, up to 1,767,000 common shares, representing approximately 2% of the issued and outstanding common shares, has been approved by OSFI and the Toronto Stock Exchange. No shares have been purchased through the NCIB as at January 31, 2018. Management may choose to activate the NCIB in fiscal 2018 should appropriate circumstances become apparent.\nFurther details regarding CWB’s regulatory capital and capital adequacy ratios are included in the following table:\n(unaudited) As at\nJanuary 31\n2018\nAs at\nOctober 31\n2017\nAs at\nJanuary 31\n2017\n($ millions) Regulatory capital CET1 capital before deductions $ 2,254 $ 2,216 $ 2,104 Net CET1 deductions (211) (206) (207) CET1 capital 2,043 2,010 1,897 Tier 1 capital (1) 2,308 2,275 2,162 Total capital (1) 2,679 2,644 2,602 Risk-weighted assets $ 21,825 $ 21,082 $ 20,028 Capital adequacy ratios\nCET1 9.4\n% 9.5\n% 9.5\n% Tier 1 10.6 10.8 10.8 Total 12.3 12.5 13.0 (1) The 2018 inclusion of non-common equity instruments that do not include NVCC clauses is capped at 40% of the January 1, 2013 outstanding balances (2017 - 50%). For all periods presented, there were no exclusions from regulatory capital related to NVCC.\nBook value per common share at January 31, 2018 was $24.98, up from $23.77 last year and $24.82 last quarter, mainly reflecting growth of retained earnings.\nCommon shareholders received a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per common share on January 4, 2018. On March 7, 2018, CWB’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per common share, payable on March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 16, 2018. This quarterly dividend is up two cents, or 9%, from the dividend declared one year ago and one cent, or 4%, from the previous quarter. The Board of Directors also declared a cash dividend of $0.275 per Series 5 Preferred Share, and a cash dividend of $0.390625 per Series 7 Preferred Share, both payable on April 30, 2018 to shareholders of record on April 23, 2018.\nManagement evaluates common share dividend increases every quarter against CWB’s dividend payout ratio target of approximately 30% of common shareholders’ net income, the current strength of CWB’s capital position, and capital requirements under the Standardized approach to support ongoing strong and balanced asset growth. While the dividend payout ratio this quarter was approximately 34%, CWB’s current capital position is very strong and management expects earnings growth to result in migration of the dividend payout ratio toward the 30% target while supporting CWB’s track record of dividend increases over the medium-term.\nFurther information relating to CWB’s capital position is provided in Note 16 of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the period ended January 31, 2018 as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and MD&A for the year ended October 31, 2017.\nOutlook for Capital Management\nCWB continues to operate from a very strong capital position. Management will maintain strong capital ratios under the Standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets, above CWB’s target thresholds and OSFI’s required minimums. Target capital ratios, including an appropriate capital buffer over the prescribed OSFI minimums, are reconfirmed through CWB’s regulatory capital planning.\nThe ongoing retention of earnings, net of expected common and preferred share dividends, is expected to support capital requirements associated with the anticipated achievement of CWB’s medium-term performance target for a strong common equity Tier 1 ratio.\nThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized Basel III reforms this quarter and OSFI indicated it will launch a public consultation on the domestic implementation of the proposed reforms in spring 2018. Management does not believe that the reforms to the Standardized approach for credit risk as recommended by the Basel Committee would have a material impact on CWB’s capital position or capital management.\nAIRB transition plan\nCWB’s project continues in support of an application to OSFI for transition to the AIRB methodology for capital and risk management, including an anticipated three-year time frame ending in fiscal 2019. The AIRB approach will put CWB on more equal footing with its competition. It will add risk sensitivity to CWB’s framework for capital management, increase risk quantification processes, improve risk-based pricing capabilities and economic capital estimations, improve CWB’s stress testing capabilities and enhance CWB’s ability to comply with new accounting standards and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) reporting requirements. These improved risk management capabilities will better equip CWB to allocate resources to target business segments that generate the most attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nCWB’s AIRB transition project is separated into several discrete phases, including: establishment of formalized project governance; creation of models including data collection, development and testing, deployment, operationalization and use test; model validation; implementation of CWB’s risk-weighted asset production and capital reporting tool; and, submission of final application to OSFI. All material AIRB models and related scorecards have now been developed and operationalized within the business.\nWork continues toward development of an enhanced enterprise data warehouse to serve as the repository for required data. Model validation and continuous improvement of existing models continues. Further development of CWB’s risk function, including: three lines of defence enhancement; stress testing capabilities; and, economic capital estimation are also underway.\nSignificant Changes in Accounting Policies and Financial Statement Presentation\nThe unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the quarter were prepared using the same accounting policies as the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2017.\nFuture Accounting Changes\nA number of standards and amendments have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and are described in further detail in CWB’s 2017 Annual Report. These standards and amendments may impact the presentation of financial statements in the future and management is currently reviewing these changes to determine the impact, if any. CWB continues to monitor the IASB’s proposed changes to IFRS.\nIFRS 9 – Financial Instruments\nCWB will adopt IFRS 9 effective November 1, 2018. CWB’s IFRS 9 transition activities in 2017 concentrated on assessing the classification and measurement of financial instruments, developing impairment models and building a comprehensive expected credit loss (ECL) calculation process. All material AIRB models, which are being leveraged to satisfy IFRS 9 requirements with consideration for specific differences between regulatory and accounting requirements, have been deployed into the business this quarter and related scorecards are being populated to generate risk parameters for use in the estimation of ECL. During the current year, CWB will focus on implementing and testing a comprehensive governance framework, validating and refining impairment models and the expected credit loss calculation process and performing a parallel run. CWB is on schedule to meet transition timelines and continues to monitor industry interpretations of IFRS 9 requirements and adjust implementation plans accordingly. The impact of transitioning to IFRS 9 has not yet been quantified.\nControls and Procedures\nThere were no significant changes in CWB’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, CWB’s disclosures of required information and internal controls over financial reporting. Prior to its release, this quarterly report to shareholders was reviewed by the Audit Committee and, on the Audit Committee’s recommendation, approved by the Board of Directors of CWB.\nThird-party Credit Ratings\nDBRS Limited (DBRS) maintains published credit ratings on CWB’s senior debt (deposits), short-term debt, subordinated debentures and preferred shares of “A (low)”, “R1 (low)”, “BBB (high)” and “Pfd-3”, respectively, all with a stable outlook. Credit ratings do not consider market price or address the suitability of any financial instrument for a particular investor and are not recommendations to purchase, sell or hold securities. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Management believes the ratings widen the base of clients and investors who can participate in CWB’s offerings, while also lowering overall funding costs and the cost of capital.\nUpdated Share Information\nAs at February 28, 2018, there were 88,772,455 common shares and 2,958,752 stock options outstanding. For additional information on share capital and stock options, see Notes 18 and 19 of audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2017 and Notes 11 and 12 to the interim consolidated financial statements for this quarter.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan\nCWB common shares (TSX: CWB) and preferred shares (TSX: CWB.PR.B; CWB.PR.C) are deemed eligible to participate in CWB’s dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan). The Plan provides holders of eligible shares of CWB the opportunity to direct cash dividends toward the purchase of CWB common shares. CWB has elected to issue common shares for the Plan at the average market price (as defined in the Plan). Further details for the Plan are available on CWB’s website.\nSummary of Quarterly Financial Information\n2018 2017 2016 ($ thousands) Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Total revenue $ 193,217 $ 195,122 $ 183,843 $ 172,443 $ 175,227 $ 168,252 $ 168,412 $ 163,730 Common shareholders’ net income 61,939\n60,833\n56,308\n47,594 49,542\n47,834 45,582\n32,213 Earnings per common share Basic 0.70 0.69 0.64 0.54 0.56 0.54 0.55 0.40 Diluted 0.69 0.68 0.64 0.54 0.56 0.54 0.55 0.40 Adjusted cash 0.75 0.74 0.69 0.59 0.61 0.59 0.60 0.41 Total assets ($ millions) 27,914 26,447 25,345 24,618 24,815 25,223 25,185 24,237 The financial results for each of the last eight quarters are summarized above. In general, CWB’s performance reflects a relatively consistent trend, although the second quarter contains three fewer revenue-earning days in non-leap years, and two fewer days in leap years such as 2016. Total revenue in the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017 includes the impact of gains related to the CWT process to appoint successor trustees for certain accounts. Common shareholders’ net income in the second quarter of 2016 reflects the impact of the credit performance of oil and gas production loans.\nAmong other things, quarterly results can also fluctuate from the recognition of periodic income tax items.\nFor additional details on variations between the prior quarters, refer to the summary of quarterly results section of CWB’s MD&A for the year ended October 31, 2017 and the individual quarterly reports to shareholders which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on CWB’s website at www.cwb.com .\nNon-IFRS Measures\nCWB uses a number of financial measures to assess its performance. These measures provide readers with an enhanced understanding of how management views the results. Non-IFRS measures may also provide readers the ability to analyze trends and provide comparisons with our competitors. These non-IFRS measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other financial institutions. The non-IFRS measures used in this MD&A are calculated as follows:\npre-tax, pre-provision income - total revenue less non-interest expenses, excluding the pre-tax amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (see calculation below); adjusted cash earnings per common share – diluted earnings per common share calculated with adjusted common shareholders’ net income (see calculation below), which excludes the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and contingent consideration fair value changes, net of tax. Excluded items are not considered to be indicative of ongoing business performance; return on common shareholders’ equity – annualized common shareholders’ net income divided by average common shareholders’ equity; adjusted return on common shareholders’ equity – annualized common shareholders’ net income excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and contingent consideration fair value changes, net of tax (see calculation below), divided by average common shareholders’ equity; return on assets – annualized common shareholders’ net income divided by average total assets; efficiency ratio – non-interest expenses, excluding the pre-tax amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, divided by total revenue, (see calculation below); net interest margin – net interest income divided by average total assets; provision for credit losses as a percentage of average loans – provision for credit losses divided by average total loans; operating leverage – growth rate of total revenue less growth rate of non-interest expenses, excluding the pre-tax amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; common share dividend payout ratio - common share dividends declared during the past twelve months divided by common shareholders’ net income earned over the same period; Basel III common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios – in accordance with guidelines issued by OSFI; and average balances – average daily balances.\nOf note, commencing with the first quarter of 2018, CWB has discontinued the use of the taxable equivalent basis (teb) non-IFRS measure as it is no longer of material significance to CWB’s results. Previously, teb increased interest income and the provision for income taxes to what they would have been had certain tax-exempt securities been taxed at the statutory rate. Comparative figures have been restated to conform with the current period presentation.\nAdjusted financial measures For the three months ended Change from\nJanuary 31\n2017 (unaudited) January 31\n2018 October 31\n2017 January 31\n2017 ($ thousands) Non-interest expenses $ 87,917 $ 93,129 $ 82,815 6 % Adjustments (before tax): Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (1,764 ) (1,909) (1,852) (5) Adjusted non-interest expenses $ 86,153 $ 91,220 $ 80,963 6 % Common shareholders’ net income\n$ 61,929 $ 60,833 $ 49,542 25 % Adjustments (after tax): Acquisition-related fair value changes 3,640 3,462 3,184 14 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 1,344 1,408 1,364 (1) Adjusted common shareholders’ net income $ 66,913 $ 65,703 $ 54,090 24 %\nPre-tax, pre-provision (PTPP) income For the three months ended Change from\nJanuary 31\n2017 (unaudited) January 31\n2018 October 31\n2017 January 31\n2017 ($ thousands) Total revenue\n$ 193,217 $ 195,122 $ 175,227 10 % Less: Adjusted non-interest expenses (see above) 86,153 91,220 80,963 6 Pre-tax, pre-provision income $ 107,064 $ 103,902 $ 94,264 14 %\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nAs at\nJanuary 31\n2018\nAs at\nOctober 31\n2017 As at\nJanuary 31\n2017 Change from\nJanuary 31\n2017 (unaudited) ($ thousands) Asset s Cash Resources Cash and non-interest bearing deposits with financial institutions $ 52,776 $ 17,491 $ 46,778 13 % Interest bearing deposits with regulated financial institutions (Note 4) 320,394 503,895 403,925 (21 ) Cheques and other items in transit 18,639 410 -

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements of Canadian Western Bank (CWB) have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 – Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) using the same accounting policies as the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2017. These interim consolidated financial statements of CWB, domiciled in Canada, have also been prepared in accordance with subsection 308 (4) of the Bank Act and the accounting requirements of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). Under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), additional disclosures are required in annual financial statements and accordingly, these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2017.\nThe interim consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on March 7, 2018.\n2. Future Accounting Changes\nCWB continues to monitor the IASB’s proposed changes to accounting standards. Although not expected to materially impact CWB’s 2018 consolidated financial statements, proposed changes may have a significant impact on future financial statements. Additional discussion on certain accounting standards that may impact CWB is included in the audited consolidated financial statements within CWB’s 2017 Annual Report.\nIFRS 9 – Financial Instruments\nCWB will adopt IFRS 9 effective November 1, 2018. CWB’s IFRS 9 transition activities in 2017 concentrated on assessing the classification and measurement of financial instruments, developing impairment models and building a comprehensive expected credit loss (ECL) calculation process. All material AIRB models, which are being leveraged to satisfy IFRS 9 requirements with consideration for specific differences between regulatory and accounting requirements, have been deployed into the business this quarter and related scorecards are being populated to generate risk parameters for use in the estimation of ECL. During the current year, CWB will focus on implementing and testing a comprehensive governance framework, validating and refining impairment models and the expected credit loss calculation process and performing a parallel run. CWB is on schedule to meet transition timelines and continues to monitor industry interpretations of IFRS 9 requirements and adjust implementation plans accordingly. The impact of transitioning to IFRS 9 has not yet been quantified.\n3. Strategic Transactions\nEquipment Loans and Leases and General Commercial Lending Assets\nOn January 31, 2018, CWB acquired a portfolio of equipment loans and leases and general commercial lending assets, which added $846.0 million to performing loans at fair value. No goodwill or intangible assets were included in the purchase. No allowance for credit losses was recorded on the acquisition date and loans are evaluated for impairment at each balance sheet date using the same methodology as other CWB loans.\nCanadian Western Trust (CWT)\nOn August 16, 2017, CWB announced that CWT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CWB, will no longer offer self-directed account services to clients holding certain securities, and CWT initiated a process to appoint successor trustees for these accounts. Pre-tax gains of $3.0 million this quarter, along with $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to these transactions are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income, reflecting sales proceeds less the carrying value of assets sold and related transaction costs. The carrying value of deposits transferred this quarter totalled $21.9 million and the market value of the related assets under administration totalled $1.7 billion, along with $71.3 million of deposits and $1.3 billion of assets under administration in the fourth quarter of 2017..\nThe operations and cash flows of CWT’s self-directed account services provided to clients holding certain securities cannot be clearly distinguished operationally or financially from the rest of CWB, nor do they represent a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations. As such, the transaction does not require the presentation of discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of income.\n4. Securities\nNet unrealized gains (losses) reflected on the consolidated balance sheets follow:\nAs at\nJanuary 31\n2018 As at\nOctober 31\n2017 As at\nJanuary 31\n2017 Interest bearing deposits with regulated financial institutions $ (31 ) $ (18 ) $ (2 ) Securities issued or guaranteed by Canada (33,197 ) (20,243 ) (11,570 ) A province or municipality (8,710 ) (4,652 ) (597 ) Other debt securities 462 1,750 1,465 Preferred shares (11,016 ) (16,749 ) (31,960 ) Unrealized Losses, Net $ (52,492 ) $ (39,912 ) $ (42,664 ) The securities portfolio is primarily comprised of high quality debt and equity instruments that are not held for trading purposes and, where applicable, are typically held until maturity. Fluctuations in value are generally attributed to changes in interest rates, market credit spreads and shifts in the interest rate curve as well as volatility in equity markets. As at January 31, 2018, CWB assessed the securities with unrealized losses and, based on available objective evidence, concluded that the unrealized losses resulted from changes in interest rates and not from deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers. No impairment losses were included in gains (losses) on securities, net during the three months ended January 31, 2018 (2017 – nil).\n5.
