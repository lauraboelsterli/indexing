    "text": "SEATTLE, March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Azuqua , a leader in cloud-based business automation, today announced that Todd Owens has been named its new CEO. Founder Nikhil Hasija will move to a critical new Chief Product Officer role, where he will focus on the company’s product strategy and long term technical vision. Todd was chosen by Hasija and the board to lead Azuqua following a record year in 2017, which included a 65 percent growth in new customers, a doubling of new cloud application connectors, and a 50 percent growth in overall employee headcount.\n“Azuqua is on a mission to increase productivity by automating the flow of information across boundaries in a SaaS world,” said Nikhil Hasija, Founder and Chief Product Officer of Azuqua. “We’ve been overwhelmed by what our customers and partners have been able to do with Azuqua. We’re well positioned for the next phase of growth as a company to change the application integration market and are thrilled to be able to add a leader of Todd’s caliber to spearhead this journey.”\nAzuqua enables people to integrate their SaaS applications and create automations across their business without the need for technical chops or custom code. Instead of traditional integrations that rely on months of custom development and big budgets, the company’s platform enables users to create custom automations and integrations in a matter of days. In the past year, Azuqua has added more than 90 new connectors to its already impressive library of connectors for applications including Adobe, Marketo, Hubspot, Salesforce, Slack, Smartsheet, Zendesk and hundreds more.\n“I am blown away by the power and uniqueness of the Azuqua product,” said Todd Owens, Azuqua CEO. “The company’s impressive and growing customer base demonstrates how integral the Azuqua platform is to automating business processes that improve the customer and employee experience - something all innovative organizations are striving to do. I’m honored to be selected by Nikhil and the board to take the company to the next level and am looking forward to working with the extremely talented group of people that make up Azuqua.”\nTodd Owens was previously CEO of Appuri, developer of a cloud-based customer data and analytics platform, that was acquired by DocuSign in December 2017. Prior to Appuri, he was President and CEO of TalentWise, which was acquired by Sterling Talent Solutions in January 2016. Owens also held leadership roles at Wind River, Siebel Systems and others. He holds an MBA from Harvard Business School.\nTodd Owens caps Azuqua’s new leadership team that also includes the recent additions of CMO Dan Kogan and CFO Rodney Jenkins. Dan joined Azuqua from Tableau, where he was the Senior Director of Product Marketing while Rodney comes to Azuqua from Telstra, where he served as a Vice President in the Telstra Software Group.\nVisit www.azuqua.com to learn how enterprises around the world, including Airbnb, Hubspot and Workfront leverage Azuqua to improve data accuracy, team collaboration and business processes.\nAbout Azuqua\nAzuqua is a provider of cloud application connectivity that empowers business users to work more productively together by automating business processes between SaaS apps, without a single line of code.
