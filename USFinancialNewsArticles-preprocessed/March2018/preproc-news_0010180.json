    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italian eyewear group Luxottica ( LUX.MI ) said on Tuesday it had acquired a 67 percent stake in Fukui Megane, a family-owned Japanese manufacturer specializing in the production of titanium and solid gold spectacles.\nFILE PHOTO: The Luxottica's headquaters is seen in downtown Milan, February 1, 2016. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo The acquisition, for which Luxottica did not disclose a value, allows the worldâ€™s biggest eyewear group to gain a foothold in the Fukui eyewear district, near Kyoto, famous for its artisan skills with precious metals such as titanium.\nExecutive Chairman Leonardo Del Vecchio said Luxottica would invest further to create a production center in the area.\nReporting by Valentina Za, editing by Steve Scherer\n ",
