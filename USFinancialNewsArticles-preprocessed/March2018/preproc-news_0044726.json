    "text": "March 24, 2018 / 8:38 AM / in a day Rugby-Sonny Bill out for up to eight weeks with broken wrist Reuters Staff 1 Min Read WELLINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - All Blacks and Auckland Blues midfielder Sonny Bill Williams has been ruled out of action for up to eight weeks after he broke his wrist in the 37-20 loss to the Stormers last week. The twice World Cup winner posted a photograph on his Twitter page on Saturday with his left forearm and hand encased in a plaster cast. The Blues told local media Williams would be out for between six and eight weeks. The team were not immediately available to confirm the reports. The 32-year-old could return in time for the clash against the defending champion Canterbury Crusaders on May 19, two weeks before the All Blacks play their first match in their three-test series against France in Auckland. The Blues, who have a bye this week, play South Africaâ€™s Sharks next Saturday at Eden Park. (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Nick Mulvenney)",
