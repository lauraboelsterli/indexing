    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China is willing to strengthen communications and coordination with the European Union to cope with chaos caused by the U.S aluminum and steel tariffs, the commerce ministry said on Monday.\nChina will take action to resolutely safeguard Chinese firms’ interests, the ministry’s Wang Hejun said, after the EU’s decision to launch an investigation into imported steel in response to the U.S. tariffs.\nAdopting trade protection measures is not the correct choice and will only worsen the chaotic international trade caused by the U.S. action, Wang said.\nThe ministry said on Friday that China was planning measures against up to $3 billion of U.S. imports to balance U.S. tariffs against Chinese steel and aluminum products.\nReporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ",
