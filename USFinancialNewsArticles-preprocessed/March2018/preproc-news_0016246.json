Augustin had 20 points and nine assists for the Magic. Fournier finished with 17 points and Shelvin Mack added 10 off the bench.\nReggie Bullock and James Ennis III each scored 21 points for the Pistons, who have lost seven of their last nine games. Blake Griffin contributed 12 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. Dwight Buycks and Anthony Tolliver each added 12 points off the bench, while Andre Drummond chipped in 10 points and 15 rebounds.\nThe Magic shot 51.2 percent from the field and 36.1 percent from long range while winning for the first time since topping Atlanta 100-98 on Feb. 8. Detroit shot 43.5 percent overall and 41.4 percent on 3-point attempts.\nOrlando outscored Detroit 11-2 in overtime.\nFournier hit a three to give Orlando the lead in overtime. He then was credited with a layup when Drummond was called for goaltending.\nFournier made one of two free throws with 2:27 left in overtime to make it 110-104.\nThe Pistons didn’t score in overtime until Tolliver was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 32.3 seconds left. Tolliver made two free throws. Augustin answered with free throws.\nOrlando scored the first nine points and led the remainder of the first half. Detroit took its first lead early in the third quarter. The Pistons were up by seven with under five minutes remaining.\nThe Magic then reeled off eight straight points, including six by Gordon, to take a 101-100 lead.\nBullock made two free throws with 1:50 remaining to give Detroit a 102-101. Both teams came up empty in their next possession. Fournier then hit a 3-pointer to give Orlando a two-point lead. Ennis tied it with 7.2 seconds remaining on a fast-break dunk off a Griffin feed.\nVucevic stumbled on the Magic’s last possession of regulation and lost the ball.\nOrlando won the season series 2-1. The teams split the first two meetings in the December.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
