    "text": "* Crude up as OPEC/non-OPEC deal to hold through 2018\n* But rising U.S. crude inventories, production cap prices\n* Shanghai crude futures down almost 10 pct since Monday launch\n* Goldman says Shanghai crude launch was \"relatively successful\" (Adds Goldman Sachs comments on Shanghai crude futures, updates prices)\nSINGAPORE, March 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday as the producer cartel OPEC and other suppliers look set to continue withholding output for the rest of the year and potentially into 2019.\nU.S. WTI crude futures were at $64.62 a barrel at 0354 GMT, up 24 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their previous settlement.\nBrent crude futures were at $69.81 per barrel, up 28 cents, or 0.4 percent.\nThe Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia started cutting output in 2017 to rein in oversupply and prop up the market.\nBrent, off which OPEC prices most its crude exports, has risen by around a quarter since then, which has lead to speculation that the restraints on production may be lifted.\nBut sources at OPEC told Reuters this week that the group and its allies were set to keep their deal on cutting production for the rest of 2018.\nDespite this, Brent remained below $70 and WTI under $65 per barrel, weighed by rising crude inventories and production in the United States.\nCommercial U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.6 million barrels in the last week <C-STK-T-EIA> to 429.95 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday.\nU.S. crude oil production hit a record, at 10.43 million barrels per day (bpd) <C-OUT-T-EIA>. That puts the United States ahead of top exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia pumps out more, at 11 million bpd.\nIn China, Shanghai crude oil futures opened Thursday's morning session down nearly 2 percent, pushing the new market close to parity with U.S. prices.\nThe latest drop takes the fall since the contract's launch on Monday to 10 percent.\nDespite high volatility this week and some remaining skepticism about Shanghai's trading hours as well as doubts about the process for physical delivery of crude under contract, most analysts expect the contract to establish itself as a third global oil price benchmark next to Brent and WTI.\nGoldman Sachs said in a note to clients that there was \"finally, an exchange traded price for Chinese crude oil.\"\nThe U.S. bank said Shanghai's \"start of trading was relatively successful (as)... it is the first onshore Chinese commodity contract that allows direct trading by foreign investors and is denominated in RMB (yuan), indirectly promoting the use of the Chinese currency.\"\nGoldman said Shanghai crude futures represented 3 percent of combined WTI and Brent trading volumes since its launch on March 26.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Aaron Sheldrick and Christian Schmollinger)",
