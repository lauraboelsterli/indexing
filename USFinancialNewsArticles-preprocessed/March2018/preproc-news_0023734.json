    "text": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko expressed confidence on Monday that a pending law to set up a new anti-corruption court would be in line both with Ukrainian law and recommendations made by the Venice Commission, a rights watchdog.\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko speaks during a news briefing after the talks with European Union Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini in Kiev, Ukraine March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko Setting up an anti-corruption court is a key reform that Kiev must pass to qualify for aid from the International Monetary Fund. But it is unclear whether the final version of the bill, which could be passed in the coming months, will satisfy the Venice Commission’s recommendations.\n“I am sure that the parliament will not delay in considering the amendments in preparation for the second reading, compromises will be found in the parliament ... that the text of the bill will comply with the recommendations of the Venice Commission, Ukrainian legislation and the Constitution,” Poroshenko said while addressing a business forum.\nReporting by Olena Vasina; writing by Matthias Williams; Editing by Toby Chopra\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
