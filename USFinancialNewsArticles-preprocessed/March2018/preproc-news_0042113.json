    "text": "BOSTON, March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Crozier Fine Arts , an Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM) company and the nation's leading fine art storage and logistics provider, today announced the acquisition of Artex Fine Arts Services. The acquisition includes all Artex customer relationships, along with 5 new facilities – located in Washington, DC; New York; Boston; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Los Angeles – and more than 160,000 feet of space, strengthening Crozier's operational footprint in the United States. Additionally, Artex CEO John K. Jacobs will join the Crozier leadership team.\nFounded in 1990 by Jacobs and Todd Herman, Artex offers fine art transportation, storage, crating/packing, and collection management to museum, gallery, private and commercial clients. The acquisition will enhance Crozier's Museum & Institutional offering, combining the company's reputation for client service and art handling/logistical excellence with Artex's unique museum services capability. This offering will include a consulting division that manages large moves; conservation specialists; a fleet of climate-controlled vehicles and an optimized logistics routing process; state-of-the-art and high-security storage warehouses; and five crate production facilities. Taken together, the combined capabilities will allow Crozier to meet the needs of the institutional segment of the fine art world.\nIn addition to the Artex acquisition, Crozier also announced the appointment of Tom Hale as senior vice president and general manager, responsible for Crozier's North American operations including sales, marketing, IT and human resources, as well as overall operations and client satisfaction. Hale joins Crozier from Lisson Gallery in London and New York, one of the most influential and longest-running international contemporary art galleries in the world, where he served as global commercial director. Prior to that, he was vice president of Sales and Development for UOVO, and worked at London's White Cube Gallery and art services firm Momart.\n\"The acquisition of Artex solidifies Crozier's position as the leading fine arts service provider in North America,\" said Ted MacLean, executive vice president, Iron Mountain. \"Bringing these two best-in-class organizations together gives us a strong network that enables us to service clients across all major art markets in the US, leveraging the Crozier and Artex brands and reputation for museum-class services.\"\nAcquired by Iron Mountain in late 2015, Crozier advances the company's strategy to grow adjacent businesses with its promise of serving as the trusted guardian of its customers' most precious assets.\nAbout Crozier Fine Arts\nBased in New York, Crozier Fine Arts is an industry-leader in art storage and an advocate for worldwide commercial standards.
