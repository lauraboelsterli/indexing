    "text": "GRENOBLE, France, UnitySC , a leader in advanced inspection and metrology solutions, today announced it acquired 100% of the shares of HSEB Dresden, GmbH (HSEB), a leading supplier in optical inspection, review and metrology for high-value semiconductor applications. Following the acquisition, the new entity’s extended line of leading-edge process control solutions will provide a unique and essential inspection and metrology capability to semiconductor manufacturers. Together, the entity’s offerings span substrate, front-end-of-line (FEOL) manufacturing, wafer-level packaging, 3D ICs and power semiconductors. Further, bringing together the two companies will strengthen worldwide customer support for all platforms.\nThe combined product portfolio and future common platforms of UnitySC and HSEB will support manufacturing of devices used in mobility, automotive and internet of things applications. Combined, these markets are expected to reach a 14% CAGR, far outpacing the 8% growth forecast of the rest of the semiconductor industry. This will require the expansion and construction of new manufacturing facilities with novel equipment lines.\n“Thanks to the proprietary technologies developed by both companies, this strategic acquisition further strengthens our capacity for development and innovation, enabling us to be the preferred partner to meet new customer requirements,” said Patrick Leteurtre, president of UnitySC. “Our product portfolio now spans the spectrum required for substrate control of new FEOL, advanced packaging applications such as fan-out wafer-level packaging, embedded dies and through silicon vias, resulting in a value-added market positioning that will further accelerate our growth.”\nThe new entity is distinguished by its strong semiconductor legacy and focus on technology development. More than 50% of its 140 employees are dedicated to R&D. Its extensive patent portfolio comprises 46 key patent families related to new semiconductor applications, and the management team is deeply rooted in the semiconductor industry.\nUnitySC and HSEB products are already in service in the top five foundries and the top 10 OSATs, supported by an experienced service team. The acknowledgment of its products as tools-of-record by customers working on next-generation processes has generated a growth rate of more than 50% in a market that generally does not exceed 10% CAGR.\nAt closing, UnitySC paid an undisclosed fixed price for 100% of the shares of HSEB. Jointly, the two entities achieved a turnover of $20 million in 2017, and recorded $22 million in bookings by the end of February 2018.\nABOUT HSEB DRESDEN GMBH\nHSEB-Dresden GmbH, headquartered in Dresden, Germany, is a leading supplier of optical inspection, review and metrology for high-value semiconductor applications. Based on very smart design in-house technologies and high-quality optics, HSEB products focus on optical inspection with very high resolution and very high throughput and on extremely thin film thickness measurement with high lateral resolution. HSEB inspection products are tools-of-record at major foundry sites in FEOL, and HSEB metrology is enabling next-generation transistor technology.\nABOUT UNITYSC\nUnitySC, headquartered in Montbonnot, France, is recognized worldwide as a key player in inspection and metrology, combining advanced technologies in automated optical inspection and 3D imaging with high depth of focus line scanning, temporal-mode interferometry, spectrometry and phase shift analysis. This enables customers to deliver higher yields and achieve faster time to market. We provide standard and customized solutions adapted to specific industrial needs and constraints, enabling a new era in process control.
