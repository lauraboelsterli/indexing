    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 11:44 AM / in 30 minutes J&J says offered $2.1 bln for Lifescan diabetes business Reuters Staff 1 Min Read March 16 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Friday that private investment firm Platinum Equity had offered to buy its LifeScan Inc diabetes care business for about $2.1 billion. LifeScan makes blood glucose monitoring products and generated net revenue of about $1.5 billion in 2017, Johnson & Johnson said. The company said the acceptance period for the offer would end on June 15, unless extended, and during that time, consultations with relevant works councils were planned. J&J had said in January last year it was evaluating options for its diabetes care companies, specifically LifeScan, Animas Corp, and Calibra Medical Inc.
