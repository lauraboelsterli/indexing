    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) â€” Facebook is seeking to add a new office building to its Northern California headquarters.\nThe San Jose Mercury News reports Saturday that building permits compiled by Buildzoom show Facebook plans to erect the 465,000 square-foot (43,200 square-meter) building at its campus in Menlo Park, California.\nThe plans come as a number of technology companies including Mountain View-based Google and Cupertino-based Apple are seeking space to expand in the region.\nJohn Yandle, executive managing director of a commercial realty brokerage office in Santa Clara, says this part of the San Francisco Bay Area has never seen so many companies embarking on major expansions at the same time.\nInformation from: San Jose (Calif.)
