    "text": "0 COMMENTS The author of books on Muddy Waters and Stax Records, Robert Gordon has reported on the grass-roots weirdness of Memphis, Tenn., for more than 30 years.\nWhile the Bluff City is known globally as the home of Elvis, Mr. Gordon is more enamored of his town’s glorious undercard of James Carr, Charlie Feathers and Phineas Newborn Jr., to name a few of the characters in “Memphis Rent Party: The Blues, Rock & Soul in Music’s Hometown.” Pairing features, reviews and profiles with after-the-fact explanation and commentary, the collection includes Mr. Gordon’s biggest hits and some previously unreleased bonus tracks.\nAt Mr. Gordon’s rent party, we get to know local juke-joint legends the Fieldstones, psycho sideman Jerry McGill —“a gun-toting cowboy hero in black, the rebel who does wrong in the name of right”—and perhaps the last of the Mississippi River-men, Ernest Willis, a retired fisherman living in a trailer right by the waterline.\nA common thread Mr. Gordon sees in uncommon artists like Tav Falco and Furry Lewis is that Memphis musicians are not afraid to express themselves in ways that don’t necessarily translate into financial reward. That’s why the city has revolutionized popular music three times: as birthplace of the blues in the early 1900s, launchpad of rock ’n’ roll in the 1950s and hub of Southern soul into the 1970s. Musical revolution begins with originality.\nBut not all originality leads to revolution. Many of Mr. Gordon’s characters have gone down honorably, doing what they believe in without compromise. Mr. Falco, a rockabilly punk who frightened away mainstream success by soloing on a power saw, says, “Money was a subversion.”\nMemphis Rent Party By Robert Gordon\nBloomsbury, 254 pages, $28\nLike many of his subjects, Mr. Gordon found money elusive. Adventure came in steady supply, though. He got into the business in Philadelphia in the 1980s, thanks to critic Ken Tucker, who offered the chance to review an up-and-coming band’s late-night concert. “He asked me if I liked Sonic Youth,” Mr. Gordon recalls, “and I told him I loved Sonic Youth.” Mr. Gordon headed back home after the meeting, “went to my punk rock roommate . . . and asked if he had any Sonic Youth records—I’d never heard of the group.”\nThe plucky writer eventually returned to the South. While sitting on the front porch with rockabilly legend Charlie Feathers and downing white lightning in Junior Kimbrough’s cotton-patch juke joint, Mr. Gordon developed a sensitivity to the subjects of his writing and an awareness of the fine line between celebrating culture and ruining it with publicity.\nOne of the ultimate down-home events is an annual goat barbecue and fife-and-drum festival held in Gravel Springs, Miss. Performances of local music occur impromptu in open fields—sometimes hypnotic Hill Country-style blues, sometimes an exotic marching band ensemble featuring homemade cane flutes.\nAfter Mr. Gordon began regularly attending the event, hosted by fife player Otha Turner, who died in 2003, he came to resent the documentary film crews on hand as the presence of outsiders expanded every year. It was good for Turner, who collected more revenue on the picnic and sold more CDs. Mr. Gordon, however, lost interest. Film crews “broke the mood. Their signs advised Otha’s longtime neighbors that they were now on a film set . . . crews stumbled and shoved and shouted to save their shoots, killing the feel they were trying to capture.”\nBut Mr. Gordon began to wonder, “Am I writing about myself?”\nSuch self-awareness and discretion characterize his finest work. The soul of this collection is a piece on the R&B star James Carr and the inclusion of a previously unpublished interview that delves into the singer’s mental illness. Carr’s hits in the 1960s included “Pouring Water on a Drowning Man” and the legendary “Dark End of the Street.” Mr. Gordon caught up with Carr on the comeback trail in the 1990s. Carr had returned to the recording studio, working with the same producer with whom he cut his classics.\nCarr exuded menthol smoky mystique, “pulling drags that leave half-inch coals glowing.” He sang like his old self. But something wasn’t right. The singer veered between majesty and incoherence, with flawless takes giving way to words sung out of order. His producer had been through it before, but seemed more focused on working around Carr than working him up. Mr. Gordon pitched in, whispering lyrics to cue the singer and try to get him through the session.\nLater, Carr explained the source of his trouble. He’d undergone a transformation. “Do you believe another person can switch bodies with you?” Carr wondered. He recounted how someone had forcibly switched his body for an older, infirm version of himself. Mr. Gordon asked, “So when they switched you, they left your voice with you?”\n“Yeah,” Carr replied. “Seems like that’s all I am, a voice.”\nNot wishing to damage a fragile man in a precarious state, Mr. Gordon left out the “switched” story when he first published the piece in LA Weekly. Carr died of lung cancer in 2001, and Mr. Gordon’s story lasts as a haunting reminder of the artist’s humanity. Carr needed health care more than fame.\nSome of Mr. Gordon’s profiles—and their subjects—are more appealing than others, though I have to acknowledge here my bias for the old originals like Furry Lewis and Otha Turner over brooding bourgeoisie like Jeff Buckley and Alex Chilton. Adults trying to be cool make me sad. What I enjoyed most was the sense of humility and hard work that pervade Mr. Gordon’s stories. In a writing world that often feels self-celebratory to the point of delusion, Mr. Gordon reminds us that, as an early colleague told him, “it’s just words.” When friends in stable careers project their Bohemian fantasies on him, he stares back, longing for a dental plan. His choice, however, is not without rewards.\nLooking back at “all these heroic individuals who followed the muse and cut paths of their own,” Mr. Gordon sees “the fleeting shimmer of the treasure I’ve witnessed.”\n—Mr. Lauterbach is the author of “The Chitlin’ Circuit” and “Beale Street Dynasty.”",
