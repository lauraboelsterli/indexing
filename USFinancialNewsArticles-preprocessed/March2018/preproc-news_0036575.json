The hiring comes as new Chief Executive Brian Niccol looks to turn around the fortunes of the troubled burrito chain and reclaim some of its lost reputation. Brandt had worked with Niccol at Yum Brands, where he served as the chief brand and marketing officer of Taco Bell. Brandt most recently served as chief brand officer across Bloomin’ Brands Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s, Bonefish Grill and Fleming’s.
