    "text": "HOUSTON, March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amplify Energy Corp. (OTCQX:AMPY) (“Amplify” or the “Company”) announced today its operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, year-end 2017 proved reserves and provided guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018.\nStrategic Updates\nIncreased reserves: 2017 year-end proved reserves of 990 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 8% compared to 2016 year-end proved reserves Reduced debt: As of March 5, 2018, Amplify reduced net debt to $340 million, inclusive of $17 million of cash on hand, from $371 million of net debt as of November 3, 2017 Optimization / transformation: Continued to work with the Board and advisors to evaluate strategic alternatives, improve cost structure and streamline the asset base to be a growth-oriented, low-cost E&P operator; through March 5, 2018, the Company has reduced annual recurring cash G&A by approximately $6 million Economic drilling / free cash flow generation: Announced 2018 first quarter and full year guidance, which includes an active horizontal drilling program in East Texas targeting the Cotton Valley and generates significant free cash flow\nKey Fourth Quarter Highlights\nIncreased daily production 4% to 184.3 MMcfe/d, in-line with quarterly guidance Reduced lease operating expenses to $1.57 per Mcfe, a reduction of 12% from the third quarter 2017 and below the low end of the guidance range of $1.63 to $1.75 per Mcfe Generated net cash provided by operating activities of $44 million for the quarter, exceeding the midpoint of guidance of $35 million Generated Adjusted EBITDA of $48 million, exceeding the high end of the guidance range of $37 million to $42 million Generated $31 million of free cash flow, exceeding the high end of the guidance range of $20 million to $25 million Reduced total debt to annualized Adjusted EBITDA to 2.0x for the fourth quarter from 2.7x at the end of the third quarter\n“This has been another strong quarter for Amplify. Our assets and our employees continue to perform very well as we transition to a more streamlined, growth-oriented E&P company. Throughout 2017 we consistently met or exceeded our guidance metrics by maximizing production, driving down costs and generating significant cash flow which was used to pay down debt and further enhance liquidity,” said Bill Scarff, President and Chief Executive Officer of Amplify. “In 2018, we expect to direct a large portion of our capital budget into horizontal drilling opportunities in our core East Texas asset, and we expect the Company to generate significant free cash flow throughout the year. We will also continue to work closely with our Board to explore portfolio rationalization for non-core assets, but will only make divestment decisions that are in the best interest of our shareholders. The strong performance and significant cash flow from our assets gives us flexibility to execute strategies that will maximize value.”\nKey Financial Results\n$ in millions 4Q17 3Q17 FY 2017 FY 2016 Average daily production (MMcfe/d) 184.3 177.4 181.3 223.4 Total revenues $87.5 $75.6 $314.7 $284.6 Total assets $917.5 $951.4 $917.5 $1,973.3 Net Income (loss) $9.7 $(7.5 ) $(89.7 ) $(540.4 ) Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) $48.2 $37.8 $158.2 $320.6 Total debt (1) $376.0 $403.0 $376.0 $1,622.9 Total debt / Adjusted EBITDA (2) 2.0x 2.7x 2.4x 5.1x Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $44.3 $37.3 $220.1 $408.6 Total capital $11.6 $25.4 $61.2 $52.7 (1) As of December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively\n(2) Annualized for the respective quarter ended\nRevolving Credit Facility and Liquidity\nOn December 6, 2017, the Company announced that it had completed its fall redetermination of the revolving credit facility borrowing base and entered into an amendment to its credit agreement.

Approximately 71% of proved reserves were classified as proved developed with a total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of approximately $768 million.\nProved Reserves Table Total Proved Reserves (Bcfe) Proved reserves at December 31, 2016 917 Revisions of previous estimates 131 Extensions and discoveries 8 Production (66 ) Proved reserves at December 31, 2017 990 Production and Drilling Program Update\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Amplify increased average daily production by 4% to 184.3 MMcfe/d, in-line with quarterly guidance. This increase was driven primarily by first production from three new horizontal Cotton Valley wells that came online in the third quarter. Prior to year-end 2017, three additional horizontal Cotton Valley wells were drilled in the Joaquin area. Two of those wells were completed in the first quarter of 2018, with the third scheduled for completion in the second quarter 2018.\nIn 2018, the Company plans to drill an additional seven horizontal wells targeting the Cotton Valley formation, four of which are expected to be online prior to year-end.\nThe Company also participated in 3.0 gross (0.2 net) non-operated wells brought on-line in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk formations. The average IP30 for these wells was 1,070 Boe/d per well (91% liquids). Amplify expects to participate in 10 gross (0.5 net) new non-operated Eagle Ford shale wells, which will achieve first production by the second quarter of 2018.\nCapital Spending Update and Outlook\nAmplify’s capital spend for the fourth quarter was approximately $12 million, in-line with quarterly guidance. Fourth quarter capital was allocated 64% in East Texas, 21% in the Eagle Ford and the remainder focused primarily on workover and infrastructure related projects in California, the Rockies and South Texas.\nBased on the Company’s current drilling plans, the Company’s capital spending program for the full year 2018 is expected to be approximately $65 to $80 million. Amplify anticipates spending approximately 80% of this capital in East Texas and 7% in the Eagle Ford, with the remainder focused primarily on infrastructure-related projects in California, the Rockies and South Texas. Details of the 2018 capital spending program are below:\n$ in millions 2018\nGuidance\nMidpoint % of\nTotal East Texas: Horizontal Development $50.0 69 % Workovers 5.0 7 % Land, Facilities and Other 3.0 4 % Total East Texas $58.0 80 % Eagle Ford Non-Op - Horizontal Development 5.0 7 % California - Facilities & Workovers 5.0 7 % Rockies - Facilities & Workovers 4.0 6 % South Texas - Facilities & Workovers 0.5 1 % Total Other Areas 14.5 20 % Total 2018 Capital Program $72.5 100 % First Quarter and Full Year 2018 Guidance\nThe following guidance included in this press release is subject to the cautionary statements and limitations described under the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" caption at the end of this press release. Amplify's updated 2018 guidance is based on its current expectations regarding capital expenditure levels and on the assumption that market demand and prices for oil and natural gas will continue at levels that allow for economic production of these products.\nQ1 2018E (1) FY 2018E (1) Low High Low High Net Average Daily Production Oil (MBbls/d) 9.3 - 9.9 8.9 - 9.8 NGL (MBbls/d) 4.6 - 4.8 4.6\n- 5.0\nNatural Gas (MMcf/d) 86 - 91 89\n- 98\nTotal (MMcfe/d) 169 - 179 169\n- 187\nCommodity Price Differential / Realizations (Unhedged) Oil Differential ($ / Bbl) $3.35 - $4.00 $3.75\n- $4.50\nNGL Realized Price (% of WTI NYMEX) 38%\n- 45%\n38%\n- 45%\nNatural Gas Realized Price (% of NYMEX to Henry Hub) 96%\n- 100%\n96%\n- 100%\nGathering, Processing and Transportation Costs Oil ($ / Bbl) $0.63 - $0.70 $0.63\n- $0.70\nNGL ($ / Bbl) $4.75 - $5.00\n$4.75\n- $5.00\nNatural Gas ($ / Mcf) $0.55 - $0.65\n$0.55\n- $0.65\nTotal ($ / Mcfe) $0.43 - $0.51\n$0.43\n- $0.51\nAverage Costs Lease Operating ($ / Mcfe) $1.81 - $1.92\n$1.64\n- $1.81\nTaxes (% of Revenue) (2) 5.0%\n- 6.3%\n5.0%\n- 6.0%\nRecurring Cash General and Administrative ($ / Mcfe) (3) $0.59 - $0.63\n$0.46\n- $0.51\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities ($MM) (4) $35 $149 Adjusted EBITDA ($MM) (5) $37 - $43\n$160\n- $175\nCash Interest Expense ($MM) $4 - $6\n$16\n- $22\nCapital Expenditures ($MM) $10 - $16\n$65\n- $80\nFree Cash Flow (MM) (5) $19 - $24\n$71\n- $86\n(1) Guidance based on NYMEX strip pricing as of February 23, 2018; Average prices of $61.87 / Bbl for crude oil and $2.80 / Mcf for natural gas for 2018\n(2) Includes production, ad valorem and franchise taxes\n(3) Recurring cash general and administrative cost guidance excludes reorganization expenses and non-cash compensation\n(4) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities guidance does not include certain restructuring and reorganization expenses or changes in working capital\n(5) Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that Amplify expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Terminology such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “estimate,” “believe,” “target,” “continue,” “potential,” the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Amplify believes that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but such assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Such statements are also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Amplify, which may cause Amplify’s actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please read the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including “Risk Factors” in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, and if applicable, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other public filings and press releases for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those in such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release. All forward-looking statements in this press release are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Amplify undertakes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future results or otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release and accompanying schedules include the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. The accompanying schedules provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Amplify’s non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, net cash flows provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Amplify’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner as Amplify does.\nAdjusted EBITDA . Amplify defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss, plus interest expense; income tax expense; depreciation, depletion and amortization; impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets; accretion of asset retirement obligations; losses on commodity derivative instruments; cash settlements received on expired commodity derivative instruments; losses on sale of assets; unit-based compensation expenses; exploration costs; acquisition and divestiture related expenses; amortization of gain associated with terminated commodity derivatives, bad debt expense; and other non-routine items, less interest income; gain on extinguishment of debt; income tax benefit; gains on commodity derivative instruments; cash settlements paid on expired commodity derivative instruments; gains on sale of assets and other, net; and other non-routine items. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of Amplify’s financial statements, such as investors, research analysts and rating agencies, to assess: (1) its operating performance as compared to other companies in Amplify’s industry without regard to financing methods, capital structures or historical cost basis; (2) the ability of its assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest and support Amplify’s indebtedness; and (3) the viability of projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. Since Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or loss and because these measures may vary among other companies, the Adjusted EBITDA data presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net cash provided by operating activities.\nFree Cash Flow. Amplify defines Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA, less cash income taxes; cash interest expense; and total capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for Amplify’s investors since it serves as an indicator of the Company’s success in providing a cash return on investment. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities.\nSelected Operating and Financial Data (Tables) –\nAmplify Energy Corp.
