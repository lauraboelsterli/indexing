Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister), Leo Varadkar, speaks outside Stormont House, in Belfast, Northern Ireland February 12, 2018. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne “She (May) has given a number of important reassurances today, which I welcome,” Varadkar said after May gave a speech on Brexit.“However I remain concerned that some of the constraints of leaving the Customs Union and the Single Market are still not fully recognised.” Reporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",
