    "text": "March 2 (Reuters) - Speculators' net bearish bets on U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures rose to a one-year high earlier this week as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's upbeat remarks on the economy raised bets on a faster pace of interest rate hikes, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 342,889 contracts on Feb. 27, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data. A week earlier, speculators held 214,480 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures.
