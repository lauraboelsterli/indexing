(NASDAQ:CHUBA) (NASDAQ:CHUBK) (“CommerceHub,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”), a leading distributed commerce network for retailers and brands, today announced financial results and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“We had another strong financial performance in the quarter, with core drop-ship revenue increasing 14%, but we are most excited about the January 2018 signing of Macy’s as a new drop-ship retail customer,” said Frank Poore, CommerceHub’s Founder, President and CEO. “Macy’s is a storied retail brand with a significant online presence. This new relationship is yet another validation of CommerceHub’s role as strategic partner to many of the largest and most successful retailers online. Drop-shipping and virtual inventory are strategic initiatives at leading retailers, and CommerceHub’s superior platform, solutions and supplier network power our market-leading position.”\n“The power of our business model was again on display in the fourth quarter, generating $10.7 million of operating cash flow and $10.5 million of free cash flow on $3.2 million of net income and $19.6 million of adjusted EBITDA, while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 53%,” said Michael Trimarchi, CommerceHub’s CFO. “Full-year 2017 total revenue of $111.1 million grew 11% year-over-year, while net income rose 8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 20%,” he continued.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue was $36.7 million, a 12% increase from $32.9 million in 2016. Core drop-ship revenue was $34.4 million, a 14% increase from $30.2 million in 2016. Gross margin was 85%, compared to 82% in 2016. Adjusted gross margin was 86%, compared to 83% in 2016. Net income was $3.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to $6.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in 2016. Adjusted net income was $10.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $8.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.6 million, compared to $16.8 million in 2016. Operating cash flow was $10.7 million, compared to $4.3 million in 2016. Free cash flow was $10.5 million, compared to $3.3 million in 2016. Net cash and cash equivalents at quarter end was $19.8 million.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue was $111.1 million in 2017, an 11% increase from $100.6 million in 2016. Core drop-ship revenue was $102.1 million, a 13% increase from $90.4 million in 2016. Gross margin was 81% in 2017, compared to 77% in 2016. Adjusted gross margin was 81% in 2017, compared to 78% in 2016. Net income was $9.9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in 2017, compared to $9.1 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in 2016. Adjusted net income was $22.0 million, or $0.49 per diluted share in 2017, compared to $17.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $45.4 million in 2017, compared to $37.8 million in 2016. Operating cash flow was $38.1 million in 2017, compared to negative $48.1 million in 2016. Free cash flow was $35.5 million in 2017, compared to negative $57.7 million in 2016.\nAn explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above is included below under the heading “Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest comparable GAAP financial measures has also been provided in the financial tables included at the end of this press release.\nOther Recent Highlights\nTotal customer count at December 31, 2017 was approximately 11,600, up 15% year-over-year from approximately 10,100 at December 31, 2016. Drop-ship order volume grew 15% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 16% for the full year of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016. We expanded our CommerceHub for Retailers network with the signing of Macy’s, a top 10 online retailer, as a new drop-ship customer in January 2018. This win is a conversion of an existing in-house drop-ship program, which we believe demonstrates the complexity of such programs and the value CommerceHub can deliver through increased operational efficiencies, improved customer service and capital-efficient expansion of product assortments.\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will offer a live conference call, and a live, listen-only webcast of the call via the CommerceHub Investor Relations website at 4:30 p.m., E.T., today, Wednesday, February 28, 2018.

These statements involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, market acceptance and performance of our products and services, competitive issues, general market conditions, regulatory matters and changes in law affecting our business and the risk factors described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 1A \"Risk Factors.” Further, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all potential risks or assess their potential effects on our business. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any such statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. There can be no assurance that any expectation or belief expressed in a forward-looking statement will occur, and you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Please refer to our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, for additional information about us and the risks and uncertainties we face that may affect the forward-looking statements made in this press release.\nStatement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we provide non-GAAP financial measures that management considers in reviewing our financial performance because we feel they are relevant measures of the overall efficiency of our business model. These non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for, or superior to, and should be considered only in addition to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. They are subject to inherent limitations and exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements. Certain of these adjustments are based on estimates and assumptions of management and do not purport to reflect actual historical results. In addition, you should be aware that our computation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies do not calculate these measures in the same fashion. We define “adjusted gross profit” as gross profit plus share-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible amortization and restructuring charges. We define “adjusted gross margin” as adjusted gross profit divided by revenue. We define “adjusted operating expenses” as total operating expenses less share-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible amortization and restructuring charges. We define “adjusted EBITDA” as net income or loss plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of capitalized software costs and intangible assets, share-based compensation and restructuring charges, less interest income and income tax benefit. We define “adjusted net income” as net income or loss plus share-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible amortization, restructuring charges and the tax effects of these adjustments, federal tax reform and other deferred charges. We define “adjusted earnings per diluted share” or “adjusted EPS” as earnings per diluted share plus the diluted per share effects of share-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible amortization, restructuring charges and the tax effects of these adjustments, federal tax reform and other deferred charges. We define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by, or used in, operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude restructuring charges, the elimination of which does not result in a reduction of operating expenses necessary to conduct our business. By excluding these charges, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information that enables us and investors to better analyze our operating performance and the sustainability of our results and to compare our performance on a more consistent basis from period to period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest comparable GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial tables included at the end of this press release.\nCommerceHub Investor Relations Contact\nSara Leggat\ninvestor@commercehub.com\nCommerceHub, Inc.
