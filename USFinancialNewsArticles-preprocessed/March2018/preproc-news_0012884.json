    "text": "TOKYO, March 8 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose on Thursday, as fears about a global trade war amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s push to introduce protectionist tariffs were tempered by signs the move could include carve-outs for key partners.\nThe Nikkei rose 0.7 percent while the broader Topix gained 0.4 percent. Large-cap shares led the gains with Topix Core 30 rising 0.6 percent, led by 3.3 percent gains in Nintendo. (Reporting by Tokyo Markets Team; Editing by Himani Sarkar)\n ",
