    "text": "March 30 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s crude oil output in 2018 is expected to fall 14.7 percent from last year to 11.31 million metric tonnes, or 227,130 barrels per day, down 14.7 percent from last year, the government said Friday.\nCrude oil production is declining as reserves at offshore oil fields are running low, the government said in a statement.\nCrude oil output in the first quarter fell 7.7 percent from a year earlier to 3.57 million tonnes, it said.\nThe country’s coal output is expected to rise 9.2 percent this year to 41.51 million tonnes, the government said, adding that output in the first quarter reached 10.76 million tonnes.
