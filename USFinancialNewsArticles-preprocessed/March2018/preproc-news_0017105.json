    "text": "Conor Sheary scored two goals to lift the Pittsburgh Penguins past the Philadelphia Flyers 5-2 Wednesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.\nJamie Oleksiak, Phil Kessel and Evgeni Malkin also scored for the Penguins.\nPittsburgh goaltender Tristan Jarry stopped 26 shots in the win.\nTravis Konecny and Jakub Voracek each scored one goal for the Flyers.\nPetr Mrazek was the starting goaltender for Philadelphia and he struggled with only 23 saves on 27 shots.\nKessel put the Penguins on the scoreboard first at 18:35 of the first period. The power play goal was Kessel’s 28th of the season with Sidney Crosby and Malkin registering the assists.\nThe Flyers tied the game at 1 when Voracek connected at 2:07 of the second. The goal was originally awarded to Nolan Patrick but was later changed.\nClaude Giroux narrowly missed giving the Flyers a quick one-goal lead less than a minute later but was denied by Jarry.\nPhiladelphia kept the pressure on and did in fact take a 2-1 lead at 13:59 when Konecny scored a spectacular goal in which he flipped the puck into the net while falling down behind it. It was Konecny’s 18th goal of the season.\nThe Penguins tied the game at 2 at 10:36 when Oleksiak tipped in a shot off Philadelphia’s Andrew MacDonald. The goal was later reviewed by officials and was deemed good.\nPittsburgh went ahead 3-2 at 5:35 as Sheary gathered a loose rebound and scored. Crosby took the initial shot on goal and Mrazek wasn’t able to contain the puck.\nWith just 39.3 seconds left in the second, the Penguins took a 4-2 lead as Sheary redirected a puck past Mrazek. Crosby earned the assist for his 1,100th career point. Crosby picked up three assists and now has 91 points in 62 career games against the Flyers.\nThe Penguins improved to 21-0-1 this season when leading after two periods.\nPhiladelphia’s power play continued to scuffle as it finished 0-for-5.\nMrazek was pulled with 2:04 remaining yet the Flyers weren’t able to capitalize with an extra skater. In fact, Malkin scored an empty net goal 23 seconds later.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
