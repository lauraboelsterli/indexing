    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bluegreen Vacations Corporation (NYSE: BXG) (\"Bluegreen\" or the “Company\") today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nShawn B. Pearson, Chief Executive Officer and President said, “Following our successful initial public offering in November, we are pleased to report our fourth quarter earnings, which included a 5% increase in system-wide sales of vacation ownership interests (`VOIs'), net, and $66.5 million of net income attributable to our shareholders. We also continue to realize net new owner growth, which was 2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016. Our Bluegreen Vacation Club offering, which delivers authentic local experiences to our owners and guests, continues to attract the differentiated and largest target demographic of middle America, with a focus on the Millennial generation. The vacation ownership industry is one of the fastest growing segments of the travel and tourism sector. We believe that we are well positioned to execute on our growth initiatives to provide long-term value for our shareholders with our flexible points-based vacation ownership product and a robust sales and marketing platform supported by our exclusive relationships with nationally-recognized brands such as Bass Pro Shops, Inc (`Bass Pro') and Choice Hotels.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nNet income attributable to shareholders for the fourth quarter 2017 was $66.5 million, compared to $25.6 million for the same period in 2016; EPS was $0.91, compared to $0.36 for the same period in 2016; Total Adjusted EBITDA was $35.6 million, compared to $35.8 million for the same period in 2016; Increased system-wide sales of VOIs, net by 5% to $154.0 million from $146.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2016; Grew resort operations and club management revenue by 14% to $24.6 million from $21.6 million for the same period in 2016; Capital-light revenue (1) was 67% of total revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 63% for the three months ended December 31, 2016; Selling and marketing expenses, as a percentage of system-wide sales of VOIs, net, were 51% during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 52% for the three months ended December 31, 2016; Income tax benefit from the reduction of deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was $47.7 million, or $0.66 per share.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights:\nNet income attributable to shareholders was $125.5 million for 2017, compared to net income of $75.0 million for 2016; EPS was $1.76 for 2017, compared to $1.06 EPS for 2016; Total Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% to $148.6 million for 2017, compared to $137.9 million for 2016; Increased system-wide sales of VOIs, net by 2% to $616.7 million from $605.4 million during 2016; Grew resort operations and club management revenue by 8% to $97.1 million from $89.6 million for 2016; Capital-light revenue (1) was 67% of total revenue during 2017, compared to 60% for 2016; Selling and marketing expenses, as a percentage of system-wide sales of VOIs, net, were 52% during 2017, which was consistent with 2016; Income tax benefit from the reduction of deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was $47.7 million, or $0.67 per share.\n(1) Bluegreen's \"capital-light\" revenue include revenues from the sales of VOIs under fee-based sales and marketing arrangements, just-in-time inventory acquisition arrangements, and secondary market arrangements, as well as its other fee-based services revenue.\nFinancial Results – Fourth Quarter of 2017\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to shareholders was $66.5 million, or $0.91 per share, compared to $25.6 million, or $0.36 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to a $47.7 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, as deferred tax liabilities were reduced as a result of the Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 (the “Act”). The Act reduced the statutory Federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%. As a result, the Company expects to pay lower income taxes on its deferred tax items in future years and is required to recognize the benefit for those lower taxes in the period when the new tax rates were enacted. The Company provisionally estimates that its effective combined Federal and state income tax rate will decrease from its typical historical rate of 39% to a range of 26% to 28% in 2018.\nIncome before non-controlling interest and provision for income tax was $29.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 23%, compared to $37.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease is primarily a result of:\nA $4.8 million payment to Bass Pro in connection with an issue raised by Bass Pro regarding the computation of prior sales commissions paid to Bass Pro pursuant to our marketing relationship. While we believe the amount of commissions originally paid was consistent with the terms and intent of the parties’ agreement and intend to continue discussions with Bass Pro regarding such payment, we made the $4.8 million payment and recognized the payment as a general administrative expense during the fourth quarter of 2017. The resolution of this issue could result in an increase to our marketing expense in the future. A $2.2 million expense for severance costs related to a Company-wide initiative to streamline and realign operations to facilitate future growth and investment in innovation (the “Corporate Realignment Initiative”). The Corporate Realignment Initiative is expected to result in an estimated reduction in the Company’s annual salaries and benefits expense of $19.5 million. The Company expects to apply a portion of this savings to additional associates and expenditures for growth-driving initiatives in 2018. A $6.6 million increase in estimated uncollectable VOI notes receivable. This increase was due to increased gross sales of VOIs and a $1.0 million charge for an increase in estimated uncollectable VOI notes receivable related to prior years’ sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a $3.4 million benefit for a reduction in estimated uncollectable VOI notes receivable in the fourth quarter of 2016. The factors described above were partially offset by: The income associated with a 5% increase in system-wide sales, net; A reduction in selling and marketing costs as a percentage of system-wide sales of VOIs, net, to 51% from 52% in the three months ended December 31, 2016; A 14% increase in resort operations and club management revenue and a 10% increase in pre-tax profits from such activities during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nFinancial Results – Full Year 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to shareholders was $125.5 million, or $1.76 per share, compared to $75.0 million, or $1.06 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the $47.7 million income tax benefit recognized in connection with the Act, as discussed above.\nIncome before non-controlling interest and provision for income tax was $135.3 million for 2017, an increase of 8%, compared to $124.9 million for 2016. This increase is primarily the result of:\nThe income associated with a 2% increase in sales; An 8% increase in resort operations and club management revenue and a 2% increase in pre-tax profits from such activities during 2017 compared to 2016; A reduction in cost of VOIs sold to 7% of sales of VOIs in 2017 from 10% in 2016; These factors were partially offset by: The $4.8 million payment to Bass Pro discussed above; Expense of $5.8 million related to severance costs associated with the Corporate Realignment Initiative and severance costs associated with the retirement of an executive in September 2017; and An increase in estimated uncollectable VOI notes receivable to 16% of gross sales of VOIs in 2017 from 14% in 2016.\nSegment Results – Fourth Quarter 2017\nSales of VOIs and Financing\nSystem-wide sales of VOIs, net were $154.0 million and $146.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase was driven by an 11% increase in sales volume per guest (“VPG”), partially offset by a 7% reduction in sales tours. During 2017, we began screening the credit qualifications of potential marketing guests, resulting in the higher VPG and the lower number of tours in the three months ended December 31, 2017. The Company believes that this screening should result in improved efficiencies in its sales process and intends to continue refining its methodology. The VPG increased as the sale-to-tour conversion ratio increased 2%, partially offset by a 9% decrease in the average sales price per transaction for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. In the second quarter of 2017, the Company reintroduced sales of low-pointed, introductory packages, which the Company had previously eliminated in 2016. The sales of these introductory packages improved VPG by increasing conversion rates, partially offset by lower average sales prices per transaction.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, financing revenue, net of financing expense related to the sale of VOIs was $15.4 million and $16.1 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to the lower weighted-average interest rate on our notes receivable of approximately 15.3% at December 31, 2017 compared to 15.7% at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the weighted-average interest rate was primarily attributable to our introduction of “risk-based pricing” pursuant to which borrowers’ interest rates are determined based on their FICO score at the point of sale. As a result, the Company realized 2017 loan originations (after 30 day pay-offs, same as cash) with a weighted-average FICO score of 724 compared to 716 for 2016.\nOperating profit for the Sales of VOIs and Financing segment was $37.0 million and $43.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Sales of VOIs and Financing segment was $44.6 million for both the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment was also impacted by the variance in estimated uncollectable VOI notes receivable, discussed above.\nResort Operations and Club Management\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, resort operations and club management revenue was $24.6 million and $21.6 million, respectively, an increase of 14%. The resort properties Bluegreen manages increased from 46 as of December 31, 2016 to 48 as of December 31, 2017, due to new resorts under management in Charleston, South Carolina and Banner Elk, North Carolina.\nOperating profit for the Resort Operations and Club Management segment was $9.9 million and $9.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Adjusted EBITDA for the Resort Operations and Club Management segment was $10.5 million and $9.4 million, respectively, an increase of 12%.\nSegment Results – Full Year 2017\nSales of VOIs and Financing\nSystem-wide sales of VOIs, net were $616.7 million and $605.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of 2%. This increase was driven by a 10% increase in VPG, partially offset by an 8% reduction in sales tours. These changes reflect the impact of screening of potential marketing guests, discussed above. The VPG increased as the average sales price per transaction increased by 12%, partially offset by a 2% decrease in the sale-to-tour conversion ratio for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, financing revenue, net of financing expense related to the sale of VOIs was $61.7 million and $60.3 million, respectively. The increase is a result of a lower weighted-average cost of borrowing and an increase in our VOI notes receivable portfolio in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nOperating profit for the Sales of VOIs and Financing segment was $164.9 million and $162.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA of Sales of VOIs and Financing was $180.3 million and $169.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of approximately 7%. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment was also impacted by the decreased cost of VOIs sold and increased estimated uncollectable VOI notes receivable, discussed above.\nResort Operations and Club Management\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, resort operations and club management revenue was $97.1 million and $89.6 million, respectively, an increase of 8%.\nOperating profit for the Resort Operations and Club Management segment was $37.7 million and $37.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Adjusted EBITDA for the Resort Operations and Club Management segment was $39.6 million and $38.5 million, respectively, an increase of approximately 3%.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $197.3 million. Bluegreen had availability of approximately $219.6 million under its receivable-backed purchase and credit facilities, inventory lines of credit and corporate credit line as of December 31, 2017, subject to eligible collateral and the terms of the facilities, as applicable.\nFree cash flow, which the Company defines as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures, was $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $94.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in free cash flow is primarily attributable to higher inventory expenditures, including the acquisition of secondary market and just-in-time inventory, as well as higher income tax payments in 2017. The Company believes the Act will have a favorable impact on income tax payments in the future.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn November 17, 2017, the initial public offering of Bluegreen Vacations' common stock was consummated. Bluegreen sold 3,736,723 shares in the initial public offering and BBX Capital Corporation (NYSE: BBX) (OTCQX: BBXTB) sold 3,736,722 shares as selling shareholder including 974,797 shares sold during December 2017 in connection with the underwriters exercise of its option to purchase additional shares. Bluegreen’s net proceeds from the offering were approximately $47.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Bluegreen did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by BBX Capital. Bluegreen’s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 17, 2017 under the symbol \"BXG\". BBX Capital now owns approximately 90% of Bluegreen’s outstanding common stock.\nDividend Establishment\nOn January 3, 2018, Bluegreen announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend payment of $0.15 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on January 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on the close of trading on January 16, 2018. Bluegreen currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on its common stock of $0.15 per share, but such dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are dependent on many factors, including provisions of Bluegreen’s debt.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Webcast\nThe Company has provided a pre-recorded business update and management presentation via webcast link, listed below, on the Investor Relations section of its website at ir.bluegreenvacations.com .

Represent sales of third-party VOIs where we are paid a commission.\nJIT Sales. Represent sales of VOIs acquired from third parties in close proximity to when we intend to sell such VOIs.\nSecondary Market Sales. Represent sales of VOIs acquired from HOAs or other owners, typically in connection with maintenance fee defaults. This inventory is generally purchased at a greater discount to retail price compared to developed VOI sales and JIT sales.\nDeveloped VOI Sales. Represent sales of VOIs in resorts that we have developed or acquired (not including inventory acquired through JIT and secondary market arrangements).\nFinancing Revenue. Represents revenue from the financing of VOI sales, which includes interest income and loan servicing fees. We also earn fees from providing mortgage servicing to certain third-party developers to purchasers of their VOIs.\nResort Operations and Club Management Revenue. Represents recurring fees from managing the Vacation Club and transaction fees for certain resort amenities and certain member exchanges. We also earn recurring management fees under our management agreements with HOAs for day-to-day management services, including oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance, and certain accounting and administrative functions.\nOther Fee-Based Services. Represents revenue earned from various other services that produce recurring, predictable and long-term revenue, such as title services.\nPrincipal Components of Expenses\nCost of VOIs Sold. Represents the cost at which our owned VOIs sold during the period were relieved from inventory. In addition to inventory from our VOI business, our owned VOIs also include those that were acquired by us under JIT and secondary market arrangements. Compared to the cost of our developed VOI inventory, VOIs acquired in connection with JIT arrangements typically have a relatively higher associated cost of sales as a percentage of sales while those acquired in connection with secondary market arrangements typically have a lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales as secondary market inventory is generally obtained from HOAs at a significant discount to retail price. Cost of VOIs sold as a percentage of sales of VOIs varies between periods based on the relative costs of the specific VOIs sold in each period and the size of the point packages of the VOIs sold (primarily due to offered volume discounts, and taking into account consideration of cumulative sales to existing owners). Additionally, the effect of changes in estimates under the relative sales value method, including estimates of projected sales, future defaults, upgrades and incremental revenue from the resale of repossessed VOI inventory, are reflected on a retrospective basis in the period the change occurs. Cost of sales will typically be favorably impacted in periods where a significant amount of secondary market VOI inventory is acquired and the resulting change in estimate is recognized. While we believe that there is additional inventory that can be obtained through the secondary market at favorable prices to us in the future, there can be no assurance that such inventory will be available as expected.\nNet Carrying Cost of VOI Inventory. Represents the maintenance fees and developer subsidies for unsold VOI inventory paid or accrued to the HOAs that maintain the resorts. We attempt to offset this expense, to the extent possible, by generating revenue from renting our VOIs and through utilizing them in our sampler programs. We net such revenue from this expense item.\nSelling and Marketing Expense. Represents costs incurred to sell and market VOIs, including costs relating to marketing and incentive programs, tours, and related wages and sales commissions. Revenues from vacation package sales are netted against selling and marketing expenses.\nFinancing Expense. Represents financing interest expense related to our receivable-backed debt, amortization of the related debt issuance costs and other expenses incurred in providing financing and servicing loans. Additionally, financing expense includes the administrative costs associated with mortgage servicing activities for our loans and the loans of certain third-party developers. Mortgage servicing activities include, amongst other things, payment processing, reporting and collections.\nResort Operations and Club Management Expense. Represents costs incurred to manage resorts and the Vacation Club, including payroll and related costs and other administrative costs to the extent not reimbursed by the Vacation Club or HOAs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. Primarily represents compensation expense for personnel supporting our business and operations, professional fees (including consulting, audit and legal fees), and administrative and related expenses.\nKey Business and Financial Metrics and Terms Used by Management\nSales of VOIs. Represent sales of our owned VOIs, including developed VOIs and those acquired through JIT and secondary market arrangements, reduced by equity trade allowances and an estimate of uncollectible VOI notes receivable. In addition to the factors impacting system-wide sales of VOIs, net, sales of VOIs are impacted by the proportion of system-wide sales of VOIs, net sold on behalf of third-parties on a commission basis, which are not included in sales of VOIs.\nSystem-wide Sales of VOIs, net. Represents all sales of VOIs, whether owned by us or a third party immediately prior to the sale. Sales of VOIs owned by third parties are transacted as sales of VOIs in our Vacation Club through the same selling and marketing process we use to sell our VOI inventory. We consider system-wide sales of VOIs, net to be an important operating measure because it reflects all sales of VOIs by our sales and marketing operations without regard to whether we or a third party owned such VOI inventory at the time of sale. System-wide sales of VOIs, net is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to sales of VOIs or any other measure of financial performance derived in accordance with GAAP or to any other method of analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.\nGuest Tours. Represents the number of sales presentations given at our sales centers during the period.\nSale to Tour Conversion Ratio. Represents the rate at which guest tours are converted to sales of VOIs and is calculated by dividing guest tours by number of VOI sales transactions.\nAverage Sales Volume Per Guest (“VPG”). Represents the sales attributable to tours at our sales locations and is calculated by dividing VOI sales by guest tours. We consider VPG to be an important operating measure because it measures the effectiveness of our sales process, combining the average transaction price with the sale-to-tour conversion ratio.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings, or net income, before taking into account interest income (excluding interest earned on VOI notes receivable), interest expense (excluding interest expense incurred on debt secured by our VOI notes receivable), income and franchise taxes, loss (gain) on assets held for sale, depreciation and amortization, amounts attributable to the non-controlling interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations (in which we own a 51% interest), and items that we believe are not representative of ongoing operating results. For purposes of the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, no adjustments were made for interest income earned on our VOI notes receivable or the interest expense incurred on debt that is secured by such notes receivable because they are both considered to be part of the operations of our business.\nWe consider our total Adjusted EBITDA and our Segment Adjusted EBITDA to be an indicator of our operating performance, and it is used by us to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by companies, lenders, investors and others because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity, including cash flow, derived in accordance with GAAP, or to any other method or analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. The limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool include, without limitation, that Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect (i) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (ii) our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness (other than as noted above); (iii) our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; (iv) historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; or (v) the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations or performance. Further, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. In addition, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to definitions of Adjusted EBITDA or other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306006703/en/\nEdelman Financial Communications\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nDanielle O’Brien, 212-704-8166\nBluegreen@edelman.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\nBrad Simon, 305-358-5291\nBradley.Simon@edelman.com\nSource: Bluegreen Vacations Corporation",
