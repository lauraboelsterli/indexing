Amounts do not reflect adjustments for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles including those relating to amortization of premiums on securities held.\nNotes: (a) Net Asset Value (“NAV”) Per Share is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. (b) Market Price Per Share is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange. (c) Premium / (Discount) to NAV is the % difference between the market price and the NAV price. (d) Overdistributed amounts may be funded by capital gains on portfolio securities or through return of shareholder’s capital. Undistributed / (Overdistributed) Net Investment Income (“UNII”) (“ONII”) represents the balance to date of a fund’s net investment income less its distributions. Includes prior year ONII of ($1,213,911) for the fiscal year ended 7/31/17 and the UNII of $9,742,839 for the fiscal year ended 7/31/16. (e) The UNII information provided treats amounts relating to foreign currency transactions as net realized and unrealized gain (loss). However, these amounts are treated as net investment income (loss) for federal income tax purposes. In accordance with federal income tax treatment, the UNII balances would have been $0 ($0.00 per share), $0 ($0.00 per share), and $8,735,451 ($0.21 per share), as of the current quarter, prior quarter, and year ago quarter, respectively. While not required to do so, the Fund may attempt to hedge its foreign currency exposure, which may offset all or a portion of the foreign currency exposure included in the table above. As of the date of this press release, the Fund believes that it has significantly hedged its foreign currency exposure.
