Today, these firms still dominate the market and issuers still pay them for their ratings. 94% of the credit-rating industry's revenue was earned by three firms. Note: As of 2016 Source: Securities and Exchange Commission U.S. Housing Policy Is Frozen in Time When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were bailed out in 2008, lawmakers promised a reset of U.S. housing finance. But 10 years later, next to nothing has changed. Government-backed firms* make up 96% of mortgage security issuance * Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac Source: Urban Institute 3. Areas to Watch “People aren’t going to be that stupid again. So they find another way to be stupid…I think there’s going to be other crises.” Richard Bookstaber, former risk manager at Morgan Stanley and author Bitcoin, a New Mania Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, have exploded onto the scene, in part reflecting advances in technology as well as splintering trust in the financial system. Regulators are probing a number of the players involved in the market, and analysts warn that investments in these currencies could prove worthless.

Consumer credit outstanding Source: Federal Reserve Bank of New York Indexes: Out of Control? The rise of exchange-traded funds has made indexing a household word. But the number of indexes world-wide has taken off and now dwarfs the number of stocks, raising questions about the risks investors are taking on, knowingly and otherwise. There are more than 3 million equity indexes world-wide, compared to about 52,000 listed companies.

But Wall Street hasn’t forgotten what happened last time, and so for the moment few analysts are raising alarms. On the Regulatory Front, Lots of Uncertainty Republicans have promised a rollback of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, which President Donald Trump calls a \"disaster.\" But Democrats are largely opposed, and bankers say it's not so simple.
