Nifty IT index was trading 0.98 percent lower after gaining in four out of the last five months.\nIndiabulls Real Estate Ltd rose as much as 3.8 percent after the company said its units would divest 50 percent stake in Indiabulls Properties and Indiabulls Real Estate Co Pvt to Blackstone Group LP.\nMMTC Ltd climbed 10 percent while State Trading Corp of India Ltd rose 5 percent after commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu said that a merger of the state-run commodity trading firms was on the cards, according to a Mint daily report that cited PTI.
