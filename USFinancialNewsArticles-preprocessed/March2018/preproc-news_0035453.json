    "text": "March 20, 2018 / 2:51 PM / Updated an hour ago Trump congratulates Putin on election, leaders look to meet soon Andrew Osborn , Steve Holland 5 Min Read MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday congratulated Vladimir Putin on his re-election, a week after the United States took a harder stance towards Russia, and said they would likely meet soon to discuss the arms race and crises in Ukraine, Syria and North Korea. Putin won a landslide victory in Sunday’s presidential election, extending his rule over the world’s largest country for another six years at a time when his ties with the West are on a hostile trajectory. “I congratulated him on the victory, the electoral victory,” Trump told reporters at the White House while meeting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “The call had to do also with the fact that we will probably get together in the not too distant future so we can discuss arms, we can discuss the arms race.” The White House later said there were no specific plans for a summit meeting. Speaking of the arms race, Trump said: “We will never allow anybody to have anything even close to what we have.” Trump’s administration last week accused Russia of hacking into America’s energy grid and approved the first sanctions on Russian entities and individuals for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The United States also joined Britain, France and Germany in demanding that Russia explain a military-grade nerve toxin attack in England on a former Russian double agent, with Trump saying last week: “It certainly looks like the Russians were behind” the incident. Trump, who vowed to improve relations with Russia on taking office 14 months ago, has been under pressure from Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, to take a tougher stance on Putin, his inner circle and scores of Russian oligarchs. Republican U.S. Senator John McCain chastised Trump for the congratulatory call. “An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,” McCain said in a statement.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo “And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country’s future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin’s regime.” SOFTER TONE FROM PUTIN The Kremlin said Tuesday’s conversation between the two leaders had been broadly constructive and focussed on overcoming problems in relations, which are at a post-Cold War low. “The leaders spoke in favour of developing practical cooperation in different spheres, including on questions of how to ensure strategic stability and fight international terrorism,” the Kremlin said in a statement. Moscow and Washington are at odds over Ukraine and Syria, while U.S. allegations that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election, something Moscow denies, continue to cast a shadow over ties. Trump has said there was no collusion between his presidential campaign and Russians. Putin and Trump agreed on the need to work together to avoid a possible arms race, the Kremlin said, adding: “Special attention was devoted to working through the question of a possible high-level meeting.” Related Coverage",
