    "text": "44 COMMENTS For the second time in two years, countries around the Pacific are coming together to form a bloc aimed at boosting trade and putting pressure on China’s economic system.\nThis time, they are doing it with one key country absent: the U.S. \nJapan, Canada, Mexico and eight other Pacific nations signed a new version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, on Thursday. The Trump administration, which was expected later in the day to announce unilateral tariffs on global imports of steel and aluminum , pulled the U.S. out of the original TPP a year ago, fulfilling a promise in a 2016 election campaign dominated by skepticism about the benefits of global trade.\nThe goal of the pact is to open borders to more trade in the rapidly growing Asia-Pacific region and to set international standards, which many free-trade advocates see as crucial to managing the encroaching dominance of China, the second-biggest economy in the region and in the world.\nOfficials involved said the pact shows some countries are eager to liberalize trade at a time when the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and some other governments are wary of economic integration.\n“There’s rising protectionism around the world at the moment,” said David Parker, New Zealand’s trade minister. “It’s not just harmful for our own economies. An open world makes for a peaceful world.”\nMr. Trump and his advisers have made it clear they prefer bilateral trade agreements in which the U.S. can better leverage the influence of its large economy, potentially winning more concessions from a single partner than from a trading bloc. The TPP is also strongly opposed by U.S. labor, environmental and other left-leaning groups who say the deal favors multinational corporations over workers and consumers.\nFree-trade advocates in the U.S., however, were chagrined at the split-screen image of Washington’s allies signing a new trade pact while the American president unveils new tariffs.\n“While the TPP countries have today signed an agreement tearing down trade barriers, President Trump and his trade team are hard at work raising them,” said Daniel Price, a senior White House economic aide in the George W. Bush administration. “The U.S. is increasingly isolated,” he added. “Is this what winning looks like?”\nThe 11-member bloc, formally called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, will have less than half of the economic impact of the original, according to economists who back the TPP, which comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.\nThe signing in Chile on Thursday kicks off an effort to get a majority of the member countries to ratify the deal, allowing the agreement to enter into force. Several ministers expressed hope that would happen by the end of the year. The Obama administration, facing resistance to the deal during the 2016 election season, never brought the original TPP to Congress.\nMore on Trade \nTrump to Meet Metal Workers as Aides Ready Tariff Rollout U.S. Asks China for Plan to Reduce Trade Deficit by $100 Billion Trump Tariff Plan Challenges Trade System U.S. Helped Build Capital Journal: Trump Brings Republicans to Moment of Truth on Trade The Man Behind Trump’s Embrace of Tariffs The pact will eventually eliminate most tariffs among the 11 countries and set rules on intellectual property, labor and the environment that will help modernize economies such as Vietnam’s. It will also open up Japan’s highly protected agricultural market, allowing for more beef and pork shipments from Australia and Canada. The bloc could put some pressure on China to adopt market-friendly reforms or abide by Western-style commercial rules, according to officials who support the TPP.\nOfficials hope the pact’s provisions will help stem antiglobalization sentiment and spread economic benefits from trade.\n“Progressive trade is the way forward,” said François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s trade minister. “Making sure that our trade agreements provide real, tangible benefits to all citizens…will make trade more appealing.”\nThe agreement’s signing will spur the efforts of U.S. farm and business lobbyists to persuade Mr. Trump—or a future president—to rejoin the pact to address what they worry will be their competitive disadvantages in the region.\nPartly as a bargaining chip for any future negotiations with the U.S., the TPP countries have suspended some of the original deal’s provisions that were popular in the U.S. Those sections, which include international protections for drug makers’ intellectual property, could be restored if all the other countries agree. \nThe Trump administration is currently locked in contentious negotiations with Canada and Mexico to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. Those two countries have rejected proposals from U.S. officials designed to boost American content in automobiles, restrict access to U.S. government procurement contracts and weaken Nafta’s systems for resolving disputes.\nIn January, Mr. Trump shocked economists and business leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, by saying he would consider opening negotiations to rejoin the TPP “either individually or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all.” \nA spokeswoman for U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer declined to comment on the administration’s TPP plans.\n—Anthony Harrup in Mexico City contributed to this article. \nWrite to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com and William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com",
