    "text": "CHICAGO, March 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oil-Dri Corporation of America (NYSE:ODC), producer and marketer of sorbent mineral products, announced today its second quarter and six-month earnings of fiscal 2018.\nSecond Quarter Year to Date Ended January 31, 2018 Ended January 31, 2018 F18 F17 Change F18 F17 Change Consolidated Results Net Sales $ 68,894,000 $ 65,174,000 6% $ 135,540,000 $ 131,786,000 3% Net Income $ (1,096,000 ) $ 4,250,000 N/A $ 1,954,000 $ 6,259,000 -69% Earnings per Diluted Share $ (0.15 ) $ 0.58 N/A $ 0.26 $ 0.86 -70% Business to Business Net Sales $ 27,355,000 $ 23,261,000 18% $ 54,442,000 $ 50,734,000 7% Segment Operating Income $ 9,759,000 $ 7,815,000 25% $ 18,635,000 $ 17,223,000 8% Retail and Wholesale Net Sales $ 41,539,000 $ 41,913,000 -1% $ 81,098,000 $ 81,052,000 Flat Segment Operating Income $ 2,422,000 $ 4,987,000 -51% $ 4,787,000 $ 4,480,000 7% Daniel S. Jaffee stated, “With the recent passing of my father, the Board of Directors has appointed me as Chairman. I am humbled and honored to assume the role and to continue growing Oil-Dri in my father and grandfather’s legacy.\nWith respect to financial results, our strategy to focus on value-added products continued to demonstrate success. Year to date sales were an all-time record for the first six months of a fiscal year.\nThe reduction in net income detailed above was significantly impacted by a one-time $5,091,000 tax expense adjustment to reflect the impact on deferred income tax assets under the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The tax expense adjustment effectively reduced diluted net income per share by $0.69 for the first six months of fiscal 2018.\nWe saw strong performances by all business to business products and private label cat litter. Sales of our granules used for agricultural carrier applications increased approximately 50% during the quarter. Sales of our Amlan animal health products increased, specifically in Latin America. Fluids purification products sold to edible oil, petroleum and biodiesel producers also increased in the quarter.\nWe launched the Cat’s Pride Litter for Good campaign late in the quarter and are excited about the traction gained so far. Now, with every purchase of a Cat’s Pride Fresh & Light jug, we will be donating a pound of litter to shelters across America. To date, we have increased our Cat’s Pride Club membership exponentially, received thousands of shelter nominations and promised 435,178 pounds of litter donations all helping to reach our goal of donating five million pounds of litter in 2018.\nFor more details on our financial results and tax adjustment, please review the Form 10-Q that was filed today and join us for our next earnings teleconference on March 12th. Call details are available on our website’s ‘Events’ page.”\nWhile Oil-Dri’s founding product was granular clay floor absorbents, it has since greatly diversified its portfolio. The Company’s mission to “Create Value from Sorbent Minerals” is supported by its wide array of consumer and business to business product offerings. In 2016, Oil-Dri celebrated its seventy-fifth year of business and looks forward to the next milestone.\nThe Company will host its second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings teleconference on Monday, March 12, 2018 and its third quarter teleconference on Monday, June 11, 2018 . Both teleconferences will commence at 10:00 am, Central Time. Dial-in details will be communicated via web alert approximately one week prior to the calls.\n“Oil-Dri”, “Amlan”, “Cats Pride” and “Fresh & Light” are registered trademarks of Oil-Dri Corporation of America.“ Litter for Good” is a trademark of Oil-Dri Corporation of America.\nCertain statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our future performance, our business, our beliefs, and our management’s assumptions.
