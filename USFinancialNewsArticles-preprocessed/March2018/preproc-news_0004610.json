Stay strong, nor’easters. \nOn Point A new report explains lack of diversity in tech A new report and a companion website from the Kapor Center released this week points to the lack of conviction behind the costly “hodgepodge of one-off efforts,” that have done little to move the needle on diversity in tech. “The data makes it clear that women and underrepresented minorities face a vast and complicated array of barriers keeping them from careers in tech,” Melinda Gates said in a statement. The report identifies some of them – from unwelcoming K-12 classrooms and wealth gaps that prevent promising STEM students from effective college prep to the “harassment, inequitable pay, bias in promotion and toxic corporate cultures,” which drive them away if they do find a job. Click through for the proposed solutions. USA Today So, where are the women in tech? Ask your campus recruiter Wired’s Jessi Hempel reports on new research that shows that the campus recruiting process is often a turn-off for female candidates. The paper published in February by Stanford University postdoctoral fellow, Alison Wynn, examines tech company recruiting sessions “at an elite West Coast university” that were typically unwelcoming and in some cases, openly hostile to women. Some of the company presentations included sexist jokes and images, geeky references, and typically had only male engineers holding court. The women representing the companies were usually in support roles, handing out swag. The intimidating scene makes it difficult for female engineers to engage. “We hear from companies there’s a pipeline problem, that there just aren’t enough people applying for jobs. This is one area where they are able to influence that,” says Wynn. Wired Refinery 29 knows where the women are Enjoy this list of 20 “black women you need to know right now,” a celebration of black, female excellence in a variety of fields, from tech to fashion and entertainment. All should be bookmarked immediately – including Fortune’s own grit expert , Erica Joy Baker, and Black Ceiling profile subject, the writer/activist Brittany Packnett. The team at Refinery 29 says that while black women are getting praised for everything from their box office clout to getting out the vote in Alabama, “This is not just ‘a moment.’ This is us, and this will always be us. We’re not going anywhere.” Refinery 29 Where are the people of color in academia? It’s worth the subscription to the Harvard Educational Review, a quarterly publication, for this issue alone – every article focuses on race, gender or identity in some way. But if you only have time for one, start with this piece from academics Özlem Sensoy and Robin DiAngelo, the latter of whom identified the concept of “white fragility.” The co-authors rigorously examine the hiring practices of predominantly white universities to discover why their dreams for diversity are never fulfilled. “We argue that through a range of discursive moves, hiring committees protect rather than unsettle Whiteness. In so doing, they actively close the gates against racial diversity,” they write. Culture fit – we’re looking at you.",
