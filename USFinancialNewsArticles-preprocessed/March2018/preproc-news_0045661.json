Spain's Rafael Nadal in action during his match against Croatia's Marin Cilic. REUTERS/Issei Kato The 31-year-old has not played in the competition since helping five-time winners Spain return to the top tier of world tennis with victory in India in 2016.\nNadal was named in captain Sergi Bruguera’s team alongside Pablo Carreno Busta, Roberto Bautista Agut, David Ferrer and Feliciano Lopez.\nNadal, 16-times grand slam champion, withdrew from the Australian Open in January after reaching the last eight due to an upper quad problem.\nHe had been expected to return at the Mexican Open at the end of February, but missed his fifth tournament in a row.\nThe Davis Cup quarter-finals take place over the weekend of April 6-8.\nReporting by Joseph Cassinelli, editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
