    "text": "BEIJING, March 8 (Reuters) - China’s CNPC said on Thursday that its international unit, PetroChina International Co, has agreed to buy a 30-percent stake in Brazilian oil products trader TT Work, as it pushes to expand abroad.\nPrivately-owned TT Work is Brazil’s fourth largest oil products distributor, with more than 13 storage facilities serving 2,200 petrol stations in the South American country, according to a statement from state-owned CNPC. No financial details were disclosed.\nThe step comes as PetroChina’s oil and gas trading arm looks to expand globally almost a year after a veteran fuel marketing executive took charge of the business. Reuters reported on the international expansion plan in December.\nReporting by Meng Meng and Josephine Mason\n ",
