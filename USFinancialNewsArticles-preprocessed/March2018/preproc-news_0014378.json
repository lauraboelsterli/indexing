S&P 500 e-minis rose 5.75 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 32.25 points.\nAmong stocks, Express Scripts soared 17 percent after health insurer Cigna agreed to buy the pharmacy benefits manager for $54-billion deal. Cigna shares slipped 5.6 percent.\nKroger fell 5 percent after the supermarket chain issued a disappointing full-year profit forecast.\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters rose 3.3 percent as sales at established stores topped analysts’ estimates for the holiday shopping quarter.\nA Labor Department report showed initial jobless claims rebounded from a more than 48-year low last week, but the trend continued to point to robust labor market conditions.\nA comprehensive reading on jobs and wage is expected on Friday. The average hourly earnings is expected to slow to 2.8 percent in February on an annualized basis, from 2.9 percent in January.\nInvestors are worried that higher wages could lead to faster interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and make borrowing expensive for companies.
