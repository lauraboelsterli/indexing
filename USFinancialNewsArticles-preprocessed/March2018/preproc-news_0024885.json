(NASDAQ:EVEP) and its subsidiaries (collectively, “EVEP” or the “Company”) today announced that it has entered into a restructuring support agreement (“RSA”) with certain banks and certain holders of its senior notes. The RSA contemplates a comprehensive restructuring of the Company’s capital structure, to be implemented through a proposed pre-packaged plan of reorganization that will significantly deleverage the Company’s balance sheet.\nNeither EnerVest, Ltd., nor EnerVest Operating, L.L.C., is seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief.\nEnerVest Operating, L.L.C., will continue to operate assets for EVEP.\nHouston-based EnerVest, founded in 1992, acquires, develops and operates oil and gas fields in 14 states on behalf of its institutional investors.
