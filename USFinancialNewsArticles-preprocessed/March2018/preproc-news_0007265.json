Jordan Peele, a comedian who wrote and directed the film, also won best director at the annual awards that recognizes the year’s best independent achievements made on small budgets. “This means so much,” Peele said accepting the best feature award. “We are in the beginning of a renaissance right now, where stories from the outsider ... are being honored and recognized and celebrated,” Peele added. “Get Out,” which tells the story of a young black man who visits his white girlfriend’s family as a racial satire, was a box office juggernaut for Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures, grossing $176 million at U.S. and Canadian theaters. The film has earned four Oscar nominations, including best picture, best director, best original screenplay and best actor for Daniel Kaluuya. 2018 Film Independent Spirit Awards - Show - Santa Monica, California, U.S., 03/03/2018 - Producer and Director Jordan Peele accepts the Best Feature Award accompanied by the cast of his film \"Get Out.\" REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni The last four winners of the Spirit Awards’ top prize -“Moonlight,”“Spotlight,”“Birdman” and“12 Years a Slave” - all went on to win the best picture Oscar, which will be awarded on Sunday.
