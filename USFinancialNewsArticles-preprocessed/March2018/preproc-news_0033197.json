    "text": "March 20, 2018 / 5:04 PM / Updated 32 minutes ago MOVES-Senior Black Sea trader at Bunge leaves Reuters Staff 2 Min Read PARIS, March 20 (Reuters) - Gert Bosscher, a senior grain trader for the Black Sea region at U.S. trader Bunge, left the company last week, he said on Monday, at a time when the group is struggling in one of the world’s largest grain exporting hubs. Bosscher, whose title on his LinkedIn profile was Manager Black Sea, declined to say what he would do next. Bunge declined to comment. His move comes at a time when the U.S. group is struggling with poor results that have left its management fending off takeover interest from rivals including Archer Daniels Midland Co and Glencore Plc. Grain traders have been facing rising competition in the Black Sea region in recent years, notably in Russia, one of the world’s largest wheat exporters. Trading margins have also been squeezed by a global supply glut. Bunge last year announced it would re-focus its Russian grain trading on its Azov Sea export terminal near the southern city of Rostov-on-Don in an effort to boost efficiency. Bunge is the “B” of the so-called ABCDs of global grain trading, which also includes ADM, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co. Bosscher, who left Bunge’s Geneva office on Friday, joined the group in 2013 after working in companies including Glencore and Nidera - now part of COFCO International - according to his LinkedIn profile.
