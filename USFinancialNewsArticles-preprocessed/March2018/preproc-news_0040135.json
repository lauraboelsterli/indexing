    "text": "Consumers might just start saying “no” to Honey Nut Cheerios.\nThat comes as General Mills , which also produces Yoplait yogurt , Gushers, and Häagen-Dazs ice cream , said it would raise the prices of some packaged goods Wednesday, due to rising shipping and commodities costs.\n“In terms of pricing, we are going to use a number of levers in some markets and some businesses; it’s going to be list price increase,” said Donald Mulligan, the firm’s Chief Financial Officer, also pointing to greater inflation in the U.S. economy.\nThat news, alongside a lowered full-year forecast, cut the 151-year-old food giant’s market value by $2.5 billion, to about $25.8 billion. Shares feel about 9% in trading—its single worst slide in almost a decade.\nThat came as General Mills said during its fiscal third quarter earnings that it expected earnings of $3.08 to $3.11 per share for the year—a significant difference the previously forecasted $3.17.\nHigher shipping prices are ringing throughout the industry . During the firm’s earnings call, CEO Jeff Harmening, noted that freight costs now represent about 20% of shipments, against a historical 5%.\n“In fact North American freight spot prices were near 20-year highs in February,” he said.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article attributed the Quote: referring to higher freight costs to Vice President Jeff Siemon. This article has been edited to reflect that CEO Jeff Harmening made the statement.",
