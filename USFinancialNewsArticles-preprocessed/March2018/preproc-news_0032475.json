    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 5:50 AM / Updated 17 minutes ago Stoke striker Diouf 'slight chance' for Everton game   Stoke City striker Mame Biram Diouf has stepped up his recovery from a shoulder injury and faces a fitness test to be available for Saturday’s Premier League clash against Everton, manager Paul Lambert said. Soccer Football - Premier League - Southampton vs Stoke City - St Mary's Stadium, Southampton, Britain - March 3, 2018 Stoke City's Mame Biram Diouf gestures Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs The Senegal international picked up the injury in Stoke’s goalless draw at Southampton earlier this month and the initial diagnosis suggested the 30-year-old would face a long spell on the sidelines. “With regards to Mame, he has a slight chance, but we are going to have to have a look at him over the next day or so,” Lambert said. “There are a few decisions to be made before kick-off and there are a few areas of the pitch that we may need to shake things up in a little bit.” However, Lambert suggested he is unlikely to rush Diouf into action too early with fellow forwards Peter Crouch and Saido Berahino likely to lead the line against the ninth-placed Everton. Stoke, who were beaten 2-0 by league leaders Manchester City in their last game, are second from bottom in the table with 27 points from 30 games. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru",
