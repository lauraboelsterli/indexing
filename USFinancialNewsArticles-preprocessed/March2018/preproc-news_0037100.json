    "text": " 27 AM / Updated 41 minutes ago Hyundai Motor shares tumble following U.S. probe of air bag failures Reuters Staff 1 Min Read SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares of Hyundai Motor ( 005380.KS ) fell as much as 4.8 percent on Monday after a U.S. regulator said it had opened a probe into why some air bags failed to deploy in Hyundai and Kia ( 000270.KS ) vehicles following crashes. The logo of Hyundai Motor is seen during the 2017 Seoul Motor Show in Goyang, South Korea, March 31, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji The probe came after four people were reportedly killed and another six injured in the crashes. Shares of Hyundai Motor affiliates lost ground, with Kia Motors losing 2.8 percent and Hyundai Mobis ( 012330.KS ) down 5.4 percent.
