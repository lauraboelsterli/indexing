    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn., March 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- 4M Carbon Fiber Corp. (4M) announced today that Paresh Chari, President and CEO of Mexichem Fluent Group, a $3 + billion division of Mexichem has been appointed to the Company's Board of Directors.\nMr. Chari was appointed to his current role to unite 3 different companies with multiple geographies and headquarters in Latam, Europe and the US under one group. Mr. Chari joined Mexichem through the acquisition of Dura-Line by Mexichem in 2014. Mr. Chari was the CEO of Dura-Line for over 18 years.\nDuring his tenure at Dura-Line, he grew the business both organically and through mergers, joint ventures, acquisitions and greenfield operations in several countries around the world. Prior to Dura-Line, he held executive positions in Fortune 500 companies including Emerson Electric, AT&T (Ameritech) and Kellogg Brown & Root (Halliburton).\n\"Mr. Chari is a seasoned business executive and a global leader, and we are excited to welcome him to 4M Carbon Fiber's board of directors,\" said Josh Kimmel, 4M's CEO. \"We believe his strong experience leading basic materials businesses, especially in M&A and building a global business across both developed and emerging markets, will be extremely valuable as 4M deploys its proprietary plasma oxidation technology to meet the growing global demand for carbon fiber.\"\nOf his appointment, Mr. Chari said, \"4M's mission, not coincidentally, is strategically aligned with my professional experience. It is my privilege to contribute to this dynamic company as a director.\"\nAbout 4M Carbon Fiber Corp.\nNamed for plasma, the fourth state of matter, 4M Carbon Fiber Corp. is headquartered in Knoxville, TN as a unique manufacturer of carbon fiber and oxidized PAN fiber.

All statements regarding the Company's financial position, potential, business strategy, plans and objectives for future operations are Forward-Looking statements. Many of these statements contain words such as \"goal,\" \"aims,\" \"may,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"would,\" \"exceed,\" \"should,\" \"steady,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"dramatic,\" and variations of such words and similar expressions identify Forward Looking statements, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not a Forward-Looking statement. Because Forward Looking statements involve future , there are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. The Company cannot predict the actual effect these factors will have on its results and many of the factors and their effects are beyond the Company's control. Any forward-looking statement made by the Company speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise.
