    "text": "NEW YORK, March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Daniel Elbaum has been appointed Senior Associate Executive Director of the American Jewish Committee (AJC). In this newly created position, Elbaum also will serve as Chief Advocacy and Program Officer for the premier global Jewish advocacy organization, guiding the organization in focusing and aligning its work for greater impact.\n\"Dan Elbaum is a trusted and committed colleague who will help steer our collective effort to fulfill AJC's mission, and assure closer coordination of advocacy across all AJC departments,\" said AJC CEO David Harris. \"With his new high-level position in our organization, AJC leadership on our priority concerns will be further enhanced.\"\nElbaum first joined the AJC staff in 2009 as director of AJC Chicago and has served since 2013 as AJC Assistant Executive Director and Managing Director of Regional Offices. AJC maintains 22 regional offices across the U.S., headquarters in New York, and 11 posts around the world.\nAs Senior Associate Executive Director and Chief Advocacy and Program Officer, Elbaum's responsibilities will extend beyond the regional offices to coordination of AJC's work on college campuses, its pioneering young leadership programs, national political outreach, global interfaith and interethnic work, marketing and communications, and media relations, all major components of the 112-year-old agency's policy agenda.\n\"I am excited and honored to take on this new role,\" said Elbaum. \"For the last eight years, I have been privileged to work with and learn from extraordinary staff colleagues and lay leaders who live and breathe AJC's mission. I am eager to work with them to advance AJC's work to build a safer, more secure future for the Jewish people, Israel, and all humanity.\"\nElbaum came to AJC in 2009 after six years as Civil Rights Counsel and Director of Development for the Anti-Defamation League's Midwest Region. Prior to entering Jewish communal life, Elbaum was a prosecutor in the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. He is a graduate of the University of Illinois College of Law.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/daniel-elbaum-named-ajc-senior-associate-executive-director-300615832.html\nSOURCE American Jewish Committee",
