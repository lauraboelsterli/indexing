The addition of the KBGE team further builds on CEC's capabilities, allowing the company to enhance its offerings in Austin and better serve clients across the country.\n\"Acquiring KBGE represents a significant milestone for CEC as the company grows its presence in Texas and the Southwest,\" said Ken Miller, P.E., President and CEO of CEC. \"Bringing the best of both firms together will allow us to provide our clients the highest level of service and expertise, wherever they are located.\"\nEstablished in 2011, KBGE joins CEC with extensive experience in consulting, civil engineering and land development.
