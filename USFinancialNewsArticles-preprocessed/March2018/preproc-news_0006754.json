    "text": "0 COMMENTS\nRandles’s Take Jonathan Randles\nMarijuana Doesn’t Have to Mean Bankruptcy Dismissal A bankruptcy judge in Woodland Hills, Calif., has pushed back on the notion that a debtor is denied refuge in bankruptcy because it is tangentially connected to a marijuana business.\nOn Feb. 5, a three-judge panel of bankruptcy judges for the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion vacating the order and remanding the case. The circuit covers California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington which have all authorized the recreational sale and use of marijuana. The opinion was first reported by Bill Rochelle, editor-at-large for the American Bankruptcy Institute. The decision is unpublished.\nThe marijuana issue came before Judge Maureen A. Tighe in a case she heard while sitting on the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The case involves a 92-year-old woman who filed for chapter 13 protection in 2017 to prevent foreclosure on a shopping center she owns in South Lake Tahoe. A trial court judge dismissed the bankruptcy case because the woman had received rent from a marijuana dispensary.\nA former federal prosecutor, Judge Tighe wrote in concurring opinion that if the trial court believed the woman broke federal law because the rent came from a marijuana dispensary, “an explicit finding of the facts required for criminal liability is needed.”\nThe woman, Patricia Olson, is legally blind and lives in an assisted living facility in Sparks, Nevada; the shopping center, managed by her son, leases property to a medical marijuana dispensary called the Tahoe Wellness Cooperative, court papers say. The owner of the dispensary sued Olson Bijou Center LP, the partnership that owns the shopping center, over an option agreement prior to the bankruptcy.\nIn chapter 13, Ms. Olson sought to sell the shopping center and an adjacent property for $3 million and reject the Tahoe Wellness Cooperative’s lease. Judge Bruce T. Beasley dismissed Ms. Olson’s case and her lawyers appealed.\nCourts, generally, have ruled that debtors involved in the marijuana business can’t obtain relief under the bankruptcy code because marijuana is classified as illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act. The U.S. Trustee Program, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice overseeing bankruptcy, has taken the position to seek dismissal of cases in which marijuana or assets derived from the sale of marijuana are present.\nThe tension between states that have legalized marijuana and the federal prohibition on marijuana has been complicated. In April, Clifford J. White III, director of the executive office of U.S. Trustees, said in a letter that his office was noticing an increase in the number of bankruptcy cases involving marijuana assets.\nIn Ms. Olson’s case, South Lake Tahoe city attorney Thomas Watson said in a court filing that the municipality is likely going to be involved in more bankruptcy proceedings involving the marijuana industry in the future.\nJudge Tighe said prosecution of a crime under the CSA would require evidence that Ms. Olson knew that she had leased property to a marijuana dispensary and that she intended to allow for the use of the space as a dispensary. Whether Ms. Olson had knowledge that her tenet was operating a medical marijuana dispensary is unclear; Ms. Olson said in a declaration referenced in the opinion that her son had leased the space to the dispensary.\n“A finding explaining how a debtor violates federal law or otherwise provides cause for dismissal is important to avoid incorrectly deeming a debtor a criminal and denying both debtor and creditors the benefit of the bankruptcy laws,” Judge Tighe said.\n“The Debtor’s personal knowledge is an especially critical inquiry for an elderly, blind woman residing in assisted living with an attorney-in-fact in charge of the lease,” Judge Tighe continued. Judge Tighe added “the presence of marijuana near the case should not cause mandatory dismissal.”\nLawyers representing Ms. Olson and the owner of the marijuana dispensary said the case signals how the bankruptcy system will likely have to reckon with the marijuana industry with greater frequency in the future. Seth J. Adams a Woodburn and Wedge lawyer representing the owner of the Tahoe Wellness Cooperative, said he has noticed while driving in Lake Tahoe that the dispensaries “are popping up left and right.”\n“There is absolutely no way that bankruptcy courts are going to be immune,” Mr. Adams said.\nBANKRUPTCY CALENDAR MARCH 01--Niner automatic stay hearing\nMARCH 01--Fibrant first-day hearing\nMARCH 06--ExGen confirmation hearing\nThe Team Send us your tips, suggestions and feedback.
