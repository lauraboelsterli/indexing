    "text": "LISLE, Ill., March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Navistar International Corporation (NYSE: NAV) today announced a first quarter 2018 net loss of $73 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to a first quarter 2017 net loss of $62 million, or $0.76 per diluted share. First quarter 2018 results included $46 million of charges as a result of the company's debt refinancing in November 2017.\nRevenues in the quarter were $1.9 billion, a 15-percent increase compared to $1.7 billion in the first quarter last year, driven by a 24-percent increase in the company's Core (Class 6-8 trucks and buses in the United States and Canada) volumes.\nFirst quarter 2018 EBITDA was $55 million, compared to first quarter 2017 EBITDA of $63 million. First quarter 2018 includes $49 million in net adjustments, including the debt refinancing and other items. Adjusted EBITDA was $104 million versus $55 million in first quarter 2017.\nNavistar finished the first quarter 2018 with $975 million in consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $947 million in manufacturing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n\"We are off to a strong start in 2018 thanks to our ability to grow Navistar's position in a strengthening market,\" said Troy A. Clarke, Chairman, President and CEO. \"We grew our Class 8 market share and improved our margins, on the way to delivering our best first quarter on an adjusted EBITDA basis since 2011.\"\nNavistar's first quarter Core chargeouts were up 2,400 units year-over-year led by Class 8 Heavy, which was up 56 percent compared to first quarter last year. The company's Class 8 market share was up 1.2 points versus the same period one year ago. Gross margin for the quarter was 19.6 percent of revenue, up 2 percentage points from first quarter 2017.\n\"Our improvement this year is due largely to the market's positive reaction to our new products, including the LT Series on highway tractor and the 13-liter A26 engine,\" Clarke said. \"In fact, the strong interest in our A26 engine has us nearly doubling our share of trucks with 13-liter engines in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a year ago.\"\nContinuing its cadence of new product launches, Navistar unveiled its new International MV Series medium-duty vehicle at the NTEA Work Truck Show earlier this week. The launch of the MV Series completes the company's Project Horizon product refresh, and reflects that program's improved cab design, along with the same driver-centric enhancements already launched in Class 8 vehicles.\nAdditionally, the company's alliance with Volkswagen Truck & Bus is accelerating Navistar's development of future technologies, including electric powertrains, which are already in development for school buses and medium duty trucks. The company is currently testing its first prototype electric school bus, the chargE, which Navistar will be demonstrating for customers and government officials starting later this month.\n\"As a leader in the medium and school bus segments, we know our customers and the jobs their trucks and buses do, which is why we're convinced these will be the market segments best suited for e-powertrains in the near term,\" Clarke said. \"These vehicles travel shorter distances and typically return to their base overnight, making the charging infrastructure less complex. And, perhaps most significantly, they will provide environmental benefit, especially in urban areas.\"\nBased on stronger industry conditions, the company raised its 2018 full-year guidance:\nRetail deliveries of Class 6-8 trucks and buses in the United States and Canada are forecast to be in the range of 360,000 units to 390,000 units, with Class 8 retail deliveries of 235,000 to 265,000 units. Revenues are expected to be between $9.25 billion and $9.75 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $700 million and $750 million. Year-end manufacturing cash is expected to be about $1.1 billion.\n\"We expect market conditions to remain robust and we are determined to take advantage of opportunities to grow share while delivering strong margin performance,\" Clarke said. \"Given the progress made in Q1, and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are confident that 2018 will be the breakout year for Navistar.\"\nSEGMENT REVIEW\nSummary of Financial Results:\nThree Months Ended\nJanuary 31,\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2018\n2017\nSales and revenues, net\n$\n1,905\n$\n1,663\nSegment Results:\nTruck\n$\n(7)\n$\n(69)\nParts\n137\n149\nGlobal Operations\n(7)\n(4)\nFinancial Services\n20\n13\nNet loss (A)\n(73)\n(62)\nDiluted loss per share (A)\n$\n(0.74)\n$\n(0.76)\n(A)\nAmounts attributable to Navistar International Corporation.\nTruck Segment – Truck segment first quarter 2018 net sales increased to $1.3 billion, primarily due to higher volumes in the company's Core markets, an increase in military sales, and production of GM-branded units manufactured at Navistar's Springfield, Ohio plant, which launched in the second quarter of 2017. This was partially offset by a decline in the company's Mexico and export truck volumes.\nThe Truck segment loss was $7 million in the first quarter 2018, versus a loss of $69 million in the same period one year ago. The improvement was primarily driven by the impact of higher volumes in the company's Core markets, a decrease in used truck losses, and an increase in military sales, partially offset by higher structural costs.\nParts Segment – In the first quarter of 2018, the Parts segment net sales were $568 million, slightly lower than the prior year primarily due to the expected runoff in Blue Diamond Parts (BDP) sales, partially offset by higher U.S. and Canada parts sales related to the Fleetrite ™ and ReNEWed ® brands.\nThe Parts segment profit was $137 million, down eight percent, primarily due to lower BDP margins and higher freight-related expenses.\nGlobal Operations Segment – In the first quarter of 2018, the Global Operations segment net sales increased 62 percent to $81 million, primarily driven by higher engine volumes in the company's South America engine operations due to improvement in the Brazilian economy.\nFor the first quarter 2018, the Global Operations segment loss was $7 million versus a $4 million loss in the first quarter 2017. Higher engine volumes and a benefit recognized as an adjustment to restructuring charges only partially offset a one-time benefit in the first quarter of 2017 of $9 million related to an adjustment to pre-existing warranties.\nFinancial Services Segment – In the first quarter of 2018, the Financial Services segment net revenues increased to $59 million primarily due to higher portfolio yields, higher overall finance receivable balances in Mexico and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates impacting the company's Mexican portfolio.\nThe Financial Services segment profit increased to $20 million primarily due to a decrease in the provision for loan losses in Mexico and improved interest margins.\nAbout Navistar\nNavistar International Corporation (NYSE: NAV) is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates produce International ® brand commercial and military trucks, proprietary diesel engines, and IC Bus ™ brand school and commercial buses. An affiliate also provides truck and diesel engine service parts. Another affiliate offers financing services.

The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and are reconciled to the most appropriate GAAP number below.\nEarnings (loss) Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"):\nWe define EBITDA as our consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Navistar International Corporation, net of tax, plus manufacturing interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA provides meaningful information to the performance of our business and therefore we use it to supplement our GAAP reporting. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to investors, analysts and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analyses of operating results.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nWe believe that adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain identified items that we do not consider to be part of our ongoing business, improves the comparability of year to year results, and is representative of our underlying performance. Management uses this information to assess and measure the performance of our operating segments. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to investors, analysts and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analyses of operating results, to illustrate the results of operations giving effect to the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the below reconciliations, and to provide an additional measure of performance.\nManufacturing Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities:\nManufacturing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities represent the Company's consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities excluding cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of our financial services operations. We include marketable securities with our cash and cash equivalents when assessing our liquidity position as our investments are highly liquid in nature. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to investors, analysts and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analyses of our ability to meet our operating requirements, capital expenditures, equity investments, and financial obligations.\nStructural costs consist of Selling, general and administrative expenses and Engineering and product development costs.\nGross Margin consists of Sales and revenues, net, less Costs of products sold.\nFree Cash Flow consists of Net cash from operating activities and Capital Expenditures.\nEBITDA reconciliation:\nThree Months\nEnded January 31,\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\nLoss attributable to NIC, net of tax\n$\n(73)\n$\n(62)\nPlus:\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n55\n59\nManufacturing interest expense (A)\n58\n62\nLess:\nIncome tax expense\n(15)\n(4)\nEBITDA\n$\n55\n$\n63\n(A)\nManufacturing interest expense is the net interest expense primarily generated for borrowings that support the manufacturing and corporate operations, adjusted to eliminate intercompany interest expense with our Financial Services segment.
