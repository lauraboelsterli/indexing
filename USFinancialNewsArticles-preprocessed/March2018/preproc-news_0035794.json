FILE PHOTO: Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal sits for an interview with Reuters in the office of the suite where he has been detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia January 27, 2018. REUTERS/Katie Paul/File Photo In the interview, aired on Tuesday, Prince Alwaleed declined to disclose the details of his “confirmed understanding” with the government but said it was easy to verify that he still held a 95 percent stake in his global investment firm. The process with the government was ongoing, said the prince, who was released in late January. Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Paul Tait",
