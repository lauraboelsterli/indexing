    "text": "LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - British new car registrations fell by 2.5 percent in February from a year earlier, continuing a downward trend, according to preliminary data released by an industry body on Monday The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) will release the final registration numbers at 0900 GMT.\nThe dip follows January data showing an even larger year-on-year fall of about 6 percent.\nThe SMMT said the January decline was partly attributable to consumers being deterred from buying diesel models that politicians have targeted because of concerns over air quality.
