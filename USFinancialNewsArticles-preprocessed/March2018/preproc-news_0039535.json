Joining the Board are Alfredo Altavilla, Palmer Clarkson and Sidney Simmons.\nAlfredo Altavilla currently serves as both the Chief Operating Officer of Europe, Africa and the Middle East and as the Head of Business Development at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, reporting to FCA’s Chief Executive Officer. Prior to his current role, he served as Chief Executive Officer of Iveco (the Trucks and Commercial Vehicles Division of CNH Industrial) and as Director of Chrysler LLC. He is an experienced, results-oriented global leader with nearly 30 years of strategy, business development and capital allocation expertise gained while living and working in Russia, China, Turkey and Europe.\nJ. Palmer Clarkson is the founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bridgestone HosePower LLC, the largest U.S. based service provider of hydraulic and industrial hoses used in construction machinery, mining, oil field equipment and general industrial applications.

To inform this process, active and constructive dialogue with Southeastern Asset Management was conducted and an agreement was entered into, resulting in the appointments of Messrs. Clarkson and Simmons.\nCommenting on the appointments, Robert Peterson, Actuant’s Chairman, said, “We are pleased to welcome these new independent Actuant Board members who add proven, world-class expertise in building businesses, driving growth and prudent capital allocation. The new Board is unified in its mission to work with Chief Executive Officer Randy Baker and the rest of Actuant’s leadership team to further management’s focus on the most profitable core businesses while representing all shareholders in maximizing long-term value creation.”\nPeterson continued, “On behalf of Actuant and its Board, I want to thank the directors who are stepping down – Gurminder Bedi, Alan Hunter and Dennis Williams – for their longstanding and dedicated service to the Company.”\nAbout Actuant\nActuant Corporation is a diversified industrial company serving customers from operations in more than 30 countries.
