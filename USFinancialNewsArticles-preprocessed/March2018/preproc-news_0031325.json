A view shows the building of All-Russian State Library for Foreign Literature, named after Margarita Rudomino, which houses the British Council in Moscow, Russia March 17, 2018. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich Russia’s move came after Britain’s decision on Wednesday to expel 23 Russian diplomats over the nerve toxin attack in the English city of Salisbury that left a former Russian spy and his daughter critically ill in hospital. Britain’s Foreign Office said in a statement on Saturday that the country’s National Security Council would meet early next week to consider its next steps. “Our priority today is looking after our staff in Russia and assisting those that will return to the UK,” the Foreign Office said in its statement. “The onus remains on the Russian state to account for their actions and to comply with their international obligations.” Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by MarkPotter",
