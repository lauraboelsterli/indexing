Dollar amounts in thousands. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nPortfolio Highlights for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nThe Company realized servicing fee income of $7.7 million from its MSR portfolio, interest income of $14.0 million from its RMBS portfolio and other income of $10.9 million primarily related to unrealized gains on derivatives. The unpaid principal balance for the MSR portfolio stood at $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 and the carrying value of the MSR portfolio ended the quarter at $122.8 million. Net interest spread for the RMBS portfolio stood at 1.27% and the debt-to-equity ratio on the aggregate portfolio ended the quarter at 5.3x.\nThe RMBS portfolio had both book and carrying values of approximately $1.8 billion at quarter end December 31, 2017. The portfolio had a weighted average coupon of 3.9% and weighted average maturity of 25 years.\nIn order to mitigate duration risk and interest rate risk associated with the Company’s RMBS, Cherry Hill used interest rate swaps, swaptions and TBAs. At quarter end December 31, 2017, the Company held interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $1.1 billion, swaptions with a notional amount of $155.0 million and TBAs with a notional amount of $26.9 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Cherry Hill’s GAAP book value was $20.44 per diluted share, a 1.9% increase, net of the fourth quarter dividend, from book value per share of $20.05 as of September 30, 2017.\nDividends\nOn December 7, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.49 per share of common stock for the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend was paid in cash on January 30, 2018 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 29, 2017. Additionally, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.5125 per share on the Company’s 8.20% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend was paid in cash on January 16, 2018 to preferred stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 29, 2017.\nCore Earnings\nCore earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as GAAP net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders, excluding realized gain (loss) on RMBS, realized and unrealized (gain) loss on investments in Excess MSRs and MSRs, realized and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, and changes in fair value of MSRs primarily due to realization of expected cashflows (runoff). Core earnings is adjusted to exclude outstanding LTIP-OP units in the Company’s Operating Partnership and dividends paid on preferred stock. Additionally, core earnings excludes (i) any tax (benefit) expense on unrealized (gain) loss on MSRs and (ii) any estimated catch up premium amortization (benefit) cost due to the use of current rather than historical estimates of constant prepayment rates for amortization of Excess MSRs. Core earnings include yield maintenance payments received in connection with the sale of the Company’s Excess MSRs. Core earnings are provided for purposes of comparability to other issuers that invest in residential mortgage-related assets. The Company believes providing investors with core earnings, in addition to related GAAP financial measures, gives investors greater transparency into the Company’s ongoing operational performance. The concept of core earnings does have significant limitations, including the exclusion of realized and unrealized gains (losses), and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other peers, which may use different calculations. As a result, core earnings should not be considered a substitute for the Company’s GAAP net income (loss) or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to core earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (1) Net income (loss) $ 20,233 $ 26,602 Realized (gain) loss on RMBS, net 1 (74) Realized (gain) loss on investments in Excess MSRs, net - (1,520) Realized loss on derivatives, net 1,260 4,056 Unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives, net (8,447) (15,307) Unrealized (gain) loss on investments in Excess MSRs - (2,588) Unrealized (gain) loss on investments in MSRs (3,688) (3,870) Tax (benefit) expense on unrealized (gain) loss on MSRs 1,487 1,486 Estimated 'catch up' premium amortization cost 2,245 (4,130) Changes due to realization of expected cash flows (4,935) (1,219) Reversal of loss on acquired assets, net - 244 Yield maintenance income 500 250 Total core earnings: $ 8,656 $ 3,930 Core earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership (113) (73) Dividends on preferred stock 1,240 - Core Earnings Attributable to Common Stockholders $ 7,303 $ 3,857 Core Earnings Attributable to Common Stockholders, per Share $ 0.57 $ 0.51 GAAP Net income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock $ 1.47 $ 3.48",
