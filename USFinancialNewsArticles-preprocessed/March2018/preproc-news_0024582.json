    "text": "STEVENSON, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The securities litigation law firm of Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of Xunlei Limited (Nasdaq: XNET) (“Xunlei” or the “Company”) securities during the period between October 10, 2017, and January 11, 2018, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors who wish to become proactively involved in the litigation have until March 20, 2018 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff.\nIf you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the class, you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff will direct the litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to accept a settlement for the class in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants claiming the largest loss from investment in Xunlei securities during the Class Period. Members of the class will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead plaintiff. No class has yet been certified in the above action.\nThe complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants’ failure to disclose during the Class Period that: Xunlei had engaged in an unlawful financial activity; OneCoin was a form of disguised initial coin offering (“ICO”); and Xunlei was engaged in the promotion of an Initial Miner Offering (“IMO”).\nAccording to the complaint, following November 24, 2017 news reports that the Company’s business partner conducted an unlawful ICO, a November 29, 2017 press release announcing an update on its business relationship with Big Data, and a January 12, 2018 issue of a risk alert notice regarding a disguised ICO, the value of Xunlei American Depositary shares declined significantly.\nIf you have suffered a loss in excess of $100,000 from investment in Xunlei securities purchased on or after October 10, 2017 and held through the revelation of negative information during and/or at the end of the Class Period and would like to learn more about this lawsuit and your ability to participate as a lead plaintiff, without cost or obligation to you, please contact Brower Piven either by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com or by telephone at (410) 415-6616.\nAttorneys at Brower Piven have extensive experience in litigating securities and other class action cases and have been advocating for the rights of shareholders since the 1980s. If you choose to retain counsel, you may retain Brower Piven without financial obligation or cost to you, or you may retain other counsel of your choice. You need take no action at this time to be a member of the class.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180313006347/en/\nBrower Piven, A Professional Corporation\nCharles J.
