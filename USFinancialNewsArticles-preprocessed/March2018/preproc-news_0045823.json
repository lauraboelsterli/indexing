Such temporary and voluntary suspension materially and adversely impacted our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. We want to restate that the Company was one of the two entities approved by the Ministry of Finance in 2012 to provide online lottery sales services on behalf of the China Sports Lottery Administration Center. In particular, such approval mandated that the China Sports Lottery Administration Center use its best effort to develop an online lottery sales management system as part of a pilot program for online lottery sales in China, and once such a management system is finished, the China Sports Lottery Administration Center should apply again for approval from the Ministry of Finance for official commencement of online lottery sales in China. The Company has been working and will continue to work with the China Sports Lottery Administration Center to develop the management system. To the best of the Company's knowledge, the approval by the Ministry of Finance for the Company to provide online lottery sales services on behalf of the China Sports Lottery Administration Center is valid and has not been revoked or amended as of the date of this earnings release.\"\n\"As part of our efforts to expand the scope of our business and diversify our revenue streams, we acquired approximately 40.65% of the issued share capital of Loto Interactive Limited (formerly known as \"Melcolot Limited\") in the second quarter of 2017 and 93.0% of the equity shares of The Multi Group Ltd in the third quarter of 2017. On March 6, 2018, we entered into a framework agreement (the \"Framework Agreement\") with the China Sports Lottery Administration Center, under which, both parties plan to cooperate to develop physical channels to sell sports lottery tickets. We believe that these new businesses and strategic acquisitions will create strong synergies with our existing operation platform, and the Framework Agreement will bring us strong growth potential.\"\nFourth Quarter 201 7 Financial Results\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues were RMB48.1 million (US$7.4 million), representing a significant increase of RMB 40.6 million or 541.3% increase from RMB7.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase of RMB 4.9 million or 11.3% increase from RMB43.2 million for the third quarter of 2017.
