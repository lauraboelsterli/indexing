The positive trend gained strength as the year progressed, with emphasis on the strong performances seen in the second and third quarters\" said Aliansce Senior VP Rafael Sales. \"In the fourth quarter, total sales growth reached 7.8%, and the strongest performance was verified during the month of November, as a result of a sales peak during the Black Friday period\"\nAccording to Rafael Sales \"In the beginning of 2018, we've continued to observe a brighter track for sales\"\n4Q17 Highlights\nThe Company's gross revenue reached R$ 177.1 million in 4Q17, an increase of 3.9% over 4Q16.
