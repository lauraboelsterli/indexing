    "text": "0 COMMENTS The dollar fell Tuesday, amid continued uncertainty over a trade squabble between the U.S. and other nations.\nThe Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently down 0.4% at 83.46.\nExpectations of rising tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners have put investors on edge in recent days, helping drag the dollar down from its February highs. Several senior Republicans have spoken out against White House plans to put tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, helping ease tensions. Some investor also believe the tariff threats may be a negotiating tactic employed by President Donald Trump, who is seeking to renegotiate trade deals with key U.S. partners, including Mexico and Canada.\nNevertheless, “the dollar seems to be increasingly punished for this administration’s unpredictability,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, in a note to clients.\nThe dollar was recently down 1.3% against the South Korean won, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told a visiting South Korean delegation that he was willing to hold talks with the U.S. about giving up nuclear weapons and normalizing relations with Washington\nThe euro was up 0.6% to $1.2405.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com",
