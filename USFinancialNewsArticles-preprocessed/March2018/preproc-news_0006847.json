    "text": "MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (“Park” or the “Company”) (NYSE: PK) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. Highlights include:\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nComparable RevPAR was $159.50, an increase of 1.7% on a Pro-forma basis from the same period in 2016; excluding the effect of hurricanes on Key West hotels, Comparable RevPAR increased 2.4% from the same period in 2016; Net income was $61 million and net income attributable to stockholders was $60 million; Adjusted EBITDA was $180 million; Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders was $145 million; Diluted earnings per share was $0.28; Diluted Adjusted FFO per share was $0.68; and Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.8%, an increase of 70 bps on a Pro-forma basis from the same period in 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nComparable RevPAR was $163.49, an increase of 0.7% on a Pro-forma basis from the same period in 2016; excluding the effect of hurricanes on Key West hotels, Comparable RevPAR increased 0.9% from the same period in 2016; Net income was $2,631 million and net income attributable to stockholders was $2,625 million; Adjusted EBITDA was $757 million; Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders was $596 million; Diluted earnings per share was $12.21; Diluted Adjusted FFO per share was $2.78; and Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1%, a decrease of 20 bps on a Pro-forma basis from the same period in 2016.\nThomas J. Baltimore, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I’m incredibly proud of our team and our accomplishments in our first year as an independent company. We’ve made great strides in closing the margin gap with our peers, returned nearly $1 billion in cash and stock dividends to stockholders and have made tremendous progress on our capital recycling program through the sale of 12 non-core hotels for gross proceeds of $379 million. We remain encouraged by the most recent economic data and improved business sentiment as we move into 2018, which we believe will translate into stronger operating fundamentals over the next 12 months.”\nSelected Statistical and Financial Information\n(unaudited, dollars in millions, except per share data, Comparable RevPAR and Comparable ADR)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Comparable RevPAR (1)(2) $ 159.50 $ 156.85 1.7 % $ 163.49 $ 162.30 0.7 % Comparable Occupancy (1)(2) 78.7 % 78.3 % 0.4 % pts 81.1 % 81.3 % (0.2 )% pts Comparable ADR (1)(2) $ 202.57 $ 200.40 1.1 % $ 201.56 $ 199.70 0.9 % Net income (3) $ 61 $ 17 NM (4) $ 2,631 $ 139 NM (4) Net income attributable to stockholders (3) $ 60 $ 17 NM (4) $ 2,625 $ 133 NM (4) Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 180 $ 186 (3.2 )% $ 757 $ 764 (0.9 )% Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA (1)(2) $ 175 $ 166 5.4 % $ 709 $ 702 1.0 % Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin (1)(2) 27.8 % 27.1 % 70 bps 28.1 % 28.3 % (20 ) bps Adjusted FFO attributable to stockholders (1) $ 145 $ 140 3.6 % $ 596 $ 586 1.7 % Earnings per share - Diluted (3)(5) $ 0.28 $ 0.09 $ 12.21 $ 0.67 Adjusted FFO per share - Diluted (1)(5) $ 0.68 $ 0.72 $ 2.78 $ 2.97 Weighted average shares outstanding - Diluted 215 198 214 198\n(1) For 2016, amounts are calculated on a Pro-forma basis. (2) Excludes unconsolidated joint ventures. (3) Includes net deferred tax expense of $9 million and net deferred tax benefit of $2,347 million recognized for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, from the derecognition and remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities associated with Park’s intent to be taxed as a REIT. (4) Percentage change is not meaningful. (5) For 2016, per share amounts were calculated using the number of shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of Park’s spin-off from Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. Per share amounts are calculated based on unrounded numbers and are calculated independently for each period presented; therefore, the sum of the quarterly per share amounts do not equal the per share amounts for the full year. Hurricanes Irma and Maria\nHurricanes Irma and Maria caused damage and disruption at certain of Park’s hotels located in Florida and Puerto Rico in September 2017. The majority of Park’s hotels in Florida sustained minor damage and remained open, while its two hotels in Key West, the Casa Marina, a Waldorf Astoria Resort and The Reach, a Waldorf Astoria Resort, sustained moderate damage and disruption and were closed for several weeks. Additionally, Park’s hotel in Puerto Rico, the Caribe Hilton, sustained significant damage and currently remains closed. Park recognized total casualty losses, net of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represent losses up to the amount of its deductibles. Park expects the Caribe Hilton in Puerto Rico to remain closed for almost all of 2018; therefore, the results of operations of that property are presented as non-comparable. Park expects that insurance proceeds, excluding any applicable insurance deductibles, will be sufficient to cover a significant portion of the property damage to the hotels and the near-term loss of business. Park received $2 million of insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $16 million in January 2018 for both Key West hotels and the Caribe Hilton.\nDispositions\nIn January 2018, Park sold the Hilton Rotterdam for a sales price of approximately $62 million. In February 2018, Park sold 11 hotels, including a portfolio of three Embassy Suites hotels (Embassy Suites by Hilton Kansas City Overland Park, Embassy Suites by Hilton San Rafael Marin County and Embassy Suites by Hilton Atlanta Perimeter Center) for an aggregate sales price of approximately $96 million, a portfolio of seven hotels located in the United Kingdom (Hilton Blackpool, Hilton Belfast, Hilton London Angel Islington, Hilton Edinburgh Grosvenor, Hilton Coylumbridge, Hilton Bath City and Hilton Milton Keynes) for an aggregate sales price of approximately $189 million and the Hilton Durban for a sales price of $33 million. When adjusted for Park’s anticipated capital expenditures of $132 million for the 12 hotels, the proceeds represent a 5.5% capitalization rate on the portfolio’s 2017 net operating income (7.4% excluding capex), or 15.3x the portfolio’s 2017 EBITDA (11.3x excluding capex).\nTotal Consolidated Comparable Hotels\nComparable RevPAR increased 1.7% for the quarter and 0.7% for the year, on a Pro-forma basis, due to a 0.4% pts increase in occupancy during the quarter, as well as a 1.1% and 0.9% increase in rate, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2016. Group rooms revenue increased 1.0% for the quarter and 0.6% for the full year and transient rooms revenue increased 1.6% for the quarter and 0.1% for the full year. Highlights across comparable hotels and Park’s markets include:\nHawaii : RevPAR growth was 3.3% for the quarter and 2.9% for the year due to increases of 20.7% and 10.7% in group revenue, respectively, and increases in rate during both the quarter and year; Northern California : RevPAR growth was 1.8% for the quarter, attributable to increased demand at the DoubleTree Hotel Sonoma Wine Country from the October 2017 wildfires in the area, despite a decline in RevPAR at Park’s two San Francisco hotels of 1.2% for the quarter due to renovations at Hilton San Francisco Union Square. RevPAR for the year declined 0.9%, from decreases in both rate and occupancy attributable to the closure of the Moscone Convention Center for half of 2017 coupled with the Super Bowl taking place in San Francisco in February 2016, and renovations at Hilton San Francisco Union Square in the second half of 2017; and Florida : RevPAR growth was 5.5% for the quarter and 2.7% for the year, primarily attributable to combined RevPAR growth at Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek and Waldorf Astoria Orlando of 13.0% during the quarter from increases in group and transient demand. The Orlando area hotels and the Miami hotel saw RevPAR growth for the year due to strong transient business and guests displaced by hurricanes, slightly offset by the hurricane disruption at Park’s two Key West hotels.\nTop 10 Hotels\nRevPAR for Park’s Top 10 Hotels, which accounts for approximately 65% of Hotel Adjusted EBITDA for the year, increased 0.3% for the quarter and declined 0.7% for the year, on a Pro-forma basis, due to decreases in occupancy for both periods and increases and decreases in rate, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2016. Highlights within the Top 10 Hotels include:\nHilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort : RevPAR growth was 3.3% for the quarter and 2.9% for the year due to increases of 20.7% and 10.7% in group revenue, respectively, and increases in rate during both the quarter and year; New York Hilton Midtown : RevPAR declined 0.7% for the quarter and 2.8% for the year, due to increased supply in the market, coupled with disruption from renovations earlier in the year; Hilton San Francisco Union Square / Parc 55 San Francisco – a Hilton Hotel : Combined RevPAR declined 1.2% for the quarter due to renovations at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square, offset slightly by increased transient demand at Parc 55 San Francisco. Combined RevPAR declined 3.3% for the year due to the closure of the Moscone Convention Center for half of 2017 coupled with the Super Bowl taking place in San Francisco in February 2016, and renovations at Hilton San Francisco Union Square; Hilton Waikoloa Village : RevPAR grew 0.3% for the quarter and declined 0.9% for the year, due in part to the delayed transfer of the first phase of rooms to Hilton Grand Vacations (“HGV”), which affected the ability to market for group business; Hilton New Orleans Riverside : RevPAR declined 2.2% for the quarter and 2.5% for the year, due to the effects of hurricanes coupled with a decrease in group business; Hilton Chicago : RevPAR declined 6.1% for the quarter and 1.4% for the year, from decreased rate due to a decrease in transient and group business which was driven by weak market demand and increased supply; Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek / Waldorf Astoria Orlando : Combined RevPAR growth was 13.0% for the quarter primarily from increases in transient and group demand and guests displaced by the hurricanes, and combined RevPAR growth was 6.2% for the year, due to strong transient business; and Casa Marina, A Waldorf Astoria Resort : RevPAR declined 19.6% for the quarter and 8.3% for the year, from the effects of Hurricane Irma.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nPark had the following debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017:\n(unaudited, dollars in millions) Debt Collateral Interest Rate (1) Maturity Date As of\nDecember 31,\n2017\nFixed Rate Debt Mortgage loan DoubleTree Hotel Spokane City Center 3.55% October 2020 $ 12 Commercial mortgage-backed securities loan\nHilton San Francisco Union Square, Parc 55 San Francisco - a Hilton Hotel 4.11% November 2023 725 Commercial mortgage-backed securities loan\nHilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort 4.20% November 2026 1,275 Mortgage loan The Fess Parker Santa Barbara Hotel - a DoubleTree Resort 4.17% December 2026 165 Total Fixed Rate Debt (2) $ 2,177 Variable Rate Debt Revolving credit facility (3)\nUnsecured L + 1.50% December 2021 (4) $ - Term loan Unsecured L + 1.45% December 2021 750 Mortgage loan DoubleTree Hotel Ontario Airport L + 2.25% May 2022 (4) 30 Total Variable Rate Debt $ 780\n(1) The weighted average interest rate of Park’s total debt outstanding is 3.9%.

Total cash and cash equivalents were $379 million as of December 31, 2017, including $15 million of restricted cash.\nCapital Investments\nPark invested $181 million in 2017 on capital improvements at its hotels, including $134 million on improvements made to guest rooms, lobbies and other guest-facing areas. Key projects include:\nHilton San Francisco Union Square : $25 million primarily on rooms and suites renovations; New York Hilton Midtown : $20 million primarily on rooms, suites and meeting space renovations; Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort : $11 million primarily on fitness center expansion and structural renovations; and Hilton Sao Paulo Morumbi : $12 million primarily on guest room and corridor renovations.\nDividends\nPark declared a fourth quarter 2017 cash dividend of $0.55 per share to stockholders of record as of December 29, 2017.

All future dividends are subject to approval by Park’s Board of Directors.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nPark expects the full year 2018 operating results to be as follows:\n(unaudited, dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 Outlook as of March 1, 2018 Metric Low High Comparable RevPAR Growth 0.0 % 2.0 % Net income $ 232 $ 266 Net income attributable to stockholders $ 227 $ 260 Diluted earnings per share (1) $ 1.05 $ 1.20 Adjusted EBITDA $ 705 $ 745 Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin change (80 ) bps 20 bps Adjusted FFO per share - Diluted (1) $ 2.59 $ 2.75\n(1) Per share amounts are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Full year 2018 guidance is based in part on the following assumptions:\nGeneral and administrative expenses are projected to be $44 million, excluding $17 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense and $5 million of transition costs; Fully diluted weighted average shares are expected to be 215.5 million; Due to the transfer of a significant number of rooms at the Hilton Waikoloa Village to Hilton Grand Vacations in 2017, and because the Caribe Hilton is expected to be closed most of the year, the results from these hotels will be excluded from Park’s comparable results in 2018; Includes the anticipated receipt of $26 million of business interruption proceeds for hotels that were affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria; and Excludes potential future acquisitions and dispositions, which could result in a material change to Park’s outlook.\nSupplemental Disclosures\nIn conjunction with this release, Park has furnished a financial supplement with additional disclosures on its website.

For 2016 and 2015, represents costs incurred and accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees on extinguished debt.
