Chaudhary Birender Singh, Union Minister of Steel, Government of India, speaks during an interview with Reuters in New Delhi, India, March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Saumya Khandelwal “Our exports have increased substantially, about 40 percent growth during January to December,” Singh told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday, referring to 2017.

In that case, these kind of disturbances should not take place.” Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump set import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium, to come into force in 15 days, a disputed move that threatens to spiral into a trade war.
