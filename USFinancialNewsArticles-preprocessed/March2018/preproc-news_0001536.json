    "text": "NEWBURYPORT, Mass., March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UFP Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:UFPT), an innovative designer and custom converter of foams, plastics, composites, and natural fiber materials, today reported net income of $9.2 million or $1.26 per diluted common share outstanding for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $8.0 million or $1.10 per diluted common share outstanding for its 2016 fiscal year. Sales for 2017 were $147.8 million compared to 2016 sales of $146.1 million. For its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $2.7 million or $0.37 per diluted common share outstanding, compared to net income of $1.5 million or $0.20 per diluted common share outstand­ing in the same period of 2016. Sales for the fourth quarter 2017 were $37.2 million versus 2016 fourth quarter sales of $36.5 million.\n“I am pleased with our results and our continuing progress in positioning UFP Technologies for long-term profitable growth,” said R. Jeffrey Bailly, chairman & CEO. “Operational improvements at our two largest plants, combined with ongoing cost reduction efforts and a favorable tax rate, helped generate a 14.5% increase in earnings per share. This increase came despite a significant non-recurring material settlement we received in 2016. Operating income, before the material settlement and restructuring costs, rose 10.4%. Sales for the year grew 1.2% as an 8.1% increase in medical sales more than offset a 15% drop in automotive revenue, due in part to the phase-out of our long-running Mercedes-Benz door panel program.”\n“I am also very excited about our February 2018 acquisition of Dielectrics,” Bailly added. “This company checks nearly every box in our profile of an ideal acquisition candidate: an innovative culture similar to our own, a very strong management team, a blue chip medical customer base, a complementary line of highly engineered products that are costly to switch out, and a high-margin book of business that we anticipate will be solidly accretive to earnings. We are working with the Dielectrics team on a seamless integration process and planning to launch several new programs now in the engineering phase.”\n“We expect that this transformative acquisition will increase our value to customers, strengthen our competitive position, and grow both our top and bottom lines,” said Bailly. “We anticipate that Dielectrics will add $0.35 - $0.45 per share to our EPS and will bring our medical book of business to approximately 60% of sales. In addition, we expect that UFP’s cash flow and net income will improve going forward as our effective tax rate decreases to an estimated 25%.”\nUFP Technologies is an innovative designer and custom converter of foams, plastics, and natural fiber materials, principally serving the medical, automotive, consumer, electronics, industrial, and aerospace and defense markets. The UFP team acts as an extension of its customers’ in-house research, engineering, and manufacturing groups, working closely with them to solve their most complex product and packaging challenges.\nThis news release contains statements relating to expected financial performance and/or future business prospects, events and plans that are forward-looking statements.
