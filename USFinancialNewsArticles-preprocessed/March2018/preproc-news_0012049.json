    "text": "DeAndre Jordan collected a game-high 20 rebounds to complement 19 points Friday night, sending the Los Angeles Clippers to a 128-105 blowout win over the New York Knicks in Los Angeles.\nJordan, the NBA’s second-leading rebounder, reached 20 for the ninth time this season, propelling the Clippers to a 51-33 dominance on the boards.\nKnicks center Enes Kanter countered with a double-double of his own, dropping in a team-high 18 points to go with 14 rebounds.\nThe win was the Clippers’ eighth in 11 games since trading Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons in February. Jordan has collected 16 or more rebounds in six of those games.\nJordan’s 19 points were the second-most he has had in a game this season in which he also totaled 20 or more rebounds. He had a 20-point, 22-rebound game at Cleveland in November.\nLed by balanced scoring, the Knicks rallied from an early deficit to take a 60-57 halftime lead.\nBut Tobias Harris opened the third quarter with a game-tying 3-pointer, C.J. Williams slammed home a dunk, Austin Rivers hit a 3-pointer and Harris swished a close-range shot, accounting for all the scoring in a 10-0 Clippers burst that turned the game in their favor for good.\nThe Clippers led by as many as 30 points while evening their record on a six-game homestand at 1-1. They were coming off a 105-92 loss to Houston on Wednesday.\nJordan hit nine of his 11 shots and Montrezl Harrell buried eight of nine en route to 19 points, helping the Clippers connect on 56.2 percent of their shots.\nReserve Lou Williams led Los Angeles with 21 points. Rivers was a third Clipper with 19 points, while Harris finished with 15 and Sam Dekker 10.\nHarris recorded a team-high six assists.\nTim Hardaway Jr. had 17 points and Courtney Lee 15 for the Knicks, who have lost three in a row and 11 of their last 12.\nThe Knicks had beaten the Clippers 107-85 in New York in November.\nTrey Burke had 12 points and Troy Williams 11 for the Knicks, who were opening a four-game trip. Emmanuel Mudiay dished a game-high seven assists to go with nine points.\nThe Knicks lost despite shooting 46.1 percent from the field and connecting on 11 of 25 3-point attempts.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
