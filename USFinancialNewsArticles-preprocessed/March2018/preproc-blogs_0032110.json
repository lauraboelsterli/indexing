    "text": "AVGO -4.81% \n$117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm, reflecting officials’ concerns about an intensifying arms race between the U.S. and China over advanced technologies. \nThe latest round of drama at Qualcomm comes a week after Mr. Jacobs was stripped of the title of executive chairman against his will after some investors complained about his pay and argued that having separate roles of executive chairman and chief executive causes confusion about who is in charge, according to another person. \nMr. Jacobs was replaced with an independent director and the move was widely seen as an effort by Qualcomm to enhance its governance and bolster its case against Singapore-based Broadcom. According to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Jacobs was unhappy about the move. \nAt an annual meeting that was scheduled to occur earlier this month, Qualcomm shareholders were to vote on whether to oust current board members in favor of directors nominated by Broadcom. The meeting was delayed at the behest of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. before the deal was blocked by Mr. Trump. \nIt is now scheduled to take place next Friday and Qualcomm directors are expected to be re-elected unopposed as the Broadcom ballots won’t be tallied. \nHad the vote gone ahead as originally planned, a number of Qualcomm directors were expected to lose their seats, including possibly Mr. Jacobs, people familiar with the matter said. \nMr. Jacobs, the son of Qualcomm’s co-founder, owns just 0.13% of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego and has a market value of about $90 billion. To pull off a takeover of the company, which would cost upward of $100 billion, he would need to secure an inordinate amount of financing, and it isn’t clear where he would get it. \nMr. Jacobs took over as chief executive from his father, Irwin, in 2005, before passing the baton to current CEO \nSteve Mollenkopf \nin 2014. —Ted Greenwald contributed to this article. \nWrite to Dana Cimilluca at [email protected] , David Benoit at [email protected] and Dana Mattioli at [email protected] Appeared in the March 17, 2018, print edition as ‘Qualcomm Director Is Out.’ ADVERTISEMENT",
