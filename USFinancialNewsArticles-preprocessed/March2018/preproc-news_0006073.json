    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 8:32 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago U.S. calls Russia idea of Syria humanitarian corridors 'a joke' Reuters Staff 1 Min Read WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - Russian proposals for humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from Eastern Ghouta in Syria are a “joke” and people are afraid to use them for fear of conscription, exile or death, the U.S. State Department said on Thursday. “The idea that Russia is calling for a so-called humanitarian corridor, I want to be clear, is a joke,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a briefing. Residents fear using such corridors because they could be conscripted into Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, never return to their homes, or be killed, she said.
