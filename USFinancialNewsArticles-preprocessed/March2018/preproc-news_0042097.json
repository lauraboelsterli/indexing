(CSE:ISOL) (OTC:ISOLF) (FSE:LB6A.F) (the “Company” or “Isodiol”) , a global Bioactive CBD innovator specializing in the development of pharmaceutical and wellness products, is pleased to announce that the Company has signed a letter of intent (LOI) to acquire 100% of KURE™ Corp , a leading specialty vape retailer headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, with locations in the United States and annualized unaudited Fiscal 2018 revenue of $8.8m USD. KURE™ specializes in the retailing of vaporizers and e-cigarettes, e-juices, and related accessories ( kurevapes.com , kuresociety.com ).\nKURE™ set out to change the current state of the “vape shop” industry with the introduction of KURE Vaporium & Lounge™, a modern and sophisticated retail environment and lounge catering to the vaping community. By elevating the environment and customer experience, KURE™ has paved a completely new path to the rapidly growing vaping and e-cigarette industry and operates a total of twelve e-juice bars and lounges today, with plans for international expansion.\n“KURE’s™ executives are highly experienced business entrepreneurs that have done a tremendous job in building the KURE™ brand,” said CEO of Isodiol, Marcos Agramont. “Not only does this further entrench our footprint in the vaping and e-cigarette industry, but through KURE™ retail stores, the Company will set up its own distribution channels for its family of brands, including ISO-Sport and Be Tru Wellness .”\n“We believe KURE™ to be the Starbucks of the specialty retail vape industry. The KURE™ brand has been carefully built thanks to our incredibly loyal customer following.

These KURE™ e-Juices are skillfully blended and served while customers shop, lounge and enjoy a selection of coffees, beverages, and snacks or simply vape.\n“When we acquired Bradley’s Bioscience , we were excited about the prospects of providing safer alternatives to smoking, while at the same time being able to enter a market poised to be worth over $60 billion by 2025,” said Agramont. “With this partnership, we will further entrench our footprint in this fast-growing industry, and we look forward to the global opportunities it presents for the Company.”\nOnce finalized, the terms of this agreement will be defined upon the definitive agreement, which is anticipated by the end of April 2018.\nAbout Isodiol International Inc.\nIsodiol International Inc. is the market leader in pharmaceutical grade phytochemical compounds and the industry leader in the manufacturing and development of CBD consumer products.\nIsodiol is the pioneer of many firsts for the cannabis industry including commercialization of 99%+ pure, bioactive pharmaceutical grade cannabinoids, micro-encapsulations, and nanotechnology for the highest quality consumable and topical skin care products.\nIsodiol’s growth strategy includes the development of over-the-counter and pharmaceutical drugs, expanding its phytoceutical portfolio and will aggressively continue international expansion into Latin America, Asia and Europe.\nAbout KURE™ Corp\nKURE™ Corp.
