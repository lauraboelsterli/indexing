    "text": "NEW ORLEANS, March 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”) and KSF partner, former Attorney General of Louisiana, Charles C. Foti, Jr., remind investors that they have until May 4, 2018 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:AFH), if they purchased the Company’s securities between March 13, 2017, and March 2, 2018, inclusive (the “Class Period”). This action is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\nWhat You May Do\nIf you purchased securities of Atlas and would like to discuss your legal rights and how this case might affect you and your right to recover for your economic loss, you may, without obligation or cost to you, contact KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or via email ( lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com ), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqgm-afh/ to learn more. If you wish to serve as a lead plaintiff in this class action, you must petition the Court by May 4, 2018 .\nAbout the Lawsuit\nAtlas and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.\nOn March 1, 2018, the Company disclosed that, following “a comprehensive review of its reserves” it was substantially increasing its overall reserves “based on year-end actuarial work coupled with a detailed internal file audit for claims with reserves not established by the Company’s predictive analytics tools….”\nOn this news, the price of Atlas’ shares plummeted $7.70 per share, over 40%, to close at $11.10 per share on March 2, 2018, on unusually heavy trading volume.\nAbout Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC\nKSF, whose partners include the former Louisiana Attorney General Charles C.
