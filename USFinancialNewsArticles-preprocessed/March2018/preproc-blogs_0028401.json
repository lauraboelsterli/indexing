Barack Obama, former U.S. president \nObama chimed in on Twitter with a simple message and photo of the late physicist at the White House. \"Have fun out there among the stars,\" he wrote. PRESIDENT OBAMA TWEET 6. NASA \nThe aerospace research agency paid tribute to Hawking with a touching video showing the late scientist without his wheelchair floating in zero gravity during a 2007 demonstration. \n\"Remembering Stephen Hawking, a renowned physicist and ambassador of science,\" NASA tweeted. \"His theories unlocked a universe of possibilities that we & the world are exploring. \" NASA TWEET 7. The cast of 'Big Bang Theory' \nCast members of the award-winning sitcom, which features four physicists, shared their individual memories with Hawking who was often featured on the show. \nThe official \"Big Bang Theory\" Twitter page released a photo of Hawking with the cast. \"Thank you for inspiring us and the world,\" said the tweet. BIG BANG THEORY TWEET 8. Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder \nGates reminisced about his shared past with Hawking, who he met on a visit to Cambridge University in 1997 . \n\"I feel lucky to have known Stephen Hawking. His work is an inspiring reminder of what human minds are capable of,\" Gates tweeted. BILL GATES TWEET 9. Richard Branson, Virgin Group founder \nThe billionaire sent a series of tweets expressing his sadness and shared memories with Hawking. In 2015, Branson offered the physicist a free ticket, which goes for $250,000 , aboard his Virgin Galactic spaceflight. Last year, Hawking told Good Morning Britain that he never dreamed he'd be able to go to space and had immediately accepted Branson's offer. \nBranson explained his reasoning behind the offer on his Virgin blog : \"Professor Stephen Hawking is one of the people I admire most in the world,\" he wrote at the time. \"He is the only person I have given a free ticket with Virgin Galactic, and he is signed up to fly as a Future Astronaut with us if his health permits it.\" \nIn October of last year, Branson told CNBC's Squawk Box that he expects to be in space by April of this year . Unfortunately, the late physicist will miss seeing this dream come to pass. \n\"Proud Stephen Hawking was a member of our @virgingalactic family,\" Branson wrote on his Twitter. \"Sorry we didn't get him to space, but honoured he played such a meaningful role in our development.\"",
