    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 11:01 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Cricket-Findings of Cricket Australia ball-tampering investigation Reuters Staff 5 Min Read \nJOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Reuters) - Following are the findings of the Cricket Australia investigation into the ball-tampering scandal as released in a statement on Wednesday: \nThe key finding from the investigation was that prior knowledge of the incident was confined to three players, Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft. KEY FINDINGS: \nSteve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft have been charged with a breach of Article 2.3.5 of the CA Code of Conduct, namely that their conduct: \n(a) was contrary to the spirit of the game; \n(b) was unbecoming of a representative or official; \n(c) is or could be harmful to the interests of cricket; and/or (d) did bring the game of cricket into disrepute. \nIn respect of the individual players concerned, Cricket Australia advises the following: \nSteve Smith was charged with a breach of Article 2.3.5 of the CA Code of Conduct based on: \n(a) knowledge of a potential plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball; \n(b) failure to take steps to seek to prevent the development and implementation of that plan; \n(c) directing that evidence of attempted tampering be concealed on the field of play; \n(d) seeking to mislead Match Officials and others regarding Bancroft’s attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball; and \n(e) misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent and participants of the plan \nDavid Warner was charged with a breach of Article 2.3.5 of the CA Code of Conduct based on: \n(a) development of a plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball; \n(b) instruction to a junior player to carry out a plan to take steps to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball using sandpaper; \n(c) provision of advice to a junior player regarding how a ball could be artificially altered including demonstrating how it could be done; \n(d) failure to take steps to seek to prevent the development and/or implementation of the plan; \n(e) failure to report his knowledge of the plan at any time prior to or during the match; \n(f) misleading Match Officials through the concealment of his knowledge of and involvement in the plan; and \n(g) failure to voluntarily report his knowledge of the plan after the match \nCameron Bancroft was charged with a breach of Article 2.3.5 of the CA Code of Conduct based on: \n(a) knowledge of the existence of, and being party to, the plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball using sandpaper; \n(b) carrying out instructions to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball; \n(c) seeking to conceal evidence of his attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball; \n(d) seeking to mislead Match Officials and others regarding his attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball; and \n(e) misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent, implementation and participants of the plan SUMMARY OF SANCTIONS \nThe range of sanctions available to Cricket Australia under Article 2.3.5 are extensive. The CA Board determined sanctions that would be appropriate in each player’s case, following their review of the report. \nThe Board has considered the recommendations and determined that the following sanctions will be offered to each player in accordance with the CA Code of Conduct process: \nSteve Smith Suspension of 12 months from all international and domestic cricket \nDavid Warner Suspension of 12 months from all international and domestic cricket \nCameron Bancroft Suspension of 9 months from all international and domestic cricket \nAll three players will be permitted to play club cricket and will be encouraged to do so to maintain links with the cricket community. \nIn addition, all three players will be required to undertake 100 hours of voluntary service in community cricket. LEADERSHIP \nSteve Smith and Cameron Bancroft will not be considered for team leadership positions until a minimum of 12 months after the conclusion of their respective suspensions from international and domestic cricket. \nAny consideration of future leadership would be conditional on acceptance by fans and the public, form and authority among the playing group. \nDavid Warner will not be considered for team leadership positions in the future.
