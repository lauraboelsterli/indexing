    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Monday there remained“much work to do” with Iran over its ballistic missile programme and its role in regional conflicts.\nLe Drian said after a day of tough talks in Tehran that France would continue discussions with Iran, adding that it was imperative to find a way to bring stability to region.\nLe Drian was in Tehran on a delicate mission to reaffirm Europe’s support for a nuclear deal that opened Iran’s economy while echoing U.S. concern about Tehran’s missile programme and role in regional conflicts.\nReporting by John Irish; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
