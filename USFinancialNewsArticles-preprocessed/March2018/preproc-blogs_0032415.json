    "text": "United States: Mexico’s Cemex faces another U.S. probe, shares drop March 15th, 2018 Americas \nMexico’s Cemex said on Wednesday the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had asked it for information on its operations in Colombia and in other jurisdictions for a probe of the company, and its shares slid more than 2.3 percent in early trading. \nCemex said it had received information requirements from the DOJ. In December, the company said the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) asked it for information to determine whether it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the construction of a new plant in Colombia. \nThe company said it would cooperate with both the DOJ and the SEC investigations. \nThe full original article can be found at uk.reuters.com",
