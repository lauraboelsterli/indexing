    "text": "(Corrects to say Bahrain did mention two incidents took place, not just one, in 6th paragraph)\nDUBAI, March 26 (Reuters) - Two Qatari fighter jets flew dangerously close to two civilian aircraft from the United Arab Emirates while they were in Bahraini airspace on Monday, the UAE’s state news agency WAM Quote: d its civil aviation authority as saying.\nWAM said the General Civil Aviation Authority had condemned the “provocative action,” which it said followed two similar incidents that had been reported by the UAE to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations’ aviation agency.\nThe UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, imposed travel, diplomatic and trade sanctions on Qatar last June, accusing it of supporting regional foe Iran as well as Islamist extremists. Qatar has denied the charge and accused the four countries of trying to make it conform to their foreign policy positions.\nQatar in June 2017 asked the ICAO to intervene after its Gulf neighbors closed their airspace to Qatar flights as part of the sanctions.\nBahrain’s civil aviation authority confirmed the incident took place, saying two Qatari fighter jets flew under a UAE Airbus A320 en route from the emirate of Fujairah to Rome, forcing the UAE aircraft to fly at a higher altitude.\nBahrain said this was the second incident to take place on the same day.\nThe airline involved was not specified.\nThe Bahraini agency said in a statement carried by state news agency BNA that the Qatari jets entered airspace managed by Bahrain without prior authorisation, and that the necessary measures had been taken to file a complaint with the ICAO.\nQatari officials were not immediately available to comment.\nWhile the UAE has banned Qatari aircraft from using its airspace as part of the restrictions, Qatar has not reciprocated.
