    "text": "(Reuters) - British bookmaker William Hill Plc ( WMH.L ) said on Tuesday it agreed to sell its Australia business to a unit of CrownBet for an equity value of A$313.7 million ($243.6 million) as a ban on credit betting pressured its profit in that country.\nThe deal represents an enterprise value of A$300 million, the company said.\nThe Australian business, which operates licensed betting, over the telephone, internet and mobile phone platforms, has about 284,000 customers. It made up 7 percent of William Hill’s total revenue and nearly 6 percent of adjusted operating profit in 2017.\nThe company said in January it was reviewing options for the Australia business after the unit’s profits came under pressure following a ban on credit betting and the likely introduction of a point of consumption tax in some states.\nHowever, the retreat from Australia could raise further questions about the future of William Hill, which has missed out on a round of consolidation in its home British market.\nThe company said in November it was in “very preliminary discussions” with CrownBet, which is partly owned by Canada’s Stars Group Inc ( TSGI.TO ), about a possible combination with its Australian business.\nProceeds from the sale will be partly used to pay down debt, William Hill said.\nReporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ",
