    "text": "(Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb’s firm Third Point LLC wants to build a stake in United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ), according to a filing with the Federal Trade Commission, as the U.S. aero parts maker explores a breakup of its businesses.\nHedge fund manager Daniel Loeb speaks during a Reuters Newsmaker event in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 21, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Loeb’s Third Point Offshore Fund Ltd has requested permission from the U.S. consumer protection regulator to acquire shares in the company above a certain threshold, according to the filing dated March 23 on the FTC’s website.\nUnited Tech declined to comment and Third Point was not immediately available for comment.\nUnited Technologies logo is displayed on a screen at the post where it's stock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 5, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid United Tech, which makes Otis Elevators, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and Carrier air conditioners, in February said it would decide by the end of 2018 whether its businesses were more valuable together or better off as separate entities.\nThe company’s shares have lagged the broader market under Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes as the company spent heavily on developing a new fuel-saving geared turbofan aircraft engine and as sales of Otis elevators were pressured by a supply glut in China.\nBillionaire investor William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management is also building a position in United Tech, according to reports in February.\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\nOur ",
