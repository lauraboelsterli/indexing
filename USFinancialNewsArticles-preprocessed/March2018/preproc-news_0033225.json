    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Orla Mining Ltd. (TSX-V:OLA) (the “ Compan y” or “ Orla ”) is pleased to announce that Mr. Etienne Morin will be joining the executive team at Orla as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Paul Robertson will step down as Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Morin will assume the role effective April 30, 2018. Following Mr. Morin’s appointment, Mr. Robertson will remain active with the Company in an advisory role.\nMarc Prefontaine, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented: “On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to welcome Etienne to the Orla team. Etienne has extensive industry experience and market understanding, which will help guide the Company through the next phase of its development, and I look forward to working with him to execute on the Company’s strategic initiatives. I would like to thank Paul Robertson for his dedication to this role since 2015, including his oversight of two significant acquisitions for Orla.”\nMr. Morin joins Orla from Goldcorp Inc. where he spent the last 11 years in various finance and operations roles, as well as acquiring significant capital markets experience in his roles as Director of Corporate Development and more recently heading the investor relations function. Mr. Morin holds a Bachelor of Arts in geology from Colgate University and a MBA from the Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa.\nAbout Orla Mining Ltd.\nOrla Mining owns two advanced stage open pit, heap leach style oxide gold projects in Panama and Mexico. Camino Rojo is an advanced gold and silver project covering over 200,000 hectares in Zacatecas State, Central Mexico. The project is 100% owned and has historical oxide reserves along with historical sulphide resources (which Goldcorp Inc. retains a back-in right on the sulphides). The Company believes it has exploration potential for additional oxide and sulphide mineral resources. Access and infrastructure are excellent with a paved highway and powerline nearby. A NI 43-101 Technical Report dated January 24, 2018, on Camino Rojo is available on SEDAR. The 100% owned Cerro Quema project in Panama includes a near-term gold production scenario and exploration upside. Cerro Quema’s 14,800 Ha concession boasts paved road access, a supportive local population and private land ownership. The Cerro Quema project is currently in the last stage of the permitting process for a proposed open pit mine and gold heap leach operation. Please refer to the Cerro Quema Project - Pre-feasibility Study on the La Pava and Quemita Oxide Gold Deposits dated August 22, 2014, which is available on SEDAR.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis news release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Canadian and United States securities legislation, including, without limitation, statements with respect to the expected timing for appointment of the Chief Financial Officer, the results of exploration and planned exploration programs, the potential for discovery of additional mineral resources and the Company’s objectives and strategies. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts which address events, results, outcomes or developments that the Company expects to occur. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs, estimates and opinions of the Company’s management on the date the statements are made and they involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Certain material assumptions regarding such forward-looking statements are discussed in this news release, including without limitation, assumptions that the Company’s activities will be in accordance with the Company’s public statements and stated goals; that there will be no material adverse change affecting the Company or its properties; that all required approvals will be obtained and that there will be no significant disruptions affecting the Company or its properties. Consequently, there can be no assurances that such statements will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
