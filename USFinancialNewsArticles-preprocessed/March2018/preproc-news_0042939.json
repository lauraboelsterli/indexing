    "text": "March 26, 2018 / 10:06 AM / Updated an hour ago SoftBank mulls $1 bln investment in Chinese logistics firm Manbang - WSJ Reuters Staff 2 Min Read March 26 (Reuters) - Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp is looking to invest $1 billion in Chinese delivery firm Manbang Group, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. SoftBank's possible investment, through its $98 billion Vision Fund, would be part of a fundraising effort by Manbang, which is looking to raise between $500 million and $1 billion in fresh funds to help it expand in China's growing logistics market, the Journal said here . The amount and the participating investors have not been set for the fundraising, the report said. Manbang, backed by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd and a private-equity firm co-founded by billionaire Jack Ma, would be valued at $5 billion if it raises $500 million, WSJ said. SoftBank and Manbang were not immediately available for comment. SoftBank has been aggressively investing in technology companies worldwide - notably through its London-based Vision Fund - including U.S. ride hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc .
