    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Investcorp, a leading global provider and manager of alternative investment products, today announced an investment in ICR (or “the Company”), a leading strategic communications and advisory firm. Investcorp is partnering with ICR, whose senior team will retain a significant ownership stake in the Company.

That said, this environment has created new opportunities for ICR to expand its services and reach as well as elevate the standards of client engagement. We are thrilled to partner with Investcorp on these efforts, which in turn, will help us better serve our clients and the dynamic challenges they face each day.”\nWilliam Blair & Company served as the exclusive financial advisor to ICR and its stockholders.\nAbout Investcorp\nInvestcorp is a leading global provider and manager of alternative investments, offering such investments to its high-net-worth private and institutional clients on a global basis.
