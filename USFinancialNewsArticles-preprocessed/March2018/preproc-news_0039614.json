    "text": "NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Five Star Senior Living Inc. (Nasdaq: FVE) today announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017:\nSenior living revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 0.6% to $279.2 million from $281.0 million for the same period in 2016, primarily due to an estimated $0.9 million revenue reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the previously disclosed 2017 Medicare compliance assessment, or the 2017 Compliance Assessment, at one of Five Star's skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, and a decrease in occupancy, partially offset by an increase in average monthly rates to residents who pay privately for services. Management fee revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 4.5% to $3.5 million from $3.4 million for the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of managed communities compared to the same period in 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.0 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $5.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a gain on sale of senior living communities of $7.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in connection with the sale of two senior living communities in December 2017 pursuant to a transaction agreement Five Star entered with Senior Housing Properties Trust (Nasdaq: SNH), or the 2017 Transaction Agreement. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 also included a benefit from income taxes of $3.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, resulting primarily from Five Star’s monetization of alternative minimum tax credits, $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for estimated revenue reserve, penalties and fees related to the 2017 Compliance Assessment, and $1.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to long lived asset impairment Five Star recorded to reduce the carrying value of one senior living community classified as held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 included a benefit from income taxes of $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, related to a reduction of previously accrued estimated state tax expense. Earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.8 million compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2016. EBITDA excluding certain items noted in the supplemental information provided below, or Adjusted EBITDA, was $2.1 million and $3.5 million for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. A reconciliation of loss from continuing operations determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 appears later in this press release.\nOperating Results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017:\nOccupancy at owned and leased senior living communities for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 82.6% compared to 83.9% for the same period in 2016. The average monthly rate at owned and leased senior living communities for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 0.3% to $4,653 from $4,639 for the same period in 2016. The percentage of revenue derived from residents’ private resources at owned and leased senior living communities for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 77.7% compared to 77.6% for the same period in 2016.\nFinancial Results for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nSenior living revenue of $1.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 had a slight decrease of 0.1% from 2016. This slight decrease in senior living revenue is primarily a result of an estimated $0.9 million revenue reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the 2017 Compliance Assessment, a decrease in occupancy and a $1.0 million reversal of revenue reserves during 2016 as a result of the final settlement amount in 2016 of the previously disclosed 2014 Medicare compliance assessment, or the 2014 Compliance Assessment, at one of Five Star's SNFs, partially offset by an increase for 2017 in average monthly rates to residents who pay privately for services. Management fee revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 14.0% to $14.1 million from $12.4 million for 2016. The increase in management fee revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of managed communities during 2017 compared to 2016 and the modifications to the calculations of management fees under Five Star's management arrangements with SNH that became effective on July 1, 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $20.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $21.8 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain on sale of senior living communities of $7.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in connection with the sale of two senior living communities in December 2017 pursuant to the 2017 Transaction Agreement, a benefit from income taxes of $4.5 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, resulting primarily from Five Star’s monetization of alternative minimum tax credits, $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for estimated revenue reserve, penalties and fees related to the 2017 Compliance Assessment, and $2.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, primarily related to long lived asset impairment Five Star recorded to reduce the carrying value of one senior living community classified as held for sale to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, reversal of revenue reserves and accrued liability for estimated penalties related to the 2014 Compliance Assessment and a provision for income taxes of $2.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, resulting primarily from state tax expense. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $16.3 million compared to $22.3 million for 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.1 million and $22.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A reconciliation of loss from continuing operations determined in accordance with GAAP to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 appears later in this press release.\nOther:\nAs previously disclosed, in November 2017, Five Star agreed to sell six senior living communities to SNH pursuant to the 2017 Transaction Agreement for an aggregate sales price of $104.4 million, including $2.4 million of mortgage debt principal that Five Star prepaid in December 2017 in connection with the sale of one of these communities and SNH's assumption of approximately $33.5 million of mortgage debt principal secured by certain of these senior living communities as of December 31, 2017, and excluding closing costs. In December 2017, Five Star sold two of these communities for an aggregate sales price of approximately $39.2 million, excluding closing costs. In January 2018, Five Star sold one of these communities for approximately $19.7 million, excluding closing costs. In February 2018, Five Star sold one of these communities for approximately $22.2 million, including SNH’s assumption of approximately $16.8 million of mortgage debt principal and excluding closing costs. In connection with these sales, Five Star entered management and pooling agreements with SNH to manage these senior living communities, and Five Star expects to enter additional management and pooling agreements with SNH concurrent with the sales of the remaining two communities. The closings of the sales of the remaining two communities for an aggregate sales price of approximately $23.3 million, including SNH’s assumption of approximately $16.7 million of mortgage debt principal, are expected to occur as third party approvals are received by the end of the first half of 2018.\nConference Call:\nOn Wednesday, March 21, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bruce Mackey, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Richard Doyle, and Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Scott Herzig, will host a conference call to discuss Five Star's fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nThe conference call telephone number is (877) 329-4332.

measures are financial measures that are not determined in accordance with GAAP. Five Star believes the non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table below are meaningful supplemental disclosures because they may help investors gain a better understanding of changes in Five Star’s operating results and its ability to pay rent or service debt, make capital expenditures and expand its business. These non-GAAP financial measures also may help investors make comparisons between Five Star and other companies on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Five Star believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful financial measures that may help investors better understand its financial performance, including by allowing investors to compare Five Star’s performance between periods and to the performance of other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used by management to evaluate Five Star’s financial performance and compare Five Star’s performance over time and to the performance of other companies. Five Star calculates EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as shown below. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to income (loss) from continuing operations or net income (loss), as indicators of Five Star’s operating performance or as measures of Five Star’s liquidity. Also, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts calculated by other companies.\nFive Star believes that income (loss) from continuing operations is the most directly comparable financial measure, determined according to GAAP, to Five Star’s presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. The following table presents the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to loss from continuing operations for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nFor the three months ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the year\nended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Loss from continuing operations $ (1,006 ) $ (5,952 ) $ (20,902 ) $ (22,007 ) Add: interest and other expense 1,108 955 4,308 4,912 Add: (benefit from) provision for income taxes (1) (3,206 ) (490 ) (4,536 ) 2,351 Add: depreciation and amortization expense 9,152 9,205 38,192 38,052 Less: interest, dividend and other income (206 ) (218 ) (765 ) (984 ) EBITDA 5,842 3,500 16,297 22,324 Add (less): Long lived asset impairments 1,584 — 2,112 502 Costs related to compliance assessments 1,546 (2) — 1,546 (2) (1,498 ) (3) Litigation recovery — — (800 ) — Employee litigation matter 345 — 345 — Gain on sale of senior living communities (7,258 ) — (7,258 ) — Transaction costs — — — 1,480 Gain on early extinguishment of debt — — (143 ) — Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,059 $ 3,500 $ 12,099 $ 22,808 (1) 2017 data includes Five Star's monetization of alternative minimum tax credits.

(2) The number of owned and leased communities between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 decreased by one due to the sale in September 2016 of one leased community that was not classified as held for sale and the sale of two senior living communities to SNH in December 2017 pursuant to the 2017 Transaction Agreement, partially offset by the leasing of two additional senior living communities from SNH in December 2016; separate comparable senior living community financial data is not presented because the differences between that data and the data for all owned and leased communities is not material to Five Star’s operating results. (3) Data presents the seven communities that were sold to SNH in June 2016 pursuant to a sale and leaseback transaction as leased for all periods presented. (4) Skilled nursing facility revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 includes an estimated $0.9 million revenue reserve related to the 2017 Compliance Assessment. Skilled nursing facility revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a $1.0 million reversal of revenue reserves related to the 2014 Compliance Assessment. (5) Insurance and other expenses primarily relate to Five Star's captive insurance company subsidiary, which mainly participates in Five Star's workers' compensation and professional and general liability insurance programs.
