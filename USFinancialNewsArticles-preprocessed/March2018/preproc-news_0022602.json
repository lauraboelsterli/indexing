    "text": "TORONTO, March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Real Estate Council of Ontario-RECO has announced its 2018 Board of Directors Election race for its registered members. The Council’s mandate is to peruse the Administrative Agreement contracted between RECO and the Ministry of Public Service and Consumer Service. There are 12 directors set on board; the ministry appointed six of them while real estate members elected the remaining. RECO has over 80 thousand practicing members in all of the province of Ontario. RECO is considered the regulatory body of the real estate industry in Ontario.\nAli Salarian, Candidate photo for Region-1 Board of Directors 2018 Election-RECO\nRECO 2018 Board of Directors Election, Region-1\nAli Salarian, Real Estate Broker and Vice President of PPS Realty Brokerage, is one of the thirteen candidates competing for region-1 of central Ontario, while region-3 of eastern and northern Ontario has three candidates, and only two candidates to compete in region-2 eastern and northern Ontario. Voting is restricted to members only and it would be carried out through an online electronic voting system which would be open from Mar. 12 till Mar. 26, 2018.\nAli Salarian believes this year’s election is crucial due to the recent public and media criticisms of the real estate industry in Ontario, as a result of its very active and busy market during the last few years. Ali Salarian carries under his belt a rich experience in corporate and investment banking as well as his management experience in boutique real estate brokerage in northern Toronto.\nLast year, election voter turnout was close to 20%. This year, he wishes to achieve over 50% in order to support RECO’s mandates to modernize Real Estate Business and Brokers REBBA, Act 2002. This Act intends to protect consumers who are engaged in real estate transaction in Ontario and also regulate real estate professionals.\nThe Real Estate Council of Ontario is responsible for regulating real estate professionals in the province on behalf of the Ontario government. They protect the public interest through a fair, safe and informed marketplace.\nAli Salarian\nali@ppsrealty.ca\n905-209-7400 ext: 102\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/39b48905-3b60-434f-86e3-e3c4789f8219\nSource: PPS REALTY",
