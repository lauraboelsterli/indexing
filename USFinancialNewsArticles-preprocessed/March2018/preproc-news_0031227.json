    "text": "VANCOUVER, March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - American Hotel Income Properties REIT LP (\"AHIP\") (TSX: HOT.UN, HOT.U, and HOT.DB.U) announced today a cash distribution of US$0.054 per limited partnership unit (\"Unit\") for the period of March 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018, which is equivalent to US$0.648 per Unit on an annualized basis. The distribution will be paid on April 13, 2018 to unitholders of record at the close of business on March 29, 2018.\n\"We have no intention of changing our distribution based on our ongoing performance and expectations, and understand the importance of this cash return to our valued income-biased investor base,\" said Rob O'Neill, CEO, AHIP. \"Like all hotel companies, our business has seasonality and therefore should be reviewed and evaluated on an annual basis, which we believe is an important consideration for long-term oriented investors.\"\nThe policy of AHIP is to pay cash distributions on or about the 15th day of each month to the unitholders of record on the last business day of the preceding month.\nABOUT AMERICAN HOTEL INCOME PROPERTIES REIT LP\nAmerican Hotel Income Properties REIT LP (TSX: HOT.UN; HOT.U and HOT.DB.U), or AHIP, is a limited partnership formed to invest in hotel real estate properties located substantially in the United States. AHIP currently has 115 hotels, and is actively engaged in growing its portfolio of premium branded, select-service hotels in larger secondary markets that have diverse and stable demand. AHIP hotels operate under brands affiliated with Marriott, Hilton, IHG, Wyndham and Choice Hotels through license agreements. The company's long-term objectives are to build on its proven track record of successful investment, deliver reliable and consistent U.S. dollar denominated distributions to unitholders, and generate value through the continued growth of its diversified hotel portfolio.
