    "text": "OTTAWA, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)(TSX:SHOP), the leading cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform, today announced the appointment of Amy Shapero as Chief Financial Officer, effective April 2, 2018.\nShapero joins Shopify from Betterment, an online wealth-management service, where she has served as Chief Financial Officer since 2016. Previously, Shapero was Chief Financial Officer at Sailthru, a SaaS marketing technology provider, and Senior Vice President of Strategy, Corporate Development and Corporate Communications at DigitalGlobe, a big data and analytics provider. Prior to that, she held Chief Financial Officer roles at Spot Holdings, a financial services company, and Standard & Poor’s, a business unit of The McGraw-Hill Companies.\nShapero began her career as a CPA at Ernst & Young, followed by positions at Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs. She holds a Bachelor of Science from the University of Illinois and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\"We’re excited to welcome Amy to Shopify as our new CFO,\" said Shopify CEO, Tobi Lütke. \"Amy brings extensive financial, operational, and strategic experience. This, combined with her deep knowledge of the technology industry and experience scaling high-growth companies, will be a huge asset to Shopify as we enter our next phase of growth and further our mission to make commerce better for everyone.”\nShapero will succeed Russ Jones, who has served as Shopify’s Chief Financial Officer since 2011. Jones will remain a strategic advisor to the company during a transition period.\n“Russ was Shopify’s first CFO, and now he’s our first official retiree. He leaves behind an incredible legacy at Shopify, which includes taking us public. In the last seven years, Russ has been instrumental in growing Shopify from a 50 person company to a leading public SaaS company with over 3,000 employees. We’re very grateful to Russ for his valuable contributions and wish him all the best as he begins his well-deserved retirement,\" said Lütke.\nShopify is also pleased to announce the recent addition of Jeff Weiser as Chief Marketing Officer.
