    "text": "Evan Fournier hit the tiebreaking 3-pointer with 22 seconds remaining as the Orlando Magic posted a 107-100 victory Saturday over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies, whose losing streak reached 13 games.\nFournier missed his first five attempts from outside before getting a screen from Nikola Vucevic and shooting the 3-pointer when Memphis rookie Dillon Brooks left too much space. The shot snapped a 100-all tie and gave Fournier a 3-pointer in his 22nd straight game.\nThe Grizzlies missed a chance to tie when rookie Jonathan Isaac used his left hand to block a 3-pointer by Jarell Martin with seconds remaining after falling for the pump fake. Fournier hit two free throws with eight seconds left and D.J. Augustin hit two foul one second later after the Grizzlies were called for a five-second violation on an inbounds play.\nFournier and Vucevic scored 19 points apiece for Orlando, which won for the second straight night at home after snapping a seven-game losing streak Friday. Augustin and Mario Hezonja added 16 apiece while Aaron Gordon contributed 14 in a game that featured 22 ties and 14 lead changes.\nBen McLemore scored 20 points for the Grizzlies. Martin added 19 as Memphis remained winless since Jan. 29. The Grizzlies shot 40.9 percent.\nMario Chalmers contributed 15 and Kobi Simmons added 14 as Memphis was outscored 30-21 in the fourth quarter.\nThe Grizzlies rested Marc Gasol for the second time during this streak and JaMychal Green scored 10 points as the starting center.\nThe Grizzlies took a 79-77 lead into the fourth after Simmons hit a floater with 43 seconds remaining. Orlando squandered two chances to get a lead as Hezonja missed a 3-pointer and Mack was called for an offensive foul.\nMemphis held a 92-86 lead on a basket by Green with 4:50 remaining but the Magic scored the next seven points to get a 93-92 lead on a drive by Gordon with 3:17 left. The game was tied four more times before Fournier’s clutch 3-pointer.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
