    "text": "3 COMMENTS Among Facebook Inc.’s FB 0.49% growing list of new problems is a decidedly unfamiliar one—its market value has been stuck in reverse.\nA deluge of damaging headlines has shaved about 10% or $50 billion off Facebook’s market value over the last two days. That drop takes Facebook out of the upper-echelon of Big Tech giants and puts it just below a company with a practically vintage web presence, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A 0.70% conglomerate.\nBut the trend isn’t necessarily that new; Facebook’s share price has lagged behind its tech peers and the overall market for the last six months as investors grow increasingly concerned about the possibility of regulators and lawmakers stepping in to check the company’s enormous influence on public discourse.\nBragging rights aside, a weakened stock poses a unique challenge at a difficult time for the company. Facebook, which added more than 8,000 full-time workers to its rolls last year, competes intensely for talent against both its large Silicon Valley peers and well-funded startups that can dangle the prospects of a big IPO payoff. Until recently, the company could offer the best of both worlds; the stability of a giant corporation along with a red-hot stock. Facebook’s share price has averaged 46% growth annually over the last five years. Google, now known as Alphabet Inc., has averaged a mere 27% over that time.\nAnd talent is precisely what Facebook needs right now—perhaps more than ever. Among the damaging news this week are reports that its chief security officer is planning to leave the company after clashing with other executives. A few other former Facebook executives have publicly expressed regrets about their roles in building up the social network’s money machine. Facebook’s tarnished image won’t do wonders for its recruiting efforts. A bum stock won’t help either.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",
