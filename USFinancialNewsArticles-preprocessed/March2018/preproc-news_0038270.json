    "text": "LYNNWOOD, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pacific Crest Savings Bank is pleased to announce that it has appointed Dave Griffith to its board of directors. Griffith joins Pacific Crest’s governance board after serving as a long-time industry ally to the Lynnwood-based community bank.\nOver his 30-year career, Griffith developed expertise in risk management, mortgage banking, sales, trading and insurance at several key financial institutions. He most recently served as chief market risk officer for SunTrust Mortgage before retiring late last year.\n“It’s a privilege to welcome Dave to our board,” said Sheryl Nilson, president and CEO of Pacific Crest Savings Bank. “I have respected, trusted and appreciated Dave’s counsel for many years and know that his deep expertise in risk management and banking will be a great asset to our organization and the clients we serve.”\nGriffith earned a law degree from Seattle University and built his career working for Wall Street firms specializing in risk management for financial institutions. He joined Washington Mutual in 2002 where he worked as a senior risk manager in the Capital Market unit before joining SunTrust Mortgage in a similar capacity in 2008.\n“I’m looking forward to joining Pacific Crest’s board to help support the bank’s specialized focus on real estate lending,” Griffith said. “They’ve developed a cooperative culture based on the integrity of a lot of long-tenured employees who are dedicated to meeting their clients’ needs. I really respect that approach and hope to apply my risk management background to provide an outside perspective to help further the bank’s growth.”\nIn addition to his role on the Pacific Crest board, Griffith continues to consult on risk management issues for mortgage-industry organizations across the U.S.\nPacific Crest Savings Bank was also recognized by the Puget Sound Business Journal as one of the top 25 small businesses in its Corporate Philanthropy List in 2017.
