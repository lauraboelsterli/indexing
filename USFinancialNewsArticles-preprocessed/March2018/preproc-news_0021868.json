    "text": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will sell state-owned weapons maker IMI Systems to Elbit Systems ( ESLT.TA ) for 1.8 billion shekels ($523 million), the Finance Ministry said on Sunday.\nFILE PHOTO: Logo of Israeli defence electronics firm Elbit Systems is seen at their offices in Haifa, Israel February 26, 2017. REUTERS/Baz Ratner/File Photo A deal would likely see Elbit top Israel Aerospace Industries as the country’s biggest defense contractor.\nElbit was the last remaining bidder among five which had shown interest in IMI, a manufacturer of military systems best known as a maker of the Uzi submachine gun, the ministry said.\nElbit shares were up 5.8 percent in Tel Aviv.\nThe government announced its intention to privatize IMI in 2013.\nThe ministry said negotiations had taken “a number of months” and that Elbit might pay an additional 100 million shekels depending on IMI’s results.\nIMI Systems reported 2016 sales of $628 million, mostly in Israel.\nThe acquisition will require approval from Israel’s antitrust authority.\nElbit declined to comment.\nReporting by Ari Rabinovitch and Steven Scheer, Editing by Tova Cohen\n ",
