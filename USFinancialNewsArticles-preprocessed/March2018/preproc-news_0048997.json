(Photo: Business Wire)\nCampbell, who has more than 25 years of developed financial expertise, will be responsible for managing DuChâteau’s financial resources and leading its strategic investments as part of the organization’s growth initiatives. His expertise includes cross-functional leadership, strategic planning and execution, contract review and negotiation, and planning and managing growth with improved profitability.\nCampbell is based at the company’s headquarters in San Diego and reports to Misael Tagle, CEO, and Benjamin Buzali, president.\n“Scott has extensive experience in working with successful privately held companies and has the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit that DuChâteau looks for in its leaders,” Tagle said. “He has helped growing companies invest strategically and increase their productivity, sales and profitability. We are pleased to have someone with Scott’s experience join us at this important juncture as we continue to expand into new markets as a lifestyle brand and design leader.”\nCampbell previously served as CFO of Road Runner Sports, a leading provider of running and walking gear with 36 stores in 11 states nationwide. He held the position from 1997-2003 and again from 2008 until leaving to join DuChâteau. Campbell was instrumental in helping Road Runner Sports achieve its strategic growth objectives, including its further expansion in retail. During his second stint with the company, Road Runner tripled its number of retail locations in the U.S.\nCampbell was also corporate controller at Patagonia, an innovative, global company specializing in the manufacture and multi-channel distribution of premium outdoor clothing, outdoor gear, footwear and luggage. He began his career in public accounting with Ernst & Young and earned his MBA from UCLA’s Anderson School of Management.\n“I was attracted to DuChâteau because it presented an opportunity to work with a growing, entrepreneurial, innovative company that is setting the standard in its industry,” Campbell said. “DuChâteau has an outstanding team in place and solid plans for future growth. The organization is well-positioned to continue the momentum it has built over the past 10 years and I am looking forward to being part of its continued expansion and increased market share.”\nThe first regional flooring company to distribute its products nationwide with its own direct sales force, DuChâteau has implemented strategic growth plans the past two years to introduce new flooring and wall covering product lines and expand into new markets in the Midwest and East Coast. The company recently introduced five new luxury vinyl plank collections , which capture the natural beauty of wood and stone, while offering a remarkably durable and low-maintenance flooring option.\nHeadquartered in San Diego, DuChâteau has a presence in seven countries across the globe, including Australia, China, the Dominican Republic and Mexico. The company’s incredibly personal design statements are appreciated by some of the world’s most prestigious brands, including The Ritz Carlton, Ian Schrager hotels, Saks Fifth Avenue, Whole Foods and Augusta National Golf Club.\nAbout DuChâteau\nDuChâteau® is a growing and innovative lifestyle brand that specializes in the design and manufacture of luxury architectural elements from custom flooring to wall coverings, doors, furniture and more.
