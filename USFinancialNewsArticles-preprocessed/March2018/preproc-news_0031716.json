We're encouraged by our progress and believe these initiatives can improve earnings performance as they continue to mature. We're also pleased with the 37% growth rate and improved efficiency we achieved in e-commerce during 2017.\"\n\"As we look to 2018, we plan to build on this momentum and address the changing landscape by prioritizing investments such as 'Buy Online, Pickup in Store,' the expansion of our vendor direct program, and enhancements to the mobile experience while maintaining our focus on operating discipline. We're also fast-tracking more testing to drive innovation and pursue new avenues for growth. Our goal is to leverage our omni-channel platform to inspire customers within our well-established value model combining style and affordability. Our balance sheet remains strong, providing us with the flexibility to invest further in these critical areas while returning excess cash to shareholders.\"\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nKirkland's is introducing its outlook for fiscal 2018 as follows:\nStore Growth:\nFor the 52-week period ending February 2, 2019 (\"fiscal 2018\"), the Company expects square footage growth of approximately 2% to 3% compared to 5% in 2017, with 20 to 25 new store openings and 10 to 15 store closings.\nSales:\nOn a 52-week basis, the Company expects total sales for fiscal 2018 to increase 3% to 5% compared with fiscal 2017. This level of sales performance implies a comparable store sales increase in the range of 1% to 2%, driven by growth in e-commerce through kirklands.com .\nEarnings:\nThe Company expects fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.60. The full year earnings projection assumes a tax rate of approximately 24% compared with a rate of 46% in fiscal 2017.\nCash Flow:\nCapital expenditures in fiscal 2018, which are driven primarily by new store openings and investments in omni-channel and supply chain capabilities, are estimated to range between $26 million and $29 million compared with approximately $28 million in fiscal 2017.\nThis updated performance outlook is based on current information as of March 16, 2018. The information on which this outlook is based is subject to change, and investors are cautioned that the Company may update its full year business outlook or any portion thereof at any time for any reason.\nInvestor Conference Call and Web Simulcast\nKirkland's will hold its earnings call for the fourth quarter later today at 11:00 a.m. ET.
