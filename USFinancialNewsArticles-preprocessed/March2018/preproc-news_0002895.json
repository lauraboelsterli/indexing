Gordon will remain in the role until March 31.\nThe company, which generates 30 percent of its revenue from work carried out on behalf of the National Health Service (NHS), the UK’s publicly funded healthcare system, reported 2017 EBITDA of 150 million pounds ($206.7 million).\nIt was in line with Spire’s forecast of EBITDA between 149 million pounds to 151 million pounds, which it revised down last year from 162 million pounds, citing weakness in the online NHS referrals business.\nNHS, which has been operating with an over 1 billion pound deficit with shortage of beds and staff, has been seeking assistance from companies such as Spire, BMI Healthcare and Nuffield Health.\nSpire’s referrals coming in through NHS weakened, with revenue from the business falling 1.9 percent to 287.8 million pounds in 2017.\nTotal revenue rose marginally to 931.7 million pounds in the period.\nAnalysts were expecting EBITDA of 151.77 million pounds and revenue of 938.84 million pounds according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAustralian hospital chain Ramsay Health Care reported a weak first-half on Wednesday after its British business, a competitor of Spire, was also hit by NHS weakness.\n$1 = 0.7258 pounds Reporting By Justin George Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ",
