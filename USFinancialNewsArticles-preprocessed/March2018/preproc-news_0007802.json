REUTERS/Hannah McKay Branderiz had joined Tesla in October 2016 after a six-year stint at SunPower Corp.\nThe news comes at a time when ISS and Glass Lewis, two influential proxy advisory firms, are recommending that Tesla shareholders vote against a proposal to give CEO Elon Musk a $2.6 billion performance-based stock option grant.\nShares of the Silicon Valley company were down 1.5 percent at $324 in after-hours trading on Thursday.\nReporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
