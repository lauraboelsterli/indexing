    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump threw the massive spending bill into doubt Friday, saying he was \"considering\" a veto of the $1.3 trillion plan over concerns about young \"Dreamer\" immigrants and border wall money.\nHours before funding for the government expires, Trump said on Twitter that he was weighing a veto \"based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"\nThe tweet was at odds with comments Thursday by Trump's supporters. Budget director Mick Mulvaney had said the president would sign the bill and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said Trump was supportive.\nCongress has already left town for a two-week recess. Earlier Friday morning, the Senate gave final approval of the bill before funding for the government expires at midnight.\nThe Senate passage shortly after midnight averted a third federal shutdown this year, an outcome both parties wanted to avoid. But in crafting a sweeping deal that busts budget caps, they've stirred conservative opposition and set the contours for the next funding fight ahead of the midterm elections.\nThe House easily approved the measure Thursday, 256-167, a bipartisan tally that underscored the popularity of the compromise, which funds the government through September. It beefs up military and domestic programs, delivering federal funds to every corner of the country.\nBut action stalled in the Senate, as conservatives ran the clock in protest. Then, an unusual glitch arose when Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, wanted to remove a provision to rename a forest in his home state after the late Cecil Andrus, a four-term Democratic governor.\nAt one point, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., stepped forward to declare the entire late-night scene \"ridiculous. It's juvenile.\"\nIn the end, Risch lost. But the fight contributed to late-night delays before passage of the massive spending package,\nOnce the opponents relented, the Senate began voting, clearing the package by a 65-32 vote a full day before Friday's midnight deadline to fund the government.\n\"Shame, shame. A pox on both Houses - and parties,\" tweeted Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who spent the afternoon tweeting details found in the 2,200-page bill that was released the night before. \"No one has read it. Congress is broken.\"\nPaul said later he knew he could only delay, but not stop, the outcome and had made his point.\nThe omnibus spending bill was supposed to be an antidote to the stopgap measures Congress has been forced to pass — five in this fiscal year alone — to keep government temporarily running amid partisan fiscal disputes.\nLeaders delivered on President Donald Trump's top priorities of boosting Pentagon coffers and starting work on his promised border wall, while compromising with Democrats on funds for road building, child care development, fighting the opioid crisis and more.\nBut the result has been unimaginable to many Republicans after campaigning on spending restraints and balanced budgets. Along with the recent GOP tax cuts law, the bill that stood a foot tall at some lawmakers' desks ushers in the return of $1 trillion deficits.\nTrump only reluctantly backed the bill he would have to sign, according to Republican lawmakers and aides, who acknowledged the deal involved necessary trade-offs for the Democratic votes that were needed for passage despite their majority lock on Congress.\n\"Obviously he doesn't like this process — it's dangerous to put it up to the 11th hour like this,\" said Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., who opposed the bill and speaks regularly to Trump. \"The president, and our leadership, and the leadership in the House got together and said, Look, we don't like what the Democrats are doing, we got to fund the government.\"\nWhite House legislative director Marc Short framed it as a compromise. \"I can't sit here and tell you and your viewers that we love everything in the bill,\" he said on Fox. \"But we think that we got many of our priorities funded.\"\nTrying to smooth over differences, Republican leaders focused on military increases that were once core to the party's brand as guardians of national security.\n\"Vote yes for our military. Vote yes for the safety and the security of this country,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., ahead of voting.\nBut even that remained a hard sell. In all, 90 House Republicans, including many from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, voted against the bill, as did two dozen Republicans in the Senate.\nIt was a sign of the entrenched GOP divisions that have made the leadership's job controlling the majority difficult. They will likely repeat in the next budget battle in the fall.\nDemocrats faced their own divisions, particularly after failing to resolve the stalemate over shielding young Dreamer immigrants from deportation as Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has left it for the courts to decide.\nInstead, Trump won $1.6 billion to begin building and replacing segments of the wall along the border with Mexico. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus opposed the bill.\nAlso missing from the package was a renewal of federal insurance subsidies to curb premium costs on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Trump ended some of those payments as part of his effort to scuttle President Barack Obama's health care law, but Republicans have joined Democrats in trying to revive them.\nBipartisan efforts to restore the subsidies, and provide additional help for insurance carriers, foundered over disagreements on how tight abortion restrictions should be on using the money for private insurance plans. Senate Republicans made a last-ditch effort to tuck the insurance provisions into the bill, but Democrats refused to yield on abortion restrictions.\nStill, Democrats were beyond pleased with the outcome. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., chronicled the party's many gains, and noted they could just have easily withheld votes Republicans needed to avert another shutdown.\n\"We chose to use our leverage to help this bill pass,\" Pelosi said.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said as the minority party in Congress, \"We feel good.\" He added, \"We produced a darn good bill.\"\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Daly and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\nFollow Mascaro on Twitter at https://twitter.com/LisaMascaro and Fram at https://twitter.com/AsFram",
