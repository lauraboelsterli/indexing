He has also been EVP of Developed Asia for Telenor as well as Chief Executive Officer of Digi Telecommunications Malaysia and of Telenor Sweden. Lars-Åke holds an MBA from Gothenburg School of Economics, an MSc in Engineering Physics from Uppsala University and an MSc in Systems Engineering from Case Western Reserve University, USA.\nCristina Stenbeck, Chairman of the Nomination Committee, commented: \"The Nomination Committee is pleased to nominate Lars-Åke Norling to the Millicom Board. When he joins the Board in September, Lars-Åke will bring more than twenty years of experience from the TMT sector in emerging markets and in the Nordics, as well as from driving digital transformations. The Nomination Committee has recommended the Board that Lars-Åke succeeds the departing Directors on both the Audit and Compliance and Business Conduct Committees.\"\nCristina Stenbeck continued: \"On behalf of the Nomination Committee, I would also like to extend our gratitude to Simon Duffy and Alejandro Santo Domingo for their contribution during their tenures on the Millicom Board. The Nomination Committee looks forward to continuing its work with the aim to further enhance the Board's composition throughout the year.\"\nThe Nomination Committee's proposals are presented in the notice to Millicom's AGM, to be held on 4 May 2018.
