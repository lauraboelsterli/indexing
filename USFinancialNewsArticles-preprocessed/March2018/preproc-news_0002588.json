    "text": "MANITOWOC, Wis., March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orion Energy Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:OESX) ( Orion Lighting ), a provider of enterprise-grade LED lighting and energy project solutions, today announced that CEO Mike Altschaefl and CFO Bill Hull will present in LD Micro's inaugural Virtual Conference on Wednesday, March 7, 2018, at 11:00 am Eastern (details below). The online conference will feature presentations by over 60 small cap and microcap companies.\nDate: Wednesday, March 7, 2018 at 11:00 am ET\nWebcast & Replay URL: http://www.investorcalendar.com/console/conference/?id=26471\nOrion at a Glance: Recent Share Price: $0.85 Cash (12/31/17): $10.6M 52-Week Range: $0.73 - $2.11 Price / TTM Revenue: 0.4x Market Cap: $24.6M Price / Book Value (12/31/17): 1.0x TTM Revenue: $61.0M Expanded Sales Reach and Cost Reduction Program\nLed by Mike Altschaefl, who was named CEO in May 2017, Orion has made solid progress on its goals of 1) positioning the Company for long-term growth in the LED lighting market and 2) reducing ongoing overhead expense, accelerating its path to improved financial results. On the sales front, Orion has substantially expanded its national sales reach by forming a network of approximately fifty agencies to build upon Orion’s existing direct sales effort focused on a number of major national accounts. Orion estimates that the addition of its agent sales base now enables it to engage with roughly 77% of potential LED lighting opportunities up from its prior direct sales reach of approximately 13%.\nOn the cost side, over the past year Orion has reduced annual overhead by approximately 20% or $6M, savings which should be fully reflected in Orion’s fiscal 2019 year which starts April 1, 2018. Management’s goal is to advance the Company to breakeven, on an EBITDA basis, by its second quarter ending September 30, 2018, at the same time it focuses on driving sales growth from its expanded market reach.\nAbout LD Micro\nLD Micro was founded in 2006 with the sole purpose of being an independent resource in the microcap space.
