General view aftermath of the ski-lift accident in Gudauri, Georgia, March 16, 2018 in this picture obtained from social media. Courtesy of IRYNA IADAK/via REUTERS Video shot by people next to the lift, posted on social media, showed skiers jumping or falling from the carriages, as horrified onlookers shouted in panic. The lift appeared to be moving backwards and dangerously fast, leading to a pile-up of broken and twisted chairs at the liftâ€™s lowest point.
