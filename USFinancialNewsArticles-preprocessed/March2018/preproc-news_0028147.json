    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Viking Mergers & Acquisitions, a business brokerage firm representing middle market business owners in the South East, has successfully completed the sale of Carolina Precision Fibers, a green industry recycled materials manufacturing business located in Ronda, North Carolina that specializes in cellulose installation, hydroseeding mulch and industrial fibers for asphalt roads. Carolina Precision Fibers was founded by Fred Vincelli, an entrepreneur with a passion for the well-being of the environment. After 17 years of owning, developing and expanding CPF, Vincelli decided that it was time to sell the business to a new owner.\nVincelli hired Viking Mergers & Acquisitions and worked with Senior Advisor Greg White to facilitate the sale and guide him through the entire acquisition. White knew that CPF was a profitable business and that it would not be difficult to find a successor. \"I quickly realized that CPF was a very special and unique business and that the owner was a very intelligent individual. I knew instantly that the business would generate a lot of activity,\" says White. After 8 months of working together in finding the ideal buyer for the business, White and Vincelli completed the transaction.\n\"Greg White is one of the most organized, dedicated and hard-working professionals that I have ever worked with, and he was there to guide me through the entire process,\" says Vincelli. After closing the deal and passing the business on to the new buyer, Vincelli is enthusiastic about seeing the business grow and prosper under new ownership. He plans to travel, spend time with his family and give back to the community by participating in volunteer opportunities.\nAbout Viking Mergers & Acquisitions\nViking Mergers & Acquisitions was founded in 1996 by father-son team, Brad and Jay Offerdahl.
