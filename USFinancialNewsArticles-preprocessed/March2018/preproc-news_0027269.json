    "text": "Before divining the meaning of a special election in a Pennsylvania congressional district that soon will cease to exist, let us pause to consider America’s obsession with elevating the totally obscure to national prominence.\nIn March no more pleasurable habit returns than finding the least probable colleges in the NCAA basketball tournament. This year’s bracket lists a first-round game as “NCCU vs. TXSO.” That would be North Carolina Central against Texas Southern, which made it to the Big Dance by defeating Arkansas-Pine Bluff for its league title. \nWe call them Cinderella teams. Which brings us to Pennsylvania state Rep. Rick Saccone versus the Pittsburgh chameleon Conor Lamb. \nIt used to be true that all politics was local. Why care about an election in a district that sprawls horizontally south of Pittsburgh? Because now more than ever, every day in our politics is March Madness. A political burp at any level can turn into a national event.\nWhat do the returns in Allegheny County, Pa., mean for control of Congress? Does Conor Lamb’s strong showing in PA-18 mean “Conor Lamb” should be the future of the Democratic Party? \nWashington’s daily takeover of our heads didn’t start with the phenomenon called “ Trump. ” It began with “ Obama. ”\nBarack Obama preceded Donald Trump as our first totally celebrified president. Both men’s victories were unique on a virtually unprecedented scale. Mr. Obama was the first black president. Donald Trump was the first . . . well, the first “Trump.” \nAs important, both men became president during the rise of always-on electronic media that will no longer recognize any political reality without first pulling it through a lens labeled Obama then or Trump now. The American presidency defines everything, including PA-18. \nDonald Trump may think he is dominating our politics, but he’s also a role-player. He is forced to prop up weak local candidates in places like Alabama or Western Pennsylvania with two-year-old campaign oratory, because the whole world knows he carried PA-18 by 20 points. Barack Obama spent his first term giving the same campaign speech everywhere. If he talked to a kindergarten class, it somehow always got around to “the wealthiest” and the “1%,” or so it seemed. \nRelated \nReview & Outlook: Trump’s Pennsylvania Downdraft Karl Rove: What the GOP Can Learn From Losing In its current iteration, the national “narrative,” which is what we used to call the conventional wisdom, holds that Trumpist populism now defines the Republican Party. But Trumpism’s details look more like an hourly work in progress, reflecting their source. \nIn fact, the leveling political tides are creating a bigger problem for Democrats. Democrats are both beneficiaries and victims of Barack Obama, whose congenial persona camouflaged the party’s hard-left turn during his term. \nNow they’re forced to produce candidates like Conor Lamb or Jon Ossoff, who last year lost the Georgia-6 special congressional election, or Cory Booker —who seem to represent pretty much nothing. Or at least nothing resembling the dominant Democratic idea-set produced by Washington, New York, San Francisco, Hollywood, most media, late-night comedians or on any college campus. \nThe most telling thing about Conor Lamb’s campaign wasn’t that he rarely mentioned Donald Trump but that he disowned Nancy Pelosi. One could write the history of the modern Democratic Party in Mrs. Pelosi’s biography. \nShe grew up in a Baltimore political family when that city defined the party’s gritty, working-class affiliations. She migrated to San Francisco, won a special congressional election in 1987 and now personifies the ascendant Google Democrats. \nAmong the Democrats who did campaign for Mr. Lamb was Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan of nearby Youngstown, who challenged Mrs. Pelosi for minority leader last year. He said the party’s coastal-created obsession with race, gender and the rest of the identity-politics palette has caused it to abandon working-class Democrats from heartland states like his. \nFor the short version of the political and psychological confusions this internal tension has produced, see Hillary Clinton’s remarks in India explaining why white women vote. That is the voice of a Democrat—and she’s far from alone—who is simply lost inside the party’s current progressive “narrative.” \nShould Conor Lamb’s impressive performance south of Pittsburgh worry Paul Ryan and House Republicans? Yes. Surviving midterm elections is a beast. In 2010, the House Democrats of the now-canonized Barack Obama lost 63 seats. \nAs noted here previously, three recent presidents have minimized their party’s midterm losses or gained seats: Reagan in ’86 (minus 5); Clinton in a personally tumultuous ’98 (plus 5); and George W. Bush in ’02 (plus 8). They had one thing in common: a strong national economy.\nLast month the U.S. added 313,000 jobs. The labor participation rate among black Americans now equals that of whites for the first time since 1972. \nJohn F. Kennedy, Democrat, said a rising economic tide lifts all boats. Today the Democratic Party’s strategy is to persuade voters those are fake jobs. The party’s Conor Lambs are stuck somewhere in the middle. He’s not just in PA-18 anymore. No one is. \nWrite henninger@wsj.com.",
