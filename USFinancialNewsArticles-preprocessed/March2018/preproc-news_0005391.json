(NASDAQ:MMSI), a leading manufacturer and marketer of proprietary disposable devices used in interventional, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, particularly in cardiology, radiology, oncology, critical care and endoscopy, today announced revenue of $190.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 21.0% over revenue of $157.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. On a comparable, constant currency basis, revenue of 2017 would have been up 19.3% over revenue for the comparable quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue was $727.9 million, up 20.5% compared to revenue of $603.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. On a comparable, constant currency basis, revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been up 20.4% over revenue for the comparable period of 2016.\nMerit’s GAAP net income of 2017 was $6.8 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to $7.5 million, or $0.17 per share, of 2016. Merit’s non-GAAP net income* for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $16.8 million, or $0.33 per share, compared to $13.8 million, or $0.31 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nMerit’s GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $27.5 million, or $0.55 per share, compared to $20.1 million, or $0.45 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Merit’s non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $64.3 million, or $1.28 per share, compared to $45.1 million, or $1.01 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nMerit’s revenue by category for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding periods in 2016, was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, % Change 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 Cardiovascular Stand-alone devices 40.0 % $ 71,997 $ 51,419 44.1 % $ 275,431 $ 191,148 Custom kits and procedure trays 16.4 % 35,007 30,062 5.8 % 126,114 119,226 Inflation devices 7.3 % 20,546 19,142 8.1 % 79,875 73,916 Catheters 14.0 % 33,390 29,289 12.7 % 127,747 113,367 Embolization devices 4.1 % 12,596 12,098 7.6 % 49,532 46,035 CRM/EP 3.8 % 9,936 9,570 15.0 % 41,914 36,459 Total 21.0 % 183,472 151,580 20.8 % 700,613 580,151 Endoscopy Endoscopy devices 21.0 % 7,425 6,135 15.0 % 27,239 23,687 Total 21.0 % $ 190,897 $ 157,715 20.5 % $ 727,852 $ 603,838 Note: Certain revenue categories for 2016 have been adjusted from prior disclosure to reflect changes in product classifications to be consistent with updates in the management of Merit's product portfolios in 2017.\n“We have now closed the final year of our initial three-year plan,” said Fred P. Lampropoulos, Merit’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe that much has been accomplished and that the structure and programs are in place to reach our previously disclosed goals related to core growth, gross margin improvement, and profitability.”\n“I have recently returned from Japan and witnessed our consolidation of businesses and look forward to substantial sales growth there as our business builds more direct presence,” Lampropoulos said.\n“Over the next several months we intend to transition the product lines we recently purchased from Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) to our facilities in Tijuana,” Lampropoulos said. “As a reminder, we expect transition expenses during this period to affect our earnings over the next six to nine months as customer service, manufacturing, product fulfillment, IT, regulatory, and other costs associated with our movement to a fully controlled and manufactured business is completed. Our 2018 guidance includes these expenses. To put this simply, there will be some irregular quarters as we go through this process, but once again, I must reiterate that our team is in place and transfer activities, including movement of accounts and direct interface with customers and national accounts, are well underway. Equally important, we plan to introduce new biopsy products and services, which we believe will give Merit a competitive advantage.”\n“Our overall pipeline is robust with new drainage products, inflation devices, vascular access products, endoscopy balloons, and stents,” Lampropoulos said. “We also have many other products and programs in place which we believe will support our organic growth for years to come.”\n“We believe the substantial investments of the past, along with a long-term vision of the future, continued discipline, and a keen eye on the present will continue to present a substantial opportunity for stakeholders and value for our shareholders,” Lampropoulos said.\n2018 Guidance\nBased upon information currently available to Merit's management, Merit estimates that for the year ending December 31, 2018, absent material acquisitions or non-recurring transactions, Merit's revenues will be in the range of $838 - $851 million, an increase of approximately 15-17%, compared to revenues of $727.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Also, based on information currently available to Merit's management, Merit estimates that, absent material acquisitions or non-recurring transactions, Merit's GAAP earnings per share for 2018 will be in the range of $0.77 - $0.85, GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 45.6% - 46.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $1.57 - $1.69, and non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 49.7% - 50.8%. Merit’s financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2018 is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, potential accounting adjustments attributable to Merit’s ongoing valuation of intangibles and other financial assets acquired from BD, as well as risks and uncertainties identified in Merit’s public filings.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nMerit will hold its investor conference call (conference ID 2978169) today, Wednesday, February 28, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (4:00 p.m. Central, 3:00 p.m. Mountain, and 2:00 p.m. Pacific).

Non-GAAP financial measures used in this release include:\nconstant currency revenue; core revenue; core revenue on a constant currency basis; non-GAAP gross margin non-GAAP net income; and non-GAAP earnings per share;\nMerit’s management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate Merit’s profitability and efficiency, to compare operating results to prior periods, to evaluate changes in the operating results of its operating segments, and to measure and allocate financial resources internally. However, Merit’s management does not consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to such measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nReaders should consider non-GAAP measures used in this release in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures generally exclude some, but not all, items that may affect Merit's net income. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which items are excluded. Merit believes it is useful to exclude such items in the calculation of non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP net income (in each case, as further illustrated in the reconciliation table below) because such amounts in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Merit’s business operations and can vary significantly between periods as a result of factors such as new acquisitions, non-cash expenses related to amortization of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets, unusual compensation expenses or expenses resulting from litigation, governmental proceedings or changes in tax regulations. Merit may incur similar types of expenses in the future, and the non-GAAP financial information included in this release should not be viewed as a statement or indication that these types of expenses will not recur. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Merit urges investors and potential investors to review the reconciliations of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Merit’s business or results of operations.\nConstant Currency Revenue\nMerit’s revenue on a constant currency basis is prepared by translating the current-period reported revenue of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period. The constant currency revenue adjustments of $(2.7) million and $(0.6) million for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017, respectively, were calculated using the applicable average foreign exchange rates for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nCore Revenue and Core Revenue on a Constant Currency Basis\nMerit’s core revenue is defined as reported revenue excluding revenues from the acquisitions of the HeRO® Graft (excluded January 2017 only) in February 2016, DFINE, Inc. (excluded through June 2017) in July 2016, Catheter Connections, Inc. and the critical care division of Argon Medical Devices, Inc. in January 2017, Osseon LLC in July 2017, Laurane Medical S.A.S. in August 2017 and ITL Healthcare Pty. Ltd. in October 2017. Core revenue on a constant currency basis is defined as core revenue plus the foreign exchange impact related to those core sales, using the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior-year periods presented.\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\nNon-GAAP gross margin is calculated by reducing GAAP cost of sales by amounts recorded for amortization of intangible assets, inventory mark-up related to acquisitions and severance.\nNon-GAAP Net Income\nNon-GAAP net income is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income for certain items which are deemed by Merit’s management to be outside of core operations and vary in amount and frequency among periods, such as expenses related to new acquisitions, non-cash expenses related to amortization of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets, unusual compensation expenses or expenses resulting from litigation, governmental proceedings or changes in tax regulations, as well as other items set forth in the table below.\nNon-GAAP EPS\nNon-GAAP EPS is defined as non-GAAP net income divided by the diluted shares outstanding for the corresponding period.\nOther Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation\nThe following table sets forth supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to Merit’s net income and earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The non-GAAP income adjustments referenced in the following table do not reflect stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.2 million and $0.6 million for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and approximately $4.1 million and $2.5 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income (Unaudited, in thousands except per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Pre-Tax Tax Impact (a) After-Tax Per Share Impact GAAP net income $ 11,280 $ (4,474 ) $ 6,806 $ 0.13 Non-GAAP adjustments: Cost of Sales Amortization of intangibles 5,490 (1,848 ) 3,642 0.07 Inventory mark-up related to acquisitions 279 (39 ) 240 — Operating Expenses Severance 446 (171 ) 275 0.01 Acquisition-related (b) 1,593 (532 ) 1,061 0.02 Fair value adjustment to contingent consideration (c) (338 ) 131 (207 ) — Long-term asset impairment charge (d) 93 (36 ) 57 — Intangible asset impairment charge (e) 809 — 809 0.02 Amortization of intangibles 1,908 (703 ) 1,205 0.02 Special legal expense (f) 2,001 (779 ) 1,222 0.02 Other (Income) Expense Gain on bargain purchase (g) (243 ) — (243 ) — Amortization of long-term debt issuance costs 171 (67 ) 104 — Tax expense related to tax reform (h) — 1,855 1,855 0.04 Non-GAAP net income $ 23,489 $ (6,663 ) $ 16,826 $ 0.33 Diluted shares 51,722 Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Pre-Tax Tax Impact (a) After-Tax Per Share Impact GAAP net income $ 9,622 $ (2,116 ) $ 7,506 $ 0.17 Non-GAAP adjustments: Cost of Sales Amortization of intangibles 4,434 (1,653 ) 2,781 0.06 Inventory mark-up related to acquisitions 1,581 (615 ) 966 0.02 Operating Expenses Severance 848 (330 ) 518 0.01 Acquisition-related (b) 753 (266 ) 487 0.01 Fair value adjustment to contingent consideration (c) (38 ) 15 (23 ) — Long-term asset impairment charge (d) 13 (5 ) 8 — Acquired in-process research and development 61 (24 ) 37 — Amortization of intangibles 1,298 (499 ) 799 0.02 Special legal expense (f) 1,016 (395 ) 621 0.01 Other (Income) Expense Amortization of long-term debt issuance costs 172 (67 ) 105 — Non-GAAP net income $ 19,760 $ (5,955 ) $ 13,805 $ 0.31 Diluted shares 45,165\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income (Unaudited, in thousands except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2017 Pre-Tax Tax Impact (a) After-Tax Per Share Impact GAAP net income $ 35,881 $ (8,358 ) $ 27,523 $ 0.55 Non-GAAP adjustments: Cost of Sales Amortization of intangibles 20,705 (7,550 ) 13,155 0.26 Inventory mark-up related to acquisitions 3,400 (1,253 ) 2,147 0.04 Operating expenses Severance 2,185 (847 ) 1,338 0.03 Acquisition-related (b) 6,648 (2,048 ) 4,600 0.09 Fair value adjustment to contingent consideration (c) (298 ) 116 (182 ) — Long-term asset impairment charge (d) 179 (70 ) 109 — Acquired in-process research and development 12,136 (97 ) 12,039 0.24 Intangible asset impairment charge (e) 809 — 809 0.02 Amortization of intangibles 6,111 (2,324 ) 3,787 0.07 Special legal expense (f) 12,616 (4,908 ) 7,708 0.15 Other (Income) Expense Gain on bargain purchase (g) (11,039 ) — (11,039 ) (0.22 ) Amortization of long-term debt issuance costs 685 (267 ) 418 0.01 Tax expense related to tax reform (h) — 1,855 1,855 0.04 Non-GAAP net income $ 90,018 $ (25,751 ) $ 64,267 $ 1.28 Diluted shares 50,101 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Pre-Tax Tax Impact (a) After-Tax Per Share Impact GAAP net income $ 25,386 $ (5,265 ) $ 20,121 $ 0.45 Non-GAAP adjustments: Cost of Sales Amortization of intangibles 15,122 (5,592 ) 9,530 0.21 Inventory mark-up related to acquisitions 2,990 (1,163 ) 1,827 0.04 Severance 56 (22 ) 34 — Operating Expenses Severance 10,271 (3,878 ) 6,393 0.14 Acquisition-related (b) 4,503 (1,448 ) 3,055 0.07 Fair value adjustment to contingent consideration (c) 61 (24 ) 37 — Long-term asset impairment charge (d) 100 (38 ) 62 — Acquired in-process research and development 461 (179 ) 282 0.01 Amortization of intangibles 4,167 (1,595 ) 2,572 0.06 Special legal expense (f) 1,016 (395 ) 621 0.01 Other (Income) Expense Amortization of long-term debt issuance costs 952 (370 ) 582 0.01 Non-GAAP net income $ 65,085 $ (19,969 ) $ 45,116 $ 1.01 Diluted shares 44,862 Reflects the tax effect associated with pre-tax income and the non-GAAP adjustments Represents costs related to acquisitions Represents changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and contingent receivables as a result of acquisitions Represents abandoned patents Represents impairment charges of certain intangible assets Costs incurred in responding to an inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice Represents the gain on bargain purchase realized from the acquisition of the critical care division of Argon Medical Devices, Inc.
