    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 3:39 PM / a minute ago UPDATE 1-Brazil stops BRF poultry exports to EU; shares dive Reuters Staff (Adds share performance, ABPA statement) By Ana Mano SAO PAULO, March 16 (Reuters) - Brazil food processor     stopped   Union, and the company’s shares slid to their lowest since 2011. BRF, Brazil’s largest chicken processor, said the ministry suspended production and certification “preemptively” but did not give the reason. BRF has been ensnared in a food safety scandal; it is a target in an investigation which accused it of engaging in fraud to evade food safety checks. The company said   restriction. It said the   The Agriculture Ministry did not have an immediate comment. This week, a shareholder sued BRF in the United States, accusing the world’s largest poultry exporter of concealing its involvement in food safety fraud, culminating in the arrest of a former chief executive officer. The export suspension affects 10 out of 35 BRF plants in Brazil, the company said. Shares tumbled more than 6 percent to a session low of 23.70 reais in early morning trading, near the lowest since August 2011. They later recovered to 24.70 reais, down about 2.3 percent. The temporary suspension will affect less than 5 percent of the company’s total sales volumes, according to a bank analyst who cannot speak to the press. Still, the analyst said, the suspension is undesirable considering the company needs to improve margins and reduce debt. Brazilian chicken companies exported more than 5 million tonnes of that kind of meat to the European Union in the last 10 years, trade group ABPA said in a statement on Friday. “Brazil is a long-term partner of the European Union. We expect a solution is found to resume exports,” ABPA said. BRF said it shipped 278,000 tonnes of poultry and processed products to Europe last year. It declined to provide an exact breakdown of how much was shipped out of its plants in Brazil. (Reporting by Ana Mano and Paula Laier   and David Gregorio)",
