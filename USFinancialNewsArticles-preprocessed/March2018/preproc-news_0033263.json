In this role, she will lead its global people initiatives as the company continues to transform its culture to ensure long-term success.\nReporting to Ford CEO Jim Hackett, Robinson, 47, will be the senior leader and corporate officer overseeing all people processes globally. The appointment is effective April 1, 2018.\n“As we work to become the most trusted mobility company, designing smart vehicles for a smart world, our people and our culture will be the foundation that ensures we deliver for all of our stakeholders,” said Jim Hackett, president and CEO. “Kiersten has proven herself a strong leader for transformational times and I have confidence that progress on modernizing our people systems and culture will accelerate under her watch.”\nIn this role, Robinson will oversee all global people processes including talent management, workforce planning, learning and development, recruiting, diversity and inclusion, compensation and benefits, and the dealer policy board. Bill Dirksen, Ford vice president, Labor Affairs, also will matrix report to her.\nRobinson previously served as the company’s interim Human Resources leader and brings a wealth of global experience in human resources spanning more than 23 years, including serving in Europe, Asia Pacific and most recently in the Americas.\nShe joined the company in 1995 as a labor relations representative in Ford of Australia and quickly rose through the ranks, serving in the first of several international assignments in 1997 with the Ford of Europe manufacturing organization. Following two additional positions in Australia, Robinson moved to Ford’s headquarters in 2002 to hold a variety of roles of increasing responsibility, culminating in her appointment to vice president of Human Resources for Ford in Asia Pacific in 2010.\nWhile leading Human Resources for Asia Pacific, Robinson further distinguished herself by leading the development and deployment of a robust talent and people resource plan for the growing operation and by establishing Ford’s brand as an employer of choice across the 16 markets in Asia.\nIn 2016, Robinson was appointed to lead human resources for The Americas, and in early 2017 her role was expanded to include Global Markets; a role in which she served until her appointment to interim leader of Human Resources in November 2017.\nRobinson holds a bachelors degree in Education and Liberal Arts from the University of Melbourne, Australia.\nFor biographical information and photos of Kiersten Robinson, click here .\nAbout Ford Motor Company\nFord Motor Company is a global company based in Dearborn, Michigan.
