    "text": "Industry Veteran and Former Netflix Security Leader to Drive Development of the JASK ASOC Platform; Will Join Company in Austin, Texas Office\nSAN FRANCISCO & AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- JASK , the provider of the industry’s only Autonomous Security Operations Center (ASOC) platform, today announced the appointment of Rob Fry as its vice president of engineering. A cybersecurity industry expert and visionary, he has held senior security architect and engineering roles at Netflix, Yahoo and security start-ups, and will now lead the development of the JASK ASOC platform. Fry joins JASK’s fast-growing team in its Austin, Texas dual-headquarters location.\nFry is an accomplished architect, inventor and public speaker with more than 20 years of experience specializing in SOC technologies, including security automation, threat detection, data analytics, machine learning and cloud security. During his technology leadership roles at both Netflix and Yahoo, he built high-performance teams and experienced first-hand the challenges organizations are facing when it comes to defending from the ever-evolving cyber threat.\n“JASK’s vision of delivering the autonomous SOC and its data-first approach to solving the challenges that continue to plague security analysts with overwhelming and unmanageable alerts is directly in-line with what I have been advocating throughout the past decade,” said Fry. “The ability to build a world-class team while fulfilling our shared product vision makes JASK the perfect fit for me, and the potential is phenomenal.”\nAt Netflix, Fry supported the company’s expansion from a US-based to a global business spanning 190 countries. He was responsible for incident response, threat intelligence, Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and PCI-DSS compliance and IP security for 3,800 employees, as well as sensitive data security for 100 million subscribers. He also provided security leadership and advisory services during the company’s transition to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and invented FIDO, a patented open source security orchestration platform.\n“Rob brings the perfect blend of experiences to lead our engineering team while actively contributing to our vision and we are thrilled that he was enthusiastic about relocating to join our team in Austin,” said J.J. Guy, JASK CTO. “Rob’s track record as a leader within Netflix’s renowned engineering culture, combined with his innovative spirit, will be critical factors as we continue to build our team and work to solve the challenges that are restricting security modernization efforts.”\nDriven by A.I. and machine learning, the JASK ASOC platform automates the collection, normalization, correlation and analysis of alerts, helping SOC analysts focus on the highest-priority threats to streamline investigations and deliver faster response times. The platform is open and extensible through API-based integrations, allowing the ability to couple JASK data with information from existing security solutions and deliver extended value to customers from their current investments.\nPrior to Netflix, Fry was senior server and security engineer at Yahoo, where he created the DUBS configuration and automation framework for production servers. In his free time, he enjoys guiding technology companies through growth as an active participant on customer advisory boards and engineering steering teams.\nFor more information on the JASK ASOC platform, please visit https://jask.ai/solutions/product/ .\nAbout JASK\nJASK is modernizing security operations to reduce organizational risk and improve human efficiency.
