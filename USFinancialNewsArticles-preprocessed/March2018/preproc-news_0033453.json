The local share price index futures rose 0.5 percent, or 27 points, to 5.974, a 24.6-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark ended 0.5 percent up on Friday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index inched up in early trade. (Reporting by Christina Martin in Bengaluru, editing by Larry King)",
