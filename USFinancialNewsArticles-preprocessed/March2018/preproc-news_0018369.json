    "text": "ZURICH, March 7 (Reuters) - Novartis said on Wednesday it plans up to 10 clinical trials over three years using a U.S. partnerâ€™s mobile technology to help free patients from burdensome hospital trips as the Swiss drugmaker aims to boost study participation and cut costs.\nNovartis will work with Science 37, a Playa Vista, California-based startup that provides technology including smart phone apps to patients, allowing video-based telemedicine visits rather than always requiring physical travel to clinics.
