    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca now expects a key lung cancer study of two immunotherapy drugs to produce overall survival results in the second half of 2018, rather than the first half.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of AstraZeneca is seen on medication packages in a pharmacy in London April 28, 2014. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo The Phase III trial, known as Mystic, is testing Imfinzi on its own and in combination with tremelimumab, and the drugmaker noted in a brief statement on Monday that it was driven by clinical events among patients involved.\nFirst results from Mystic disappointed investors last July when AstraZenecaâ€™s two drugs proved no more effective at stopping disease progression than chemotherapy, sending its shares tumbling.\nReporting by Ben Hirschler, editing by Louise Heavens\n ",
