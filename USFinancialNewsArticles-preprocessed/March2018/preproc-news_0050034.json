    "text": "(Adds details of case, no immediate comment from Starbucks, other companies)\nMarch 29 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp and other coffee companies must put a cancer warning label on coffee products sold in California, a Los Angeles judge ruled.\nSuperior Court Judge Elihu Berle said in a proposed decision Wednesday that Starbucks and other companies had failed to show that the threat from a chemical compound produced when roasting coffee was insignificant, court documents showed.\nStarbucks and other plaintiffs in the case have until April 10 to file objections.\nOfficials from Starbucks Corp, McDonalds Corp , Dunkin Donuts and Peets did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe California-based Council for Education and Research on Toxics sued Starbucks and other companies on grounds they failed to provide warnings to consumers that the coffee they sold contained high levels of acrylamide, a toxic and carcinogenic chemical, court documents showed.
