    "text": "Facebook has responded to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal , saying it will prevent further misuse by enacting restrictions on the use of personal data.\nThe company said on a post in its Newsroom on Wednesday it was enacting six main initiatives to prevent companies from having access to people's personal data without proper authorization. \nThe initiatives include:\n* Reviewing all apps that have had access to large amounts of data on its platform, \n\n* Alerting people who have had their information misused, \n* Turning off access to users' data if the person hasn't used the app in the last three months, \n* Changing Facebook Login data so apps can only see a user's name, profile photo and email address unless the app goes through a further review process, \n\n* Helping people manage the apps they use on Facebook, and,\n\n* Adding a bug bounty program for people to report and get rewarded if they find instances of app developers incorrectly using people's data. \nThe Guardian and The New York Times reported that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica used unauthorized data from a psychology quiz app to target voters during the 2016 U.S. election. The professor who created the app, Aleksandr Kogan, had told Facebook he was creating the app for academic research purposes, but he sold the personal information to Cambridge Analytica. Though only 270,000 people had downloaded the app, because users gave the app access to information on their Facebook friends the data set included info on more than 50 million Facebook profiles.\nCambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump's campaign, used the information to target potential voters, according to The Guardian and the New York Times. Cambridge Analytica has denied these claims, saying it deleted the information when it was notified it was obtained improperly.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a statement on the situation on his Facebook page on Wednesday , pledging to prevent the misuse of personal information on its platform. Though allowing access to friends' personal information through Facebook apps was stopped in 2014, the company will work to ensure any improperly obtained information will be deleted, make users more aware of who has access to their information and put more restrictions on what information apps can have about users. \n\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" Zuckerberg said. \nSee the full blog post here .",
