(\"Vermilion\") (TSX, NYSE: VET) announces a correction to the ex-dividend and record dates for the dividend payment on April 16, 2018. The ex-dividend date will be March 28, 2018 and the record date will be March 29, 2018, rather than the previously announced dates of March 29, 2018 and March 30, 2018, respectively, due to the statutory holiday on March 30, 2018.\nVermilion previously announced a cash dividend of $0.215 CDN per share payable on April 16, 2018, which is an eligible dividend for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada).\nAbout Vermilion\nVermilion is an international energy producer that seeks to create value through the acquisition, exploration, development and optimization of producing properties in North America, Europe and Australia.
