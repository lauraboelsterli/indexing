Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the operating performance of our business, as well as for executive compensation metrics, for comparable periods. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used by investors or other third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as it excludes a number of important cash and non-cash recurring items.\n3 The sum of net income (loss) and adjustments per diluted common share may not equal the Adjusted earnings per share due to rounding.\nWhile Adjusted net income (loss) 1 , Adjusted earnings (loss) per share 1 and Adjusted EBITDA 2 are non-GAAP measurements, management believes that they are important indicators of operating performance, and useful to investors, because:\nEBITDA excludes the effects of financings, investing activities and tax structure by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and income tax costs, and\n° For the 14 and 53 weeks ended February 2, 2018 and the 13 and 52 weeks ended January 27, 2017, we exclude the loss on disposal of property and equipment as management considers the gains or losses on disposal of assets to result from investing decisions rather than ongoing operations.\nOther significant items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of results. We have adjusted our results for these items to make our statements more comparable and therefore more useful to investors as the items are not representative of our ongoing operations.\n° For the 13 and 52 weeks ended January 27, 2017, we exclude the impairment of our indefinite-lived trade name asset as this is a non-cash charge that is an unusual event that affects the comparability of our financial results.\n° For the 14 and 53 weeks ended February 2, 2018, we exclude the impacts of the transfer of corporate functions, including severance and contract losses associated with a transition of certain corporate activities from our New York office to our Dodgeville headquarters.\n° For the 14 and 53 weeks ended February 2, 2018, we exclude the impacts of the Tax Reform as they are a result of a nonrecurring event that affects the comparability of our financial results.\n° For the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2017, an amount of a previously recorded recall was reversed due to lower than estimated customer return rates for the recalled products despite our efforts to contact impacted customers. These are unusual events that affect the comparability of our financial results.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information to GAAP (Unaudited) 14 Weeks Ended (in thousands except per share data) February 2, 2018 Pre-tax Tax impact After-Tax Adjusted Diluted EPS Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share $ 17,883 $ (21,869 ) $ 39,752 $ 1.24 Transfer of corporate functions 1,520 567 952 0.03 Tax Reform — 28,370 (28,370 ) (0.88 ) Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (1)(3) $ 19,403 $ 7,068 $ 12,334 $ 0.38\n13 Weeks Ended (in thousands except per share data) January 27, 2017 Pre-tax Tax impact After-Tax Adjusted Diluted EPS Net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share $ (157,603 ) $ (62,782 ) $ (94,821 ) $ (2.96 ) Intangible asset impairment 173,000 65,169 107,831 3.37 Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (1)(3) $ 15,397 $ 2,387 $ 13,010 $ 0.41\n53 Weeks Ended (in thousands except per share data) February 2, 2018 Pre-tax Tax impact After-Tax Adjusted Diluted EPS Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share $ 448 $ (27,747 ) $ 28,195 $ 0.88 Transfer of corporate functions 3,921 1,433 2,488 0.08 Tax Reform — 28,370 (28,370 ) (0.88 ) Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (1)(3) $ 4,369 $ 2,056 $ 2,313 $ 0.07\n52 Weeks Ended (in thousands except per share data) January 27, 2017 Pre-tax Tax impact After-Tax Adjusted Diluted EPS Net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share $ (178,880 ) $ (69,098 ) $ (109,782 ) $ (3.43 ) Intangible asset impairment 173,000 65,169 107,831 3.37 Product recall (212 ) (87 ) (125 ) — Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (1)(3) $ (6,092 ) $ (4,016 ) $ (2,076 ) $ (0.06 )\n14 Weeks Ended 13 Weeks Ended February 2, 2018 January 27, 2017 (in thousands) $’s % of\nNet Sales $’s % of\nNet Sales Net income (loss) $ 39,752 7.8 % $ (94,821 ) (20.7 )% Income tax benefit (21,869 ) (4.3 )% (62,782 ) (13.7 )% Other expense, net 4,520 0.9 % 3,032 0.7 % Interest expense 7,287 1.4 % 6,137 1.3 % Operating income (loss) 29,690 5.8 % (148,434 ) (32.3 )% Intangible asset impairment — — % 173,000 37.7 % Depreciation and amortization 5,879 1.2 % 5,584 1.2 % Transfer of corporate functions 1,520 0.3 % — — % Loss on disposal of property and equipment 197 — % 500 0.1 % Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 37,286 7.3 % $ 30,650 6.7 %\n53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended February 2, 2018 January 27, 2017 (in thousands) $’s % of\nNet Sales $’s % of\nNet Sales Net income (loss) $ 28,195 2.0 % $ (109,782 ) (8.2 )% Income tax benefit (27,747 ) (2.0 )% (69,098 ) (5.2 )% Other expense, net 2,708 0.2 % 1,619 0.1 % Interest expense 25,929 1.8 % 24,630 1.8 % Operating income (loss) 29,085 2.1 % (152,631 ) (11.4 )% Intangible asset impairment — — % 173,000 13.0 % Depreciation and amortization 24,910 1.8 % 19,003 1.4 % Product recall — — % (212 ) — % Transfer of corporate functions 3,921 0.3 % — — % Loss on disposal of property and equipment 348 — % 672 0.1 % Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 58,264 4.1 % $ 39,832 3.0 %\nLANDS’ END, INC.
