    "text": "QUEBEC CITY and MYRTLE BEACH, SC, March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - TSO 3 Inc. (TSX: TOS), (\"TSO 3 \" or the \"Company\"), an innovator in sterilization technology for medical devices in healthcare settings, today announced that it has received 510(k) clearance from US regulators for a significant improvement to its STERIZONE ® VP4 Sterilizer. The cleared change can improve the customer installation process and reduce start-up costs by significantly reducing the oxygen supply requirements for the system.\n\"We are excited to incorporate this new feature to our STERIZONE ® VP4 Sterilizer\", said TSO 3 President and CEO R.M. (Ric) Rumble. \"The improvement now makes the installation of our device more cost-effective, further solidifying its position as the least expensive, on a cost per item sterilized basis, low temperature sterilizer available today relative to legacy hydrogen peroxide-based sterilizers.\"\nAll of the Company's new STERIZONE ® VP4 Sterilizers, along with any upgraded units in existing inventories, can now incorporate this new feature and several other additional customer improvements intended to improve the user experience.\nAbout the STERIZONE ® VP4 Sterilizer\nThe STERIZONE ® VP4 Sterilizer is a low-temperature sterilization system that utilizes the dual-sterilants of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and ozone (O 3 ) to achieve terminal sterilization of heat and moisture sensitive medical devices. Its single pre-programmed cycle can sterilize a large number and wide range of compatible devices, creating a cost-effective sterilization process with error free cycle selection. The device's unique Dynamic Sterilant Delivery System™ automatically adjusts the quantity of injected sterilant based on the load composition, weight and temperature. This capability removes the guesswork and potential for human error, as there is no need to sort instruments and choose the appropriate cycles as with other machines.\nThe STERIZONE ® VP4 Sterilizer is the only terminal sterilization method that is FDA cleared to sterilize multi-channeled flexible endoscopes (with a maximum of four channels) of up to 3.5 meters in length, such as video colonoscopes and gastroscopes - an industry first for any medical device sterilization process.\nThe STERIZONE ® VP4 Sterilizer is also the only cleared low temperature sterilizer that can process a mixed load consisting of general instruments, single channel flexible endoscopes, and single or double channel rigid endoscopes in the same cycle with load weights of up to 75 lb. The ability to run mixed loads significantly reduces labor costs by minimizing the amount of instrument sorting required, while maximizing the device turns (more productivity from increased throughput capacity).\nMore information about the STERIZONE ® VP4 Sterilizer is available through TSO 3 's website, under the Products section at http://www.tso3.com/en/products/sterizone-vp4/ .\nAbout TSO 3\nFounded in 1998, TSO 3 's activities encompass the sale, production, maintenance, research, development and licensing of sterilization processes, related consumable supplies and accessories for heat-sensitive medical devices. The Company designs products for sterile processing areas in the hospital environment that offer an advantageous replacement solution to other low temperature sterilization processes currently used in hospitals. TSO 3 also offers services related to the maintenance of sterilization equipment and compatibility testing of medical devices with such processes.\nFor more information about TSO 3 , visit the Company's website at www.tso3.com .\nThe statements in this release and oral statements made by representatives of TSO 3 relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, uncertainties and hypotheses, including, but not limited to, the limited history of sales or distribution of the Company, the ability of the Company to obtain the required regulatory clearances to market its products, general business and economic conditions, the condition of the financial markets, the ability of TSO 3 to obtain financing on favourable terms and other risks and uncertainties.
