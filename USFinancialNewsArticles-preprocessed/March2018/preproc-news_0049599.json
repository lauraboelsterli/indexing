    "text": "43 COMMENTS A law firm hired by the family of an Arizona woman who died after being struck by a self-driving Uber Technologies Inc. vehicle said Thursday the issue “has been resolved.”\nThe Uber vehicle, which was in self-driving mode but had a human operator at the wheel, hit 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg while she was walking her bike outside of a crosswalk March 18, Tempe police said. She ultimately died from her injuries.\n“The daughter and the husband of the late Ms. Herzberg have no further comments on this matter as it has been resolved,” Cristina Perez Hesano, an attorney for the Glendale, Ariz.-based Bellah Perez PLLC, said in an email to The Wall Street Journal.\nUber declined to comment.\nThe Tempe, Ariz., police released a video of the fatal accident involving a pedestrian and an Uber self-driving vehicle. We asked experts to analyze the footage and explain what factors may have caused systems to fail. Photo: National Transportation Safety Board The fallout for Uber has expanded beyond Arizona following the fatal accident. Uber has suspended its autonomous car program in the four cities where it was testing it and isn’t going to renew its permit to test those kinds of vehicles in California. \nAdditionally, an Uber executive who worked on technology for autonomous vehicles, Lior Ron, is leaving the company . \nAbout a year ago, shortly after a self-driving Uber vehicle was involved in a crash in Tempe, law firm Bellah Perez wrote on its website the concept of negligence will have to evolve as autonomous vehicles become more prevalent on roadways.\n“As personal injury attorneys, we at Bellah Perez want to ensure any victims of negligence out on the road receive justice for their suffering,” the post said.\nIn the March 2017 accident, Tempe police said the accident wasn’t the Uber vehicle’s fault and that there were also no major injuries.\n—Cara Lombardo contributed to this article\nWrite to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com",
