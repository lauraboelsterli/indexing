    "text": "CHICAGO, March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Berlin Packaging, the leading full-service supplier of glass, plastic, and metal containers and closures, announced today with Bruni Glass the strategic acquisition of H. Erben Ltd., a Hadleigh, England-based supplier of closures, packaging, and packaging equipment with strength in the food and drinks sectors. Erben also brings dedicated operations in South Africa, in California with its California Capsules business, and operates www.TheBottleJarStore.co.uk for convenience quantities.\nBerlin Packaging is a $2.6 billion global supplier of rigid packaging products and services to customers of all types across all sectors. The company has a stronghold in North America, where it has operated since 1898, and also has a European headquarters in Milan, Italy. In 2016, Berlin acquired Bruni Glass , a leading supplier of premium and specialty glass containers and accessories.\nWith the completed Erben acquisition, the combined company has offices spread throughout Europe, including Italy, France, Spain, and now the U.K., to go alongside locations in South Africa, China, and across North America. This acquisition offers many benefits to the customers and suppliers of Berlin Packaging, Bruni Glass, and Erben alike.\nBerlin and Bruni customers now enjoy added product depth and breadth, expanded geographic coverage with the addition of multiple warehouses in the U.K. and South Africa, and an England-based quality lab attuned to helping increase sales and profitability for customers. Erben customers can avail themselves of a much larger European impression, a diverse array of containers (in glass, plastic, and metal) and closures, and Berlin's suite of income-boosting services that are offered at no charge in exchange for new packaging business; these services include Studio One Eleven and Bruni Glass structural and brand design as well as quality consulting.\nSuppliers of packaging also benefit by tapping into the combined company's 200-person sales force. This team, in conjunction with regular marketing efforts, targets every market that uses rigid packaging, including food, beverage, wine and spirits, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical, personal care, household care, and industrial.\n\"Sasha Erben leads an extraordinary company that not only shares our focus on quality, service, and results for customers, but also has a culture that delights in serving and growing powerfully in the marketplace,\" said Andrew Berlin, Chairman and CEO of Berlin Packaging. \"Adding Erben to the Berlin enterprise shows our commitment to acquire the best businesses in the packaging industry along with our proven approach to organic growth.\"\nH. Erben Ltd. has more than six decades worth of experience supplying packaging and machinery to the wine, beer, and spirits markets, and has seen tremendous growth over the past decade under the leadership of Sasha Erben. With 2017 turnover almost quadruple that of levels in 2007, H. Erben Ltd. shipped more than 1 billion units of packaging last year.\n\"H. Erben Ltd. was started by my father in 1951 and is the jewel in my family,\" said Sasha Erben, H. Erben Ltd.'s CEO. \"I am excited about combining our company with Berlin Packaging, as I know together we can accelerate investments in our products, team, and capabilities like never before.\"\n\"Bruni Glass has been a supplier of glass packaging to Erben for years,\" noted Roberto Del Bon, CEO of Bruni Glass. \"This marriage of organizations brings us all together as one family and allows the best flow of ideas, innovations, and talent across our company for the benefit of our employees, customers, and suppliers.\"\nAll employees and locations will be retained, and Erben's leadership, including Sasha Erben, will be continuing on in the same capacity.\nH. Erben Ltd. will now operate as Bruni Erben, a Berlin Packaging Company.\nThe H. Erben Ltd. deal marks Berlin's second acquisition in Europe and eighth overall since 2010.\nAbout Berlin Packaging\nBerlin Packaging is the only Hybrid Packaging SupplierÂ® of glass, plastic, and metal containers and closures.
