(NYSE: EGL) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nCEO Commentary\n\"The financial results for 2017 are reflective of the significant progress that we have made against our key strategic initiatives of driving organic growth, attracting and retaining key talent and strengthening our balance sheet.

Dugle will also continue to serve as Engility's President and CEO.\nKey Fourth Quarter 2017 Contract Awards\nAwarded a position on the Alliant 2 government-wide acquisition contract with the General Services Administration to provide custom information technology services. Under this multi-award contract, which has a $50 billion ceiling value, Engility will support Federal IT systems and modernization efforts by providing key offerings such as systems engineering and integration, cyber, high performance computing and enterprise solutions. Awarded a position on the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense Joint Enterprise Research Development Acquisition and Procurement Omnibus contract. This $8 billion multi-award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity vehicle allows the DOD to obtain research, design, and development services related to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high yield explosives defense systems and equipment.\nFiscal Year 2018 Guidance\nThe table below summarizes the company's fiscal year 2018 guidance.\nFiscal Year 2018 Guidance\nRevenue\n$1.83 billion - $1.91 billion\nGAAP Diluted EPS (1)\n$0.81 - $0.91\nEBITDA\n$160 million - $170 million\nOperating Cash Flow\n$100 million - $110 million\n(1) 2018 GAAP diluted EPS guidance includes approximately $25 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired by the company. It also assumes diluted weighted-average outstanding shares of approximately 38 million and a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 25 percent.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe tables under \"Engility Holdings, Inc. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" present Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"), Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measure. These financial measures are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"Non-GAAP Measures\"). Engility has provided these Non-GAAP Measures to adjust for, among other things, the impact of amortization expenses related to our acquisitions of TASC, Inc. and Dynamics Research Corporation, costs associated with a loss or gain on the disposal or sale of property, plant and equipment, acquisition and restructuring-related expenses, legal and settlement costs, refinancing-related expenses, and the impact of certain tax related items. These items have been adjusted because they are not considered core to the company's business or otherwise not considered operational or because these charges are non-cash or non-recurring. The company presents these Non-GAAP Measures because management believes that they are meaningful to understanding Engility's performance during the periods presented and the company's ongoing business. Non-GAAP Measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and therefore are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled metrics or the financial results of other companies. These Non-GAAP Measures should be considered a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWith respect to our \"Fiscal Year 2018 Guidance\" above, reconciliation of EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts. We are unable to reconcile EBITDA to net income due to our inability to predict certain non-cash items included in net income, including taxes and timing of potential restructuring charges. The disclosure of such reconciliations may imply to our investors a degree of precision in our calculations that is not possible. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nConference Call Information\nEngility will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 1, 2018 (today), to discuss the financial results for its fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nListeners may access a webcast of the live conference call from the Investor Relations section of the company's website at http://www.engility.com .
