    "text": "(Reuters) - Former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez said on Wednesday that she had left Garbine Muguruza’s coaching team following her Spanish compatriot’s exit at the Miami Open in the round of 16.\nMar 9, 2018; Indian Wells, CA, USA; Garbine Muguruza (ESP) during her second round match against Sachia Vickery (not pictured) in the BNP Open at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports Martinez first joined Muguruza’s set-up during the temporary absence of the world number three’s regular coach Sam Sumyk last year and helped the Spaniard win her first Wimbledon crown. Martinez rejoined the twice major winner’s team in February.\n“I want to share the news that my collaboration with Garbine has finished after Miami,” Martinez, a former finalist at the Australian Open and French Open, said on Twitter.\nFILE PHOTO: Spain's new Davis Cup captain Conchita Martinez speaks during a news conference in the auditorium of the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona July 7, 2015.

I wish her and the rest of the team the best for the rest of year,” added Martinez.\nThe 24-year-old Muguruza was beaten by U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens 6-3 6-4 in Miami on Monday.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ",
