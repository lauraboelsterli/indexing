    "text": "SAN DIEGO and SHENZHEN, China, March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Highpower International, Inc. (NASDAQ: HPJ) (\"Highpower\" or the \"Company\"), a developer, manufacturer, and marketer of lithium ion and nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) rechargeable batteries, battery management systems, and a provider of battery recycling, today announced its preliminary unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 is estimated to be in the range of $78.2 to $80.2 million, a 45% to 49% increase from $53.9 million in the same quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 net sales are estimated to be in the range of $243.2 to $245.2 million, a 40% to 41% increase from $173.9 million in the same time period last year. The Company's strong top-line performance in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by growth from Ganzhou Highpower, which experienced an increase in larger volume orders with support from its new largest shareholder. In December 2017, the Company entered into a transaction decreasing its ownership of Ganzhou Highpower so that Highpower is no longer the majority shareholder. Excluding the contribution of Ganzhou Highpower, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 is estimated to be in the range of $62.4 to $63.6 million, an 18% to 20% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 net sales are estimated to be in the range of $214.0 to $217.0 million, a 26% to 28% increase compared to full year 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 gross profit is estimated to be in the range of $10.8 to $12.8 million, or 13.8%-16.0% as a percent of net sales, from $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 gross profit is estimated to be in the $46.4 to $48.4 million range, or 19.1%-19.7% as a percent of full year net sales, compared to $38.1 million in 2016, or an increase of 22% to 27%. Excluding the impact of Ganzhou Highpower, fourth quarter 2017 gross profit is estimated to be in the range of $10.3 to $11.0 million, or 16.5%-17.5% as a percent of net sales. Full year 2017 gross profit is estimated to be in the range of $43.1 to $45.0 million, or 20%-21% as a percent of full year net sales.\nIncome before taxes in the fourth quarter is estimated to be in the $6.7 to $7.5 million range, a 210% to 250% increase from $2.1 million in the same quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 income before taxes is estimated to be in the $21.0 to $22.0 million range, a 190% to 210% increase from $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nMr. George Pan, Chairman and CEO of Highpower International, commented, \"We are pleased to report top-line performance that beats guidance. We continue to make progress with our R&D efforts to strengthen our product offering, improving our production capacity and efficiency, and maintaining an efficient supply chain. We've seen an unprecedented expansion in the number of electrical products available to customers in recent years, not only among public consumers, but also among companies and governments worldwide resulting in a surge in global energy demand and solutions. We are living in a digital age where power is central to the functioning of our homes and jobs. At Highpower, we will continue providing cleaner, safer and more efficient power solutions to meet society's needs.\"\nThe Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, are not finalized until they are filed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
