At December 31, 2017, net asset value (\"NAV\") per share was $13.63, an increase of $0.02 per share from September 30, 2017, and an increase of $0.17 per share from December 31, 2016. The Company also announced that its board of directors declared a first quarter distribution of $0.34 per share, which will be payable on March 29, 2018 to holders of record as of March 15, 2018.\nSelected Financial Highlights\n(in thousands, except per share data) December 31, 2017 Investment Portfolio (1) $ 1,850,872 Total Assets $ 1,928,018 Total Statutory Debt (2) $ 735,275 NAV $ 1,034,975 NAV per Share $ 13.63 Statutory Debt/Equity 0.71x Investment Portfolio Composition December 31, 2017 Percent of Total First Lien $ 693,563 37.5% Second Lien (1) 708,162 38.2% Subordinated 70,257 3.8% Preferred Equity 197,337 10.7% Investment Fund 102,400 5.5% Common Equity and Other (3) 79,153 4.3% Total $ 1,850,872 100.0% (1) Includes collateral for securities purchased under collateralized agreements to resell. (2) Excludes the Company's United States (\"U.S.\") Small Business Administration (\"SBA\")-guaranteed debentures.\n(3) Includes investments held in New Mountain Net Lease Corporation. We believe that the strength of the Company’s unique investment strategy – which focuses on acyclical \"defensive growth\" companies that are well researched by New Mountain Capital, L.L.C. (\"New Mountain\"), a leading alternative investment firm, is underscored by continued stable credit performance. The Company has had only seven portfolio companies, representing approximately $112 million of the cost of all investments made since inception in October 2008, or approximately 2.1% of $5.3 billion, go on non-accrual.\nRobert A. Hamwee, CEO, commented: \"The fourth quarter represented another solid quarter of performance for NMFC. We originated $190 million of investments and once again had no new investments placed on non-accrual. Additionally, over the last twelve months, we are pleased to have maintained a steady portfolio yield while increasing book value.\"\n\"As managers and as significant stockholders personally, we are pleased with the completion of another successful quarter and year,\" added Steven B. Klinsky, NMFC Chairman. \"We have continued to build New Mountain as a firm and team, and now employ over 130 individuals and have substantially added to the team over the past year. We believe New Mountain’s focus on team building and acyclical “defensive growth” industries continues to be a successful strategy.\"\nPortfolio and Investment Activity 1\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s NAV was approximately $1,035.0 million and its portfolio had a fair value of approximately $1,850.9 million in 85 portfolio companies, with a weighted average YTM at Cost 2 of approximately 10.9%. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company made approximately $190.0 million of originations and commitments 3 . The $190.0 million includes approximately $151.3 million of investments in eight new portfolio companies and approximately $38.7 million of follow-on investments in eight portfolio companies held as of September 30, 2017. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $11.8 million of sales 3 and cash repayments 3 of approximately $212.9 million.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nQuarterly Results\nThe Company’s total investment income and total adjusted investment income 4 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $53.3 million and $43.8 million, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s total investment income and total adjusted investment income 4 consisted of approximately $37.4 million 5 and $36.3 million 5 in cash interest income from investments, respectively, approximately $1.8 million and $1.5 million in payment-in-kind (\"PIK\") and non-cash interest income from investments, respectively, prepayment penalties of approximately $1.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, net amortization of purchase premiums/discounts of approximately $2.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, PIK and non-cash dividend income of approximately $6.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and approximately $3.5 million and $3.3 million in other income, respectively.\nThe Company's total net expenses after income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $26.6 million and $20.8 million, respectively. Total net expenses after income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted of approximately $10.2 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of costs associated with the Company's borrowings and approximately $13.8 million and $11.6 million, respectively, in net management and incentive fees. Since the Company's initial public offering (\"IPO\"), the base management fee calculation has deducted the borrowings under the New Mountain Finance SPV Funding, L.L.C. credit facility (the \"SLF Credit Facility\"). The SLF Credit Facility had historically consisted of primarily lower yielding assets at higher advance rates. As part of an amendment to the Company’s existing credit facilities with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the SLF Credit Facility merged with and into the New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. credit facility (the \"Holdings Credit Facility\") on December 18, 2014. Post credit facility merger and to be consistent with the methodology since the IPO, New Mountain Finance Advisers BDC, L.L.C. (the \"Investment Adviser\") will continue to waive management fees on the leverage associated with those assets that share the same underlying yield characteristics with investments that were leveraged under the legacy SLF Credit Facility, which as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled approximately $281.2 million and $297.3 million, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, management fees waived were approximately $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The Investment Adviser cannot recoup management fees that the Investment Advisor has previously waived. The Company’s net direct and indirect professional, administrative, other general and administrative and income tax expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $2.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded approximately $0.1 million and ($18.9) million of net realized gains and adjusted net realized losses, respectively, and $0.5 million and $30.0 million of net changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and adjusted net changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments and securities purchased under collateralized agreements to resell, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, provision for taxes was approximately ($0.4) million and ($0.2) million, respectively, related to differences between the computation of income for United States (\"U.S.\") federal income tax purposes as compared to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\").\nAnnual Results\nThe Company's total investment income and total adjusted investment income 4 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $197.8 million and $168.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s total investment income and total adjusted investment income 4 consisted of approximately $149.7 million 5 and $144.2 million 5 in cash interest income from investments, prepayment penalties of approximately $4.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively, approximately $6.4 million and $4.3 million in PIK and non-cash interest income from investments, respectively, net amortization of purchase premiums/discounts of approximately $9.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, cash dividend income of approximately $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, PIK and non-cash dividend income of approximately $17.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, and approximately $9.6 million and $8.2 million in other income, respectively.\nThe Company's total net expenses after income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $95.6 million and $80.0 million, respectively. Total net expenses after income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted of approximately $37.1 million and $28.4 million, respectively, of costs associated with the Company’s borrowings and approximately $50.4 million and $44.7 million, respectively, in net management and incentive fees. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, management fees waived were approximately $5.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, and incentive fees waived were approximately $1.8 million and $0, respectively. The Company’s net direct and indirect professional, administrative, other general and administrative and income tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $8.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded approximately ($39.7) million in net realized losses and approximately ($16.9) million in adjusted net realized losses, respectively, and $46.8 million of net changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments and securities purchased under collateralized agreements to resell and $40.0 million of adjusted net changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments and securities purchased under collateralized agreements to resell. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, benefit for taxes was approximately $0.1 million and $0.6 million, related to differences between the computation of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as compared to GAAP.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $34.9 million and total statutory debt outstanding of approximately $735.3 million 6 , which consisted of approximately $312.4 million of the $495.0 million of total availability on the Holdings Credit Facility, $122.5 million of the $122.5 million of total availability on the Company’s senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"NMFC Credit Facility\"), $155.4 million 6 of convertible notes outstanding and $145.0 million of unsecured notes outstanding. Additionally, the Company had $150.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nPortfolio and Asset Quality\nThe Company puts its largest emphasis on risk control and credit performance. On a quarterly basis, or more frequently if deemed necessary, the Company formally rates each portfolio investment on a scale of one to four. Each investment is assigned an initial rating of a \"2\" under the assumption that the investment is performing materially in-line with expectations. Any investment performing materially below our expectations would be downgraded from the \"2\" rating to a \"3\" or a \"4\" rating, based on the deterioration of the investment. An investment rating of a \"4\" could be moved to non-accrual status, and the final development could be an actual realization of a loss through a restructuring or impaired sale.\nAs of December 31, 2017, one portfolio company had an investment rating of \"4\". The Company’s investment in this portfolio company had an aggregate cost basis of approximately $0.1 million and an aggregate fair value of approximately $0.4 million.\nRecent Developments\nThe Company had approximately $205.7 million of originations and commitments since the end of the fourth quarter through February 26, 2018. This was offset by approximately $76.3 million of repayments during the same period.\nOn January 25, 2018, the Company entered into a Commitment Increase Agreement (the \"Commitment Agreement\") related to the NMFC Credit Facility. The Commitment Agreement increases the total commitments under the NMFC Credit Facility from $122.5 million to $150.0 million from existing lenders in accordance with the accordion feature of the NMFC Credit Facility.\nOn January 30, 2018, the Company entered into a second supplement (the \"Supplement\") to the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement, dated September 30, 2016 (the \"NPA\"). Pursuant to the Supplement, on January 30, 2018, the Company issued to certain institutional investors identified therein, in a private placement, $90.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.87% Series 2018A Notes due January 30, 2023 (the \"2018A Unsecured Notes\") as an additional series of notes under the NPA. Except as set forth in the Supplement, the 2018A Unsecured Notes have the same terms as the $90.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.313% Notes due May 15, 2021 and the $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 4.76% Series 2017A Notes due July 15, 2022 (collectively, the \"Prior Notes\") that the Company previously issued pursuant to the NPA and the first supplement thereto, respectively. The 2018A Unsecured Notes will rank equal in priority with the Company’s other unsecured indebtedness, including the Prior Notes. Interest on the 2018A Unsecured Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2018.\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company’s board of directors declared a first quarter 2018 distribution of $0.34 per share payable on March 29, 2018 to holders of record as of March 15, 2018.\nOn February 27, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the \"Amendment\") to the NMFC Credit Facility. The Amendment extends the term of the NMFC Credit Facility from the existing maturity date of June 4, 2019 to June 4, 2022. After June 4, 2019, the capacity under the NMFC Credit Facility will be reduced from the existing amount of $150.0 million to $135.0 million.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating its business, NMFC considers and uses adjusted investment income as a measure of its operating performance. Adjusted investment income is defined as investment income adjusted to reflect income as if the cost basis of investments held at NMFC’s IPO date had stepped-up to fair market value as of the IPO date. Under GAAP, NMFC’s IPO did not step-up the cost basis of the predecessor operating company’s existing investments to fair market value. Since the total value of the predecessor operating company’s investments at the time of the IPO was greater than the investments’ cost basis, a larger amount of amortization of purchase or issue discount, and different amounts in realized gains and unrealized appreciation, may be recognized under GAAP in each period than if a step-up had occurred. For purposes of the incentive fee calculation, NMFC adjusts income as if each investment was purchased at the date of the IPO (or stepped-up to fair market value).\nThe term adjusted investment income is not defined under GAAP and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted investment income has limitations as an analytical tool and, when assessing NMFC's operating performance, and that of its portfolio companies, investors should not consider adjusted investment income in isolation, or as a substitute for investment income, or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, adjusted investment income does not reflect NMFC’s, or its portfolio companies’, actual cash expenditures. Other companies may calculate similar measures differently than NMFC, limiting their usefulness as comparative tools.",
