At Tintri he will be able to draw on his deep data center experience to focus our go-to-market approach, cultivate key talent and align the organization around the markets where it leads.”\n“I am excited to join Tintri at such an important stage in its development. Tintri is widely recognized for its visionary technology—now the company needs to execute to expand its footprint with existing customers and land in new accounts,” said Mr. Barton. “I look forward to working with the company to expand our reach.”\nBarton has served in numerous executive roles. He led Rackable Systems from an early stage company to a publicly traded company, reaching over $300 million in annual revenue. More recently he drove rapid growth in revenue at Planet Labs and oversaw all aspects of operations—including the launch of 150 satellites and a strategic partnership with Google for acquisition of its high resolution imaging satellites. Barton has also spent time at Lightspeed Venture Partners, Cygnus Solutions, Red Hat and McKinsey & Co.\nKieran Harty, CTO, co-founder and member of the Board of Directors added, “Tom’s addition to the executive team comes at the right time for the company. We recently took important steps to strengthen our company, including the addition of $25 million in incremental funding and significant reductions to operating expenses. We’ve now got the right foundation and the right leader in place for the company’s next phase.”\nAbout Tintri\nTintri (NASDAQ: TNTR) offers an enterprise cloud infrastructure built on a public-cloud like web services architecture and RESTful APIs.
