(NYSE: BNED) , a leading provider of educational products and services solutions for higher education and K-12 institutions, today reported sales and earnings for the third quarter for fiscal year 2018. The Company has two reportable segments: Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, LLC (“BNC”) and MBS Textbook Exchange, LLC (“MBS”).\nFinancial highlights for the third quarter 2018 and fiscal year to date 2018:\nConsolidated sales of $603.4 million increased 15.7%, as compared to the prior year period; year to date consolidated sales of $1,846.0 million increased 20.5% as compared to the prior year period. Consolidated third quarter GAAP net loss of $(283.2) million, as compared to net income of $3.8 million in the prior year period; year to date GAAP net loss of $(269.6) million, as compared to net income of $5.1 million in the prior year period. The third quarter and year to date net loss includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $313.1 million in the BNC segment. Consolidated third quarter non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings of $19.6 million, as compared to $4.0 million in the prior year period; year to date non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings of $39.8 million, as compared to $7.8 million in the prior year period. Consolidated third quarter non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $34.6 million, an increase of $15.8 million, or 83.7%, as compared to the prior year period; year to date non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $104.6 million, an increase of $51.9 million, or 98.4%, as compared to the prior year period.\nOperational highlights for the third quarter 2018:\nContinued to expand and enhance the Company’s First Day™ inclusive access systems solutions, with adoptions doubling compared to the prior year. Increased BNC e-commerce sales by 5.8% in the quarter, with approximately 68% of online orders picked up in-store. Partnership announced with The Princeton Review to offer its products and services to the Company’s network of more than six million students and through its more than 780 physical bookstores; launched joint landing page for e-commerce sales. Continued to recognize benefits of the synergies and integration of MBS, with $138.9 million of sales in the third quarter and $20.8 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Student Brands continued to increase its number of subscribers, with $5.6 million of sales in the third quarter and $3.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Expanded BNED Courseware offering this spring semester to extend to approximately 16,000 students through 18 courses.\n“We remain focused on strengthening our position as a leading aggregator and distributor of physical and digital educational content, and on developing expanded direct-to-student digital services that we can offer both in and outside our managed stores footprint,” said Michael P. Huseby, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Barnes & Noble Education. “Our acquisitions of MBS and Student Brands, which both performed extremely well in the quarter, as well as our newly expanded digital distribution relationships with leading publishers, are just a few examples of how we are evolving our business model to effectively compete and provide sustainable value to the students, faculty and institutions we serve.”\nThird Quarter 2018 and Year to Date Results\nResults for the 13 and 39 weeks of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 are as follows:\n$ in millions 13 and 39 Weeks Selected Data (unaudited) 13 Weeks\n13 Weeks\n39 Weeks\n39 Weeks\nQ3 2018\nQ3 2017 2018 2017 Total Sales $603.4 $521.6 $1,846.0 $1,531.5 Net (Loss) Income (1) $(283.2) $3.8 $(269.6) $5.1 Non-GAAP (2)\nAdjusted EBITDA $34.6 $18.8 $104.6 $52.7 Adjusted Earnings $19.6 $4.0 $39.8 $7.8 (1) Includes a pre-tax goodwill non-cash impairment charge of $313.1 million at BNC, or $302.9 million after tax on a net tax basis, recorded in the third quarter. (2) These non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled in the attached schedules to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as required under SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Consolidated third quarter sales of $603.4 million increased $81.7 million, or 15.7%, as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily attributable to the contributions from the MBS and Student Brands acquisitions and net new stores opened at BNC, partially offset by the impact from declining comparable store sales at BNC.\nComparable store sales at BNC decreased 6.2% for the quarter representing approximately $31.3 million in revenue. Consistent with prior years, the Spring Rush period extended beyond the quarter due to later school openings and the continued pattern of students buying course materials later in the semester. Factoring in the month of February, comparable store sales at BNC decreased 4.2% on a year to date basis.\nIn the third quarter, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test required by GAAP, and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill at BNC exceeded its estimated fair value, due to the reduction in BNED’s market capitalization. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill non-cash impairment charge of $313.1 million at BNC or $302.9 million on a net tax basis.\nThird quarter net loss was $(283.2) million, or $(6.04) per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the prior year period. The current year’s fiscal quarter has 46.9 million diluted shares outstanding, while the prior year period had 46.8 million diluted shares outstanding. The Company reported non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings of $19.6 million during the quarter, compared with $4.0 million in the prior year period.\nThe Company’s Adjusted EBITDA was $34.6 million for the quarter, as compared to $18.8 million in the prior year period, an increase due primarily to the contributions from the MBS and Student Brands acquisitions of $20.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, partially offset by the Adjusted EBITDA impact from lower comparable store sales at BNC.\nAs a result of the acquisition of MBS on February 27, 2017 and the acquisition of Student Brands on August 3, 2017, the condensed consolidated financial statements for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended January 27, 2018 include the financial results of MBS for the entire year and Student Brands from the acquisition date. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended January 28, 2017 do not include any financial results of MBS and Student Brands.\nOutlook\nFor fiscal year 2018, the Company continues to expect sales at BNC to be relatively flat, while BNC comparable store sales are now projected to decline in the mid-single digit percentage point range year over year. The Company continues to expect consolidated sales to be in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion before intercompany eliminations. The Company is raising its consolidated Adjusted EBITDA guidance, and now expects to achieve consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $115 million to $125 million for fiscal year 2018, up from the previous range of $105 million to $120 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $45 million (down from prior guidance of $50 million), which represents an increase from fiscal 2017 due to new store growth at BNC.\nConference Call\nA conference call with Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. senior management will be webcast at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 1, 2018 and can be accessed at the Barnes & Noble Education corporate website at www.bned.com .\nBarnes & Noble Education expects to report fiscal 2018 fourth quarter results on or about June 26, 2018.\nABOUT BARNES & NOBLE EDUCATION, INC.\nBarnes & Noble Education, Inc.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information - Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA\nTo supplement the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), in the Press Release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Earnings (defined as Net Income adjusted for certain reconciling items) and Adjusted EBITDA (defined by the Company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for additional items subtracted from or added to net income).\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as substitutes for and should not be considered superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company's use of these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly named measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of the Company's performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company's management reviews these Non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures to evaluate the Company's performance and manage the Company's operations. The Company's management believes that these measures are useful performance measures which are used by the Company to facilitate a comparison of on-going operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period. The Company's management believes that these Non-GAAP financial measures provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business than measures under GAAP can provide alone, as it excludes certain items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of its operations. The Company's Board of Directors and management also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance, for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a measure for performance incentive plans. The Company's management believes that the inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings results provides investors useful and important information regarding the Company's operating results.\nThe non-GAAP measures included in the Press Release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 has been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures as required under Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. All of the items included in the reconciliations below are either (i) non-cash items or (ii) items that management does not consider in assessing the Company's on-going operating performance. The Company urges investors to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of the Company’s Form 10-K dated April 29, 2017 filed with the SEC on July 12, 2017, which includes consolidated financial statements for each of the three years for the period ended April 29, 2017 (Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016, and Fiscal 2015), the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 29, 2017 filed with the SEC on August 30, 2017 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended October 28, 2017 filed with the SEC on December 5, 2017.\nBARNES & NOBLE EDUCATION, INC.
