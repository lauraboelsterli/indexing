    "text": "HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. and ALBANY, N.Y., March 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CDK Global (Nasdaq:CDK) and Auto/Mate Dealership Systems have jointly agreed to terminate the previously announced acquisition of Auto/Mate by CDK. The planned transaction, announced on May 24, 2017, was subject to regulatory review and other customary closing requirements. Under the terms of the original agreement, there is no termination fee.\nThe Federal Trade Commission had notified the parties of its opposition to the proposed acquisition, leading to the decision to terminate. Both companies expressed disappointment at not being able to complete the transaction in a timely fashion, citing the desire, in the face of regulatory resistance, to redirect their resources and attention to their businesses. The companies intend to focus on delivering value to their respective customers in a competitive marketplace.\nAbout CDK Global\nWith more than $2 billion in revenues, CDK Global (Nasdaq:CDK) is a leading global provider of integrated information technology and digital marketing solutions to the automotive retail and adjacent industries.
