During his decade-long oversight of sports, The Star was among the most honored sports sections in America. He later rose to Managing Editor and became Editor and Vice President. In more than two decades at The Star he has won many national and regional awards, and most recently, the Scripps Howard Award in the First Amendment category.\nThe company also announced that Lauren Gustus , Regional Editor for McClatchy's West Region, will now also oversee its four newsrooms in Washington State including The News Tribune in Tacoma; The Olympian in Olympia; The Bellingham Herald and the Tri-City Herald in Kennewick, in addition to The Sacramento Bee, The Fresno Bee, The Modesto Bee, The Merced Sun-Star, The Tribune in San Luis Obispo, Calif., and The Idaho Statesman in Boise.\nThis completes the company's new regional structure for news as part of its program of newsroom reinvention: Robyn Tomlin , Regional Editor of the Carolinas, Lauren Gustus Regional Editor of the West, Kristin Roberts , Regional Editor of the East and Mike Fannin , Regional Editor of the Midwest. The regional editors are charged with accelerating digital growth and ensuring their newsrooms deliver what readers need in a fast-changing news environment.\n\"The vision, ambition and creativity of these four industry-leading regional editors means McClatchy is well-positioned to report and deliver journalism that is essential in the communities we serve, and increasingly impactful around the nation,'' said Craig Forman, McClatchy's President & CEO. ''Individually and collectively, Robyn, Kristin, Lauren and Mike are accelerating our transition as a digital-DNA news media business,\" said Craig Forman.\nThe company also named Steve Coffman as Editor of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Before arriving at The Eagle, Steve was editor of The Jackson (Tenn.) Sun for 10 years and worked prior to that in leadership roles at The Fayetteville (N.C.) Observer and The Finger Lakes Times in Geneva, N.Y., where he began his career as a reporter.\nAbout McClatchy\nMcClatchy operates 30 media companies in 14 states, providing each of its communities with high-quality news and advertising services in a wide array of digital and print formats.
