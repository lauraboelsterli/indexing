Soccer Football - International Friendly - Netherlands vs England - Johan Cruijff Arena, Amsterdam, Netherlands - March 23, 2018 England’s Joe Gomez with England manager Gareth Southgate as he goes off injured Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley \nGomez suffered ankle ligament damage on international duty with England last Friday, limping off early in the friendly against the Netherlands in Amsterdam. \nThe 20-year-old right back will miss the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Manchester City at Anfield next week. \n“It’s serious enough to leave him out for a couple of games but not until the rest of the season,” Klopp told reporters on Friday. \n“It’s difficult to give a time schedule but we hope that he’s back in training in three to four weeks.” \nCan pulled out of the Germany squad for friendlies against Spain and Brazil as he recovers from the back injury he suffered in Liverpool’s 5-0 league win over Watford this month. Soccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool vs Watford - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - March 17, 2018 Liverpool's Emre Can with Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp as he goes off injured REUTERS/Phil Noble \nDefender Nathaniel Clyne is fit again after back surgery and could make his first appearance of the season against Roy Hodgson’s side. \nKlopp does not expect an easy match against 16th-placed Palace, who are two points above the relegation zone. \n“It will be difficult for sure... they fight (to stay in) the league and we fight for the Champions League,” the German said. \n“They’ve had key players out - if they had constantly been together on the pitch they would be in another position in the table... they’re not a typical team. They’re in good shape. Roy is doing a fantastic job.” \nA win would improve Liverpool’s chances of finishing in the top four as they look to qualify for next season’s Champions League. They are third in the table with 63 points. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond",
