Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage and the founder of Fishing for Leave, Aaron Brown, symbolically dump fish into the River Thames next to the Houses of Parliament, to highlight what is says will be a detrimental effect a delay in leaving the Common Fisheries Policy will have on the British fishing industry, in central London, Britain March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville As part of the transition deal announced on Monday, Britain agreed to remain within the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) for around 20 months after Britain’s exit on March 29, 2019. In Scotland, home to Britain’s richest fishing grounds, lawmakers from May’s Conservative Party have pledged they will not back a final Brexit deal unless Britain leaves the Common Fisheries Policy altogether. Slideshow (3 Images) Fishermen blame the CFP for policies which they say will render their industry bankrupt, and will stage their protest on the river directly opposite the Westminster parliament. “The CFP forces British fishermen to discard half the fish they catch -the approximate equivalent of 1 billion fish portions. They then have to catch and kill more just to find the “right” species their quota allows them to keep,” said Alan Hastings of Fishing for Leave. “Brexit would have allowed a change to new UK policy of limiting time at sea in return for landing all catches, so vessels catch less but land more, allowing a bright future for fish, fishermen and coastal communities.” Reporting by William James, Writing by Elisabeth O'Leary; editing by Guy Faulconbridge",
