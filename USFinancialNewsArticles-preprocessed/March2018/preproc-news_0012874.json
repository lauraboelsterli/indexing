(OTCQB:BRFH), a manufacturer of frozen, ready-to-blend beverages, today announced that it has signed a national foodservice account with over 1,000 locations throughout the United States. The planned rollout will begin in April 2018. This national customer will be adding Barfresh’s dairy and non-dairy smoothie options to their menus.\nBased upon initial test results and customer planning for the rollout, Barfresh is expecting annualized revenues of over $4 million. Barfresh expects to add additional locations throughout the year.\n\"This is a major milestone for Barfresh.

These capabilities of our company are integral in satisfying this customer’s operational requirements. Our progression with other major national accounts continues and we intend to use this rollout as an additional milestone to validate our product’s solution and convert the other national account prospects that we have been cultivating.”\nAbout Barfresh Food Group\nBarfresh Food Group, Inc.
