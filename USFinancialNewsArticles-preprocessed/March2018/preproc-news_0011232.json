Data last week showed euro zone inflation slowed to a 14-month low at 1.2 percent, and a key market gauge of long-term expectations on Monday dipped below 1.70 percent to its lowest level this year.\nMost bond yields across bloc were up 1-2 basis points.\nGermany’s benchmark 10-year Bund yield was up 2 bps at 0.65 percent, pushing away from five-week lows hit on Monday at around 0.60 percent.\nInvestor worries about an imminent trade war eased as U.S. President Donald Trump faced growing pressure from political allies to pull back from proposed steel and aluminium tariffs. That boosted stock markets and dented demand for fixed income.\nItaly’s 10-year bond yield was steady at around 2.08 percent , allowing the gap over German peers to narrow to 143 bps after a brief, sharp widening following Sunday’s election.\nAnalysts have been surprised by the relatively subdued bond market reaction to the ballot, predicting uncertainty about the make-up of the next government would likely weigh on Italian bonds in the coming weeks.\n“All else equal, the risk of a populist government has increased compared with before the weekend so I would have expected much more weakness in peripheral spreads,” said ABN AMRO senior fixed income strategist Kim Liu.\n“I would actually expect that weakness in coming days and weeks as developments unfold.” (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; editing by John Stonestreet)\n ",
