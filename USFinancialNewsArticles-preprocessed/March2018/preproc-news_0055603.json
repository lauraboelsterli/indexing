SWK is in various stages of due diligence on additional financing opportunities.”\nConference Call Information\nSWK will host a conference call Monday, April 2nd at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, to provide an update on the Company. The call will also provide a summary of fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. Investors and the general public are invited to listen to the call by dialing (877) 876-9176 (domestic) or (785) 424-1667 (international) five minutes prior to the start of the call and providing the passcode SWK Holdings. A playback of the call will be available for 7 days after the live event. To access the playback, please dial (844) 488-7474 (domestic) or (862) 902-0129 (international) and enter passcode 32918113.\nNote:\n• All references to growth rate percentages and shares compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period.\n• The Company reports its financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing the Company’s ongoing performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted net income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted basic and diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP net income and its components and basic and diluted EPS. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that these are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP Adjusted net income and its components (unlike GAAP net income and its components) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies.\nPortfolio Overview\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's total income producing assets were $153.9 million as compared to $132.2 million as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Finance receivables $ 151,995 $ 126,366 Marketable investments 1,856 2,621 Investment in unconsolidated entity — 6,985 Less non-controlling interest — (3,756 ) Total income producing assets 153,851 132,216 Warrant Assets 987 1,013 Total Portfolio Balance, Excluding Non-Controlling Interest $ 154,838 $ 133,229 During 2017, SWK deployed $25.8 million into three new term loan financings, including a term loan to support the merger of Hooper Holmes and Provant Health. In addition to the new term loan financings, SWK supported existing portfolio companies' working capital needs through an aggregate $16.7 million of add-on fundings.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the weighted average projected effective yield of the finance receivables portfolio was 17.6%. The increase in the effective yield from the third quarter of 2017 was driven primarily by the strong performance of the Narcan® royalty asset in connection with the product achieving several sales-based milestones in 2017. The projected effective yield is the rate at which income is expected to be recognized pursuant to the Company’s revenue recognition policies, if all payments are received pursuant to the terms of the finance receivables.\nAs of March 29, 2018, the Company and its partners have executed transactions with 28 different parties under its specialty finance strategy, funding an aggregate $404 million since 2012 in various financial products across the life science sector.\nTotal portfolio investment activity as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Beginning portfolio $ 136,985 $ 114,520 Early pay-offs — (35,362 ) Impairment expense and provision for loan credit losses (8,509 ) (9,598 ) Interest paid-in-kind 1,779 398 Investment in finance receivables 37,432 75,009 Loan discount amortization and fee accretion (1) 1,273 3,104 Changes in unconsolidated entity investment (2) (6,985 ) (1,003 ) Net unrealized (loss) gain on marketable investments and derivatives (913 ) 36 Principal payments received on investments (2,734 ) (8,565 ) Proceeds/realized gains on sale of investments, net (101 ) (1,010 ) Royalty paydowns (4,577 ) (544 ) Warrant investments, net of cancellations 1,188 — Ending portfolio $ 154,838 $ 136,985 (1) Includes interest income in excess of cash received and non-cash origination fees (2) Includes non-controlling interest Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nAs of December 31, 2017, SWK had equity positions in two companies with a fair value of $1.3 million and warrant positions in three public companies with a fair value of $1.0 million. SWK carries its warrants in private companies at zero value.\nRevenues\nWe generated revenues of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, driven primarily by $26.9 million in interest and fees earned on our finance receivables and marketable securities, and $10.5 million in income related to our investment in an unconsolidated entity. We generated revenues of $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, driven primarily by $15.8 million in interest and fees earned on finance receivables and marketable securities, and $6.2 million in income related to our investment in an unconsolidated entity.\nThe increase in revenue during 2017 is primarily due to a $16.8 million increase in interest and fees earned on new and existing finance receivables, including an $8.7 million increase in royalty revenue from our Narcan® investment, as actual sales exceeded our forecasts. In addition, $4.3 million was due to an increase in income from our investment in an unconsolidated entity, which on February 23, 2017 sold its U.S. marketing rights to its underlying intellectual property (please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2017 10-K for further information on the Holmdel transaction). This was partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease in interest and fees earned on finance receivables that were paid off in 2016.\nProvision for Loan Credit Losses and Impairment Expense\nWe did not recognize any credit loss provision expense during the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2016, we recognized loan credit loss provision expense of $1.7 million related to the Besivance royalty purchase, which was due to substantial increase in gross sales to net sales deductions and lower sales volumes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized impairment expense of $7.6 million related to the ABT second lien finance receivable and security impairment expense of $0.9 million in connection with a secured royalty financing of a women’s health product due to continued disappointing sales. The debt security is reflected at its fair market value of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized aggregate debt impairment expense and a write-off of interest receivable of $1.4 million in connection with a secured royalty financing of a women’s health product due to continued disappointing sales and $1.4 million of equity security impairment expense for the continued stock price decline of our position in the public equity of Cancer Genetics. We also recognized $5.3 million of impairment expense related to the sale of our SynCardia assets during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPlease refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2017 10-K for further information regarding the impairments taken during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, stock-based compensation and related costs for management, staff, Board of Directors, legal and audit expenses, and corporate governance. General and administrative expenses increased to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily due to an increase in the performance-based bonus accrual.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflected a net fair market value loss of $(1.1) million on our warrant derivatives, offset by a $0.2 million gain on the sale of available-for-sale equity securities. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflected a net fair market value gain of $0.6 million on our warrant derivatives.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nBased on the Company's historical and expected future operating performance, the Company has concluded that it was more likely than not that the Company would not be able to realize the full benefit of the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets in the future. The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $63.7 million and $109.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize approximately $22.7 million benefit of the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets in the future. The $55.8 million decrease in the Company's cumulative gross deferred tax assets was caused by the change in statutory tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts Jobs Act (“TCJA”) signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had Net Operating Losses (“NOLs”) for federal income tax purposes of $376.0 million. The federal NOL carryforwards, if not offset against future income, will expire by 2032, with the majority expiring by 2021. We also had federal research credit carryforwards of $2.7 million. The federal research credits will expire by 2029.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $30.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $32.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the net decrease in our cash balance was new and add-on investment funding of $37.4 million, offset by interest and fees of $26.9 million earned on our finance receivables, including $11.8 million of royalty revenue from our Narcan® investment, and net proceeds of $8.6 million received related to our investment in an unconsolidated entity.\nPrimary Driver of Cash Flow\nOur ability to generate cash in the future depends primarily upon our success in implementing our business model of generating income by providing capital to a broad range of life science companies, institutions and inventors. We generate income primarily from three sources:\n1. primarily owning or financing through debt investments, royalties generated by the sales of life science products and related intellectual property;\n2. receiving interest and other income by advancing capital in the form of secured debt to companies in the life science sector; and,\n3. to a lesser extent, realize capital appreciation from equity-related investments in the life science sector.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our portfolio contains $152.0 million of finance receivables and $1.9 million of marketable investments. We expect these assets to generate positive cash flows in 2018. We continue to evaluate multiple attractive opportunities that, if consummated, we believe would similarly generate additional income. Since the timing of any investment is difficult to predict, we may not be able to generate positive cash flow above what our existing assets will produce in 2018.\nWe intend to borrow funds to make investments to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities. We currently do not have access to a credit facility or other forms of borrowing, though we executed a non-binding term sheet with a potential lender on November 7, 2017, which we are continuing to negotiate. The timing of obtaining such a credit facility is uncertain and is largely dependent upon finalizing terms and conditions acceptable to us.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\nThe net (loss) attributable to SWK Stockholders in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was ($8.4) million, or ($0.64) per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to SWK Stockholders for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share\nNet income attributable to SWK Stockholders in accordance with GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $3.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to SWK Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $19.9 million, or $1.53 per diluted share.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of SWK’s reported (GAAP) income before provision for income tax to SWK’s adjusted net income attributable to SWK Holdings Corporation stockholders (Non-GAAP) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Adjusted net income eliminates provisions for income taxes and non-cash mark-to-market changes on warrant assets and SWK’s warrant liability.\n(in thousands, except per share data) Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Consolidated net income $ 8,251 $ 32,041 Plus: income tax expense (benefit) 15,753 (21,638 ) Plus: loss (gain) on fair market value of warrants 1,115 (588 ) Plus: gain on realized value of warrants — — Adjusted income before provision for income tax 25,119 9,815 Adjusted provision for income tax — — Non-GAAP consolidated net income 25,119 9,815 Less: Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to non-controlling interest 5,204 3,153 Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to SWK Holdings Corporation Stockholders $ 19,915 $ 6,662 Non-GAAP adjusted basic income per share $ 1.53 $ 0.51 Non-GAAP adjusted diluted income per share $ 1.53 $ 0.51 Weighted average shares - Basic 13,036 13,015\nWeighted average shares - Diluted 13,040 13,018\nNote:\n• The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing the Company’s ongoing performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.\n• Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and Non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted income (loss) per share are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP net income and its components and basic and diluted income (loss). Management believes the non-GAAP adjusted net income is an important metric, as it provides a clear representation of SWK’s core specialty finance business while removing one-time items and the fair market value change of warrants, which have no impact on SWK’s expected interest, fee, or principal collection. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that these are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies.\nAbout SWK Holdings Corporation\nSWK Holdings Corporation is a specialized finance company with a focus on the global healthcare sector.
