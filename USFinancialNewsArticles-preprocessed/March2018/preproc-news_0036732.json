The volume traded was 13.99 billion as of the last full trading day. ** As of 04:03 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 25.20 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day moving average and below its 200-day moving average. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 14.98 as of the last full trading day, while the dividend yield was 2 percent. ** In Hong Kong, the sub-index of the Hang Seng index tracking energy shares rose 2.7 percent, while the IT sector gained 1.4 percent. The top gainer on Hang Seng was China Resources Land Ltd up 7.71 percent, while the biggest loser was Wharf Real Estate Investment Company Ltd which was down 1.94 percent.
