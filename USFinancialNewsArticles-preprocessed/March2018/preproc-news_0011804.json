He is also expected to turn into a running joke last year’s embarrassing best picture envelope mix-up that saw musical“La La Land” being declared winner instead of“Moonlight.”\nNo such suspense surrounds the main acting races, where Frances McDormand is heavily favored to win for her turn as an angry, grieving mother in“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” and British actor Gary Oldman’s performance as wartime leader Winston Churchill in“Darkest Hour” is widely expected to bring his first Oscar.\nIn the supporting actor categories, odds are on Allison Janney for“I, Tonya,” and Sam Rockwell for“Three Billboards” after they swept previous awards.\nAs for best picture,“anything can happen there as we have learned year after year when voters have given us upset after upset,” O’Neil said.\nThe Academy Awards will be televised live on ABC starting at 8 p.m. EST/5 p.m. PST (0100 GMT on Monday).
