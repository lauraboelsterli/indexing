    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:CDTX), a biotechnology company developing novel anti-infectives including immunotherapies, today announced the appointment of Chrysa Mineo to the company’s board of directors. Ms. Mineo’s appointment increases the size of the Cidara board of directors to seven.\nMs. Mineo has more than 25 years of operational experience in biopharmaceutical drug development, with strategic leadership roles at leading public biotechnology companies, including 19 years with San Diego-based Receptos and Neurocrine Biosciences.\n“Chrysa brings to Cidara a wealth of experience and a track record of success in the biopharmaceutical industry,” said Jeffrey Stein, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Cidara. “In particular, we expect that her operational business development experience will be of tremendous value as we approach proof-of-concept clinical data for rezafungin and key preclinical data for our Cloudbreak ADC program.”\nFrom 2009 to 2015, Ms. Mineo led corporate development at Receptos, Inc., where strategic partnering efforts for the Phase 3 immunology candidate ozanimod resulted in the company’s acquisition by Celgene. During her tenure she played a key role in the Receptos initial public offering (IPO) and established product and technology collaborations with AbbVie, Ono, Eli Lilly and Janssen. Prior to Receptos, Ms. Mineo held roles of increasing business development responsibility at Neurocrine Biosciences from 1997 to 2009, where she led or played a primary role in negotiating and closing more than 25 transactions, including worldwide or regional product candidate collaborations from Phase 1 to registration and product in-licensing transactions. Prior to Neurocrine, Ms. Mineo served in various capacities in research, marketing and business development for such companies as Amgen, DNAX Research Institute, Schering Plough and Baxter Biotech. Ms. Mineo holds a B.S. in Zoology from the University of California, Davis and an M.B.A. from Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business.\n“Improved pharmacokinetic properties position rezafungin to significantly contribute to the armamentarium of anti-fungal therapy,” said Ms. Mineo. “In particular, the planned upcoming Phase 3 prophylactic trial of once-weekly rezafungin in allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) has the potential to decrease rates of invasive fungal infections (IFI), which remain a leading cause of infection-related mortality in patients with hematological and oncological disorders. I look forward to working with Cidara’s outstanding Board and management team to advance this improved echinocandin and further explore novel anti-microbial candidates resulting from the Cloudbreak™ Immunotherapy Discovery Platform.”\nAbout Cidara Therapeutics\nCidara is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing new anti-infectives that have the potential to transform the standard of care and save or improve patients’ lives. The company is currently advancing its novel echinocandin antifungal, rezafungin acetate, formerly called CD101 IV, through Phase 2 and developing its antibody-drug conjugates for the treatment of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. Rezafungin has improved pharmacokinetics compared to existing echinocandins and has the potential for expanded utility across patient settings. Rezafungin is the only once-weekly product candidate in development for the treatment and prevention of life-threatening invasive fungal infections. Cidara is developing its antibody-drug conjugates as part of its novel Cloudbreak™ platform, the first immunotherapy discovery platform designed specifically to create compounds that directly kill pathogens and also direct a patient’s immune cells to attack and eliminate bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens. Cidara is headquartered in San Diego, California.
