    "text": "According to Utah Governor Gary Herbert, Limpert \"brings the kind of experience and vision needed to help an innovative product not just gain a foothold within a competitive industry, but also to dramatically increase its market share.”\nSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FireFly Automatix CEO Andrew Limpert is one of Utah Business' 2018 CEOs of the Year. At a luncheon this month, the magazine honored Limpert in the small business category, touting his experience turning the once-struggling robotic-focused ag equipment manufacturing company into an industry leader and the fastest growing company in Utah two years in a row. Watch Utah Business' video about Limpert at https://utahbusiness.com/andrew-limpert-ceo-of-the-year/ .\nSince Limpert joined FireFly in 2015, the company has increased revenue from $2.2 million in 2014 to over $15 million in 2017; won a 2017 Stoel Rives Utah Innovation Award for its automated turf harvester; opened new service locations in Florida and Alabama; improved the manufacturing of its turf harvesters from 4-6 weeks each to about four days; and expanded its product line to include an automated turf mower designed to cut costs per acres mowed.\n\"Andrew brings the kind of experience and vision needed to help an innovative product not just gain a foothold within a competitive industry, but also to dramatically increase its market share,\" said Utah Gov. Gary Herbert in Utah Business' March issue .\nOver his 20+ year career in business, Limpert has demonstrated convincing patterns of growth execution, helping both public and private entities redefine their paths for success. Prior to joining FireFly, he spent eight years as the chief financial officer at Profile Energy, where he earned a Utah Business CFO of the Year award, with Profire Energy CEO Brent Hatch calling him the \"driving force in building our business and defining our future.\" He's also founded, funded and consulted with numerous other successful businesses, both private and public.\nMatt Aposhian, FireFly's president and chief operating officer, attributed the company's success in large part to Limpert's ability to build people up – employees and counterparts alike. \"I'd call him the Michael Jordan of this business,\" he said. \"He is fantastic in his own abilities, but he doesn't just pat his own back. He’s not just a charismatic leader. He makes everyone around him better – and has made the company better. We definitely wouldn't be where we are without him.\"\nAbout FireFly Automatix, Inc.:\nFireFly Automatix, Inc. is bringing key, advanced technologies to the agricultural industry.
