Over the course of the year, we saw consistent, sustained improvement in sales trends which culminated in a 6.3% increase in our fourth quarter comp sales. We improved our merchandise margins through strong inventory management and improved promotional and permanent markdowns. All areas effectively managed their expenses. And, we ended the year with 7% less inventory. I am very proud of our team and the role they played in these results and want to thank them for their hard work, loyalty and dedication.”\nImpact of 53rd Week\nThe retail calendar for fiscal January 2018 included a fifth week, resulting in a 14-week fiscal fourth quarter and a 53-week year. During this 53 rd week, total sales were approximately $170 million; selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $30 million; and interest was approximately $3 million. The 53 rd week increased the Company’s net income by approximately $15 million and its diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.10 for the year.\nDividend\nOn February 28, 2018, Kohl's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.61 per share, an 11% increase over its prior dividend.
