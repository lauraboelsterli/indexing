    "text": "ARLINGTON, Va., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rosetta Stone Inc. (NYSE:RST), a world leader in technology-based learning solutions, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year Revenue in the fourth quarter 2017 totaled $44.8 million, down 13% from $51.7 million in the year-ago period. Fourth quarter 2017 net income totaled $2.4 million, compared to the net loss of $5.6 million in the year-ago period. Earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2017 totaled $0.10, compared to $(0.25) per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Overview\nRevenue at Lexia Learning (\"Lexia\"), the Company's Literacy segment, increased 23% year-over-year to a record high $12.0 million. Total operating expenses decreased $6.7 million or 15% year-over-year to $38.8 million, representing the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year expense reductions. Total operating expenses in the year-ago period included $1.6 million of lease termination costs. Net income in the fourth quarter 2017 improved year-over-year to $2.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.6 million or $(0.25) per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2016. Included in the fourth quarter 2017 net income was a one-time, non-cash $5.5 million tax benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the fourth quarter 2016 net loss included lease termination costs totaling $1.6 million. Fourth quarter 2017 pre-tax income before prior-year lease termination costs improved 9% year-over-year. Cash and cash equivalents increased sequentially to $43.0 million at December 31, 2017, with zero debt outstanding.\n“The fourth quarter and full year 2017 results represent the continuation of an improving trend at Rosetta Stone, reflecting strong growth at Lexia, the near completion of our transition to a 100%-subscription model in our Consumer Language segment, and continued expense reductions,” said John Hass, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Over the past three years, we have done the hard work and made the appropriate investments to position all of our businesses for sales growth in 2018. Sales growth, which as we approach a near 100% subscription-based business, should be more stable and predictable than in the past.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Review\nRevenue : Total revenue was down 13% year-over-year to $44.8 million, reflecting a decline of $10.2 million or 84% in product revenue, which was only partially offset by an increase of $3.3 million or 8% in subscription and service revenue. The decline in product revenue was attributable to the ongoing SaaS migration in Consumer Language. The increase in subscription and service revenue reflects continuing double-digit growth at Lexia and increases in the number of new subscribers and total subscribers in Consumer Language.\nRevenue at Lexia increased 23% year-over-year to $12.0 million in the fourth quarter 2017. Adjusting for the impact of purchase accounting, Lexia's revenue would have been $12.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $10.5 million in the year-ago period, and Lexia's pro forma growth rate would have been 17% year-over-year. Lexia's sustained revenue growth reflects strong demand for its Core5 literacy curriculum product, high retention rates, and increased effectiveness of the Company's direct sales force. In January 2018, Lexia PowerUp Literacy TM , the newest addition to Lexia's portfolio of literacy and assessment solutions, was launched. PowerUp is a literacy curriculum solution developed specifically for non-proficient readers in grades 6 through 12.\nEnterprise & Education (\"E&E\") Language segment revenue decreased 16% year-over-year to $15.0 million in the fourth quarter 2017. The decline included the Company's decision to exit a direct sales and marketing presence in several countries, including China, Brazil and France, as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan. In addition, a large multi-year sale in the fourth quarter 2016 was not eligible for renewal in the current quarter.\nConsumer Language segment revenue declined 26% year-over-year to $17.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017, primarily reflecting the strategic shift toward a 100% SaaS-based revenue model in the Company's direct-to-consumer (\"DTC\") channels, which was substantially complete at year-end. In addition, the shift toward a 100% SaaS-based revenue model and movement to consignment distribution in the Company's retail channel contributed to lower revenue as retailers managed down their inventories ahead of both transitions, which are expected to be complete in 2018. The number of paying Consumer Language subscribers in the fourth quarter 2017 increased 16% year-over-year to approximately 370,000 at December 31, 2017.\nUS$ thousands, except for percentages\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Mix % 2016 Mix % % change Revenue from: Literacy $ 12,040 27 % $ 9,810 19 % 23 % E&E Language 14,978 33 % 17,926 35 % (16 )% Consumer Language 17,771 40 % 23,942 46 % (26 )% Total Revenue $ 44,789 100 % $ 51,678 100 % (13 )% Net Income (Loss) : The fourth quarter 2017 net income improved year-over-year to $2.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.6 million or $(0.25) per diluted share in the year-ago period. Included in the fourth quarter 2017 net income was a one-time, non-cash $5.5 million tax benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the fourth quarter 2016 net loss included lease termination costs totaling $1.6 million.\nTotal operating expenses decreased $6.7 million or 15% year-over-year to $38.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017, reflecting the Company's 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year expense reductions. Excluding the $1.6 million in lease termination costs included in the fourth quarter 2016, total selling, administrative and research expenses decreased $5.1 million or 12% year-over-year, reflecting reductions of $2.8 million or 10% in sales and marketing expense, $1.2 million or 13% in general and administrative expense, and $1.0 million or 15% in research and development expense. Lower media spend contributed to a $3.0 million year-over-year reduction in advertising costs in the fourth quarter.\nFull Year 2017 Review\nRevenue : Full year 2017 revenue totaled $184.6 million, down 5% from $194.1 million in 2016, reflecting an increase of $14.1 million or 9% in subscription and service revenue, which was more than offset by a decline of $23.6 million or 59% in product revenue. The decline in product revenue reflects the ongoing SaaS migration in Consumer Language. The increase in subscription and service revenue reflects strong growth at Lexia and increases in the number of new subscribers and total subscribers in Consumer Language.\nRevenue at Lexia totaled $43.6 million in 2017, up 28% from $34.1 million in 2016. Adjusting for the impact of purchase accounting, Lexia's revenue would have been $45.4 million in 2017 compared to $38.4 million a year ago, and Lexia's pro forma growth rate would have been 18% year-over-year.\nRevenue in the E&E Language segment totaled $65.3 million in 2017, down 9% compared to $72.1 million in 2016. Nearly half of the reduction was driven by the restructuring of the E&E Language segment, initiated in March 2016, which had the effect of exiting the Enterprise segment's direct sales and marketing presence in several countries, including China, Brazil and France. E&E Language segment revenue, before the countries that were exited, decreased 6%.\nConsumer Language segment revenue was down 14% to $75.7 million in 2017, compared to $87.9 million in 2016, largely reflecting the Company's progress toward a 100% SaaS-based revenue model in the direct-to-consumer (\"DTC\") channels, which was substantially complete at year-end. The shift toward a 100% SaaS-based revenue model and movement to consignment distribution in the Company's retail channel contributed to lower revenue as retailers managed down their inventories ahead of both transitions, which are expected to be complete in 2018.\nUS$ thousands, except for percentages\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Mix % 2016 Mix % % change Revenue from: Literacy $ 43,608 24 % $ 34,123 18 % 28 % E&E Language 65,267 35 % 72,083 37 % (9 )% Consumer Language 75,718 41 % 87,883 45 % (14 )% Total Revenue $ 184,593 100 % $ 194,089 100 % (5 )% Net Loss : Full year 2017 net loss totaled $1.5 million, an improvement of $26.0 million or 94% compared to the net loss of $27.6 million in 2016. Loss per diluted share in 2017 totaled $(0.07), an improvement of $1.18 or 94% compared to $(1.25) per diluted share in 2016. Included in the 2017 net loss was a one-time, non-cash $5.5 million tax benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the 2016 net loss included (pre-tax) impairment charges of $3.9 million and lease termination costs of $1.6 million.\nSelling, administrative and research expenses combined totaled $155.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $25.6 million or 14% compared to $181.1 million in 2016. The improvement reflects the combined effects of cost savings initiatives announced since March 2015. The majority of the operating expense decline was in sales and marketing expense, which declined $17.7 million or 15% to $96.7 million in 2017, compared to $114.3 million in 2016. In addition, general and administrative expense declined $6.4 million or 16% to $34.1 million in 2017, compared to $40.5 million in 2016; $3.3 million of the decline in general and administrative expense was due to lower severance, restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses.\nBalance Sheet : The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $43.0 million and zero debt at December 31, 2017. Deferred revenue totaled $151.3 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $141.5 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term deferred revenue, which will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, totaled $110.7 million, or approximately 73% of the total December 31, 2017 balance.\nFree Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA : Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $2.6 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $4.3 million in the same period a year ago. For the full year 2017, free cash flow totaled $6.4 million, compared to $(11.3) million in 2016; included in the full year 2017 free cash flow was $13 million received from the transaction with SOURCENEXT. The Company's cash flow has historically been seasonal, with a net use of cash during the first half of the year and positive cash generation in the second half of the year.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $1.6 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of $1.9 million compared to $3.5 million in the year-ago period. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA totaled $13.3 million in 2017, compared to $4.4 million in 2016.\nEarnings Conference Call\nIn conjunction with this announcement, Rosetta Stone will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET during which time there will be a discussion of the results and the business outlook.

In addition, forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s current assumptions, expectations and beliefs and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our present expectations or projections.

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements, risks and uncertainties that are more fully described in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including those described under the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent quarterly Form 10-Q filings and Annual Report on Form 10-K, and those updated from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the Company uses, and this press release contains references to, the non-GAAP financial measures of financial performance listed below.\nSales represents executed contracts received by the Company that are either recorded immediately as revenue of deferred revenue. Therefore, sales is an operational metric and in any one period is equal to revenue plus the change in deferred revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is GAAP net income/loss plus interest income and expense, other income/expense, income tax benefit/expense, impairment, lease abandonment and termination, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring, and strategy and cost-reduction related consulting expenses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes \"Other\" items related to non-restructuring wind down and severance costs, and transaction and other costs associated with mergers and acquisitions, as well as all adjustments related to recording the non-cash tax valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods has been revised to conform to current definition. Free cash flow is cash flow from operating activities minus cash used in purchases of property and equipment. Segment contribution is calculated as segment revenue less expenses directly incurred by or allocated to the segment. Direct segment expenses include costs and expenses that are directly incurred by or allocated to the segment and include materials costs, service costs, customer care and coaching costs, sales and marketing expenses, and bad debt expense. In addition to the previously referenced expenses, the Literacy segment includes direct research and development expenses and Combined Language includes shared research and development expenses, cost of revenue, and sales and marketing expenses applicable to the Consumer Language and E&E Language segments.\nThe definitions, GAAP comparisons, and reconciliation of those measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available in this press release or in the corresponding earnings presentation, which are posted on our website at www.rosettastone.com .\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, enabling a better understanding of the long-term performance of the Company’s business. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis, and for budgeting and planning purposes. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other software and education-technology companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nThe presentation of this additional financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing earnings information, including this press release, or in corresponding earnings presentations, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to those used by other companies, and we encourage you to review and understand all our financial reporting before making any investment decision.\nAbout Rosetta Stone Inc.\nRosetta Stone Inc.
