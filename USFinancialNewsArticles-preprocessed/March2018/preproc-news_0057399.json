The 29-year-old was previously picked by the Mumbai Indians but has not played a game in the IPL.\nWarner led the Sunrisers to their maiden IPL title in 2016 and had agreed a 120 million Indian rupees deal in January to remain with the team in 2018.\nSunrisers will be led by New Zealand’s Kane Williamson this season.\n($1 = 65.11 Indian rupees)\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ",
