(NYSE:TSN) is exploring the sale of its pizza crust business (TNT Crust), the company reported today.\n“We’re focused on maximizing the full potential of our core business, and this divestiture will help pave the way for growth in our protein brands,” said Sally Grimes, Group President, Prepared Foods. “We believe a potential buyer will see the value of the pizza crust business as a whole, including the TNT Crust brand, the facilities, and the talented team members, and will be able to focus on its future.”\nThe sale of TNT Crust includes the pizza crust business of partially baked crusts, flat breads and self-rising crusts as well as the company’s two manufacturing facilities in Green Bay, Wis. The company will retain the tortilla production from the facilities that will be used in other parts of its business.
