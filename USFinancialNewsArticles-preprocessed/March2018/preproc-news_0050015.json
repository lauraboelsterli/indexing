    "text": "5 COMMENTS YOU CAN, in fact, have too much of a good thing: beige canvas logo’d tote bags, for instance. One morning last week, I extracted such a bag from my closet and discovered three smaller versions scrunched inside it—tote within tote within tote—like an unwelcome family of Russian dolls. Literary magazines, art fairs, gourmet supermarkets, athleisure brands, noodle bars, prestige pharmacies: In 2018, there are few commercial ventures that haven’t printed their names across canvas tote bags (which often come “complimentary” with a purchase or subscription). A recent scan of a Manhattan restaurant took in three New Yorker tote bags; one tote from Marfa, Texas; one tote advertising the music streaming service Tidal; and, finally, a tote designed in the style of a Virginia Woolf book cover imprinted with the dubious wordplay “Tote Lighthouse.”\nWhile often promotional, the canvas tote does have quasi-noble intentions—to lighten our loads and reduce our use of plastic bags—but the bags’ ubiquity has turned them into something of an aesthetic and ecological blight. And they already had shaky environmental credentials: A 2011 study by the U.K. Environment Agency found that cotton tote bags have a surprisingly high carbon footprint. In fact, to offset the resources expended to manufacture and distribute a single cotton tote, you’d have to use it 393 times (for a standard plastic bag, it’s just three uses). Our plan: to stop accepting those supposedly “green” cotton totes and find an alternative we will actually want to use more than 393 times. A tote that is indispensably cute.\nPhoto: F. Martin Ramin/ The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Jill Telesnicki “We wanted to make bags that were more delightful,” said Emily Sugihara, the founder and CEO of Los Angeles and New York-based company Baggu, which has been creating colorful ripstop nylon totes, which cost $10, since 2007. Her team designs with city dwellers in mind, she explains, peripatetic people for whom a tote can “often feel like your house for the day,” storing everything from gym clothes to office files to groceries. Accordingly, she ensures her bags are lightweight, collapsible, and have straps that sit comfortably on shoulders. They also come in colors other than beige: cornflower-blue gingham, a pink-grapefruit print, sherbet stripes. “It’s a low-investment way to have fun with your wardrobe,” Ms. Sugihara said, “especially in winter, when you’re wearing the same two coats—one black, one camel—and it gets dreary: Buy a red bag!”\nMere vividness isn’t the only way to upgrade your tote. Mary Ping of the conceptual clothing brand Slow and Steady Wins the Race specializes in artfully reimagining classic accessories, including the tote, by playing with scale and unexpected materials. Inspired by the bags of her childhood—the vinyl Harrods tote in “that green” and a “really vintage old Barnes and Noble tote by Tibor Kalman”—Ms. Ping has created color-blocked versions that resemble Josef Albers paintings , ones modeled after grocery bags but cut from gray sweatshirt-jersey, and winking riffs on the classic preppy boat bag. “I think there’s still definitely an evolution for the tote,” she said.\nMs. Ping’s criteria for a smartly designed tote include: easily accessible pockets and a bright lining. “If it’s black, you have to dig and use your phone light!” And besides, as Ms. Sugihara said, “Color is delightful, it brings joy.” It’s hard to say the same of the graying New York Review of Books bag you’ve been carrying all winter.\nMore from WSJ.
