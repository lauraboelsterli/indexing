    "text": "Lakewood, Colorado, March 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nThe USDA is in the market for 215 new slingable water bags used for aerial firefighting. They are shopping with small businesses for the acquisition. Small businesses who wish to make their offers known to the government must submit all required documents by March 27, 2018 to contracting officer Kim Luft ( kluft@fs.fed.us ).\nThe fire equipment requested by the government agency will be used to fight fires in the Rocky Mountain Region. They must be orange, 72-gallon bags and adhere to fire equipment regulations and standards NFES 0426. One necessary standard for this equipment is proper stenciling on the equipment which labels its contents as \"Non-Potable\" and displays the \"NFES 0426\" classification. In addition to the 215 actual bags, stenciling at a quantity of 149 should also be considered in the offered price.\nQuestions about the requirement can be directed to the contracting officer by March 14, 2018. For additional assistance finding and understanding the solicitation as well as making the best possible offer to the government, contractors may use a third-party registration firm.\nUS Federal Contractor Registration (USFCR) is the world’s largest third-party government registration firm. They not only register companies on their behalf in the government’s mandatory System for Award Management (SAM), but also provide mentorship, training and marketing for forming strong offers to the government. Building relationships with federal buyers cannot be understated in this process. To assist, USFCR has implemented the Advanced Procurement Portal (APP) . APP synthesizes market research data with active federal opportunities and a catalog of federal buyers and vendors. Access to APP is critical for small business contractors who want to gain an advantage and win government contracts.\nIf you would like more information please contact David Rockwell at (877) 252-2700 ext.750 or by email at drockwell@usfcrgov.com .
