In addition, the company received $401 million of non-binding tax equity term sheets for five tax equity partnerships. The company estimates that these tax equity partnerships will enable the company to install approximately 265 MWs of residential solar energy systems. These tax equity partnerships are subject to customary conditions and the execution of definitive documents.\nSummary Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\n$ amounts in millions, except per share data\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nYoY\nRevenue:\nOperating leases and incentives\n$\n31.2\n$\n25.3\nup 23%\nSolar energy system and product sales\n35.6\n16.5\nup 116%\nTotal Revenue\n66.8\n41.8\nup 60%\nCost of revenue:\nOperating leases and incentives\n37.7\n35.2\nup 7%\nSolar energy system and product sales\n25.3\n12.6\nup 101%\nTotal cost of revenue\n63.1\n47.8\nup 32%\nGross profit (loss)\n3.7\n(6.0)\nup 162%\nLoss from Operations\n(26.9)\n(38.1)\nup 29%\nNet income 1\n$\n183.9\n$\n20.1\nup 815%\nNet income per diluted share 1\n$\n1.54\n$\n0.18\nup 756%\nNon-GAAP net loss per share\n$\n(0.43)\n$\n(0.41)\ndown 5%\n(1) In December 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted and significantly impacted U.S. tax law.

discount rates (retained value amounts in millions):\n4%\n6%\n8%\nEstimated retained value under energy contract\n$\n1,476.1\n$\n1,238.0\n$\n1,051.0\nEstimated retained value of renewal\n588.5\n377.1\n244.2\nTotal estimated retained value\n$\n2,064.6\n$\n1,615.1\n$\n1,295.2\nNon-GAAP Earnings per Share (EPS) Before Non-controlling Interests\nWe report GAAP EPS, which is based upon net income available to common stockholders. We also report non-GAAP EPS. The difference between GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS is that non-GAAP EPS is based on net loss, which excludes net loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests. Additionally, we have excluded the effects of the federal tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% from the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and the goodwill impairment from the year ended December 31, 2016 as they are non-cash, non-recurring events that are not representative of our ongoing business. We believe that presenting non-GAAP EPS provides a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance. As we are in a net loss position for all periods reported, potentially issuable shares are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation since the effect would be antidilutive. Therefore, basic and diluted non-GAAP EPS are the same in each period presented.\nUnder GAAP accounting, we report net loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests to reflect our joint venture fund investors' allocable share in the results of these joint venture investment funds. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests is calculated based primarily on the hypothetical liquidation at book value, or HLBV, method, which assumes that the joint venture funds are liquidated at the reporting date, even though liquidation may or may not ever occur. Additionally, the returns that will be allocated to the investors over the expected terms of the investment funds may differ significantly from the amounts calculated under the HLBV method. Accordingly, we also report non-GAAP EPS based on our losses before net loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests per share, which we view as a better measure of our operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAccording to this definition, the diluted non-GAAP loss before the allocation of loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests per share was ($0.43) and ($1.58) for the three months and year\nVivint Solar, Inc.\nReconciliation from GAAP EPS to Non-GAAP EPS\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nNet Loss\nEPS\nNet Loss\nEPS\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n183,921\n$\n1.60\n$\n20,138\n$\n0.18\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests\n(45,245)\n(0.40)\n(65,545)\n(0.59)\nEffect of federal tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%\n(187,501)\n(1.63)\n—\n—\nNon-GAAP net loss\n$\n(48,825)\n$\n(0.43)\n$\n(45,407)\n$\n(0.41)\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share\n114,847\n110,198\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nNet Loss\nEPS\nNet Loss\nEPS\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n209,098\n$\n1.85\n$\n17,986\n$\n0.17\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests\n(200,628)\n(1.77)\n(260,523)\n(2.41)\nEffect of federal tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%\n(187,501)\n(1.66)\n—\n—\nImpairment of goodwill\n—\n—\n36,601\n0.34\nNon-GAAP net loss\n$\n(179,031)\n$\n(1.58)\n$\n(205,936)\n$\n(1.90)\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share\n113,132\n108,190\nGlossary of Definitions\n\" Installations \" represents the number of solar energy systems installed on customers' premises.\n\" MWs or megawatts \" represents the DC nameplate megawatt production capacity.\n\" MW Booked \" represents the aggregate megawatt nameplate capacity of solar energy systems that were permitted during the period net of cancellations in the period.\n\" MW Installed \" represents the aggregate megawatt nameplate capacity of solar energy systems for which panels, inverters, and mounting and racking hardware have been installed on customer premises in the period.\n\" Nominal Contracted Payments Remaining \" equals the sum of the remaining cash payments that Vivint Solar's customers are expected to pay over the term of their agreements for systems installed as of the measurement date. For a power purchase agreement, Vivint Solar multiplies the contract price per kilowatt-hour by the estimated annual energy output of the associated solar energy system to determine the estimated nominal contracted payments. For a customer lease, Vivint Solar includes the monthly fees and upfront fee, if any, as set forth in the lease.\n\" Retained Value \" represents the net cash flows, discounted at 6%, that Vivint Solar expects to receive from customers pursuant to long-term customer contracts net of estimated cash distributions to fund investors and estimated operating expenses for systems installed as of the measurement date. For purposes of the calculation, Vivint Solar aggregates the estimated retained value from the solar energy systems during the typical 20-year term of Vivint Solar's contracts, which Vivint Solar refers to as estimated retained value under energy contracts, and the estimated retained value associated with an assumed 10-year renewal term following the expiration of the initial contract term, which Vivint Solar refers to as estimated retained value of renewal. To calculate estimated retained value of renewal, Vivint Solar assumes all contracts are renewed at 90% of the contractual price in effect at the expiration of the initial term.\n\" Retained Value per Watt \" is calculated by dividing the estimated retained value as of the measurement date by the aggregate nameplate capacity of solar energy systems under long-term customer contracts that have been installed as of such date, and is subject to the same assumptions and uncertainties as estimated retained value.\n\" Undeployed Tax Equity Financing Capacity \" represents a forecast of the amount of megawatts that can be deployed based on committed available tax equity financing for energy contracts.\nInvestor Contact:\nRob Kain\n855-842-1844\nir@vivintsolar.com\nPress Contact:\nHelen Langan\n385-202-6577\npr@vivintsolar.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vivint-solar-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300610218.html\nSOURCE Vivint Solar",
