If there are ripple effects then it will influence growth forecasts and the way they conduct their policy,” she said.\nThe ECB announces its policy decision at 1245 GMT, followed by ECB President Mario Draghi’s news conference at 1330 GMT, which will include a quarterly update of economic projections.\nAhead of the ECB meeting, money markets continued to price in a 10 basis point rate rise in early 2019, although expectations for a hike as early as this December have been scaled back.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Additional reporting by Sujata Rao\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
