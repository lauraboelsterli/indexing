    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rennova Health, Inc. (OTCQB:RNVA), (OTCQB:RNVAW) (“Rennova” or the “Company”), a vertically integrated provider of industry-leading diagnostics and supportive software solutions to healthcare providers that recently announced the acquisition of its second Rural hospital, announces interview of CEO Seamus Lagan, on Uptick Newswire’s “Stock Day” podcast with Everett Jolly\n“Rennova Health has weathered a couple of very difficult years,” said Jolly. \"It seems that with the opening of the hospital in Oneida in August 2017 and subsequent agreement to purchase a second larger hospital 38 miles away in Jamestown, you are on your way to rebuilding some decent revenue and value in Rennova.”\nThe company’s purchase of two geographically synergetic hospitals in rural Tennessee has opened the door for predictable revenue and growth moving forward. Rennova Health expects the implementation of this model will prove positive for the company and its shareholders and expects significant improvements in revenue and shareholders’ equity throughout 2018.\n“Our hospital in Oneida is benefiting from increasing numbers of patients and billing each month since opening,” said Lagan. “The purchase of a second much larger hospital within one hour’s drive from Oneida will create opportunity for numerous efficiencies between the two facilities and allow us to further treat a large number of the patients that Oneida sends to other hospitals each month for operations and other treatments.”\nTo listen to the full interview please click here to the following link: https://upticknewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Uptick-Network-RNVA-Interview-2-26-18.mp3\nAbout Rennova Health, Inc.\nRennova provides industry-leading diagnostics and supportive software solutions to healthcare providers, delivering an efficient, effective patient experience and superior clinical outcomes.
