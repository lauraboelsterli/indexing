    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, March 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Target Capital Inc. d.b.a. CBi 2 Capital (\"CBi 2 \") (TSX-V:TCI) (CSE:TCI) is pleased to announce a strategic investment in Industrial Lifestyle Properties Real Estate Investment Trust (\"iLP\"). iLP is a newly-formed, self-advised, open-ended real estate investment trust focused on the acquisition, development, ownership and management of specialized cultivation facilities, industrial properties and real estate for the legal cannabis industry.\nCBi 2 will provide iLP with up to $1.0 million of capital through an equity commitment and iLP will use the proceeds to make strategic deposits on property acquisitions and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Prior to, or concurrent with, acquiring its first cannabis property, iLP is expected to become publicly-listed.\nAt present, cannabis market participants have limited access to traditional forms of asset-based financing and have primarily raised capital by way of equity issuances at the expense of diluting existing shareholders. iLP will provide non-dilutive capital to the cannabis market through sales-leaseback transactions and plans to secure contracts with tenants and properties under triple-net lease terms. iLP's structure will allow cannabis operators to unlock capital and redeploy it into higher return activities and will provide cannabis investors yield underpinned by a secured cash flow profile.\nCBi 2 has a detailed business plan, developed in consultation with a national law firm with expertise in real estate investment trusts. Management believes there is significant demand for this type of structure within the cannabis industry - both among cannabis operators and cannabis investors.\nCBi 2 's team has knowledge and experience designing state-of-the-art cultivation facilities and navigating the industry's licensing process and regulatory framework. CBi 2 is expected to encourage deal flow and evaluate transaction opportunities on behalf of iLP. Leading iLP's senior management team will be David McGorman as the company's Managing Partner. David is currently a Managing Director with Black Spruce Merchant Capital and prior to was President and CEO of Jennings Capital. David has over 25 years of investment banking experience and during his tenure with The Chase Manhattan Bank was also involved in a number of real estate transactions. Together with CBi 2 , David will build out a complete team of legal, finance and real estate professional to manage iLP's operations.\nCBi 2 's investment in iLP presents its shareholders with a material equity position in a start-up cannabis real estate investment trust – the first of its kind in Canada. This transaction was built off the strength of CBi 2 ’s merchant banking skills and provides CBi 2 's investors a unique position in the cannabis space. As early entrants into the marketplace, CBi 2 expects this transaction to deliver superior returns that are consistent with its overall investment strategy.\nMore information on iLP can be found at www.ilpreit.com .\nAbout CBi 2 Capital\nTarget Capital Inc., to be renamed CBi 2 Capital Corp., is a Calgary, Alberta based company engaged in making strategic investments in private companies, including small start‐up operations and land development corporations. CBi 2 ’s common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and the Canadian Securities Exchange under the trading symbol \"TCI\". Target is executing on a cannabis-focused investment strategy, where it intends to develop and manage a diversified portfolio of predominantly early stage cannabis investment opportunities. Target will explore and invest in a number of strategic investment opportunities in the medical and recreational cannabis industry and in businesses offering ancillary supportive products and services. Upon receipt of shareholder approval, Target will change its name to \"CBi 2 Capital Corp.\".\nSonny Mottahed\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nor\nBill Macdonald\nExecutive Vice President – Corporate Development\nCBi 2 Capital\nSuite 300, 407 – 3rd Street SW\nCalgary AB, T2P 4Z2\nPhone: 403.351.1779\nEmail: contact@cbi2.com\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nCertain information included in this press release constitutes forward-looking information under applicable securities legislation. Forward-looking information typically contains statements with words such as \"will\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"plan\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"propose\" or similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook.
