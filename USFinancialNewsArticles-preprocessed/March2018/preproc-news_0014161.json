    "text": "SHERIDAN, Wyo., March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Via OTC PR Wire -- Imperalis Holding Corp. (OTC:IMHC), a management consulting services company, is excited to update current shareholders as well as potential shareholders as to the status of the company's achievements and other Company business.\nWe announce with great pleasure that we have acquired The Dollar Shot Club, a trademarked monthly subscription service that offers the best tasting, highest-quality supplement shots that are formulated, manufactured, and delivered in America.\nPresident and CEO Vincent Andreula stated, \"This is a very exciting time for the company. We have entered 2018 with a commitment to create opportunity for our shareholders. We are thrilled about the acquisition of The Dollar Shot Club and the rapid growth of the energy and sports drink market as well as the CBD market.\"\nIn the last five years, the retail market for energy and sport drinks in the U.S. has been vigorously exploding with sales of $25 billion in 2016 alone. It has been estimated by Forbes that the cannabidiol (CBD) market will grow 700% by 2020.\n\"The Dollar Shot Club will be soon adding a CBD based drink to its product line up and given the rapid growth of the CBD arena, we believe we are positioned to address a remarkable market,\" added Andreula.\nImperalis is also actively mining bitcoin through The Crypto Currency Mining Company Inc. The company has bought and paid for 100 miners and is in the process of buying more. According to several analysts and executives, bitcoin is expected to hit $100,000 in 2018.\nImperalis recently completed a reverse merger with privately held The Crypto Currency Mining Company Inc., which allowed the company to make its entrance into the fast growing crypotocurrency market. The reverse merger has marked the first step for The Crypto Currency Mining Company Inc. to become a publicly traded company.\nPresident and CEO Vincent Andreula has previously stated, \"We believe that bitcoin will be a big part of the future and our goal is to become the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining farm.\"\nAbout Imperalis Holding Corp.\nImperalis Holding Corp. is a New Hampshire-based diversified holding company that specializes in emerging industries.
