The dividend is payable on April 2, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2018.\nAbout MAA\nMAA is a self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT) and member of the S&P 500 index.

For further details, please refer to www.maac.com or contact Investor Relations at investor.relations@maac.com .\nCertain matters in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27-A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements include statements made about the payment of preferred dividends. The ability to meet the payment of preferred dividends in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements could differ materially from the projection due to a number of factors, including a downturn in general economic conditions or the capital markets, changes in interest rates and other items that are difficult to control such as increases in real estate taxes in many of our markets, as well as the other general risks inherent in the apartment and real estate businesses. Reference is hereby made to the filings of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, reports on Form 8-K, and its annual report on Form 10-K, particularly including the risk factors contained in the latter filing.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maa-announces-regular-quarterly-preferred-dividend-300607036.html\nSOURCE MAA",
