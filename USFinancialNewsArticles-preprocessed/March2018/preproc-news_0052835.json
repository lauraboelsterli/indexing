    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 10:11 AM / Updated an hour ago FACTBOX-Cricket-Australia's sacked captain Steve Smith Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMarch 28 (Reuters) - Factbox on sacked Australian captain Steve Smith who was banned for 12 months by Cricket Australia on Wednesday in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. \n*Born: June 2, 1989, Sydney, Australia. \n*Made test debut against Pakistan at Lord’s in 2010, scoring one and 12 and claiming three wickets. \n*Although initially selected for Australia as a right-arm leg spinner, Smith went on to become a top-order batsman. \n*He has played 64 tests and scored 6199 runs with a 61-plus average, hitting 23 centuries and 24 fifties. \n*He was named in 2014 the country’s 45th test captain, replacing the injured Michael Clarke. \n*He scored four centuries in four-consecutive home tests against India to join Donald Bradman (six), Neil Harvey, Jack Fingleton and Matthew Hayden (four each) as Australian centurions in four or more consecutive tests. \n*The retirement of Clarke following Australia’s 3-2 Ashes series defeat by England in 2015 saw Smith appointed as full-time skipper. \n*Smith scored five consecutive 50-plus scores in the 2015 World Cup to help Australia lift the trophy for the fifth time. \n*He finished top scorer for Australia with 508 runs in the 2015 Ashes series but England won the series 3-2. \n*He has scored over 1,000 test runs in each of the last four calendar years. \n*He led Australia to 4-0 series victory over England in 2017-18 Ashes and finished as top scorer in the series with 687 runs in five tests. \n*He was named ICC test player of the year in 2015 and 2017. \n*Current world number one in ICC test batting rankings.
