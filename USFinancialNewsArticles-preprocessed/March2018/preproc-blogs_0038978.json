Potential targets of retaliation include U.S. agriculture products, particularly soybeans . \"Dealing with an emboldened Vladimir Putin in Russia.\"The Russian leader secured a fourth term in power on Sunday thanks to a national election which, as with most Russian elections in recent years, is widely suspected of fraud. Putin this week claimed a democratic mandate even as the Kremlin is believed to have interfered with the most recent U.S. national election and Europe and stands accused by UK authorities of attacking a former Russian operative with a deadly nerve agent on British soil . \"Preparing for a historic U.S.-North Korea summit, taking place as early as May, which could greatly reduce or heighten the risk of war on the Korean peninsula.\"Trump has been criticized for accepting a face-to-face meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The White House has stressed that talks must lead to an end of the rogue state's nuclear program. show chapters 2:07 PM ET Thu, 15 March 2018 | 04:48 \"Growing tensions with Iran , as Trump's May deadline to decide whether to leave the nuclear deal draws closer.\"Trump's administration is looking to change an existing deal that agreed to lift long-running sanctions against Tehran in exchange for limits on Iran's nuclear program. The future of the deal is uncertain. Nyshka Chandran Reporter, CNBC Asia-Pacific Playing",
