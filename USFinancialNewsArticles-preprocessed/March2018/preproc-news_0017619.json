    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMMY), an ophthalmology-focused pharmaceutical company, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter 2017.\nNotable Highlights:\nRevenue of $7.3 million, up 27% year-over-year Gross ophthalmology-related revenue of $5.8 million, up 64% year-over-year Average 503B order exceeded $1,400 for the quarter Gross Margin of 53%, compared to 47% in Q4 2016 Adjusted EBITDA loss of $794,000, a 67% improvement year-over-year, and 52% improvement quarter-over-quarter There are 8 clinical studies and investigations underway or near completion on the MKO Melt®, LessDrops®, OmegaDoxy™, Simple Drops™ and Imprimis's patent-pending cyclosporine formulations\nMark L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis stated, \"Record quarterly revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 meant our 15 th consecutive quarter of double digit or better year-over-year growth. We continued to narrow our Adjusted EBITDA loss, this time halving it on a quarter-over-quarter basis to $794,000. We limited cash used in operating activities to under $300,000 for the fourth quarter and we expect to further narrow our Adjusted EBITDA loss as we achieve our goal of profitability in the near future. We also ended the fourth quarter with more cash on hand than we had at the end of the prior quarter.\"\nBaum concluded, \"The first quarter is historically strong, and we are seeing that play out currently with new accounts being opened and refill rates from chronic care patients exceeding our expectations. Eton Pharmaceuticals and Surface Pharmaceuticals, two companies we started last year that are seeking FDA-approval for several Imprimis-developed drug formulations, are performing well; and we continue to drive value from Imprimis as a pharmaceutical innovation platform. I continue to believe we are at the beginning of what I expect to be a longer-term growth and value-creation cycle.\"\nRecent Commercialization and Corporate Developments\nCustomer network now exceeds 2,000 prescribers Strengthened sales force by adding new contract-based and seasoned ophthalmic sales professionals FDA-registered outsourcing facility in New Jersey issued a DEA Manufacturer Certificate Nationwide dispensing of preservative-free dorzolamide and preservative-free dorzolamide/timolol due to a shortage of dorzolamide, a drug dispensed 4 million times in 2017 to treat glaucoma Launched national custom compounded ophthalmic formulation program to meet emergent needs of patients suffering from sight-threatening conditions Four new cGMP ophthalmic formulations expected to become available from Imprimis's 503B outsourcing facility during Q1 2018\nFinancial Summary:\nSelected highlights regarding operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and for the same periods in 2016 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nFor the three months\nended December 31, 2017\nFor the three months\nended December 31, 2016\nTotal Revenues\n$7,337\n$5,793\nCost of Sales\n(3,457)\n(3,071)\nGross Profit\n3,880\n2,722\nSelling & Marketing Expenses\n(1,332)\n(1,415)\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\n(4,610)\n(4,213)\nResearch & Development Expenses\n(89)\n(601)\nOperating Loss\n(2,151)\n(3,507)\nOther Income (Expense), net\n(620)\n(2,595)\nNet Loss\n$(2,771)\n$ (6,102)\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nTotal Revenues\n$26,774\n$19,942\nCost of Sales\n(13,505)\n(9,831)\nGross Profit\n13,269\n10,111\nSelling & Marketing Expenses\n(7,059)\n(7,382)\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\n(17,960)\n(17,569)\nResearch & Development Expenses\n(413)\n(739)\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n-\n(303)\nOperating Loss\n(12,163)\n(15,882)\nOther Income (Expense), net\n178\n(3,205)\nNet Loss\n$(11,985)\n$ (19,087)\nNet Loss per Common Share\n$(0.60)\n$ (1.50)\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIn addition to the company's results of operations determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which are presented and discussed above, management also utilizes adjusted EBITDA, an unaudited financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the company's financial results and performance and to plan and forecast future periods. Adjusted EBITDA is considered a \"non-GAAP\" financial measure Regulation G promulgated by the SEC. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting its business. Management believes adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the company's performance because (i) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making; (ii) it excludes the impact of non-cash or, when specified, non-recurring items that are not directly attributable to the company's core operating performance and that may obscure trends in the company's core operating performance; and (iii) it is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the company's results. However, adjusted EBITDA and any other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the manner in which they are calculated may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures or the calculations of the same non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including the company's competitors.\nThe company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding the effects of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, other income (expense) and, if any and when specified, other non-recurring income or expense items. The company believes that the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA is net loss. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered as an alternative to gross profit or net loss as a measure of operating performance or to net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of ability to meet cash needs.\nThe following is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure, net loss, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nFor the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet Loss\n$(2,771)\nStock-based compensation\n678\nInterest expense, net\n678\nTaxes\n(851)\nDepreciation\n360\nAmortization of intangible assets\n92\nOther expenses/loss\n28\nInvestment loss from Eton Pharmaceuticals\n765\nNon-recurring expenses, net (1)\n227\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ (794)\n(1)\nNon-recurring expenses includes one-time costs related to litigation settlements and income from settlements associated with accrued expenses and trade payable disputes.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe company's management team will host a conference call and audio-only webcast today at 4:30 p.m. EST (1:30 p.m. PST) to discuss the financial results and recent developments.
