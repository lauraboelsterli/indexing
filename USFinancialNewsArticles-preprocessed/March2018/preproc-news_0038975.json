    "text": "LAS VEGAS, March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Full House Resorts, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:FLL) today announced a registered direct offering of up to 4,166,667 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of up to $12.5 million. Each share of common stock is being sold at a price of $3.00 per share.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including Phase One of its planned expansion of Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado. Phase One includes exercising the Company's options to purchase the Imperial Hotel and certain parcels of land adjacent to Bronco Billy's, as well as the construction of a 286-space parking garage. Phase One also includes completing the refurbishment of the Imperial Hotel and refurbishing and re-opening the Imperial Casino, which the Company has the option to either lease or purchase.\nUnion Gaming Securities LLC is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.\nThe shares of common stock are being offered by us pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-222390), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on January 12, 2018. A final prospectus supplement will be filed with the SEC and will form a part of the effective registration statement. The Company filed a preliminary prospectus supplement relating to this offering with the SEC on March 22, 2018.

Electronic copies of the final prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus will also be available on the website of the SEC at www.sec.gov .\nThis press release does not and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities law of any such state or jurisdiction.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release contains statements by Full House Resorts, Inc. that are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Some forward-looking statements in this press release include those regarding our issuance of securities, the amount of proceeds from the offering and the closing of the offering, and our intended use of proceeds from the offering, including Phase One of the expansion of Bronco Billy Casino and Hotel. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Such risks include, without limitation, adverse market conditions, the risk that the offering cannot be successfully completed, changes in our business strategies, interest rate risks, the failure to obtain and/or maintain regulatory approvals (including in Colorado, Indiana, Nevada and Mississippi), the ability to obtain financing upon reasonable terms (including for projects such as the Bronco Billy’s expansion), the increase in Full House's indebtedness due to the acquisition or expansion of Bronco Billy’s, construction risks, dependence on existing management, competition, uncertainties over the development and success of our acquisition and expansion projects, the financial performance of our finished projects and renovations, effectiveness of expense and operating efficiencies, general macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory and business conditions in the gaming industry. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect our financial condition and results of operations is included in the reports we file with the SEC, including, but not limited to, our Form 10-K for the most recently ended fiscal year and our other periodic reports filed with the SEC. We are under no obligation to (and expressly disclaim any such obligation to) update or revise our forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nAbout Full House Resorts, Inc.\nFull House Resorts, Inc. owns, leases, develops and operates gaming facilities throughout the country.
