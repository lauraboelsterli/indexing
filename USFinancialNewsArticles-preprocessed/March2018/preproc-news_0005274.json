    "text": "ROCK HILL, S.C., Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) announced today that it will delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The company will file a Form 12b-25, Notification of Late Filing, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which allows the company to extend the deadline to file its Form 10-K. The company now plans to hold its fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call and file its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, on Wednesday, March 14, 2018.\nThe company noted the delay in filing is related to accounting for revenue and costs related to product warranties. While completing its technical accounting analysis related to implementation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), the company concluded additional examination is required. Based on preliminary analysis, the company believes that any financial impact resulting from this review is accounted for within the company’s preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2017 results described below. The delayed filing has no impact on 3D Systems’ customers or the operations of the business.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the company anticipates revenue will be in the range of $176 million to $178 million, approximately six to seven percent growth from $165.9 million in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The company expects to report a fourth quarter GAAP loss in the range of $0.08 to $0.10 per share compared to earnings of $0.05 per share in the prior year, and expects non-GAAP earnings of $0.03 to $0.05 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“We are pleased with the growth in revenue driven by healthcare, materials, software and on demand manufacturing, as well as more balanced regional execution experienced in the fourth quarter,” commented Vyomesh Joshi (VJ), chief executive officer, 3D Systems.\nFor the full year 2017, the company expects to report a revenue increase of approximately two percent with revenue in the range of $645 million to $647 million compared to $633.0 million in 2016. The company expects to report a GAAP loss in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 per share for the full year 2017 compared to a loss of $0.35 per share in the prior year, and expects to report a non-GAAP loss in the range of $0.01 to $0.03 per share for the full year 2017 compared to a non-GAAP earnings of $0.46 per share in 2016.\n“While we still have work to do, we made significant progress in 2017 to stabilize and turn around the company. We believe our investments in go-to-market combined with improved processes and better execution have started to show returns, and I look forward to discussing our progress and our significant opportunity going forward on our conference call in a couple of weeks,” concluded Joshi.\nIn connection with the extension for its Form 10-K filing, the company will postpone its previously announced February 28, 2018 conference call and webcast to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. The company now plans to hold its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results conference call and webcast and file its Form 10-K on Wednesday, March 14, 2018 after the market closes.\nThese are preliminary results and estimates based on current expectations and are subject to year-end closing adjustments and completion of auditing procedures related to accounting for revenue and costs related to product warranties. Actual results may differ.\nQ4 2017 Conference Call and Webcast\nThe company expects to file its Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2018. 3D Systems plans to hold a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss these results on Wednesday, March 14, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\nDate: Wednesday, March 14, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time\nListen via Internet: www.3dsystems.com/investor\nParticipate via telephone: Within the U.S.: 1-877-407-8291\nOutside the U.S.: 1-201-689-8345 A replay of the webcast will be available approximately two hours after the live presentation at www.3dsystems.com/investor .\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this release that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from historical results or from any future results or projections expressed or implied by such In many cases, forward looking statements can be identified by terms such as “believes,” “belief,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “estimates,” “intends,” “anticipates” or “plans” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. are based upon management’s beliefs, assumptions and current expectations and may include comments as to the company’s beliefs and expectations as to future events and trends affecting its business and are necessarily subject to uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company.
