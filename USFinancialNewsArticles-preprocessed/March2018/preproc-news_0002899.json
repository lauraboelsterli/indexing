    "text": "BRUSSELS, March 2 (Reuters) - Greece has met all the conditions set by lenders for the disbursement of new loans and the next tranche of 5.7 billion euros ($7.02 billion) is likely to be paid out in the second half of March, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers said.\n“I have been informed that... all prior actions ...have been completed,” Eurogroup President Mario Centeno said in a statement, adding the euro zone bailout fund was likely to approve the disbursement new loans to Athens after national parliamentary procedures are completed.\n“This will pave the way to the release of the first sub tranche of 5.7 billion euros in the second half of March,” Centeno said.\nHe said the final review of Greek reforms under the bailout was now under way, as was technical work on possible new debt relief measures.
