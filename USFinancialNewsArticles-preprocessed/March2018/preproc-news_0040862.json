Morning was created in 2011 as a distributor and published its first board game, KUMO, in 2015. The company's latest success was a Kickstarter called \"Kill the Unicorns\" that was financed thanks to almost 8000 backers and $300,000 USD.\nThe upcoming acquisition of Morning gives AMFIL the opportunity to accelerate the reach of the European board game market that is $2.4 Billion EUR (Approx. $3 Billion USD).

The company also directly serves a network of 400 shops in Europe.\nValentin Famose, the COO of Morning talks about this partnership,\n\"We have been talking with AMFIL for the past few weeks, we are really happy about this opportunity to be part of something bigger and leverage the power of Snakes & Lattes to accelerate our growth in North America benefiting from an established network of shops and an outstanding reputation in the board game industry.\"\nThis buyout should be secured before the end of April.\nSnakes & Lattes Inc. continues its aggressive expansion on both the distribution and retail levels, striving to achieve its goal of industry domination from initial publishing to final retail sales.\nFurther updates can be expected from Amfil Technologies Inc. next week.\nFor more information regarding the company, please visit www.amfiltech.com and follow us on Twitter for further updates @AmfilTech.\nFor more information on Snakes & Lattes Inc. please visit www.snakesandlattes.com\nFor more information on GRO3, please visit http://gro3systems.com/\nFor more information on Natural Stuff Inc., please visit https://www.naturalstuffinc.com/\nFor more information on Interloc-Kings Inc., please visit http://www.interloc-kings.com/\nAbout Us:\nAmfil Technologies, Inc. is the parent company to four wholly owned subsidiaries.\n1). Snakes & Lagers Inc. holds the trade name and is the owner of Snakes & Lattes Inc. which currently operates 3 tabletop gaming bars and cafes located in Toronto, Ontario that brought in over $7M CAD in revenue last year. The company is in the process of franchising throughout North America. Snakes & Lattes Inc. was the first board game bar and cafe in North America, is believed to be the largest in the world and have the largest circulating public library of board games in North America for customers to choose from. Snakes & Lattes Inc. currently has a 100+ member staff and recently acquired the exclusive distribution rights throughout Canada for some of the most popular board games in the world. The company also operates a lucrative fulfillment and distribution division and has recently entered into the board game publishing business which is expected to add significant revenues to the bottom line.

The EcoPr03 GRO3 Antimicrobial System was jointly developed between Amfil Tech and A.C.T.S. Inc. which recently rebranded its technology under Advanced Ozone Integration as an extension of the existing ozone technology being utilized in the food and beverage industry and integrated by A.C.T.S. into companies such as Pepsi, Nestle, Sysco, Sun Pacific and many others. The system is a triple-function sanitization unit capable of naturally eliminating 99.9% of water and airborne pathogens and the typically problematic pests that wreak havoc for cultivators (like aphids, whiteflies and spider mites), as well as bacteria, fungus, microbes and mold on surfaces, all without chemicals. The unit can also constantly regulate a given facility's water supply, oxygenating the water and maintaining a consistent PPM infusion of ozone that prevents the formation of algae, bacteria or mold (allowing for comprehensive water recycling), simultaneously removing the need to use pesticides and/or dangerous, often carcinogenic products to treat production problems, as is common throughout the industry today. This environmentally-friendly solution also eliminates odors, while slightly reducing the air temperature, lowering energy consumption by the HEPA filtration and HVAC systems and could potentially allow for a facilities process to be labeled certified organic in the U.S.A. when the crop is no longer considered illegal on the federal level, otherwise \"Clean Green\" or \"Certified Kind\" in the meantime. The EcoPr03 GRO3 Antimicrobial System recently passed product review by a registered USDA certifying agent for use in California as well as Pennsylvania and surrounding states. The subsidiary has developed a strategic partnership with Roto Gro, the creator of proprietary rotary hydroponic technology. More information on this product line can be found on the www.gro3systems.com website or on twitter @GRO3Systems.\n3).
