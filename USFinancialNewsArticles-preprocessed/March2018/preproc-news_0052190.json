REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan/Files Most immigrant and non-immigrant visa applicants - about 14.7 million people - will be asked to list on a federal application form all of the social media identities that they have used in the past five years - information that will be used to vet and identify them, according to the proposals.\nThe State Department will publish the proposals in a notice in the Federal Register on Friday seeking approval from the Office of Management and Budget. The public has 60 days to comment on the requests.\nThe proposals support President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge in 2016 to crack down on illegal immigration for security reasons and his call for “extreme vetting” of foreigners entering the United States.\nThe department said it intends not to routinely ask most diplomatic and official visa applicants for the social media information.\nIf approved, applicants also will be required to submit five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses and their international travel history. They will be asked if they have been deported or removed from any country and whether family members have been involved in terrorist activities, the department said.\nCourts have struck down the first two versions of Trump’s travel ban and the current one is narrower in scope than its predecessors. The Supreme Court will consider its legality this spring and a decision is expected in June.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump addresses the \"Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\" at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, U.S., January 19, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files Editing by Bill Trott\n ",
