We sold eight legacy hotel assets generating gross proceeds of $29.1 million and acquired or placed under contract nine new investment platform hotels for a purchase price of approximately $168 million. We continue to thrive in our operations, having achieved 5.0% RevPAR growth in 2017 for our same-store new investment platform hotels combined with a 50 bps increase in hotel EBITDA margin over last year. Our 5.0% RevPAR growth significantly outperformed both the industry and our public hotel REIT peer group.\n“We have also had continued success subsequent to year end with the disposition of two additional legacy assets and the purchase of the TownePlace Suites Austin North Tech Ridge and Home2 Suites Summerville-Charleston bringing our new investment platform hotel acquisitions in and since 2015 to nearly $277 million. We have only three of our legacy assets remaining and one of these hotels is already under contract to be sold. We have now sold 52 legacy assets for approximately $153 million since the transition began almost three years ago. Our investment thesis continues to prove out as we execute our communicated strategy. We are excited to continue expanding our platform and create additional shareholder value in 2018 and beyond.”\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company’s total portfolio included 18 hotels, representing 2,176 rooms.\nTotal Company Financial Results\n($ in millions except per share amounts)\nThree months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Revenue $ 15.3 $ 10.5 45.9 % $ 55.5 $ 50.6 9.5 % Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders $ 1.2 $ 3.6 -67.1 % $ (9.4 ) $ 2.0 -557.4 % Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share $ 0.10 $ 0.65 -84.6 % $ (1.00 ) $ 0.91 -209.9 % Funds from Operations (FFO)* $ 2.3 $ (1.1 ) N/A $ 6.3 $ 6.8 -6.9 % FFO per Diluted Share* $ 0.18 $ (2.26 ) N/A $ (0.22 ) $ (15.40 ) N/A Adjusted FFO* $ 3.3 $ (1.1 ) N/A $ 9.8 $ 0.3 2961.4 % Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share* $ 0.28 $ (1.20 ) N/A $ 0.98 $ 0.35 180.0 % Hotel EBITDA* $ 6.0 $ 3.0 95.2 % $ 22.0 $ 15.0 46.1 % Adjusted EBITDA* $ 4.6 $ 1.3 249.8 % $ 16.2 $ 9.1 77.3 % *Please see the Reg.

G reconciliation tables at the end of this release.\nPORTFOLIO ACTIVITY\nThe Company’s investment strategy is to assemble a portfolio of premium-branded, select-service hotels in the top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSAs”) with a particular focus on MSAs ranked between 20 to 60. Since restarting its portfolio transformation in 2015, the Company has acquired or placed under contract 14 high-quality select-service hotels representing 1,808 rooms in its target markets for a total purchase price of approximately $277 million. Additionally, during this time, the Company has sold 52 legacy assets for a total gross sales price of approximately $153 million.\nAcquisitions\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the Company agreed to acquire the TownePlace Suites Austin North Tech Ridge, and during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company agreed to acquire the Home2 Suites Summerville-Charleston in South Carolina. The Company acquired both of these hotels in the first quarter of 2018 for a combined purchase price of $36.1 million. These two assets represent the fourteenth and fifteenth hotels, respectively, under the Company’s new investment platform. Aimbridge Hospitality was retained as the manager of the TownePlace Suites while Inn Ventures is managing our new Home2 Suites.\nDispositions\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company sold one legacy hotel asset, a 71-room Comfort Inn & Suites in Warsaw, IN for $5.0 million. Subsequent to year end, the Company sold the 41-room Supertel Inn in Creston, IA for $2.1 million and the Comfort Suites in South Bend, IN for $6.1 million. Net proceeds from the sales were applied to outstanding debt on the Company’s $150 million secured credit facility. The Company has only three legacy hotels remaining in the portfolio, and one of these hotels is currently under contract for sale while another is being marketed for sale.\nBALANCE SHEET AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of $10.3 million and available revolver lending capacity of $11.9 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had total outstanding long-term debt of $118.9 million associated with assets held for use with a weighted average maturity of 3.2 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company refinanced three new investment platform hotels. The effect of this refinancing was to increase the ratio of fixed rate debt to total debt and to increase the credit facility availability for future acquisitions. The refinanced hotels were previously encumbered by floating-rate debt totaling $25.0 million (4.2% weighted average rate), which was refinanced with a $26.5 million mortgage loan from Wells Fargo. The new mortgage loan has an effective fixed rate of 4.44% and matures in five years with two one-year extension options.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company sold 163,054 shares of common stock under the ATM program at an average sales price of $10.1328 per share for gross proceeds totaling $1,652,191 and net proceeds, including cash commission fees paid to the Sales Agents and additional related costs, totaling $1,588,414.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017 through March 16, 2018, the Company has sold 12,334 shares of common stock under the ATM program at an average sales price of $10.40 per share for gross proceeds totaling approximately $128,000 and net proceeds, including cash commission fees paid to the Sales Agents and additional related costs, totaling approximately $125,000.\nCAPITAL INVESTMENTS\nThe Company invested $2.8 million in capital improvements throughout the portfolio in the year ended December 31, 2017, to upgrade its properties and maintain brand standards.\nOUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE\nThe Company reiterates its previously announced 2018 Outlook Forecast as included below. Condor plans to reexamine full year 2018 guidance following the end of the first quarter of 2018.\n2018 Outlook ($ in millions except per share amounts) Low High RevPAR growth (13 new investment platform hotels owned as of December 31, 2017) 3.0% 4.5% 2018 Outlook for 17-Hotel Portfolio Forecast hotel revenue $ 74.0 $ 75.4 Forecast net earnings $ 1.7 $ 2.5 Forecast earnings per share - Diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.16 Forecast Hotel EBITDA* $ 28.8 $ 29.7 Forecast AFFO per common share and common unit - Diluted* $ 1.13 $ 1.19 *Please see the Reg. G reconciliation tables at the end of this release.\nDIVIDENDS\nOn December 19, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash common stock dividend of $0.195 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The common stock dividend represents an annualized yield of approximately 7.8% based on the closing price of the Company’s common shares on December 18, 2017. The fourth quarter dividend was paid on January 10, 2018 to shareholders of record as of January 2, 2018.\nEARNINGS CALL\nThe Company will conduct its quarterly conference call on Tuesday, March 20, 2018, at 9:00 AM ET.

We report Funds from Operations (“FFO”), Adjusted FFO (“AFFO”), Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”), Adjusted EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA as non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating results and that management uses to facilitate a periodic evaluation of our operating results relative to those of our peers. Our non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net earnings as an indication of financial performance or to U.S. GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, these measures are not indicative of funds available to fund cash needs or our ability to make cash distributions as they have not been adjusted to consider cash requirements for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, debt service obligations, or other commitments.\nFFO and AFFO\nThe following table reconciles net earnings to FFO and AFFO for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts). All amounts presented include both continuing and discontinued operations as well as our portion of the results of our unconsolidated Atlanta joint venture, the Atlanta Aloft JV, of which we own 80%.\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\nReconciliation of Net earnings to FFO and AFFO\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net earnings $ 1,348 $ 4,639 $ 2,901 $ 23,522 Depreciation and amortization expense 2,085 1,094 6,898 5,190 Depreciation and amortization expense from JV 288 283 1,140 377 Net gain on disposition of assets (2,004 ) (7,318 ) (6,807 ) (23,813 ) Net loss on disposition of assets from JV 3 1 7 2 Impairment loss, net 553 220 2,151 1,477 FFO 2,273 (1,081 ) 6,290 6,755 Dividends declared and undeclared and in kind dividends deemed on preferred stock (165 ) (975 ) (12,244 ) (20,748 ) FFO attributable to common shares and common units 2,108 (2,056 ) (5,954 ) (13,993 ) Net gain on derivatives and convertible debt (20 ) (72 ) (436 ) (6,377 ) Net loss on derivatives from JV - 5 2 5 Acquisitions and terminated transactions expense 80 175 1,250 550 Acquisition expense from JV - 15 - 239 Equity and terminated transactions - - 343 - Loss on debt extinguishment 167 639 967 2,187 Stock-based compensation and LTIP expense 572 77 1,237 305 Amortization of deferred financing fees 340 105 1,066 597 Amortization of deferred financing fees from JV 45 22 181 68 Non-recurring dividends above stated rates declared and undeclared and in kind dividends deemed on preferred stock 20 - 11,110 16,738 AFFO attributable to common shares and common units $ 3,312 $ (1,090 ) $ 9,766 $ 319 FFO attributable to common shares and partnership units - Basic and Diluted $ 2,108 $ (2,056 ) $ (5,954 ) $ (13,993 ) FFO per common share and partnership unit - Basic $ 0.18 $ (2.26 ) $ (0.22 ) $ (15.40 ) FFO per common share and partnership unit - Diluted $ 0.18 $ (2.26 ) $ (0.22 ) $ (15.40 ) Weighted average common shares and partnership units - Basic FFO 11,698,642 910,632 9,558,182 908,593 Weighted average common shares and partnership units - Diluted FFO 11,718,966 910,632 9,558,182 908,593 AFFO attributable to common shares and partnership units - Basic $ 3,312 $ (1,090 ) $ 9,766 $ 319 Convertible note interest 16 - 63 - Preferred dividends at stated rates 144 - 1,134 - AFFO attributable to common shares and partnership units - Diluted $ 3,472 $ (1,090 ) $ 10,963 $ 319 AFFO per common share and partnership unit - Basic $ 0.28 $ (1.20 ) $ 1.02 $ 0.35 AFFO per common share and partnership unit - Diluted $ 0.28 $ (1.20 ) $ 0.98 $ 0.35 Weighted average common shares and partnership units - Basic AFFO 11,698,642 910,632 9,558,182 908,593 Weighted average common shares and partnership units - Diluted AFFO 12,484,346 910,632 11,213,584 908,593 We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), which defines FFO as net earnings or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate assets, impairment, and the depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. FFO is calculated both for the Company in total and as FFO attributable to common shares and partnership units, which is FFO reduced by preferred stock dividends. AFFO is FFO attributable to common shares and partnership units adjusted to exclude items we do not believe are representative of the results from our core operations, including non-cash gains or losses on derivatives and convertible debt, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of certain fees, losses on debt extinguishment, and in-kind dividends above stated rates, and cash charges for acquisition and equity transaction costs. All REITs do not calculate FFO and AFFO in the same manner; therefore, our calculation may not be the same as the calculation of FFO and AFFO for similar REITs.\n﻿We consider FFO to be a useful additional measure of performance for an equity REIT because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that FFO provides a meaningful indication of our performance. We believe that AFFO provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income and FFO, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We present FFO and AFFO per common share and partnership unit because our partnership units are redeemable for common shares. We believe it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO and AFFO applicable to common shares and partnership units.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA\nThe following table reconciles net earnings to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands).

We believe these adjustments can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and amortization and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods. In calculating EBITDA, we add back to net earnings or loss interest expense, loss on debt extinguishment, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we adjust EBITDA to add back net gain/loss on disposition of assets, acquisition and terminated transactions expense, and equity transactions expense, which are cash charges. We also add back impairment, stock –based compensation expense, and gain/loss on derivatives and convertible debt, which are non-cash charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful additional measures of our operating performance, excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense), our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense), and other items we do not believe are representative of the results from our core operations.\nThe Company further excludes general and administrative expenses, other non-operating income or expense, and certain hotel and property operations expenses that are not allocated to individual properties in assessing hotel performance (primarily certain general liability and other insurance costs, land lease costs, and office and banking fees) from Adjusted EBITDA to calculate Hotel EBITDA. Hotel EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nHotel EBITDA is intended to isolate property level operational performance over which the Company’s hotel operators have direct control. We believe Hotel EBITDA is helpful to investors as it better communicates the comparability of our hotels’ operating results for all of the Company’s hotel properties and is used by management to measure the performance of the Company’s hotels and the effectiveness of the operators of the hotels.\nSame-Store Revenue and Hotel EBITDA\nThe following tables present our same-store revenue, Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA margin broken down by property type for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands) and reconcile these same-store measures to total revenue and Hotel EBITDA as presented above. Same-store results include all our hotels owned at December 31, 2017, with the exception of the Residence Inn Austin which was opened on August 3, 2016 (no prior period results available) and reflect the performance of these hotels during the entire period, regardless of our ownership during the period presented. Results for the hotels for periods prior to our ownership were provided to us by prior owners and have not been adjusted by us or audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. All amounts presented include both continuing and discontinued operations as well as our portion of the results of our unconsolidated Atlanta Aloft JV. Results for periods prior to the Company’s ownership have not been included in the Company’s actual consolidated financial statements and are included here only for comparison purposes.\nRevenue - Reconciliation of Same-Store to Actual Three months ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Condor and JV Revenue - Actual $ 17,265 $ 12,384 $ 64,719 $ 53,615 Revenue earned on properties owned at December 31, 2017 prior to the Company's ownership, including the JV prior to ownership and excluding the Residence Inn Austin - 7,378 8,344 34,984 Revenue earned on properties disposed of prior to December 31, 2017 during the period of ownership (367 ) (3,987 ) (5,004 ) (25,069 ) Revenue earned on Residence Inn Austin subsequent to ownership (1,025 ) - (1,386 ) - Total Revenue - Same-Store $ 15,873 $ 15,775 $ 66,673 $ 63,530 Revenue - Same-Store by Type Three months ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 New investment platform $ 13,722 $ 13,377 $ 57,064 $ 54,255 Legacy held for use 767 895 3,612 3,399 Legacy held for sale 1,384 1,503 5,997 5,876 Total Revenue - Same-Store $ 15,873 $ 15,775 $ 66,673 $ 63,530 Hotel EBITDA - Reconciliation of Same-Store to Actual Three months ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Condor and JV Hotel EBITDA - Actual $ 5,950 $ 3,048 $ 21,950 $ 15,021 Hotel EBITDA earned on properties owned at December 31, 2017 prior to the Company's ownership, including the JV prior to ownership and excluding the Residence Inn Austin - 3,056 3,416 13,738 Hotel EBITDA earned on properties disposed of prior to December 31, 2017 during the period of ownership (98 ) (952 ) (1,144 ) (6,330 ) Hotel EBITDA earned on Residence Inn Austin subsequent to ownership (391 ) - (528 ) - Total Hotel EBITDA - Same-Store $ 5,461 $ 5,152 $ 23,694 $ 22,429 Hotel EBITDA - Same-Store by Type Three months ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 New investment platform $ 5,075 $ 4,493 $ 21,175 $ 19,861 Legacy held for use 190 324 1,145 1,124 Legacy held for sale 196 335 1,374 1,444 Total Hotel EBITDA - Same-Store $ 5,461 $ 5,152 $ 23,694 $ 22,429 Hotel EBITDA Margin by Property Type Three months ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Adjusted new investment platform, including JV 37.0 % 33.6 % 37.1 % 36.6 % Legacy held for use 24.8 % 36.2 % 31.7 % 33.1 % Legacy held for sale 14.2 % 22.3 % 22.9 % 24.6 % Total Portfolio 34.4 % 32.7 % 35.5 % 35.3 % Non-GAAP Measures Included in 2018 Guidance and Outlook\nThe following tables reconcile forecast net earnings to forecast FFO and AFFO and forecast EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2018 (in millions, except per share amounts) using the definitions of these non-GAAP measures as discussed above.\nLow High Forecast net earnings $ 1.7 $ 2.5 Depreciation and amortization expense 11.4 11.4 Net gain on disposition of assets - - Forecast FFO 13.1 13.9 Preferred dividends (0.6 ) (0.6 ) Forecast FFO attributable to common shares and common units 12.5 13.3 Acquisitions and terminated transactions expense - - Stock-based compensation and LTIP expense 1.0 1.0 Amortization of deferred financing fees 0.2 0.2 Forecast AFFO attributable to common shares and common units - Basic $ 13.7 $ 14.5 Forecast AFFO attributable to common shares and common units - Diluted $ 14.3 $ 15.1 Forecast AFFO per common share and common unit - Diluted $ 1.13 $ 1.19 Diluted common shares and common units 12.7 12.7 Low High Forecast net earnings $ 1.7 $ 2.5 Interest expense 8.5 8.5 Depreciation and amortization expense 11.4 11.4 Forecast EBITDA 21.5 22.4 Acquisitions and terminated transactions expense - - Stock-based compensation and LTIP expense 1.0 1.0 Net gain on disposition of assets - - Forecast Adjusted EBITDA 22.5 23.4 Cash general and administrative expense and other expenses 6.3 6.3 Forecast Hotel EBITDA (17 Hotels) $ 28.8 $ 29.7 Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc.\nOperating Statistics\nThe following tables present our same-store occupancy, Average Daily Rate (“ADR”), and RevPAR for all our hotels owned at December 31, 2017, with the exception of the Austin Residence Inn, which was opened on August 3, 2016 (no prior period results available).
