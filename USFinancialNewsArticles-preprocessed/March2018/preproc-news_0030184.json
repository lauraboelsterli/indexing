    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 5:21 PM / Updated 41 minutes ago Stoke fears grow as Tosun earns Everton victory Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - STOKE CITY 1 EVERTON 2 Soccer Football - Premier League - Stoke City vs Everton - bet365 Stadium, Stoke-on-Trent, Britain - March 17, 2018 Everton's Cenk Tosun applauds fans after the match Action Images via Reuters/Ed Sykes Turkey forward Cenk Tosun struck twice after the break as Everton beat 10-man Stoke City 2-1 in the snowy Midlands to end a miserable run of away form in the Premier League on Saturday. Slideshow (5 Images) Stoke had Charlie Adam sent off before halftime for a foul on Wayne Rooney but defended resolutely to hold the visitors at bay until the 69th minute when Tosun scored from close range after a goalmouth scramble. When substitute Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting poked in Joe Allen’s free kick in the 77th minute, injuring himself in the process, it seemed second-bottom Stoke might salvage an important point in the relegation scrap. But their hopes were crushed when Tosun beat England keeper Jack Butland with a diving header from Theo Walcott’s delivery to end a run of five straight league defeats on the road for Everton. Stoke remained three points below the safety zone. Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Ed Osmond",
