    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is watching closely ideas floated by British Prime Minister Theresa May to limit London’s role in marketing Russian debt to investors, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.\nFILE PHOTO: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov speaks during a news briefing on the sidelines of the Russia-ASEAN summit in Sochi, Russia, May 19, 2016. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin Speaking to reporters, Peskov said such ideas of limiting access to Russian debt, if implemented, would be harmful for Britain’s relations with other investors.\nAsked about a suggestion that Austria could mediate between Russia and Britain in the case of a spy poisoning in England earlier this month, Peskov told a conference call that Russia needed “any voices that can help London see sense.”\nReporting by Andrey Ostroukh; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
