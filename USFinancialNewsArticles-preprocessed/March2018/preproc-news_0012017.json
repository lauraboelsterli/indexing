It does add to incomes and GDP overall.”\nFigures due Wednesday are forecast to show Australia’s A$1.8 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by around 0.6 percent in the December quarter. That would see annual growth slow to 2.5 percent, from 2.8 percent, but it would still mark more than 26 years without a technical recession.\nThe mix of moderate growth with restrained wages is a major reason the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is likely to keep interest rates at record lows at its March meeting on Tuesday.\nPolicy has been on hold since August 2016 and the central bank has shown no urge to hike rates anytime soon.\nSTILL HIRING The appetite for labour also shows little sign of fading, with job ads holding at six-year peaks in February.\nA survey by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group out on Monday showed the average total number of ads per week was 177,284 in February, up a brisk 13.3 percent compared to a year ago.\n“Business conditions remain elevated, job security continues to improve and capacity utilisation sits at the highest since 2008,” said ANZ’s head of Australian economics David Plank.\n“This suggests further gains in employment and ongoing inroads into the unemployment rate, at least through the first half of the year.”\nMonday’s ABS data suggested firms could afford to pay all the extra hands, with business pre-tax profits climbing 19 percent in the December quarter, from the previous quarter.\nMining alone boasted a rise of 38 percent in profits as commodity prices strengthened, while tourism, manufacturing and utilities all performed strongly.\nThere was also upbeat news for the construction industry as ABS data showed approvals to build new homes surged 17.1 percent in January, far beyond forecasts of a 5 percent increase and recouping almost all of December’s 20.6 percent drop.\nThis series has a pattern of wild swings caused by approvals for large multi-unit blocks, which ballooned 42 percent in January alone.\nYet the underlying trend is proving surprisingly resilient given the boom in home building is already five years old.\n$1 = 1.2882 Australian dollars Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editng by Sam Holmes and Himani Sarkar\n ",
