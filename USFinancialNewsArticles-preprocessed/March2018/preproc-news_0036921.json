    "text": "Company Also Makes Application To Uplist To The OTCQB Platform\nKennett Square, PA, March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Good Gaming, Inc. (OTC PINK: GMER) (the “Company”), owner and operator of a leading esports tournament and social networking platform, is pleased to announce the acquisition of Crypto Strategies Group (referred as “CSG”) as it diversifies into the cryptocurrency market.\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by Blockchain Capital, 30% of those in the 18 to 34 age range would rather invest $1,000 in Bitcoin than $1,000 in government bonds or stocks. The same study also indicates that 42% of millennials have heard about Bitcoin, compared with 15% awareness among those aged 65 and up.\nAccording to a recent article published in Forbes, “The millennial interest in trading cryptocurrencies is hard to ignore, yet they are not the only ones interested in this market. The competition for the coin is expected to become tougher in 2018 as new players enter the domain. It’s safe to say that this year, more institutional investors will start trading cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin.”\nCrypto Strategies Group provides turn-key cryptocurrency mining opportunities by managing low-cost crypto mining facilities for its clients. They provide a simplified and highly scalable investment opportunity for individuals and companies seeking to invest in cryptocurrency mining without the burden of acquiring, housing, maintaining, or programming equipment. This fully managed solution removes typical barriers to mining cryptocurrency and allows both small and large investors the ability to take advantage of this vastly expanding industry with a simplified approach.\nThe goal of Crypto Strategies Group is to offer a smart, easy way for individuals and companies to invest their monies into the cryptocurrency market through mining farms created by the company and owned by the investor. Whether you’re new to the world of cryptocurrencies, a cryptocurrency expert, or a large-scale investor, CSG has developed a plan to suit the needs of every investor.\nWith 30 mining machines already in operation and farming, Crypto Strategies Group currently offers investors an exclusive Operating Agreement to manage, operate and maintain clients’ mining equipment. CSG will then provide all functions necessary to acquire and install the mining equipment. CSG will source and contract for power in their hosting facilities, offer security and insurance of the equipment, provide expert staffing to monitor, maintain and repair the equipment, and conduct all necessary procedures to mine Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. For their effort, CSG will receive a fixed operating fee and split all residual profits with the investors. All investors can be paid in cash, Bitcoin or other forms of cryptocurrency.\nCrypto Strategies Group looks to advance its growth both organically and through strategic acquisitions already identified by the company as they seek to scale the company and take advantage of current opportunities.\nDavid B. Dorwart, Good Gaming CEO, stated, “We believe we have developed a well thought out and successful business model that can quickly scale and turn into a profitable venture. The diversification of Good Gaming into the cryptocurrency market offers us the ability to derive multiple revenue streams into the Company, while also allowing us to take advantage of what we feel will become a significant growth market in the very near future. Our acquisition of Crypto-strategies will also allow us to take advantage of synergies between gamers and bitcoin as we explore opportunities to reward our loyal players with crypto-currencies.” He also stated, “I am also pleased to announce that as a part of our overall corporate strategy and our intent to increase transparency, we have recently filed to uplist to the OTCQB. We feel this is an important step in the evolution of our Company as we continue to grow operations.”\nAll necessary documentation have been filed with OTCMARKETS.com and the Company expects to receive an approval for its QB listing within the next several days.\nPlease visit our website:\nhttps://www.good-gaming.com\nSocial networks:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GoodGamingInc\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/goodgaminginc/?fref=ts\nInvestors Hangout: https://investorshangout.com/Good-Gaming-Inc-GMER-62551/\nAbout Good Gaming :\nGood Gaming is a leading competitive online tournament gaming and social network platform targeting over 250 million eSports players and participants worldwide who want to communicate with each other, develop strategies and compete at novice, competitive and professional levels.
