    "text": "Snap is laying off about 100 engineers — nearly 10 percent of the team — CNBC has learned. \nThe company has seen smaller rounds of layoffs in recent months in its marketing, recruiting and content divisions. These layoffs would be Snap's largest yet and the first to hit the company's engineers. \nThe company last month rolled out the redesign of its pioneering photo messaging app. The redesign separated publisher content from content posted by friends and connections. \nSnap reported roughly 3,000 employees as of the December quarter and said in its first annual filing that it expected \"headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future.\"\nThe company declined to comment.\nBusiness news site Cheddar first reported the layoffs Wednesday. \n--CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report.",
