Corporate Services delivered 17% growth in revenues versus the prior period. Strong sales combined with reduced churn contributed to a 19% increase in quarter over quarter revenues from our OTCQB market. Price increases effective in January 2017 contributed to a 18% increase in OTCQX revenues, which was partially offset by an increase in compliance related downgrades – a result of enhanced OTCQX eligibility standards introduced for 2017. Market Data Licensing revenues saw a 4% increase, with price increases and new sales of our compliance products combined with quarter over quarter increases in reported professional and non-professional users driving that increase. OTC Link revenues were down 3%, largely a result of a drop in in the number of active market participants, partially offset by an increase in message revenues. Operating expenses increased 12% over the prior quarter, the result of a 15% increase in compensation and benefits costs and a 14% increase in information technology costs. Compensation costs in the quarter increased as a result of an increase in headcount, the impact of annual salary increases, an increase in sales commissions and an increase in cash bonus payments accrued in respect of 2017. Fourth quarter compensation costs were also impacted by one-time severance costs of $132 thousand. Net income increased 8%, to $2.9 million for the quarter, reflecting the increase in operating income and a quarter over quarter decrease in our effective tax rate (\"ETR\") from 41.6% to 37.4%. The Company's ETR decreased as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09 related to stock based compensation, the impact of certain benefits recognized from claiming the \"Domestic Production Activities Deduction\" (\"DPAD\") and the lower rate of Corporate Tax available in New York state to entities who meet the criteria of a \"Qualifying Emerging Technology Company\". In the current quarter, the Company recorded additional tax expense of $378 thousand, to reflect the estimated impact associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. The increase in tax expense primarily relates to the remeasurement of the Company's net deferred tax assets at the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. This estimate may be refined in the future as new information becomes available. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, declined marginally versus the prior quarter.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except shares and per share data)\n2017\n2016\n% change\n$ change\nOTC Link\n$ 10,075\n$ 10,573\n(5%)\n( 498 )\nMarket data licensing\n21,922\n21,054\n4%\n868\nCorporate services\n22,659\n19,254\n18%\n3,405\nGross revenues\n54,656\n50,881\n7%\n3,775\nNet revenues\n52,176\n48,565\n7%\n3,611\nOperating expenses\n33,872\n31,638\n7%\n2,234\nIncome from operations\n18,304\n16,927\n8%\n1,377\nOperating profit margin\n35%\n35%\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n18,351\n16,935\n8%\n1,416\nNet income\n$ 12,559\n$ 10,528\n19%\n2,031\nDiluted earnings per share\n$ 1.06\n$ 0.90\n18%\n0.16\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\n$ 1.82\n$ 1.73\n5%\n0.09\nWeighted-average shares outstanding, diluted\n11,566,086\n11,339,603\n2%\nFinancial Highlights\nGross revenues of $54.7 million, up 7% versus the prior year. Corporate Services revenues up 18% for the year. Strong sales combined with reduced churn contributed to a 16% increase in revenues from our OTCQB market. Price increases effective in January 2017 contributed to a 19% increase in OTCQX revenues, which was partially offset by an increase in compliance related downgrades – a result of enhanced OTCQX eligibility standards introduced for 2017. Market Data Licensing revenues up 4%, primarily a result of 2017 price increases related to certain data license products, new sales of our compliance products, an increase in the number of non-professional users consuming our data, offset by modest declines in the number of professional users. OTC Link revenues down 5%, primarily reflecting continued contraction in the number of broker dealer subscribers, which resulted in a decrease in subscription revenue of $473 thousand. Operating expenses for the 2017 fiscal year were up $2.2 million, or 7%, over 2016, with the increase in compensation and benefits costs the primary driver. Compensation costs increased 10%, a result of the impact of increased headcount and annual salary increases, an increase in sales commissions, and an increase in the amortized cost of stock based compensation, largely a result of the higher value of 2016 awards granted in January 2017. Net income increased 19%, or $2.0 million, a result of the 8% increase in income from operations as well as a decrease in the Company's ETR, from 37.8% to 31.6%. The Company's ETR was impacted by its adoption of accounting guidance related to stock based compensation, as well as benefits recognized related to the DPAD and lower New York state corporate tax rate available to certain companies engaged in technology industries. As noted in the quarterly discussion, the Company's ETR was also impacted by the remeasurement of net tax assets in in the context of the enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $21.6 million, or $1.82 per adjusted diluted share.\nBusiness Developments and News\nIn February 2018, launched our new OTCMarkets.com website featuring enhanced functionality and navigation, new compliance data elements and a mobile-friendly interface.
