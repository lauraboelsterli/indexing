Rugby Union - Six Nations Championship - Scotland vs England - BT Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Britain - February 24, 2018. England’s Sam Underhill arrives at the stadium before the match. REUTERS/Russell Cheyne Underhill, who came on as a replacement in England’s 25-13 Six Nations loss to Scotland last month, ruptured a tendon during a training session with the national squad when a team mate trod on his foot. “He’s essentially ruled out for the rest of the season,” Bath director of rugby Todd Blackadder told BBC Radio. The 21-year-old Underhill made his England debut against Argentina last year. Reporting by Ed Osmond; Editing by Toby Davis",
