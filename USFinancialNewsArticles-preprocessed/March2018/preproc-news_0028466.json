(NYSE:BCEI) (the \"Company\") today announces its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial and operating results.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported quarterly and annual production volumes of 14.8 MBoe per day and 16.0 MBoe per day, respectively. As previously announced, these production figures exceeded the high end of the Company's guidance range. As the Company brought online new wells in the back half of the year, the product mix became increasingly oil-weighted as new wells with enhanced completions and choke management increased oil cuts. The oil-weighted growth from these wells along with increased commodity prices resulted in a 6% increase in quarterly revenues, despite the 19% decrease in production volumes from the prior year. The table below provides production data for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Avg. Daily Sales Volumes: 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 % Change 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 % Change Crude oil (Bbls/d) 8,350 9,058 (8)% 8,442 11,776 (28)% Natural gas (Mcf/d) 22,176 29,664 (25)% 25,408 33,419 (24)% Natural gas liquids (Bbls/d) 2,705 4,237 (36)% 3,319 4,336 (23)% Crude oil equivalent (Boe/d) 14,750 18,239 (19)% 15,995 21,682 (26)% Product Mix Crude oil 57 % 50 % 53 % 54 % Natural gas 25 % 27 % 26 % 26 % Natural gas liquids 18 % 23 % 21 % 20 % Average Sales Prices (before derivatives): Crude oil (per Bbl) $ 52.00 $ 41.86 24% $ 47.56 $ 35.31 35% Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 2.23 $ 2.32 (4)% $ 2.39 $ 1.76 36% Natural gas liquids (per Bbl) $ 21.56 $ 14.40 50% $ 18.06 $ 12.39 46% Crude oil equivalent (per Boe) $ 36.73 $ 27.90 32% $ 32.65 $ 24.36 34% Product Revenue (in thousands) $ 49,850 $ 46,823 6% $ 190,617 $ 193,335 (1)% Upon emerging from bankruptcy, the Company focused on reducing operating expenses to right-size its cost structure with the current environment. The table below provides selected cash operating expenses comparatively on a quarterly and annual year-over-year basis.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Operating Expenses 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 % Change 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 % Change Lease operating expense $ 10,066 $ 9,743 3% $ 38,990 $ 43,671 (11)% Gas plant and midstream operating expense $ 3,314 $ 2,628 26% $ 11,882 $ 12,826 (7)% Severance and ad valorem taxes $ 4,748 $ 3,773 26% $ 15,261 $ 15,304 —% General and Administrative $ 11,356 $ 27,474 (59)% $ 57,768 $ 77,065 (25)% On an annual basis, the Company reduced its cash operating costs substantially as a result of various cost-saving measures that were implemented during 2017. While annual costs were reduced year over year, fourth quarter expenses increased compared to 2016. These increased costs resulted from increased well servicing expenses in the Mid-Continent region and implementation costs of compressor swaps that occurred in the Company's Rocky Mountain region. During the fourth quarter, the Company began a program to swap out existing compressors in the Wattenberg field to reduce its future rental fees. Compressor exchanges will continue into 2018 and the associated costs are reflected in the Company's lease operating expense guidance, provided on January 29, 2018. The Company expects its operating expenses to be reduced on a per-unit basis in 2018 as production volumes grow and field-level infrastructure capacity is optimally utilized.\nThe table below provides a regional breakout of the Company's lease operating expense and gas plant and midstream operating expenses.\nRegional Breakout Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Rocky Mountain Mid-Continent Total Company ($M) ($/Boe) ($M) ($/Boe) ($M) ($/Boe) Lease operating expense $ 6,728 $ 6.11 $ 3,338 $ 13.04 $ 10,066 $ 7.42 Gas plant and midstream operating expense 1,802 1.64 1,512 5.90 3,314 2.44 Total $ 8,530 $ 7.75 $ 4,850 $ 18.94 $ 13,380 $ 9.86 Reported net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $67.3 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $27.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in GAAP and adjusted net income over the prior year was driven by improved cost structure, greater oil-weighted production and an increase in commodity prices over the prior period.\nAdjusted EBITDAX for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $21.6 million, a 49% increase compared to $14.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDAX are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the respective reconciliations in the schedules at the end of this release for additional information about these measures.\nThe table below summarizes the Company's annual results as compared to previously provided guidance.\nGuidance vs Actual Summary Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Guidance Actual Production (MBoe/d) 15.7 – 15.9 16.0 Lease operating expense ($/Boe) $6.50 – $7.00 $ 6.68 Midstream ($/Boe) $1.90 – $2.10 $ 2.04 Cash G&A ($MM)* $41 – $43 $ 44 Production taxes (% of pre-derivative realization) 7% – 8% 8.0 % CAPEX ($MM) $108 – $115 $ 110 * Cash G&A guidance is a non-GAAP measure that is exclusive of the Company's stock based compensation. The Company does not guide to GAAP G&A expense as it has excessive uncertainty due to the stock based compensation portion of GAAP G&A. Please refer to the non-GAAP disclosure at the end of this release for information regarding cash G&A. The Company reported annual production above the high-end of guidance. With the exception of cash G&A, costs and capital were reported within the guided range. The Company's cash G&A expense for the year was above the high end of the Company's 2017 guidance range as a result of higher than expected advisory fees in the fourth quarter related to the previously proposed merger with SandRidge Energy, Inc.\n2017 Proved Reserves, Costs Incurred, and Finding and Development Costs\nAs previously reported, Bonanza Creek's year-end 2017 proved reserves were 102.0 MMBoe, which represented a 13% increase from 2016. The Company's year-end 2017 proved reserves were comprised of 52.9 MMBbls of oil, 22.8 MMBbls of NGLs, and 157.7 Bcf of natural gas and were 53% proved developed. At year end the Company's proved reserves PV-10 utilizing SEC pricing was $598 million. If SEC pricing for oil and gas increased by 10% to $56.47 per barrel WTI and $3.28 per Mcf Henry Hub, the Company's proved reserves PV-10 would increase by 27% to $760 million. If, rather than flat pricing, 2017 year-end strip pricing is used, the Company's PV-10 value for its proved reserves would be $656 million. Please see Schedule 9 at the end of this release for information on SEC pricing and a reconciliation from PV-10 to the GAAP figure \"Standardized Measure of Oil and Gas.\" All-in finding and development costs for 2017 were $7.46 per Boe, based on the Company's 2017 costs incurred of $127.5 million and all-in additions of 17,090 MBoe. A breakout of the Company's costs incurred are provided in the table below.\nCosts Incurred\n(in thousands) For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Acquisition (1) $ 5,828 Development (2) 117,229 Exploration 4,440 Total (3) $ 127,497 (1) Acquisition costs for unproved properties were $5.8 million. There were no acquisition costs for proved properties in 2017.\n(2) Development costs include workover costs of $6.1 million.\n(3) Includes amounts relating to asset retirement obligations of $8.3 million.\nProved Reserve Roll-Forward\nMBoe Balance as of December 31, 2016 90,651 Extensions, discoveries and infills 15,547 Revisions to previous estimates 1,543 Production (5,719 ) Balance as of December 31, 2017 102,022 2018 Production, Capital, and Expense Guidance\nThe table below reiterates the Company's previously provided 2018 guidance:\nGuidance Summary Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2018 Production (MBoe/d) 16.0 - 16.6 17.7 - 18.7 LOE ($/Boe) $5.00 - $6.00 Midstream expense ($/Boe) $1.40 - $1.80 Recurring cash G&A ($MM) (1) $1.40 - $1.80 Production taxes (% of pre-derivative realization) 7% - 8% Total CAPEX ($MM) $280 - $320 Rockies Oil Differential (2) $5.85 off WTI (1) Recurring cash G&A guidance is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as GAAP G&A expense less stock based compensation and anticipated costs for permanent CEO compensation. The Company does not guide to GAAP G&A expense as it has excessive uncertainty due to the stock based compensation portion of GAAP G&A. Please refer to the Non-GAAP disclosure at the end of this release for information regarding Recurring cash G&A. (2) Assumes strip pricing as of January 23, 2018. Operational Update\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company turned online two adjacent pads in its central legacy acreage, the J21 and T21, which now have approximately 120 days of production data. These two pads consisted of a total of five wells, two SRL and three XRL, and tested an average of approximately 1,700 pounds of proppant per lateral foot. One of the SRL wells on the T21 pad utilized a slick-water completion design, which increased the fluid intensity by over 100%. While the wells on both of the pads are generally 5 performing in line with expectations, the one slick-water well on the T21 pad stands out with significant outperformance when compared to the other wells on these adjacent pads. The slick-water SRL that was tested in the central acreage is tracking the performance of the 500 MBoe per well average of the North Platte 44-13 pad on the Company's west acreage. The Company is very encouraged by the slick-water results and plans to test additional slick-water designs in the first half of the year in various portions of the Company's Wattenberg acreage.\nAt the beginning of 2018, the Company turned online its 8-SRL F26 pad, which utilized an average of approximately 2,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and has also recently turned online its first French Lake well. The Company is currently drilling its four XRL B-28 pad on its eastern acreage and is completing its remaining seven French Lake wells. These remaining French Lake wells are expected to be turned online by the end of the second quarter.\nThe Company has provided an updated investor presentation to its website, under the \"For Investors\" section of its corporate website at www.bonanzacrk.com .

Schedule 6: Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts, unaudited)\nAdjusted net income (loss) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company defines adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss) after adjusting first for (1) the impact of certain non-cash items, including unrealized gains and losses on unsettled derivative instruments, impairment of oil and gas properties, other similar non-cash charges (2) one-time transactions and then (3) the non-cash and one time items’ impact on taxes based on an applicable rate that approximates the Company's effective tax rate in each period. Adjusted net income (loss) is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by GAAP.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss (GAAP) to adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP):\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net loss $ (5,768 ) $ (67,334 ) $ (2,360 ) $ (198,950 ) Adjustments to net loss: Derivative (gain) loss 12,603 (490 ) 15,365 11,234 Derivative cash settlements (1,464 ) 2,584 (1,464 ) 18,333 Impairment of proved properties — — — 10,000 Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties — 229 — 24,692 Exploratory dry hole expense — (33 ) 3,006 872 Stock-based compensation (1) 1,035 1,643 13,746 8,892 Advisor fees related to CEO transition and strategic alternatives (1) 2,774 14,457 2,774 20,375 Cash severance costs (1) — — 1,605 2,162 Pre-petition advisory fees (1) — — 683 — Post-petition restructuring fees (1) — — 3,740 — Reorganization items — — (8,808 ) — Gain on termination fee — — — 6,000 Contract settlement expense — 21,000 — 21,000 Total adjustments before taxes 14,948 39,390 30,647 123,560 Income tax effect (912 ) — (4,199 ) — Total adjustments after taxes $ 14,036 $ 39,390 $ 26,448 $ 123,560 Adjusted net income (loss) $ 8,268 $ (27,944 ) $ 24,088 $ (75,390 ) Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share (2) $ 0.40 $ (0.57 ) $ 1.18 $ (1.53 ) Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding (2) 20,454 49,388 20,427 49,268 (1) Included as a portion of general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations. (2) For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company used the Successor's diluted weighted average share count to calculate adjusted net income per diluted share. Schedule 7: Adjusted EBITDAX\n(in thousands, except per share amounts, unaudited)\nAdjusted EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company defines adjusted EBITDAX as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, impairment, exploration expenses and other similar non-cash and non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP financial measures of net income (loss) to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDAX.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income (loss) $ (5,768 ) $ (67,334 ) $ (2,360 ) $ (198,950 ) Exploration 3,386 3 7,444 946 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 9,126 26,613 49,377 111,215 Impairment of proved properties — — — 10,000 Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties — 229 — 24,692 Stock-based Compensation (1) 1,035 1,643 13,746 8,892 Cash severance costs (1) — — 1,605 2,162 Advisor fees related to CEO search and strategic alternatives (1) 2,774 14,457 2,774 20,375 Gain on termination fee — — — (6,000 ) Contract settlement expense — 21,000 — 21,000 Pre-petition advisory fees (1) — — 683 — Post-petition restructuring fees (1) — — 3,740 — Reorganization items — — (8,808 ) — Interest expense 313 15,842 6,429 62,058 Derivative (gain) loss 12,603 (490 ) 15,365 11,234 Derivative cash settlements (1,464 ) 2,584 (1,464 ) 18,333 Income tax (benefit) expense (376 ) — (376 ) — Adjusted EBITDAX $ 21,629 $ 14,547 $ 88,155 $ 85,957 (1) Included as a portion of general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Schedule 9: PV-10 of Estimated Proved Reserves\nPV-10 is derived from the Standardized Measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10%. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our PV-10 measure and the Standardized Measure do not purport to present the fair value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP Standardized Measure to the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10.\nDecember 31, (in thousands) 2017 PV-10 (1) 598,498 Present value of future income taxes discounted at 10% (2) — Standardized Measure $ 598,498 (1) The 12-month average benchmark pricing used to estimate SEC proved reserves and PV-10 value for crude oil and natural gas was $51.34 per Bbl of WTI crude oil and $2.98 per MMBtu of natural gas at Henry Hub before differential adjustments. Year-end 2017 benchmark prices for oil, and natural gas were both 20% higher from year-end 2016 SEC pricing. After differential adjustments, the Company's SEC pricing realizations for year-end 2017 were $46.76 per Bbl of oil, $19.57 per Bbl of NGLs, and $2.45 per Mcf of natural gas. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Disclosure at the end of this release for information regarding PV-10 (2) The tax basis of the Company's oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2017 provides more tax deduction than income generation when reserve estimates were prepared using 2017 SEC pricing. Schedule 10: Cash G&A\n(in thousands, unaudited)\nCash G&A is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company defines cash G&A as GAAP general and administrative expense exclusive of the Company's stock based compensation and one-time charges, such as severance costs and advisor fees. The Company refers to cash G&A to provide typical cash G&A costs that are planned for in a given period. Cash G&A is not a fully inclusive measure of general and administrative expense as determined by GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP financial measures of G&A expense to the non-GAAP financial measure of cash G&A.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 General and Administrative Expense $ 11,356 $ 15,181 $ 57,768 $ 77,065 Stock Compensation (1,035 ) (2,646 ) (13,746 ) (8,892 ) Cash G&A 10,321 12,535 44,022 68,173\nSource:Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc.",
