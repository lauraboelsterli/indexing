I look forward to working with the Corindus team on their mission of advancing vascular robotic technology to further improve patient care.\"\nAbout Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc.\nCorindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. is a global technology leader in robotic-assisted vascular interventions. The company's CorPath ® System is the first FDA-cleared medical device to bring robotic precision to percutaneous coronary and percutaneous vascular procedures. During the procedure, the interventional cardiologist sits at a radiation-shielded workstation to advance guide catheters, stents, and guidewires with millimeter-by-millimeter precision. The workstation allows the physician greater control and the freedom from wearing heavy lead protective equipment that causes musculoskeletal injuries. With the CorPath System, Corindus Vascular Robotics brings robotic precision to interventional procedures to help optimize clinical outcomes and minimize the costs associated with complications of improper stent placement during manual procedures. Corindus stands behind its product with its unique $1,000 hospital credit \"One Stent Program.\" For additional information, visit www.corindus.com , and follow @CorindusInc.\nForward Looking Statements\nStatements made in this release that are not statements of historical or current facts are \" \" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
