A segment dedicated to the issues was narrated by Ashley Judd, Salma Hayek and Annabella Sciorra, three of the dozens of women who have accused Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, helping touch off the #MeToo movement. Weinstein has denied having nonconsensual sex with anyone. The women described 2017, which included blockbuster and critically acclaimed films that were not centred on white men - from female-led action movie“Wonder Woman” to racial satire“Get Out” - as a move toward a more inclusive film industry. “The changes we are witnessing are being driven by the powerful sound of new voices, of different voices, of our voices, joining together in a mighty chorus that is finally saying:‘Time’s up,’” Judd said. 90th Academy Awards - Oscars Show - Hollywood, California, U.S., 04/03/2018 - Ashley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Time’s Up, launched on Jan. 1, is a legal defence fund that aims to support people reporting sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond. “So we salute those unstoppable spirits who kicked ass and broke through the biased perceptions of their race their genders and their ethnicities,” Hayek said.

Pakistani-American actor and writer Kumail Nanjiani said during his clip that producers should work with women and people of colour not only because they deserved representation but also“because you get rich.” Hollywood has been roiled by the sexual misconduct scandal, which has led to dozens of once powerful men stepping down or being dropped from creative projects.
