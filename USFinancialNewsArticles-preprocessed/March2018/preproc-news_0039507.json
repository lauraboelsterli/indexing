In his new role as Far West Division President, Cook will oversee operations for eight hospitals, nine surgery centers and numerous other outpatient locations in California and Nevada.\n“Brian has excelled in leadership positions in multiple communities served by HCA,” said Chuck Hall, President of HCA’s National Group. “He is a bright, skilled and experienced hospital operator with a deep understanding HCA’s culture as well as a passion for his employees and the patients we serve. We are pleased to welcome him to the Far West Division.”\nCook joined HCA in 2003 and has served in numerous hospital leadership roles in Florida and Tennessee. He was CEO of Parkridge East Hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee from 2009-2012 before serving as CEO of Capital Regional Medical Center in Tallahassee from 2012-2014. After that, Cook was named CEO of North Florida Regional Medical Center.\nCook is a graduate of Florida State University and earned his MBA at Rollins College’s Crummer Graduate School of Business.\nA 19-year veteran of HCA, Rogers has been President of HCA’s Far West Division for the last 10 years. He joined HCA in 1999 as CEO of Riverside Community Hospital in California. In 2003, Rogers was named President of HCA’s Midwest Division following the acquisition of Health Midwest, a 12-hospital system in Kansas City. He was instrumental in transitioning the new hospitals as well as implementing many operational improvements and significantly expanding services.\n“Bryan is a charismatic and forward-thinking leader who successfully guided two HCA divisions,” Hall said. “He led the successful integration of Health Midwest in Kansas City at a pivotal time and more recently oversaw a number of major expansion projects that enabled us to better serve patients in California and Nevada. Bryan has had an impressive career, and we wish him well in retirement.”\nAbout HCA Healthcare\nNashville-based HCA Healthcare is one of the nation's leading providers of healthcare services, operating 178 locally managed hospitals and approximately 1,800 outpatient facilities, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom.
