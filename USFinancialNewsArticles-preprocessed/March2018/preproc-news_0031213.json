    "text": "March 14, 2018 / 7:48 PM / a minute ago Brazil's BNDES CEO denies talks with investors on meatpacker JBS stake Reuters Staff 1 Min Read SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Brazilian development bank BNDES on Wednesday denied media reports that its investment arm BNDESPar is in talks with foreign investors about a potential sale of its stake in meatpacker JBS SA ( JBSS3.SA ). FILE PHOTO - Paulo Rabello de Castro (L), the new CEO of Brazil's development bank BNDES, speaks during a ceremony in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Pilar Olivares JBS is one of the companies in which the investment is not yet mature because of a low standard of corporate governance, CEO Paulo Rabello de Castro said at the Latin America World Economic Forum in Sao Paulo. When asked about a BNDES stake in pulpmaker Fibria Celulose SA ( FIBR3.SA ), Rabello de Castro declined to comment on talks with Paper Excellence BV and Suzano Papel e Celulose SA ( SUZB3.SA ). He declined to answer questions about which proposal would be chosen by the bankâ€™s investment arm. Reporting by Tatiana Bautzer; writing by Ana Mano; editing by Grant McCool",
