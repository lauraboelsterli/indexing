    "text": "FedEx reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations on Tuesday. \nHere's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: EPS: $3.72 vs. $3.11, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $16.52 billion vs. $16.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters \nIn the year ago quarter, FedEx reported earnings of $2.30 a share on $15 billion in revenue. \nShares rose more than 3 percent in after-hours trade. \nFedEx CFO Alan Graf Jr. said the company is raising its fiscal 2018 outlook due to foreign tax benefits, U.S. tax reform and the company's improved operating performance. \nThe company now expects full-year earnings, before certain pension accounting adjustments, to be between $17.90 and $18.30 per share. \nIn December, FedEx said the Republican-backed tax bill would deliver a $1.5 billion boost this year. As a result, FedEx had raised its forecast. \nFollowing tax reform, FedEx announced it will invest $1.5 billion to modernize and expand its Indianapolis shipping hub as well as $1 billion for its Memphis, Tennessee hub. \nThe stock closed at $251.99 on Tuesday and is up about 31 percent in the last 12 months versus the S&P 500's 14 percent return. \nShares have recovered somewhat after tumbling in February on reports that Amazon will launch a competing package delivery service called Shipping with Amazon. \nThis is breaking news.
