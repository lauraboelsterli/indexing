Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - FC Barcelona vs Athletic Bilbao - Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain - March 18, 2018 Barcelona’s Lionel Messi celebrates scoring their second goal REUTERS/Albert Gea Paco Alcacer took the place of suspended striker Luis Suarez in the starting line-up and scored a first goal in three months to put Barca ahead in the eighth minute at the Nou Camp, side-footing home a pass from Jordi Alba. Lionel Messi scored for the sixth game in a row in all competitions and for the 25th time in this league campaign when he doubled Barca’s lead in the 30th minute with a deadly strike into the bottom corner from the edge of the area. Atletico forward Antoine Griezmann won and converted a penalty to put his side ahead at Villarreal in the 20th minute. However, Turkey striker Enes Unal headed in a deserved equaliser in the 82nd and then struck the winner from close range in stoppage time. The visitors had forward Vitolo sent off moments later. Barca lead the standings on 75 points with nine games remaining. Champions Real Madrid were in action at home to Girona later on Sunday. The Catalans were rampant in the first half and could have taken a heavier lead into the break as Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho hit the woodwork twice and his compatriot Paulinho struck a post.

Slideshow (5 Images) “The two halves were very different, perhaps conditioned by the first. There weren’t many chances in the second half, for us or them.” Earlier on Sunday, Sevilla suffered a hangover from their Champions League triumph over Manchester United as they lost 2-1 at mid-table Leganes, their sixth defeat in 12 league games under coach Vincenzo Montella. The visitors went behind four minutes before halftime to a looping header from defender Unai Bustinza. Forward Javier Eraso side-footed home a second goal for the home side in the 69th minute and things got worse for Sevilla when midfielder Pablo Sarabia was sent off in the 84th for picking up two yellow cards inside 11 minutes. Miguel Layun pulled a goal back in stoppage time for Sevilla, who are fifth in the standings on 45 points. Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Toby Davis and Christian Radnedge",
