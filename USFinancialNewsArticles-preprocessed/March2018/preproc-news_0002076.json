    "text": "EDINBURGH, March 1 (Reuters) - Britain’ biggest floor coverings retailer Carpetright said on Thursday it was in talks with banks to see how to shore up its balance sheet, forecasting a small pretax loss in the full year - its third warning in four months.\nA drop in sales due to“difficult” consumer confidence had led the retailer to last warn on full-year profit in January.\n“Lenders have indicated that they currently remain fully supportive,” it said, adding that other unspecified options to accelerate a turnaround were also under review.\nCarpetright said that while a trend in like-for-like British sales has improved it remained negative. Trading in the rest of Europe division had also improved, led by a recovery in like-for-like sales in the Netherlands. (Reporting by Elisabeth O’Leary, editing by James Davey)\n ",
