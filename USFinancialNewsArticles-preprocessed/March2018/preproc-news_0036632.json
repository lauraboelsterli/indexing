    "text": "Front-Line Combination Study with Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel to begin patient enrollment early in 2 nd Quarter Raised $1.3M in private financing\nMINNEAPOLIS, March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sun BioPharma, Inc. (OTCQB:SNBP), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing disruptive therapeutics for the treatment of pancreatic diseases, today provides a business update and reports financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFront-Line Combination PDA Study\nThe Company’s clinical team, working in conjunction with its medical advisors and potential physician investigators, has completed development of the protocol for its study of SBP-101 administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in newly diagnosed patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDA”). The study includes a dose-escalation phase with sequential cohorts of patients receiving up to six months of treatment at each of three dose levels. The dose-escalation phase is to be followed by an expansion phase at the optimal dose level. Contract research organizations have been engaged to assist in managing the study at one site in the United States, the University of Florida where SBP-101 was invented, and at three sites in Australia. Enrollment is expected to begin early in the second quarter of 2018:\nCompletion of Phase 1 Dose Escalation Safety Trial\nAs previously announced, the Company completed its Phase 1 dose escalation safety study using SBP-101 for patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDA”). In total, 29 patients were enrolled in the study, 24 had received multiple prior chemotherapy regimens. Study data has been reviewed by the clinical team and compiled into an abstract that has been submitted for an upcoming cancer conference. When appropriate, that additional data will be disclosed by the Company. In addition, the Company is in the process of compiling a final clinical study report that is expected to be complete by the end of the second quarter of 2018.\nPrivate Placement of Common Stock and Warrants\nOn February 20, 2018 and March 16, 2018 the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (the “2018 Purchase Agreements”) with a number of accredited purchasers. Pursuant to these closings under the 2018 Purchase Agreements we issued 252,200 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 252,200 additional shares, resulting in gross proceeds of $1.3 million.\nFinancial Results for the Three Months and Full Year Ended December 31, 2017\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses decreased 7.4% to $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. G&A expenses increased 28.5% to $3.4 million in 2017, up from $2.7 million in 2016. The decrease in the fourth quarter was caused primarily by reduced stock-based compensation expense partially offset by costs incurred in connection with efforts to complete a public offering in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase for the full year of 2017 resulted from an overall increase in stock-based compensation and costs incurred in connection with efforts to complete a public offering in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by decreased license fees due to the University of Florida.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses decreased 24.8% to $638,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 down from $848,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. R&D expenses for the full year of 2017 increased 3.6% to $2.6 million as compared with $2.5 million for 2016. The decrease in fourth quarter resulted from decreased clinical trial and related costs for our Phase 1 clinical study partially offset by contract research costs incurred under an NIH sponsored pancreatitis study. The slight overall increase in R&D expenses for 2017 resulted from an increase in stock-based compensation and contract research costs incurred under an NIH sponsored pancreatitis study partially offset by decreased costs for our Phase 1 clinical trial.\nOther expense, net, was $428,000 in the current quarter compared to $213,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Other expense, net, increased to $4.9 million for the full year 2017, up from $285,000 in the prior year. The increase in the current quarter was primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from the amortization of the discount on the 2017 convertible notes payable, partially offset by grant income earned during the current year received under a research grant awarded to the Company in September 2016. On a year-to-date basis, the increase was due primarily to charges recorded related to the induced conversion of debt and increased interest expense resulting from the amortization of the discount on the 2017 convertible notes payable. These expenses were partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains recognized by our Australian subsidiary and grant income earned during the current year period.\nNet loss for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.2 million, or $0.58 and $0.34 per diluted share, respectively. The net loss for the full year 2017 was $10.4 million, or $2.91 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.1 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, for 2016.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nTotal cash resources were $152,000 as of December 31, 2017, compared to $438,000 as of December 31, 2016. Total current assets were $767,000 and $877,000 as of December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. These decreases resulted primarily from the Company’s use of cash to fund operations in the current year offset by proceeds raised from the sale of convertible promissory notes during the first quarter of 2017.\nCurrent liabilities decreased to $4.2 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $5.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in current liabilities resulted primarily from the conversion of approximately $3.1 million of previously outstanding debt and accrued interest into 418,332 shares of our common stock partially offset by the accreted carrying value of the convertible promissory notes sold during the first quarter of 2017 and increased accrued expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net cash used in each of these periods primarily reflects the net loss for these periods, and was partially offset by the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the net loss is also offset by non-cash charges recorded for the loss on induced debt conversion and the amortization of the debt discount.\nAbout SBP-101\nSBP-101 is a first-in-class, proprietary, polyamine compound designed to exert therapeutic effects in a mechanism specific to the pancreas. Sun BioPharma originally licensed SBP-101 from the University of Florida Research Foundation in 2011. The molecule has been shown to be highly effective in preclinical studies of human pancreatic cancer models, demonstrating superior activity to existing FDA-approved chemotherapy agents. Combination therapy potential has also been shown for pancreatic cancer. SBP-101 is expected to differ from current pancreatic cancer therapies in that it specifically targets the exocrine pancreas and has shown efficacy against primary and metastatic disease in animal models of human pancreatic cancer. Therefore management believes that SBP-101 may effectively treat both primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer, while leaving the insulin-producing islet cells and non-pancreatic tissue unharmed.\nAbout Sun BioPharma\nSun BioPharma Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing disruptive therapeutics for urgent unmet medical needs. The Company’s development programs target diseases of the pancreas, including pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis; the Company’s initial product candidate is SBP-101 for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.
