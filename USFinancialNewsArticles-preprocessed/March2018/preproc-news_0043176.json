    "text": "LAS VEGAS, March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Following its FDA clearance in May 2017, today, Convexity Scientific (Booth #777), a medtech company committed to innovative design and distribution strategies, unveiled its FLYP™ nebulizer, a game-changing handheld nebulizer that is poised to disrupt how physicians treat pulmonary conditions such as asthma and COPD.\n\"FLYP ™ is literally breathing new life into the nebulizer market by offering physicians a solution that puts convenience, portability and busy lifestyles at the forefront of how they treat patients with debilitating respiratory conditions, without compromising efficacy or patient outcomes,\" said Jim Daniels, CEO of Convexity Scientific. He added, \"We founded Convexity to conceive of and develop next generation medical devices with patients' lifestyles in mind and we look forward to sharing our first innovation, the FLYP ™ nebulizer, with thousands of top healthcare providers and industry leaders at Medtrade Spring.\"\nSmaller and lighter than a smartphone, FLYP ™ is a pocket-portable and virtually silent nebulizer that can be used at home or in a healthcare facility. The \"all-in-one\" design means that there are no tubes or control units—users just fill, click, breathe.\n\"For patients suffering from asthma, COPD and other lung-related diseases, FLYP ™ offers a convenient and effective alternative to preventing and managing flare-ups,\" said Dr. Ralph Finger, Co-Founder and Chairman of Convexity Scientific and inventor of FLYP. \"For years, the patient has been asked to fit their life to their nebulizer. Now with FLYP, there's a nebulizer that fits into their life.\"\nWith HypersoniQ™ technology, FLYP ™ utilizes an internal disk that vibrates at an ultrasonic speed. When medication passes through the disk's holes, it produces an inhalable aerosol mist, delivering medication deep into the lungs where it is most effective. Because the disk vibrates 110,000 times per second, the time it takes to dispense the medication is significantly shortened to about seven minutes for most medications.\nPowered by a USB rechargeable lithium-ion battery that lasts 10 treatments between recharging, FLYP ™ allows patients to stop wasting time and money on disposable batteries. FLYP ™ optimizes portability and usability, which may result in increased compliance to recommended treatment schedules.\nFLYP ™ is available at flypnebulizer.com for $249.99.\nAbout Convexity Scientific\nConvexity Scientific Inc. is a Fairfield, Connecticut-based medical technology company that is developing the next generation of devices with patients' lifestyles in mind. The company's first medical device, the FLYP™ handheld nebulizer for respiratory diseases, demonstrates Convexity's commitment to transforming medical devices with radical reinventions. FLYP is FDA cleared to treat patients ages 13 and up.
