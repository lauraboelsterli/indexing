All amounts are in US dollars unless otherwise stated.\n2017 - The Year in Review\nGold production of 206,400 ounces compared to 2016 production of 240,200 ounces\nTotal cash cost 1 of $655 per ounce sold and all-in-sustaining cost 1 of $942 per ounce sold\nGold sales of $259.0 million compared to $300.5 million in 2016\nNet income attributable to equity shareholders of $20.0 million compared to $34.2 million in 2016\nCash flows from operating activities 2 of $107.0 million compared to $142.2 million for the same period in 2016\nDrawdown of incremental $60.0 million from Credit Facility with Macquarie Bank Limited in June 2017\nFourth Quarter 2017 - in Review\nGold production of 49,500 ounces compared to 55,100 ounces for the same period in 2016 Gold sales of $63.0 million compared to $69.1 million for the same period in 2016 Total cash cost 1 of $667 per ounce sold and all-in-sustaining cost 1 of $982 per ounce sold Net income attributable to equity shareholders of $1.6 million compared to net loss of $4.9 million for the same period in 2016 Cash flows from operating activities 2 of $25.4 million compared to $30.4 million for the same period in 2016\n1 Total cash cost and all-in sustaining cost are non-IFRS financial performance measures with no standard definition under IFRS. See the “Non-IFRS financial performance measures\" defined at the end of this press release.\n2 Cash flows from operating activities exclude changes in non-cash working capital items.\nMana, Burkina Faso Mining Operations 2017 2016 Variation Operating Data Mining Waste mined (tonnes) 16,913,100 16,686,800 1 % Ore mined (tonnes) 2,268,100 2,175,700 4 % Operational stripping ratio 7.5 7.7 (3 %) Capitalized Stripping Activity Waste material – Siou (tonnes) 12,607,300 12,263,200 3 % Waste material – Fofina (tonnes) — 2,820,300 (100 %) Waste material – Wona (tonnes) 9,189,900 3,252,400 183 % 21,797,200 18,335,900 19 % Total strip ratio 17.1 16.1 6 % Processing Ore processed (tonnes) 2,136,100 2,329,500 (8 %) Low grade material (tonnes) 603,800 423,800 42 % Tonnes processed (tonnes) 2,739,900 2,753,300 — % Head grade (g/t) 2.46 2.88 (15 %) Recovery (%) 95 94 1 % Gold ounces produced 206,400 240,200 (14 %) Gold ounces sold 205,300 240,600 (15 %) Statistics (in dollars) Average realized selling price (per ounce) 1,261 1,249 1 % Cash operating cost (per tonne processed)¹ 46 43 7 % Total cash cost (per ounce sold)¹ 655 548 20 % All-in sustaining cost (per ounce sold)¹ 942 720 31 % Depreciation (per ounce sold)² 460 324 42 % The total cash cost 1 of $655 per ounce sold and all-in sustaining cost 1 of $942 per ounce were anticipated and are both due to a lower head grade and higher cash operating cost per tonne 1 , the latter being mainly caused by negative foreign exchange fluctuations.\nThe year-over-year variation in head grade in 2017 resulted from geological issues in the upper portion of Zone 9 early in the year. In addition, the variation is due to the processing of 603,800 tonnes of low-grade material not included in our reserves. This results from the decision to take advantage of higher gold prices and available milling capacity in order to generate additional cash flow. Without this, the head grade would have been 2.96 g/t Au.\nThe 2017 increase in depreciation in property, plant and equipment and depreciation per ounce sold mainly reflects a higher capitalized stripping ratio from Siou at depth compared to the same period in 2016.\n1 Cash operating cost, total cash cost and all-in sustaining cost are non-IFRS financial performance measures with no standard definition under IFRS. See the “Non-IFRS financial performance measures\" defined at the end of this press release.\n2 Depreciation per ounce sold is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standard definition under IFRS and represents the depreciation expense per ounce sold.\n2017 Reserves and Resources\nAs at December 31, 2017, total proven and probable mineral reserves stood at 29.4 million tonnes averaging 3.37 g/t Au for 3.2 million ounces as compared to 28.2 million tonnes at 3.31 g/t Au for 3.0 million ounces at the end of 2016. The increase in reserves is due to additions at Boungou and Mana, with the latter offset by SEMAFO production of 206,400 ounces of gold in 2017.\nMeasured and indicated mineral resources remained constant at 48.4 million tonnes averaging 2.00 g/t Au for 3.1 million ounces.\nMana Pre-feasibility Study\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we announced a positive pre-feasibility study (PFS) for Mana that added 188,000 ounces of mineral reserves before depletion, primarily at Siou underground.\nThe Mana PFS, which investigated the potential for extracting the deeper zone of the Siou deposit through underground operations, envisages pre-production capital of $51.7 million and development start-up in the third quarter of 2018. With mineral reserves of 18.2 million tonnes at 2.92 g/t Au for 1.7 million ounces, Mana annual production should average over 200,000 ounces between 2019 and 2023 at an all-in sustaining cost of $810 per ounce at a gold price of $1,200 per ounce. Access to the 2,000-tpd contract mining operation will be through a single portal and a 5.5- by 5.5-meter ramp at a 14-gradient slope. Given our $222 million cash and restricted cash position at year-end 2017 and anticipated cash flow from operations, pre-production capital expenditure will be financed with existing cash.\n2018 Milestones for Development of Siou Underground\nFiling of NI 43-101 technical report on SEDAR in first quarter Negotiation and signing of contract with underground contractor in second quarter Completion of detailed engineering in second quarter Commencement of infrastructures work in second quarter Completion of environmental and social impact assessment and mining permit in third quarter Mobilization of contractor on site in third quarter Commencement of portal preparation and underground development in third quarter\nBoungou\nTotal proven and probable reserves at Boungou Mine amounted to 11.2 million tonnes averaging 4.11 g/t Au for 1,5 million ounces of gold, an increase of 16% compared to year-end 2016. The increase in mineral reserves is mainly attributable to the expansion of probable reserves located on the West Flank Sector adjacent to known reserves. An internal trade-off study conducted on the West Flank Sector in 2017 concluded that open-pit mining was a mining approach superior to an underground operation as it provided better financial returns.\nAll mineral resources reported are exclusive of mineral reserves. Gold price assumptions for mineral reserves and resources at Mana and Tapoa (Boungou Mine) were $1,200 and $1,400 per ounce, respectively. For further details, refer to our press release of February 15, 2018.\n2018 Exploration\nExploration expenditure for 2018 has been set at $26 million, $9 million of which will be spent at Tapoa (Boungou), $7 million at Mana, $4 million at Nabanga, $3 million at Bantou and the remaining $3 million at Korhogo.\nThe 2018 exploration at Mana includes 10,000 meters of core, 25,000 meters of reverse-circulation (“RC”) and 60,000 meters of auger drilling. The core drill program will primarily target the Siou area with the aim of assessing the north part of Siou at depth. The Bara Trend located some 20 kilometers from the Mana mill will see extensive drilling in the first quarter, including follow-up work on significant RC results and untested auger anomalies.\nAt Boungou, the 2018 exploration program comprises 42,000 meters of RC and 60,000 meters of auger drilling. The bulk of the RC drill work will test regional gold anomalies on the Boungou proximal, Dangou, Pambourou and 045 Trend Sectors.\nThe 2018 core drill program at the Nabanga deposit, which will be carried out in the first half of the year, will test lateral and at-depth extension of the mineralization. Furthermore, the Corporation will carry out core and RC drill programs on the Korhogo and Bantou areas following a series of prospective results in 2017.\nUpdate on Boungou Mine Construction\nConstruction of the Boungou Mine continues to advance on time and on budget. As at January 31, 2018, the following achievements had been made:\nAddition of 203,000 ounces of reserves Development on budget with $171 million of the $231 million capital expenditure incurred Construction 83% completed Cash and restricted cash of $222 million as at December 31, 2017 Completion of about 90% of structural steel, 85% of mechanical and 22% of piping installation Installation of the liner on the water storage facility Tailings storage facility 72% completed Completion of 81% of the fuel depot and 83% of the power plant Pre-stripping 62% completed with 11.2 million of the projected 18 million tonnes extracted Installation of the SAG mill completed 4.1 million man-hours have been worked without lost-time injury 2,027 personnel including contractors were employed on site, 86% of which are Burkinabe\nSEMAFO’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Consolidated Financial Statements and related financial materials are available in the “Investor Relations” section of the Corporation's website at www.semafo.com . These and other corporate reports are also available on www.sedar.com .\nFourth Quarter and Year-End 2017 Conference Call\nIn view of the pre-announced 2017 results and the February 16, 2018 conference call on the Mana PFS and multi-plan targets, no conference call has been scheduled for tomorrow. Parties with questions are invited to call the IR department.\nAnnual General Meeting of Shareholders\nSEMAFO's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will be held on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 10:00 EDT at Club Saint-James, Salon Midway, 1145 avenue Union, in Montreal Quebec. Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions and meet the management team and members of the board of directors.\nAbout SEMAFO\nSEMAFO is a Canadian-based mining company with gold production and exploration activities in West Africa.

Non-IFRS Financial Performance Measures\nSome of the indicators used by us to analyze and evaluate our results represent non-IFRS financial measures. We provide non-IFRS financial performance measures as they may be used by some investors to evaluate our financial performance. Since the non-IFRS performance measures do not have any standardized definition prescribed by IFRS, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Accordingly, they are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. For the non-IFRS financial performance measures not already reconciled within the document, we have defined the IFRS financial performance measures below and reconciled them to reported IFRS measures.\nCash Operating Cost\nA reconciliation of cash operating cost calculated in accordance with the Gold Institute Standard to the operating costs is included in the following table:\n2017 2016 Per tonne processed Tonnes of ore processed 2,739,900 2,753,300 (in thousands of dollars except per tonne) Mining operation expenses (relating to ounces sold) 134,385 131,953 Government royalties and selling expenses (11,364 ) (13,627 ) Effects of inventory adjustments (doré bars and gold in circuit) 3,184 (67 ) Operating costs (relating to tonnes processed) 126,205 118,259 Cash operating cost (per tonne processed) 46 43\nTotal Cash Cost 2017\n2016\nPer ounce sold\nGold ounce sold 205,300 240,600\n(in thousands of dollars except per ounce) Mining operation expenses 134,385 131,953 Total cash cost (per ounce sold) 655 548 All-in Sustaining Cost\nAll-in sustaining cost represents the total cash cost plus sustainable capital expenditures and stripping costs per ounce.\n2017 2016 Per ounce sold Gold ounce sold 205,300 240,600 (in thousands of dollars except per ounce) Sustaining capital expenditure 58,907 41,462 Sustaining capital expenditure (per ounce sold) 287\n172 Total cash cost (per ounce sold) 655 548 All-in sustaining cost (per ounce sold) 942 720\nOperating Cash Flows per Share 2017\n2016\n(in thousands except per share) Cash flows from operating activities 1 107,023\n142,222\nWeighted average number of outstanding common shares - basic 324,894\n315,290\nOperating cash flows per share 0.33\n0.45\n1 Cash flows from operating activities exclude changes in non-cash working capital items.
