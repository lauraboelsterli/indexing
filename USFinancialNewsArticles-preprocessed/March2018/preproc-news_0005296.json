    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian energy giant Rosneft said on Thursday that U.S. oil major ExxonMobil would incur serious losses because of its decision to quit some joint ventures with Rosneft.\nFILE PHOTO: Logos of ExxonMobil are seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan April 4, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo Exxon said earlier on Wednesday it would exit the joint, citing U.S. and European Union sanctions first imposed in 2014.\nRosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev said Exxon had been forced to take what he called a predictable decision, but said the move would not affect the Sakhalin-1 joint venture in Russia’s Far East.\n“It (Exxon) will suffer serious losses as a result of this (decision),” said Leontyev.\nReporting by Olesya Astakhova; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ",
