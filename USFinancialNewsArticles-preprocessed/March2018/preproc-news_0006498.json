He will continue to report to Jim Moroney, who will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of A. H.

Over the last year, Moise has been instrumental in leading the growth of digital subscriptions and optimizing the organizational design of the company into a customer-centric model.\n“Grant is a proven leader in our industry – one that has changed dramatically over the last two decades,” said Moroney. “His contributions to The Dallas Morning News, A. H.

At the same time, we have been investing in the marketing services space in order to bring ROI-based marketing solutions to our business customers. I am honored to become the Publisher and President of such a storied news organization that has such great relationships with our subscribers and marketing partners, and I look forward to leading it for years to come.”\nMoise is on the boards of the Neeley School of Business MBA Advisory Board at Texas Christian University, and the Providence Christian School of Texas.
