    "text": "March 24, 2018 / 1:13 AM / 2 days ago Golf: Romo shoots 82 to finish last in PGA Tour debut Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo missed the cut after shooting an 82 in the second round of the Corales Puntacana Championship in the Dominican Republic on Friday. FILE PHOTO: Feb 10, 2018; Pebble Beach, CA, USA; Tony Romo plays a shot from a bunker on the 18th hole during the third round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament at Pebble Beach Golf Links. Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports Amateur Romo had hoped to improve on his opening round of 77 but instead went in the other direction, starting with six consecutive bogeys at the Corales Golf Club. He finished at 15-over 159, the worst score by six strokes among the 132 players. Leader Brice Garnett, seeking his first PGA Tour victory, shot 68 for 13-under 131, one stroke ahead of fellow Americans Steve Wheatcroft (66) and Keith Mitchell (66). Despite Romo’s score, he savoured the experience and predicted better things were to come. “I think you’ll see some better golf in my future,” Romo told PGATour.com. “I got off to a rough start. I lipped out some short putts that kind of got me almost a little bit pressing. “I just didn’t hit the irons very good today. I was short-sided a few times, made too many mistakes. So a lot of stuff to learn from, and in a good way.” Romo, 37, had an outstanding career with the Dallas Cowboys, playing 156 NFL games before retiring last year.
