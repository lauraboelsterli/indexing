    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tailored Brands, Inc. (NYSE: TLRD) today announced consolidated financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended February 3, 2018, and provided guidance for fiscal 2018.\nFor the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018, the Company reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.01 and adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.00, compared to GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.62 and adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.19 for the fourth quarter last year.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, the Company reported GAAP diluted EPS of $1.95 and adjusted diluted EPS of $2.20, compared to GAAP diluted EPS of $0.51 and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.79 last year.\nIn fiscal 2017, the fourth quarter and year included an additional operating week (\"53 rd week\") compared to fiscal 2016.\n\"In 2017, we delivered significant EPS growth and finished the year strong with positive comparable sales for both Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank in the fourth quarter,\" said Tailored Brands CEO Doug Ewert. \"Our performance reflects the progress we are making on our key growth strategies. We more than doubled our custom business to over $100 million in 2017. We believe Tailored Brands is the largest and fastest growing retailer of men's custom clothing in North America and we plan to further enhance and differentiate our custom offering in 2018.\n\"We also significantly strengthened our balance sheet, reducing debt by approximately $200 million and lowering inventories by 11%. In 2018, we plan to further reduce our debt, invest behind our growth strategies and return cash to shareholders via our dividend.\n\"In 2018, we remain focused on executing three key growth strategies: expand our custom business and make buying a custom suit as easy and affordable as buying a suit off the rack, strengthen our brands and grow market share by communicating the quality selection and service we provide at a great value, and enhance our omni-channel experience by combining the high-touch service we offer in our stores with the convenience of online shopping.\"\n(1)\nIn fiscal 2017, adjusted items consist of costs to terminate our tuxedo rental license agreement with Macy's, a goodwill impairment charge related to our divestiture of MW Cleaners and one-time tax adjustments. In fiscal 2016, these items primarily related to our store rationalization and profit improvement initiatives and integration costs related to Jos. A. Bank. Given the recurring nature of our debt reduction transactions and to facilitate comparability, we have recast our non-GAAP measures presentations for 2016 to remove adjustments previously made for gains/losses on extinguishment of debt. This changes our non-GAAP diluted EPS for fiscal 2016 to $1.79 from $1.76. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information on items excluded from adjusted EPS.\nSale of MW Cleaners\nToday, the Company also announced the sale of its MW Cleaners business for approximately $18 million, as part of the Company's strategy to focus on its core businesses and unlock cash flow. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge for MW Cleaners of $1.5 million.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results\nFourth Quarter Net Sales Summary – Fiscal 2017\nNet Sales (U.S.\ndollars, in\nmillions)\n% Total\nSales\nChange\nComparable\nSales\nChange (1)\nRetail\n$787.2\n6.6%\n2.5%\nMen's Wearhouse\n$414.9\n7.9%\n2.3%\nJos.

Retail net sales increased 6.6% primarily due to an increase in retail segment comparable sales of 2.5% and a $40.7 million benefit from the 53 rd week. Corporate apparel net sales increased 32.2%, primarily due to the rollout of new uniform programs in the U.S. and U.K., a $5.0 million benefit from the 53 rd week and the impact of a stronger British pound this year compared to last year.\nComparable Sales\nMen's Wearhouse comparable sales increased 2.3%. Comparable sales for clothing increased primarily due to an increase in transactions, partially offset by a decrease in units per transaction, while average unit retail was flat. Comparable rental services revenue increased 2.1%, primarily reflecting an increase in rental units.\nJos. A. Bank comparable sales increased 5.3% primarily due to an increase in transactions and units per transaction that more than offset a decrease in average unit retail.\nK&G comparable sales decreased 1.7% primarily due to lower transactions partially offset by an increase in units per transaction, while average unit retail was flat.\nMoores comparable sales decreased 1.4% primarily due to a decrease in average unit retail partially offset by an increase in transactions, while units per transaction were flat.\nGross Margin\nOn a GAAP basis, consolidated gross margin was $320.9 million, an increase of $18.8 million, primarily due to the increase in net sales. As a percent of sales, consolidated gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 37.3%. On an adjusted basis, consolidated gross margin decreased 80 basis points, primarily due to a decrease in retail gross margin rate.\nOn a GAAP basis, retail gross margin was $302.2 million, an increase of $14.6 million. As a percent of sales, retail gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 38.4%. On an adjusted basis, retail gross margin increased $14.1 million while the retail gross margin rate decreased 60 basis points primarily due to higher procurement and distribution costs as a percent of sales, somewhat offset by lower occupancy costs as a percent of sales.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense increased $1.2 million to $52.6 million but decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 6.1%. The increase in advertising expense was driven primarily by a shift in timing of marketing spend from the third quarter.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nOn a GAAP basis, SG&A decreased $1.7 million to $252.8 million and decreased 270 basis points as a percent of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A increased $10.9 million, primarily due to the impact of the 53 rd week and increased incentive compensation expense, partially offset by lower employee-related benefit costs. As a percent of sales, adjusted SG&A decreased 110 basis points to 29.4%.\nOperating Income\nOn a GAAP basis, operating income was $13.3 million compared to an operating loss of $18.9 million last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $14.8 million compared to $9.3 million last year. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points to 1.7%.\nNet Interest Expense and Net Loss on Extinguishment of Debt\nNet interest expense was $25.0 million compared to $25.2 million last year. The decrease in interest expense was due to reducing our outstanding debt but was mostly offset by the impact of the 53 rd week. Net loss on extinguishment of debt was $1.1 million primarily related to the write-off of deferred financing costs resulting from the Company's voluntary $40.0 million prepayment on its Term Loan and the Company's repurchase of senior notes.\nEffective Tax Rate\nOn a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 96.1% compared to a benefit of 31.8% last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate includes one-time items including a favorable tax resolution offset by a change in our position on permanently reinvested foreign earnings and other impacts of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 99.3% compared to 42.3% last year. Both the GAAP and the adjusted effective tax rate reflect a benefit related to a change in the full year effective tax rate from 33% to 29%, primarily driven by discrete tax items, tax credits, and reductions in state income tax items including reversal of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions.\nNet Loss and EPS\nOn a GAAP basis, net loss was $0.5 million compared to a net loss of $30.1 million last year. GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.01 compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.62 last year. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2017 net loss was $0.1 million compared to a net loss of $9.2 million last year. Adjusted diluted loss per share was $0.00, compared to an adjusted loss per share of $0.19 last year. As a reminder, this year's fourth quarter contained 14 weeks while last year's fourth quarter contained 13 weeks. The Company estimates the impact of the extra week in 2017 was $0.05 per diluted share.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nFull Year Net Sales Summary – Fiscal 2017\nNet Sales (U.S.\ndollars, in\nmillions)\n% Total\nSales\nChange\nComparable\nSales\nChange (1)\nRetail\n$3,053.0\n-1.5%\n0.1%\nMen's Wearhouse\n$1,742.7\n-1.6%\n-1.1%\nJos.

Retail net sales decreased 1.5% primarily due to the impact of last year's store closures partially offset by the $40.7 million benefit from the 53 rd week and an increase in retail segment comparable sales of 0.1%. Corporate apparel net sales decreased 10.3%, in line with expectations, primarily due to anniversarying last year's rollout of a large new uniform program, partially offset by a $5.0 million benefit from the 53 rd week.\nComparable Sales\nMen's Wearhouse comparable sales decreased 1.1%. Comparable sales for clothing decreased primarily due to a decrease in transactions and units per transaction, partially offset by an increase in average unit retail. Comparable rental services revenue decreased 2.0%, primarily reflecting a consumer shift to purchase suits for special occasions.\nJos. A. Bank comparable sales increased 5.4% primarily due to an increase in transactions partially offset by a decrease in average unit retail, while units per transaction were flat.\nK&G comparable sales decreased 3.1% primarily due to lower transactions partially offset by increases in units per transaction and average unit retail.\nMoores comparable sales decreased 2.0% primarily due to decreases in both units per transaction and average unit retail that more than offset a slight increase in transactions.\nGross Margin\nOn a GAAP basis, consolidated gross margin was $1,408.8 million, a decrease of $32.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in corporate apparel net sales. As a percent of sales, consolidated gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 42.6%. On an adjusted basis, consolidated gross margin increased 10 basis points to 42.7%.\nOn a GAAP basis, retail gross margin was $1,343.0 million, a decrease of $10.8 million. As a percent of sales, retail gross margin increased 30 basis points to 44.0%. On an adjusted basis, retail gross margin decreased $8.2 million but the retail gross margin rate increased 40 basis points compared to last year primarily due to leverage from occupancy costs.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense decreased $16.5 million to $173.4 million and decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 5.2%. The decrease in advertising expense was driven primarily by reductions in television advertising reflecting a shift to digital advertising.\nSG&A\nOn a GAAP basis, SG&A decreased $98.4 million to $1,000.9 million and decreased 220 basis points as a percent of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A decreased $35.9 million, primarily due to decreases in store-related costs resulting from last year's store rationalization program as well as lower employee-related benefit costs, partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense. As a percent of sales, adjusted SG&A decreased 40 basis points to 29.8%.\nOperating Income\nOn a GAAP basis, operating income was $229.4 million compared to $132.8 million last year. As a percent of sales, operating margin increased 300 basis points to 6.9%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $248.1 million, up 8.2% compared to $229.2 million last year. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 7.5%.\nNet Interest Expense and Net Gain on Extinguishment of Debt\nNet interest expense was $99.9 million compared to $103.0 million last year, as we reduced our outstanding debt. Net gain on extinguishment of debt was $5.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to $1.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, last year resulting from the Company's repurchase of senior notes and write-off of deferred financing costs for its voluntary term loan prepayment.\nEffective Tax Rate\nOn a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 28.3% compared to 21.0% last year. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 29.3% compared to 31.7% last year.\nNet Earnings and EPS\nOn a GAAP basis, net income was $96.7 million compared to $25.0 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.95 compared to $0.51 last year. On an adjusted basis, net income was $108.6 million compared to $87.3 million last year.

There were no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility at the end of 2017.\nInventories decreased $103.6 million, or 10.8%, to $851.9 million at the end of 2017 compared to the end of 2016, primarily due to lower inventories across all of our retail brands.\nTotal debt at the end of 2017 was approximately $1.4 billion. During the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased and retired $38.8 million face value of its senior notes for a full year total of $153.8 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter, the Company made a total of $43.5 million in payments on its term loan, including a $40.0 million voluntary prepayment, for a full year total of $53.4 million.\nCash flow from operating activities for fiscal 2017 was $350.8 million compared to $242.6 million last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher net earnings, and expected lower inventory and rental product purchases, partially offset by anniversarying last year's income tax refund.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2017 were $95.0 million compared to $99.7 million last year.\nFISCAL 2018 FULL YEAR OUTLOOK\nEarnings per Share: The Company expects to achieve GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $2.35 to $2.50.

Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided adjusted information for the fiscal fourth quarters and twelve months of 2017 and 2016. This non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's financial performance by removing the impacts of large, unusual or unique transactions that we believe are not indicative of our core business results. For fiscal 2017, these items consist of costs to terminate our tuxedo rental license agreement with Macy's, a goodwill impairment charge related to our divestiture of MW Cleaners and one-time tax adjustments. For fiscal 2016, these costs primarily related to our store rationalization and profit improvement programs and integration costs related to Jos. A. Bank. Given the recurring nature of our debt reduction transactions and to facilitate comparability, we have recast our non-GAAP presentation for 2016 to remove adjustments previously made for gains/losses on extinguishment of debt.\nManagement uses these adjusted results to assess the Company's performance, to make decisions about how to allocate resources and to develop expectations for future performance. In addition, adjusted EPS is used as a performance measure in the Company's executive compensation program to determine the number of performance units that are ultimately earned for certain equity awards.\nThe non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or as being superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review the Company's financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP information to our actual results follow and amounts may not sum due to rounded numbers. In addition, only the line items affected by adjustments are shown in the tables.\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Adjusted Consolidated Statements of Earnings Information\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Adjusted - Three Months Ended February 3, 2018\nConsolidated Results\nGAAP Results\nDivestiture of MW\nCleaners (1)\nTotal\nAdjustments\nNon-GAAP\nAdjusted Results\nGoodwill impairment charge\n$ 1,500\n(1,500)\n(1,500)\n$ -\nOperating income\n13,322\n1,500\n1,500\n14,822\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes (2)\n(12,300)\n1,085\n(11,215)\nNet loss\n(499)\n415\n(84)\nNet loss per diluted common share allocated to common shareholders\n$ (0.01)\n$0.01\n$ (0.00)\n(1) Consists of a $1.5 million goodwill impairment charge for MW Cleaners and related to the retail segment.\n(2) The tax effect of the excluded items is computed as the difference between tax expense on a GAAP basis and tax expense on an adjusted non-GAAP basis.
