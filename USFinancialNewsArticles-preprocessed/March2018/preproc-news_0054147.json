    "text": "0 COMMENTS Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker defended how the central bank’s regional reserve bank presidents are chosen, pushing back against some of the arguments for change.\n“It’s a complicated issue,” Mr. Harker told reporters Thursday after a speech in New York, amid criticism of how San Francisco Fed President John Williams became the front-runner to become the next New York Fed leader. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that Mr. Williams was the leading candidate for the New York job , one of the most influential positions within the central bank system. An announcement could come as soon as next week.\nMr. Williams is a widely-respected economist and is well liked by his central bank colleagues, but critics of the selection process note that it occurred largely behind closed doors.\nMr. Harker acknowledged the unease with process, but rejected some of the changes proposed. Responding to a question, he said that publicly identifying the contenders, as some critics want, would be problematic.\n“The candidates you want often have jobs. If they have to go public, they are done in that job,” Mr. Harker said. He worried that releasing the names under consideration would “preclude a set of very accomplished, qualified candidates from even entering the pool, and that’s human nature, and I don’t think there’s anything you can do to change that.”\nThe Fed chair and other Washington-based governors are nominated by the U.S. president and subject to Senate confirmation. In contrast, the presidents of the Fed’s 12 regional reserve banks are chosen by the members of the reserve banks’ board of directors, excluding those who work for financial firms regulated by the central bank. A Fed reserve bank board’s choice then goes to the Fed’s governors for approval.\nSome critics say the search process should allow for more public scrutiny and input. This is particularly true, they say, for the leader of the New York Fed, which implements monetary policy and serves as the central bank’s main point of contact with markets.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) has called for the Fed board of governors to withhold its approval of Mr. Williams as New York Fed chief until he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee.\nMr. Harker did not comment on Ms. Warren’s comments, but said subjecting the selections of the regional Fed chiefs to congressional oversight or confirmation could reduce the Federal Reserve’s independence from political pressure.\nThe New York Fed had said that its board would look at a wide variety of candidates and take account of community views as part of its search for a successor to its president, William Dudley, who plans to retire this summer.\nThe selection of Mr. Williams disappointed critics who have called for more diversity among Fed officials, most of whom are white men.\nMr. Harker said the Fed has to do better on diversity, but he said that means diversity of experience as well as race. He noted that older and younger people have lived through very different inflation environments, and having such disparate experiences is valuable to policy-making.\nWrite to Michael S.
