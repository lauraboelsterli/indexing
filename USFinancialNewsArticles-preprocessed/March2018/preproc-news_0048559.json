The underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase up to 300,000 additional Series C Preferred Units. Distributions on the Series C Preferred Units will accrue and be cumulative from, and including, the date of original issuance and to, but excluding, May 15, 2025, at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 7.00% per annum and (ii) the sum of (a) three-Month LIBOR, as calculated on each applicable date of determination and (b) 4.698% per annum, based on the liquidation preference of $25.00 per Series C Preferred Unit. On and after May 15, 2025, distributions on the Series C Preferred Units will accrue at 9.00% per annum, based on the liquidation preference of $25.00 per Series C Preferred Unit.
