    "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda, March 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Syncora Holdings Ltd. (“SHL” or the “Company”), a Bermuda holding company whose wholly-owned subsidiary provides financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance, today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSyncora Holdings Ltd. Summary of Consolidated Financial Results December 31, 2017 and 2016 (U.S. dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years Ended 2017\n2016\nNet premiums earned $ 51.1 $ 77.2 Net investment income 45.3 48.8 Net realized losses on investments (17.7 ) (19.8 ) Net loss on insurance cash flow certificates (120.1 ) (110.6 ) Net earnings (loss) on credit default and other swap contracts 59.7 (56.4 ) Net recoveries on losses and loss adjustment expenses (197.7 ) (179.3 ) Operating expenses 47.0 74.3 Income from continuing operations 121.4 20.2 Income from discontinued operations 12.5 13.0 Net income attributable to controlling interest $ 133.5 $ 32.7 Basic and diluted income per common share $ 1.54 $ 2.18 (2) Basic and diluted income from discontinued operations per common share $ 0.14 $ 0.19 Non-GAAP operating income (1) $ 148.3 $ 150.9 Non-GAAP basic and diluted operating income per common share (1) $ 1.71 $ 2.22 Basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 86.7 67.9 As of Year-End 2017\n2016\nAdjusted Book Value (1) $ 609.3 $ 484.1 Common shares outstanding at end of period 86.8 86.6 Adjusted Book Value per common share (1) $ 7.02 $ 5.59 (1) Non-GAAP operating income and adjusted book value are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) total Syncora Holdings Ltd. net income and common shareholders' equity, respectively, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. See below for reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures.\n(2) For purposes of our earnings per share calculation, $115.2 million is included for 2016, which is related to the extinguishment of the Series A perpetual non-cumulative preference shares.\nFinancial Results\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nNet premiums earned were $51.1 million for the year 2017, as compared to $77.2 million for the year 2016. The decrease was due to lower earned premiums as a result of the continued run-off of the Company’s book of business, and lower premium accelerations from refundings in the current year. Total premium accelerations were $24.8 million for the year 2017, as compared to $43.2 million for the year 2016.\nNet investment income decreased slightly by $3.5 million from $48.8 million for the year 2016 to $45.3 million for the year 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower invested assets as a result of claims payment activity during the year.\nNet realized losses on investments decreased by $2.1 million to $17.7 million for the year 2017 from $19.8 million for the year 2016. The decrease was primarily due to higher realized gains on sales, partially offset by higher other-than-temporary impairment charges in the current period.\nNet loss on insurance cash flow certificates was $120.1 million for the year 2017, as compared to $110.6 million for the year 2016. As this represents future cash flow receipts from certain insurance claim payments the Company anticipates making on policies that have been remediated, offset by reimbursements assigned to UCF holders, the increase was a result of positive RMBS developments and the effects of the GreenPoint litigation settlement.\nNet earnings (loss) on credit default and other swap contracts was $59.7 million for the year 2017, as compared to $(56.4) million for the year 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher non-performance risk spreads primarily as a result of Puerto Rico adverse developments.\nNet recoveries on losses and loss adjustment expenses were $197.7 million for the year 2017, as compared to $179.3 million for the year 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher recoveries as a result of the GreenPoint litigation settlement and other RMBS positive developments, partially offset by net incurred losses on our Puerto Rico exposures.\nOperating expenses were $47.0 million for the year 2017, as compared to $74.3 million for the year 2016. The decrease was primarily due to cost savings associated with headcount reductions and removal of restructuring transaction-related costs.\nIncome from discontinued operations represents the total revenues and total expenses of American Roads LLC, which was $12.5 million for the year 2017 and $13.0 million for the year 2016.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nTotal assets decreased by $8.9 million from $2,394.4 million as of year-end 2016 to $2,385.5 million as of year-end 2017 primarily as a result of Puerto Rico net claim payments, a reduction in expected roundtrip claim payments for remediated RMBS exposures and lower premium receivables as a result of refunding activity and the continued run-off of the Company’s book of business, partially offset by higher salvage and subrogation recoverable as a result of the GreenPoint settlement.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $169.7 million from $1,853.2 million as of year-end 2016 to $1,683.5 million as of year-end 2017. The decrease was primarily due to RMBS positive developments, lower unearned premium revenue from the continued run-off of the Company’s insured portfolio, lower mark-to-market fair values on our credit default and other swap contracts due to higher non-performance risk spreads and lower accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities due to lower compensation-related expenses as a result of headcount reductions.\nAssets and liabilities of entity held-for-sale represent the total assets and total liabilities of American Roads LLC, which met the accounting criteria for held-for-sale during the third quarter of 2017.\nSyncora Holdings Ltd.

A Non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance or financial position that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. While the Company does not manage its business or measure its performance using Non-GAAP measures, we are presenting these Non-GAAP financial measures because they provide greater transparency and enhanced visibility into the underlying performance of our business and, with respect to Adjusted Book Value, the effect of certain items that the Company believes will reverse from GAAP book value over time. In addition, we have included these measures because we believe they provide investors with important additional information to compare the Company to other financial guarantors. Non-GAAP operating income and Adjusted Book Value as calculated do not consider timing or amounts, if any, of payment on SGI’s surplus notes, which would require NYDFS approval, dividend restrictions under New York Insurance Law applicable to the insurance subsidiaries and contractual constraints with respect to any dividend payment. Reference should be made to Note 18 in the most recently issued consolidated GAAP financial statements. In addition, because other financial guarantors may calculate Non-GAAP operating income and Adjusted Book Value or similarly titled measures differently, or may not be subject to the restrictions noted above, Non-GAAP operating income and Adjusted Book Value may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other financial guarantors. Non-GAAP operating income and Adjusted Book Value are not substitutes for the most directly comparable GAAP measures, should not be viewed in isolation and may be subject to change.\nThe following table reconciles GAAP income attributable to common shareholders of Syncora Holdings Ltd. to Non-GAAP operating income attributable to common shareholders of Syncora Holdings Ltd.:\nSyncora Holdings Ltd. Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions, except per share amounts) Years Ended 2017\n2016\nGAAP net income attributable to controlling interest $ 133.5 $ 32.7 Extinguishment of Series A perpetual non-cumulative preference shares - 115.2 GAAP earnings attributable to common shareholders of Syncora Holdings Ltd. $ 133.5 $ 147.9 GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest $ 133.5 $ 32.7 Pre-tax adjustments: Non-credit impairment of net realized and unrealized fair value losses and (gains) on credit derivatives (1) (38.1 ) 69.0 Surplus note accretion (2) 40.7 22.9 Net realized losses on investments (3) 24.8 26.8 Non-recurring transaction related expenses (4) - 12.6 Income from discontinued operations (5) (12.5 ) (13.0 ) Total pre-tax adjustments 14.8 118.3 Less tax effect on pre-tax adjustments (6) - - Non-GAAP operating income $ 148.3 $ 150.9 Basic and diluted weighted average common shares 86.7 67.9 Basic and diluted earnings per common share $ 1.54 $ 2.18 Non-GAAP basic and diluted operating income per common share $ 1.71 $ 2.22 Non-GAAP operating income adjustments:\n(1) Elimination of non-credit impairment net realized and unrealized fair value (gains) and losses on credit derivatives in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses, and non-economic payments. The fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments are heavily influenced by, and fluctuate, in part according to, market interest rates, credit spreads and other factors that management cannot control or predict and that are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. In addition, this adjustment presents all financial guaranty contracts on a more consistent basis of accounting, whether or not they are subject to derivative accounting rules.\n(2) Elimination of surplus note accretion as the full face amount of the surplus notes (including interest paid-in-kind) is included in the Adjusted Book Value calculation.\n(3) Elimination of net realized losses on the Company’s investments, except for gains and losses on investments for which the fair value option of accounting was elected. The timing of realized gains and losses, which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of sales is largely subject to the Company’s discretion and influenced by market opportunities, as well as the Company’s tax and capital profile.\n(4) Elimination of expenses associated with the surplus note exchange offer and proxy solicitation for the variation of rights to the SHL Preferred Shares, which were part of Syncora Holdings US Inc.’s (“SHI”) restructuring transactions completed on August 12, 2016. The elimination of such non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items presents expenses on a more consistent basis of accounting.\n(5) Elimination of the results from discontinued operations related to American Roads LLC.\n(6) Elimination of the tax effects related to the above adjustments. SHI has a significant tax NOL that is offset by a full valuation allowance in the GAAP consolidated financial statements. As a result, for purposes of Non-GAAP measures, the Company utilizes a 0% effective tax rate until the expiration of these NOLs.\nThe following table reconciles GAAP common shareholders’ equity to Adjusted Book Value:\nSyncora Holdings Ltd. Reconciliation of GAAP Common Shareholders' Equity to Adjusted Book Value December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions, except per share amounts) As of Year-End 2017\n2016\nGAAP common shareholders' equity $ 686.0 $ 524.7 Series B preferred stock (1) (121.0 ) (121.0 ) Adjusted GAAP common shareholders' equity $ 565.0 $ 403.7 Pre-tax adjustments: Deferred acquisition costs (2) (34.9 ) (42.6 ) Net credit derivative liability (3) 84.2 122.3 Net present value of estimated net future credit derivative revenue (4) 65.8 65.9 Net unearned premium reserve on financial guaranty contracts in excess of expected loss to be expensed (5) 208.9 272.1 Notes payable (6) (248.2 ) (288.8 ) Unrealized gains on investments (7) (24.4 ) (21.5 ) Income Taxes (8) (7.1 ) (27.0 ) Adjusted Book Value $ 609.3 $ 484.1 Common shares outstanding at end of the period 86.8 86.6 Book value per common share $ 6.51 $ 4.66 Adjusted book value per common share $ 7.02 $ 5.59 Note: GAAP common shareholders' equity and Adjusted Book Value includes $175.1 million and $175.1 million, $161.9 million and $161.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to American Roads LLC. Adjusted Book Value adjustments:\n(1) Addition of the excess of the outstanding liquidation preference of the SGI Series B non-cumulative preferred shares over their carrying values. Including the SGI Series B non-cumulative preferred shares at their outstanding liquidation value (which is net of the shares received in connection with our 2012 settlement with Countrywide, Bank of America Corp.) instead of their carrying value is more in line with the residual value to common shareholders.\n(2) Elimination of pre-tax deferred acquisition costs as these amounts represent net deferred expenses that have already been paid and will be expensed in future accounting periods.\n(3) Elimination of the consolidated net credit derivative liability which represents an estimate of the fair value of the Company’s guarantees issued as CDS contracts in excess of the present value of the expected losses. By excluding the net credit derivative liability, this metric eliminates the benefit to our shareholders’ equity embedded therein from the Company’s non-performance risk, which reflects the market’s view of the risk that the Company will not be able to financially honor its obligations as they become due. The fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments are heavily influenced by, and fluctuate, in part according to, market interest rates, credit spreads and other factors that management cannot control or predict and that are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. In addition, by including our best estimate of losses we expect to incur on our CDS contracts if we were to hold such CDS contracts to maturity and pay claims as they arise over the remaining life of such contracts, the metric presents our guarantees of insurance and derivatives on a consistent basis, which results in a more meaningful measure of our value.\n(4) Addition of the pre-tax net present value of estimated net future credit derivative revenues. Including the net present value of estimated net future credit derivative revenues enables an evaluation of the value of future estimated credit derivative revenue for which there is no corresponding GAAP financial measure.\n(5) Addition of the pre-tax value of the unearned premium reserve on financial guaranty contracts in excess of expected losses to be expensed on an individual policy level, net of reinsurance as the unearned premium reserve on financial guaranty contracts represents revenues that are expected to be earned in the future.\n(6) Addition to the full face amount, in excess of the carrying amount, of the surplus notes payable held by third parties (including interest paid-in-kind), as including the full face amount of the surplus notes is consistent with the treatment of these instruments as debt.\n(7) Elimination of the pre-tax unrealized gains on the Company’s investments that are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), excluding the effects of foreign exchange. The effects of the AOCI component of the fair value adjustment on investments are not deemed economic until the Company sells such investments.\n(8) Elimination of the tax effects related to the above adjustments. SHI has a significant tax NOL that is offset by a full valuation allowance in the GAAP consolidated financial statements. As a result, for purposes of Non-GAAP measures, the Company utilizes a 0% effective tax rate until the expiration of these NOLs.\nConference Call Details\nThe Company plans to host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, March 28, 2018 to discuss its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.
