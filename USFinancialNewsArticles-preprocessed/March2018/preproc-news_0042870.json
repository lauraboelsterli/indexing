    "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tintri, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNTR), a leading provider of enterprise cloud platforms, today announced that Ian Halifax, CFO at Tintri, will leave the company on April 30, 2018. Halifax has agreed to assist in the orderly transition of his CFO responsibilities. His departure is not based on any disagreement with the company’s accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosures.\nKieran Harty, CTO, co-founder and member of the Board of Directors, stated, “I would like to thank Ian for his contributions during his 4-year tenure at Tintri and wish him the best for the future. He has worked with the team to strengthen the company’s balance sheet, significantly reduce operating expenses and reduce our cash burn. We believe that we have the right foundation to move forward.”\nIan Halifax stated, “It has been a privilege to work with such committed employees at Tintri. We have made progress in the past few months and Tintri is well positioned to achieve its strategic goals.”\nTintri has initiated a search for a successor CFO and will name an interim CFO prior to Halifax’s departure.\nAbout Tintri\nTintri (NASDAQ: TNTR) offers an enterprise cloud infrastructure built on a public-cloud like web services architecture and RESTful APIs.
