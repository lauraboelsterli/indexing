PAR has made and will continue to make investments focusing on Brink, PAR’s leading cloud restaurant platform, on our Customer Success organization to ensure that our users are maximizing our solutions for their operations, and on our internal IT systems infrastructure to enable process improvement and cost-efficient automation of work flows.\n“In the fourth quarter, PAR successfully executed reductions in both our domestic and international businesses with an estimated annual savings of $3.5 million. The savings will be reinvested as described above. While our fourth quarter revenue decreased year-over-year, revenues in the quarter increased $6.6 million sequentially over the third quarter 2017.”\nDr. Foley concluded by highlighting two important leading indicators, “PAR’s Government segment returned to revenue growth in the quarter while continuing to increase profits. Secondly, PAR’s Restaurant / Retail segment recorded new Brink POS bookings of 1,467 stores in the fourth quarter as compared with new bookings of 426 stores in the sequential third quarter, as market interest in PAR’s Brink solution accelerated. As evidence of the success of our Brink strategy to invest in solutions for multi-unit operators, 70% of the fourth quarter bookings were tied to major accounts captured in 2017.”\nConference Call .\nThere will be a conference call at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern) on March 15, 2018, during which the Company’s management will discuss the financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.

However, non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, as defined in the reconciliation table above, are provided because management uses these non-GAAP measures in evaluating the results of the continuing operations of the Company and believes this information provides investors supplemental insight into underlying business trends and operating results. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company's results of operations are impacted by certain non-recurring charges, including severance charges from restructuring business operations, equity based compensation, acquisition related expenditures, and other non-recurring charges that may not be indicative of the Company’s financial performance. Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove non-recurring charges provides a useful perspective with respect to our operating results and provides supplemental information to both management and investors by removing items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated. PAR believes the adjustments provide a useful comparison on a year-over-year basis.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $652,000 of expenses related to the Company’s previously disclosed internal investigation of conduct at its China and Singapore offices. Additionally, $349,000 of equity based compensation charges were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. One-time severance costs of $512,000, $165,000, and $113,000 are included in selling, general and administrative, costs of sales and research & development expense, respectively. The Company recognized amortization of acquired intangible assets of $242,000 related to the Company’s 2014 acquisition of Brink Software, Inc. Offsetting these charges, the Company recorded a $1,000,000 decrease to a contingent consideration liability related to the Brink Software acquisition. Lastly, the Company incurred a one-time decrease to the carrying value of its deferred tax assets of $4,490,000 as a result of the future tax rate changes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This decrease is reflected in the provision for/benefit from income tax line above netted down by a 24% or $248,000 tax impact from the non-GAAP adjustments as compared to a 37% or $147,000 increase to tax expense in 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded $1,323,000 of expenses related to the Company’s internal investigation of conduct at its China/Singapore offices offset by a $10,000 decrease to the amount recognized for the internal investigation related to the Company’s former chief financial officer’s unauthorized transfers of Company funds. In addition, $123,000 of expenses related to the implementation of the Company's new ERP system, and $72,000 of equity based compensation charges were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016. Included within costs of sales was $517,000 of accelerated amortization related to the Company’s discontinued development of a software module. The Company recognized amortization of acquired intangible assets of $242,000 related to the Company’s acquisition of Brink Software. Offsetting these charges, the Company recorded an insurance recovery of $771,000, relating to the Company’s former chief financial officer’s unauthorized transfers of Company funds, and a $1,100,000 decrease to a contingent consideration liability related to the Brink Software acquisition.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS (in thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 For the year ended December 31, 2016 Reported\nbasis\n(GAAP)\nAdjustments Comparable\nbasis (Non-\nGAAP)\nReported\nbasis\n(GAAP)\nAdjustments Comparable\nbasis (Non-\nGAAP)\nNet revenues $ 232,605 $ — $ 232,605 $ 229,653 $ — $ 229,653 Costs of sales 179,775 165 179,610 183,453 517 182,936 Gross Margin 52,830 165 52,995 46,200 517 46,717 Operating Expenses Selling, general and administrative 38,171 4,107 34,064 31,440 4,678 26,762 Research and development 13,814 113 13,701 11,581 — 11,581 Acquisition amortization 966 966 — 966 966 — Total operating expenses 52,951 5,186 47,765 43,987 5,644 38,343 Operating (loss) / income from continuing operations (121 ) 5,351 5,230 2,213 6,161 8,374 Other income (expense), net 629 (1,000 ) (371 ) 1,316 (1,871 ) (555 ) Interest (expense) income, net (121 ) — (121 ) 121 78 199 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 387 4,351 4,738 3,650 4,368 8,018 (Provision for) / benefit from income taxes (3,997 ) 3,446 (551 ) (1,147 ) (1,616 ) (2,763 ) (Loss) / income from continuing operations $ (3,610 ) $ 7,797 $ 4,187 $ 2,503 $ 2,752 $ 5,255 Income / (loss) from discontinued operations, (net of tax) $ 224 $ 224 $ (720 ) $ (720 ) Net (loss) income $ (3,386 ) $ 4,411 $ 1,783 $ 4,535 (Loss) / income per diluted share from continuing operations $ (0.23 ) $ 0.26 $ 0.16 $ 0.33 Income / (loss) per diluted share from discontinuing operations $ 0.01 $ 0.01 $ (0.05 ) $ (0.04 ) (Loss) / income per diluted share $ (0.22 ) $ 0.27 $ 0.11 $ 0.29 During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded professional services charges of $2,924,000 related to the Company’s internal investigation of conduct at its China and Singapore offices.
