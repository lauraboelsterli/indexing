    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (NYSE:HGV) announces that HNA HLT Holdco I LLC (the “Selling Stockholder”), an affiliate of HNA Tourism Group Co., Ltd., has priced an underwritten secondary offering of 22,250,000 shares of HGV’s common stock at $46.25 per share. The offering is expected to close on March 19, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions.\nHGV did not offer any shares of common stock in the offering and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in the offering.\nConcurrent with the offering, the Selling Stockholder is selling to HGV, in a privately negotiated transaction, 2,500,000 shares of its common stock (the “Share Repurchase”). The purchase price for the shares covered by the Share Repurchase is approximately $44.75 per share, which is the same price per share at which the underwriters will purchase shares of HGV’s common stock from the Selling Stockholder in the offering. HGV will retire any shares that it repurchases. The offering is not conditioned upon the completion of the Share Repurchase, but the Share Repurchase is conditioned upon completion of the offering.\nBofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan are acting as joint book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters for the offering. UBS Investment Bank, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities, Credit Suisse and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey are also acting as joint book-running managers and underwriters for the offering.\nThe offering of these securities is being made pursuant to an effective registration statement. This offering will be made only by means of a prospectus. A copy of the prospectus relating to these securities, when available, may be obtained from: BofA Merrill Lynch, 200 North College Street, 3rd floor, Charlotte, NC 28255-0001, Attn: Prospectus Department, Email: dg.prospectus_requests@baml.com ; or J.P.

The final prospectus, when available, may also be accessed through the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov .\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nSpecial Note About Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
