Former South Korean president Lee Myung-bak gets in a car as he is transferred to a detention centre, at his residence in Seoul as he is transferred to a detention centre, at his residence in Seoul, South Korea March 23, 2018. Jung Yeon-je/Pool via Reuters Lee was grilled by prosecutors earlier this month over nearly 20 charges that involve suspicions he took around 11 billion won ($10.28 million) unlawfully from a number of institutions and individuals He denies any wrongdoing. A South Korean judge issued the arrest warrant late on Thursday, saying Lee could destroy evidence. The former president was driven to a detention centre in Seoul soon after midnight. Slideshow (2 Images) Lee, in office from 2008 to 2013, says the investigation into the bribery allegations is politically motivated by prosecutors under the incumbent liberal administration. Last year, Lee’s successor ex-president Park Geun-hye was ousted from office after an influence-peddling scandal and is standing trial on charges of bribery, abuse of power and coercion. South Korean prosecutors are seeking a 30-year jail term for Park and a Seoul court will deliver a verdict in early April. ($1 = 1,070.3200 won)",
