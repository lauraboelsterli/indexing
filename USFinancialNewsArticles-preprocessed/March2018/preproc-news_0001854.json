(NYSE: AJX), a Maryland corporation that is a real estate investment trust, today announces results of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. We focus primarily on acquiring, investing in and managing a portfolio of RPLs secured by single-family residences and commercial properties, and, to a lesser extent, non-performing mortgage loans (“NPL”). In addition to our continued focus on residential RPLs, we have increased our originations of SBCs secured by multi-family residential and commercial mixed use retail/residential properties.\nFinancial Results (Unaudited)\n($ in thousands except per share amounts)\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nLoan interest income (2) $ 24,231 $ 24,396 $ 21,682 $ 20,556 $ 19,653 Total revenue (3) $ 13,797 $ 14,226 $ 13,105 $ 13,667 $ 10,969 Consolidated net income $ 6,638 $ 7,716 $ 7,102 $ 8,698 $ 6,163 Net income per diluted share $ 0.33 $ 0.38 $ 0.36 $ 0.46 $ 0.33 Average equity (1) $ 302,482 $ 292,640 $ 288,884 $ 284,872 $ 280,213 Average total assets (1) $ 1,230,026 $ 1,157,223 $ 1,050,108 $ 952,112 $ 883,621 Average daily cash balance (4) $ 47,717 $ 43,666 $ 47,705 $ 35,513 $ 32,759 Average carrying value of RPLs (1) $ 1,046,126 $ 998,692 (5)\n$ 898,749 (5)\n$ 810,166 (5)\n$ 751,801 Average carrying value of NPLs $ 43,400 $ 44,919 (5)\n$ 48,396 (5)\n$ 52,770 (5)\n$ 59,365 Average carrying value of originated SBC loans $ 11,273 $ 8,427 (5)\n$ 5,493 (5)\n$ 2,781 (5)\n$ 1,246 Average debt balance (1) $ 943,329 $ 883,770 $ 775,717 $ 669,938 $ 615,103 (1) Reflects the impact of consolidating the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest of Ajax Mortgage Loan Trust 2017-D, which is 50% owned by a third party institutional investor. (2) Loan interest income excludes interest income from debt securities and bank account balances. (3) Total revenue includes net interest income, income from investments in our manager and other income. (4) Average daily cash balance includes cash and cash equivalents, and excludes cash held in trust. (5) The 2017 quarterly average balances for mortgage loans was calculated using daily ending balances. Prior quarters of 2017 have been restated to conform to the current quarter presentation. Prior year data has not been restated. Consolidated net income decreased $1.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to the accelerated amortization of the deferred issuance costs of $0.9 million on certain of our secured borrowings that were called in the fourth quarter as we took advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance. Our professional fees increased for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of due diligence and structuring costs related to a number of transactions reviewed during the quarter. Additionally, audit fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we became larger and more complex. Accordingly, we made a cumulative adjustment to accrued audit fees during the quarter. Additionally, net interest income declined as the final deployment of the proceeds from the issuance of our convertible debt occurred late in the fourth quarter. This resulted in our fourth quarter loan acquisitions being held for only a weighted average of 23 days for the quarter, compared to a weighted average 59 day holding period during the third quarter for third quarter acquisitions. Also in the fourth quarter, we continued to experience extensions in the duration of a portion of our RPL portfolio resulting from (1) lower expected delinquencies and (2) significantly higher expected future cash flows in the form of interest payments and full payoffs. The updates resulted in a significant aggregate increase in expected future cash flows but a lower expected current yield and lower expected current period income.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we completed three securitizations, including our first rated securitization, Ajax Mortgage Loan Trust 2017-B. Ajax Mortgage Loan Trust 2017-B closed on December 21, 2017 with an aggregate of $115.8 million of AA rated senior securities and $35.7 million of subordinated securities issued with respect to $165.9 million of mortgage loans, all of which were RPLs. The senior securities represent 69.8% of the UPB of the underlying mortgage loans. The senior securities have no step up provision; as a result, the stated coupon of 3.163% is fixed to maturity.\nAjax Mortgage Loan Trust 2017-C closed on November 27, 2017 with an aggregate of $130.2 million of senior securities and $13.0 million of subordinated securities issued with respect to $185.9 million of mortgage loans. The senior securities represent 70.0% of UPB of the underlying mortgage loans. 742 of the loans were RPLs and 94 of these loans were NPLs. The senior securities have a four-year step provision - a one year extension versus the three-year step up from our previous issuance of non-rated senior securities.\nWe closed Ajax Mortgage Loan Trust 2017-D, a joint venture with an independent third party, on December 7, 2017 with an aggregate of $177.8 million senior securities and $44.5 million of subordinated equity issued with respect to $177.3 million of mortgage loans. Included in 1,003 of these loans were RPLs. The senior securities represent 80% of the UPB of the underlying mortgage loans. The senior securities and subordinated equity are currently owned 50% by us and 50% by the third party. The bonds may be sold by either party at a future date. We have consolidated Ajax Mortgage Loan Trust 2017-D in our Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2017. As a result, we included 100% of the mortgages on our balance sheet in Mortgage loans offset by a liability in Secured borrowings of $88.9 million and equity of $14.0 million in non-controlling interest. The senior securities have no step provision; accordingly, the stated coupon of 3.75% is fixed to maturity.\nWe collected $48.1 million on our mortgage loan and REO portfolios through payments, payoffs and sales of REO during the quarter, and ended the fourth quarter with $53.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. We continue to see a high volume of payoffs as borrowers continue to refinance or sell the underlying real property.\nWe acquired $219.2 million of RPLs with aggregate UPB of $241.3 million, and underlying collateral values of $363.9 million, and originated $1.7 million of SBC loans during the quarter to end the period with $1,253.5 million of mortgage loans with an aggregate UPB of $1,465.2 million. Mortgage loans purchased during the fourth quarter and held as of quarter-end were on our consolidated balance sheet for a weighted average of 23 days during the quarter.\nAlso, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold 286,841 shares of common stock for proceeds of $4.1 million, pursuant to our At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreements which we established in October 2016. In accordance with the terms of the agreements, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock at any time and from time to time through the sales agents.\nPortfolio Acquisitions\n($ in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nRPLs (1) Count 1,211 109 1,218 24 729 UPB $ 241,309 $ 32,718 $ 249,000 $ 3,445 $ 145,720 Purchase price $ 219,236 $ 26,645 $ 210,204 $ 3,143 $ 127,200 Purchase price % of UPB 90.9 % 81.4 % 84.4 % 91.2 % 87.3 % NPLs Count — — — — 23 UPB $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 3,590 Purchase price $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 2,022 Purchase price % of UPB — % — % — % — % 56.3 % (1) Includes the impact of 1,003 mortgage loans with a purchase price of $177.3 million and UPB of $194.3 million acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017 through a 50% owned joint venture which we consolidate.

Our investment will equal 67.8% of the underlying collateral value of $3.9 million. Some of these loans may be acquired through joint ventures with unrelated third parties.\nOn January 26, 2018, we agreed to acquire an 8% ownership interest in Great Ajax Financial Services LLC (“GAFS”), the parent of our servicer, Gregory Funding LLC. The acquisition is expected to be completed in two transactions.
