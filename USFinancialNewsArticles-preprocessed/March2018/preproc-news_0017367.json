(UCI), the leading media company serving Hispanic America, today announced that Peter H. Lori has been named Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately. Lori, who has served as Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Accounting Officer and Deputy Chief Financial Officer for UCI, succeeds Francisco (Frank) J. Lopez-Balboa, who has decided to leave the company to pursue other opportunities. Lori will report to Randy Falco, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n“Pete has been a critical member of our senior finance team for the last 13 years, and has the right combination of corporate finance and accounting expertise, clear leadership skills and deep knowledge of our company to drive financial growth at UCI,” said Falco. “He has been instrumental in helping us to reduce our debt and improve our capital structure, and we are confident our finance organization will continue to thrive under his leadership.”\nFalco continued, “I would like to thank Frank for his tremendous contributions to Univision since joining in 2015, during which he led a strong and capable finance and accounting organization in addition to managing our relationships with many of our external stakeholders. Given that our path to pursue a public offering has changed, this is an opportunity for Frank to begin the next chapter of his career. We wish him the best in his future endeavors.”\n“I am excited to have the opportunity to lead our financial organization and to continue working with the talented and driven individuals at UCI,” said Lori. “Throughout my time here I’ve been focused on helping to strengthen our financial results for the benefit of our audiences, employees and key stakeholders, and I remain committed to meeting our strategic goals. With a platform of strong 2017 results to build on, I look forward to working with Randy and the rest of the team to position our Company for long-term success.”\nLori, who most recently served as Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Accounting Officer and Deputy Chief Financial Officer for UCI, joined the Company in 2005 and has held a number of senior roles throughout his tenure with the Company.
