A customer buys tickets for the Powerball lottery in New York City, U.S., March 17, 2017. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon The odds of winning Saturday’s drawing, to be held at 10:59 p.m. ET (0259 GMT), are currently 1 in 292 million. A grand prize winner would have the choice of taking the $455 million jackpot doled out over 29 years, or taking a one-time, lump-sum payment of $269.4 million. Slideshow (8 Images) If no ticket matches the six numbers drawn in the lottery, the jackpot will roll over to the next drawing, on March 21. The last Powerball drawing to produce a jackpot winner was on Jan. 6, when a single ticket sold in New Hampshire won $559.7 million. The winner, who went under the name “Good Karma Family 2018,” chose the lump-sum cash option of $352 million. Powerball’s jackpot hit a record $1.6 billion in January 2016, when three winning tickets were sold in Florida, California and Tennessee. Reporting by Andrew Hay; Editing by Leslie Adler",
