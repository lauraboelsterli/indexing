    "text": "Published: Mar 18, 2018 4:52 p.m. ET Share \nGOP has lost ground in recent months, have no national advantage Getty Images President Donald Trump’s approval rating as slightly improved. \nBy Janet Hook \nDemocrats have regained a double-digit advantage over Republicans as the 2018 midterm congressional campaign intensifies and the GOP works to persuade voters of the benefits of the tax cut it passed three months ago, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has found. \nAsked which party should control Congress, registered voters picked Democrats by a 50%-to-40% margin, the second time in three months the party claimed a double-digit advantage. \n“This is not an environment where Republicans are going to have any national advantage,” said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey with Democrat Fred Yang. “They are going to have to dig in and work against the national environment to figure out how to win a campaign.” \nThe GOP lost ground over the last two months, even though Americans adopted a more favorable view of how President Donald Trump is handling his job. Some 43% approved of his job performance, compared with 39% in January. The poll found that House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is suffering from a negative image: just 21% have a positive image of her, down 4 percentage points from a poll six months ago.",
