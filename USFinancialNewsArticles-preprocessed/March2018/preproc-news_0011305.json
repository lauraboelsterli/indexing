Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary poses for a photo ahead of a news conference Brussels, Belgium, March 6, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman The airline averted widespread strikes ahead of Christmas by announcing plans to recognise pilots’ unions for the first time in its 32-year history and is talking with unions across Europe on formal recognition.

We expect some disruptions, possibly over Easter, maybe over the summer period,” Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Samantha Koester; editing by Philip Blenkinsop",
