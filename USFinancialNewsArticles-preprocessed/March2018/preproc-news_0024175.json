    "text": "OXFORD, Miss., March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Experienced healthcare executive Mark Sawyer has joined Oxford Treatment Center as Chief Executive Officer.\nSawyer, who takes the reins from founding CEO Billy Young, arrived on the Etta campus in early February. He most recently served as CEO at Acadia Healthcare's Twelve Oaks Recovery Center in Navarre, Fla.\n\"Mark understands the important work of addiction treatment and knows what it takes to lead a large organization,\" said Young, who is transitioning into a consulting role with parent company American Addiction Centers. \"He will equip our team to become even more effective in their life-changing work.\"\nThe Oxford Treatment Center, an American Addiction Centers facility, provides a complete continuum of care for drug and alcohol addiction. Its medical detox and residential treatment programs are based at its 110-acre main campus in northeastern Lafayette County. Follow-up and outpatient care takes place at offices in Oxford, Tupelo and Olive Branch.\nDuring his six-year tenure at Twelve Oaks, Sawyer served as controller, CFO, director of operations and CEO. Under his leadership, the center made strides in client satisfaction, employee engagement and financial metrics, earning Acadia's first Recovery Division Clinical Excellence Award in 2016.\nSawyer said he's found working in addiction treatment to be particularly rewarding.\n\"Our work is about changing lives,\" he said. \"To see a patient come to us sick and broken, and leave looking like a brand new person â€” it's very satisfying. At the end of the day, we can be very proud of what we do.\"\nOxford Treatment Center\nAn American Addiction Centers facility, Oxford Treatment Center provides a complete continuum of care for drug and alcohol addiction.
