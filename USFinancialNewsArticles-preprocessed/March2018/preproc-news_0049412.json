    "text": "0 COMMENTS The U.S. dollar gained Wednesday after a Commerce Department report showed the economy grew faster than originally measured in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of 16 others, rose 0.7%, the biggest gain since Feb. 2, to 83.94. The dollar rose 0.8% against the euro to $1.231 and 1.4% against the yen, rising to ¥106.85.\nGross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the U.S., rose at a 2.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter , adjusted for seasonality and inflation, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That exceeded economists’ expectations and was up from a previous estimate of 2.5% growth.\nThe U.S. dollar is also being supported by increasing concern that the synchronous global growth may be slowing, even as the U.S. continues to expand. Those worries have been fueled by worries about the potential for rising trade tensions to slow international commerce, putting a brake on growth. European growth has showed signs of cooling, reinforcing those concerns.\nOther signs of anxiety in financial markets have also boosted the dollar, analysts said. Those include gains in the U.S. government-bond market, the rising cost of dollar funding in Europe as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and $1.5 trillion in U.S. tax cuts, which are forcing the government to increase its short-term borrowing, leading to a greater scarcity for the currency.\n“There are all of these things that are happening that are negative for risk sentiment,” said Mark McCormick, a currency strategist at TD Securities. “You have an environment where volatility is rising across different asset classes.”\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com",
