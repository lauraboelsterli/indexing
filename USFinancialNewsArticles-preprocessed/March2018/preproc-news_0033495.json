Old Mutual is selling Old Mutual Colombia, Old Mutual Mexico and Latin American investment adviser Aiva, it said in a statement on Friday, without disclosing the price. CMIG International is a Singapore-based holding company. Old Mutual is coming into the final stages of breaking itself up into four parts and is narrowing the focus of its emerging markets business to Africa. Old Mutual is also planning to sell its China business. Goldman Sachs and Rothschild acted as joint financial advisers to Old Mutual on the deal, the company said.
