    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Park City Capital, LLC, the beneficial owner with its affiliates of approximately 5.2% of the shares of Resonant Inc. (Nasdaq: RESN), today announced its director nominees for the proxy contest it has initiated to elect a new board of directors at Resonant’s 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. Resonant’s full board of directors is elected annually.\nPark City is concerned that the current Resonant board—with a lack of meaningful ownership in the company and with two executives and a company service provider on the board—has been all too eager to continually return to the capital markets to effectuate dilutive financings—including with favored shareholders at deep market discounts—and to implement excessive equity programs for executives.\nPark City is even more concerned that the Resonant board has carried out its dilutive financing strategy while deliberately excluding Park City’s current board representative, Michael Fox, from the board’s review process. Park City has attempted to work constructively with the board, but has repeatedly been rebuffed and excluded simply for raising valid board matters for consideration. The Resonant board has even taken the extreme and outdated entrenchment measure of forming a committee to operate as a shadow board—which includes all of its directors other than Mr. Fox—to exclude Mr. Fox from board matters.\nPark City believes that the Resonant board has failed to achieve a stock price for the company that reflects the true value of the company’s technology. Park City believes that Resonant may be able to achieve a better outcome for shareholders by pursuing a sale of the company, which Park City believes is likely to attract a buyer willing to value the company more favorably than the current market for Resonant stock. Resonant’s stock currently trades approximately 30% below its 2014 IPO price of $6.00 per share.\nFor these reasons, Park City Capital will nominate the following director candidates at Resonant’s annual meeting:\nRobert M. Pons is the President of Spartan Advisors, Inc., a management consulting company specializing in microcap telecom and technology companies. He previously served as an executive with PTGi International, an international wholesale telecommunications service provider, as CEO of PTGi Holdings, Inc., a diversified telecommunications operator, and as Chairman of Live Microsystems, a mobile applications platform company. He also previously held executive positions with several other communications, wireless application, and software companies. He serves on the board of directors and is the Lead Director of Inseego Corp. (formerly Novatel Wireless, Inc.), a provider of wireless solutions for the mobile telecommunications market.\nLee M. Gopadze is the Chairman of the Board of Proxim Wireless Corporation, a wireless communications infrastructure manufacturer, and previously served as CEO of Proxim Wireless. He previously held executive positions with Covad Communications, SkyRiver Communications and Metricom. He currently serves on the board of directors of Proxim Wireless and Sunrise Telecom.\nAlan B. Howe is a co-founder and the managing partner of Broadband Initiatives, LLC, a telecommunications consulting firm. He served as Vice President of Strategic and Wireless Business Development for Covad Communications, a national broadband telecommunications company, and as CFO and Vice President of Corporate Development for Teletrack, a mobile data and location solutions provider. He previously held executive positions with Sprint and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. He is a member of the boards of directors of Determine, Inc., Data I/O Corporation, MagicJack Vocaltec, and WidePoint Corporation.\nJack H. Jacobs has held the McDermott Chair of Politics at West Point since 2005 and has served as an MSNBC military analyst since 2002. He is a principal of The Fitzroy Group, Ltd., a real estate development firm. He was previously a managing director of Bankers Trust, as well as a co-founder of AutoFinance Group, Inc. His military career included two tours of duty in Vietnam where he was among the most highly decorated soldiers, earning three Bronze Stars, two Silver Stars and the Medal of Honor. He is Co-Chairman of the Medal of Honor Foundation and a member of the board of trustees of the USO of New York. He is the author of the book, “If Not Now, When?: Duty and Sacrifice in America’s Time of Need.”\nLouis J. Basenese, III is the CEO of The Basenese Group LLC, a firm providing consulting and research services, analyzing companies, developing Internet-based financial publishing companies, and providing strategic planning and business development services. He is also the founder and Chief Analyst of Disruptive Tech Research, LLC, an independent equity research and advisory firm focusing on disruptive technology companies. He previously served as an Investment Consultant at Morgan Stanley.\nMichael J. Fox is the CEO of Park City Capital, LLC, a value-oriented investment management firm that he founded in 2008. He is also the co-founder of Julie’s Real Foods LLC, a fast-growing natural food company that he co-founded with his wife, Julie. He previously worked at J.P. Morgan, where he served as Vice President and Senior Business Services Analyst and headed the firm’s Business Services Equity Research Group.
