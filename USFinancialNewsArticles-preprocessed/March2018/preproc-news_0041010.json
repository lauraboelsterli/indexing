    "text": "March 21, 2018 / 8:03 AM / Updated 32 minutes ago UK competition regulator clears GVC's takeover of Ladbrokes Coral Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) cleared online gambling firm GVC Holdings Plc’s ( GVC.L ) acquisition of Ladbrokes Coral Group Plc ( LCL.L ) on Wednesday, saying the merger did not raise competition concerns. A sign hangs outside a branch of Ladbrokes in London, Britain December 22, 2017. REUTERS/Simon Dawson GVC agreed in December to take over leading British bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral for up to 4 billion pounds ($5.61 billion). “The CMA has found that GVC and Ladbrokes are not close rivals and there are many other providers of betting and gaming services online,” the competition regulator said.
