    "text": "NEW YORK, March 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors of KCAP Financial, Inc. (Nasdaq:KCAP) approved a cash distribution for the first quarter of 2018 of $0.10 per share of common stock. The distribution is payable on April 27, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business as of April 6, 2018.\nWe have adopted a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (\"DRIP\") that provides for reinvestment of our distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if we declare a cash distribution, our stockholders who have not \"opted out\" of our DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash. Please contact your broker or other financial intermediary for more information regarding the DRIP. Distributions may include net investment income, capital gains and/or return of capital. The tax status of distributions will be determined at the end of the taxable year.\nAbou t KCAP Financial, Inc.\nKCAP Financial, Inc. is a publicly traded, internally managed business development company.
