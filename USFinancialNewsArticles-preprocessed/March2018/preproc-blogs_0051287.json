    "text": "United States: Kinross Gold settles U.S. charges related to bribe prevention in Africa March 27th, 2018 Americas \nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Canadian-based mining company Kinross Gold Corp agreed to pay $950,000 to settle civil charges that it failed to ensure its payments in Africa were not being used to bribe government officials. \nThe SEC said in a statement Monday the company did little to verify payments to politically connected consultants and vendors – often made in cash – in Ghana and Mauritania were being used for their stated purpose. \nFor example between 2012 and 2015, Kinross paid a Ghanaian consultant $1,000 in cash per work visa he helped obtain for company staff, without detailing just what this former government official did to help expedite the process, the SEC said. \n  reuters.com",
