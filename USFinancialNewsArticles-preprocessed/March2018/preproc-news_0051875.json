    "text": "Company Plans to Enhance Crash Detection Location Technology for Families on the Road\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Life360 today announced a deal with PathSense, a precise positioning software development kit (SDK) for location-based mobile apps, where all of their employees will join the Life360 team, and Life360 has licensed the PathSense IP. While most GPS apps are notorious for draining smartphone batteries, the combination of Life360 and PathSense’s low battery location and sensor code technologies will provide the most advanced, battery efficient crash detection system available on the market.\n“The PathSense technology, and the team’s expertise in utilizing all of the sensors available on smartphones in a unique way, provides our users with a world-class car crash detection and response system,” said Alex Haro, co-founder and CTO of Life360. “This ensures we fulfill our vision to make every family member a safer driver and be there for them when accidents happen.”\nLife360’s crash response system automatically detects when a car accident occurs and calls the person involved. If they need immediate assistance, Life360 will dispatch emergency services to their exact location and stay on the line until help arrives. Life360 also notifies emergency contacts so that even in the worst situation, everyone is notified in real-time. This feature is part of the Driver Protect subscription service that also includes information on driving habits such as speed and phone usage.\nPathSense, which offers a software developer kit available for both iOS and Android, provides location accuracy through sensor fusion and internal navigation. The company was created by the team that created Trapster, an app that used crowd-sourced data to alert users to road hazards and speed traps.\nTogether, Life360 and PathSense plan to grow the sensors team leveraging San Diego’s rising talent pool. PathSense will continue to operate as its own corporation, servicing existing and looking to bring on new clients in the San Diego office.\nAbout Life360\nLife360 is the world’s leading location and driving safety service for families available for Android and iPhone in a convenient and secure mobile app. A leader in family tech, Life360 gives families peace of mind when they are not together. As the largest source of family driving data in the world, Life360 provides safety insights around driving behavior to better protect family members on the go via location sharing, day-to-day communications, driver updates, emergency response features, and more. Founded in 2008, Life360 has raised $76M in venture capital and is headquartered in San Francisco.
