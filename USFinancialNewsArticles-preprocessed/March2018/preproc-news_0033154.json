    "text": "0 COMMENTS As Univision Communications Inc. explores extensive cost cuts after shelving its plans for an initial public offering, the company’s digital assets aren’t being spared.\nUnivision, which has been owned by private-equity firms since its massive leveraged buyout a decade ago, hired Boston Consulting Group to review the company’s business. As part of the firm’s preliminary recommendations, BCG proposed cutting the budget of Fusion Media Group by as much as 35%, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe final amount of the budget cuts, which will also impact other parts of Univision, could still change as the consulting firm conducts a full review over the coming months, said people familiar with the process.\nThe cuts threaten to significantly reduce staffing at Fusion Media Group, which includes Gizmodo Media Group, comprised of the Root and most of the websites formerly owned by Gawker Media; a stake in the Onion; and the cable channel Fusion, the people said.\n“We are undergoing a review to ensure that UCI is best positioned to compete in a media industry that is rapidly evolving. This includes looking at all aspects of our business,” a Univision representative said in a statement. “By taking steps to streamline parts of our operations, we will be better positioned to invest in areas of growth that will best serve our audiences, community and partners into the future.”\nAn initial wave of job cuts have already started to filter through Fusion Media Group as the division is integrated with the parent company’s other digital operations, some of the people said. In the past week, Univision laid off Felipe Holguin, the president and chief executive at Fusion Media Group, and Daniel Eilemberg, the president and chief content officer for the Fusion cable network. Budget cuts have also been recommended for the Univision digital assets outside of Fusion.\nIt’s expected that a significant amount of the savings will come from streamlining of operations at the Fusion cable channel and from the changes implemented recently, according to a person familiar with the process.\nFusion Media Group has more than 600 employees with an annual budget of about $150 million, according to people familiar with the matter. The division was near break-even last year.\n“This is cutting into muscle,” one of the people said. “These are not operations that are running with a lot of overhead.”\nAs Univision works to improve the returns from Fusion Media Group, it would likely be open to in-bound interest for all or part of the group, one of the people said.\nLast week, Univision announced it was pulling plans for an IPO and its chief financial officer, who had been hired to help with the public offering, would be leaving. The following day, the company said Chief Executive Randy Falco would be retiring at the end of this year, much earlier than planned. The Wall Street Journal also reported that the Spanish-language broadcasting company had hired a consulting firm for a business review that could result in cost cuts in the range of $200 million, including significant layoffs.\nLike the rest of the pay-TV industry, Univision has battled significant ratings declines , but it also faces pressure from its $8 billion in debt and owners who are frustrated by the inability to exit their investment.\nFusion Media Group originated as just the Fusion cable channel, launched in 2013 as a joint venture between Univision and Walt Disney Co.’s ABC. Univision bought out Disney’s stake in 2016 as the cable channel struggled to establish itself and gain wider distribution. In August 2016, Univision won a court-administered auction to purchase Gawker Media Group, a portfolio of websites including Gizmodo, Deadspin and Jezebel — but not Gawker.com.\nDigital staffers have been frustrated by the uncertainty of the looming cuts, saying they are short-sighted and won’t position the company for growth. One employee pointed to remarks made by Mr. Falco during the company’s third-quarter earnings call in 2017 that touted the company’s digital assets as central to its future.\n“They’re deep cuts for a business that isn’t in trouble,” one of the people said. “It’s taking money out of the digital business, which is roughly running at break-even, to shore up the declining ratings” at the Univision broadcast network.",
