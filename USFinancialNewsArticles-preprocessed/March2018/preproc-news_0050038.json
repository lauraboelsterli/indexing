    "text": "March 29 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.\nTHE GLOBE AND MAIL B.C. Premier John Horgan is predicting a \"crisis\" over protests against the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, but says it's up the federal government and the National Energy Board to deal with the situation. tgam.ca/2GiQeXV\nThe Fort McKay Métis have reached a C$1.6 million ($1.24 million) deal with the Alberta government to buy the territory they have long leased from the province, a purchase they say is the first of its kind in Canada and another significant advancement for a group that has long had no terra firma to call its own. tgam.ca/2pNIjHG\nVancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson is calling for the decriminalization of personal drug use and possession following the release of new numbers that show more than 4,000 Canadians are believed to have died of opioid overdoses last year, with nearly 10 per cent of them in the city. tgam.ca/2uqxa4c\nNATIONAL POST Ontario's Liberal government tabled an election-year budget that offered more than $900 million in financial support for businesses and job training, a move that comes as Canada's most populous province grapples with economic uncertainty at home and abroad. bit.ly/2GCLyLU ($1 = 1.2909 Canadian dollars) (Compiled by Bengaluru newsroom)\n ",
