    "text": "March 7, 2018 / 12:45 PM / Updated 3 hours ago China leads charge against U.S. tariffs at WTO meeting Reuters Staff 1 Min Read GENEVA, March 7 (Reuters) - Major trading partners of the United States expressed both commercial and systemic concerns about its tariffs plan on Wednesday and said they feared tit-for-tat trade actions, a World Trade Organization (WTO) spokesman said. China kicked off the debate about the planned tariffs on steel and aluminium at the closed-door meeting. Delegations taking the floor included the European Union, Canada, Turkey, Russia, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Mexico, India and Brazil. “We fear that the United States may be opening a Pandora’s Box that we would not be able to close,” a trade official quoted Canada’s ambassador as saying.
