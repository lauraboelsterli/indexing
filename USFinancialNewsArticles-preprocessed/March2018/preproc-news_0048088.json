Prices have also had three consecutive quarters of gains, the longest stretch since late 2010 and early 2011.\nU.S. crude production has risen by nearly 25 percent in the last two years to over 10 million bpd <C-OUT-T-EIA>, taking it past top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of the biggest producer, Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd.\n(Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore Editing by Marguerita Choy)",
