We must act soon!\" tweet \nThe trade deficit with China surged 16.7 percent to $36 billion in January, its highest level since September 2015, suggesting that Trump's \"America First\" policies have not yet had a material impact on the deficit.

We cannot allow this to happen as it has for many years!\" WATCH: Tariffs are about national security, says Kyle Bass show chapters",
