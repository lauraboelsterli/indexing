    "text": "OLYMPIA, Wash. and HILLSBORO, Ore., March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Heritage Financial Corporation (\"Heritage\") (NASDAQ: HFWA) and Premier Commercial Bancorp (\"Premier\") (OTC Pink: PRCB) jointly announced today the signing of a definitive agreement under which Heritage will acquire Premier in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $88.6 million, or $15.12 per share, based on the closing price of Heritage common stock of $31.10 on March 8, 2018.\nPremier Community Bank, established in 1999, is headquartered in Hillsboro, Oregon with six branch locations and $401 million in total assets, $344 million in total loans and $331 million in total deposits as of December 31, 2017, and is the wholly owned subsidiary of Premier. Heritage will have total assets over $5 billion on a pro forma basis including the impact of the Premier acquisition.\n\"The partnership with Premier is an excellent way for us to expand our franchise in the Portland market. Heritage has significant momentum in Portland and Seattle, which are two of the most attractive banking markets in the Pacific Northwest,\" said Brian Vance, President and Chief Executive Officer of Heritage Financial Corporation. Mr. Vance continued, \"We welcome the employees and customers of Premier to Heritage, and we look forward to our combined success going forward.\"\nRick A.

On a combined basis, in the Portland metropolitan area Heritage will have approximately $408 million in total loans and $418 million in deposits, and we believe this will provide us with the operational scale to take advantage of more growth opportunities going forward.\"\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, Premier shareholders will receive 0.4863 shares of Heritage common stock for each share of Premier common stock. Based on the closing price of Heritage common stock of $31.10 on March 8, 2018, the consideration value per share for Premier was $15.12, or approximately $88.6 million in the aggregate, including the value of restricted stock.
