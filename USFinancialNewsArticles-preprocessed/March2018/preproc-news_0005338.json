    "text": "HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wellness Center USA, Inc.’s (OTCQB: WCUI ) wholly-owned subsidiary, StealthCo, Inc., dba Stealth Mark, is pleased to announce that Mr. Richard Neal has accepted the executive position of Stealth Mark’s Vice President of Intelligence. His primary responsibilities will focus on the further development and administration of the ActiveDuty System™ and its intrinsic, adaptable value in the global fight against counterfeiting, sex and human trafficking, and other illicit activities.\nMr. Neal is a pioneer of the new discipline of Digital Sociology, serving as an evolutionary next step to the current big data intelligence technologies within Data Science applications used within business intelligence. His book, “Expanding Sentience” (ISBN: 05557726212), focusing on Online Collectivism based on a model of Mathematical Epidemiology, sets the groundwork for using the discipline within a commercial domain.\n“The challenges present in digitally-derived intelligence today are immense,” stated Neal. “There is no better time to bring to market an array of innovative products that establish a new norm for identifying, monitoring and modeling the complex collective dynamic inherent in global online behaviors. I cannot think of another company better positioned, and with the in-depth experience in this realm, than Stealth Mark,” he continued.\nMr. Neal received a Bachelor’s in Psychology from the University of Georgia, an eMBA from Tulane University and a MSci in Technology from the University of Maryland. Rich has been conferred honors in Entrepreneurship and Innovation from the Kauffman Foundation, the State of Missouri and the Kansas City Area Development Council. Mr. Neal was accepted into Intellectual Ventures (led by the ex-CTO of Microsoft, Nathan Myhrvold) as an Invention Development Fund Network Member (known as Xinova) as well as DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) within their Principle Investigator ranks.\n“We are very pleased and excited to have Mr. Neal joining us to lead the Intelligence division of Stealth Mark”, stated Rick Howard, CEO. “With his vast depth of knowledge, and as the lead scientist and researcher for Stealth Mark’s ActiveDuty™, the company continues to push the envelope of the science,” Mr. Howard continued. “Utilizing Applied Collective Dynamics, asserting global monitoring, and heuristic sequencing, Mr. Neal’s work with ActiveDuty™ moves available big data from simply sorting into extraordinary machine learning comprehension of human patterns of activity. This provides strategic intelligence needed for companies, organizations, and agencies to optimize the execution of automated tactical advantage.”\nAbout the ActiveDuty System™.\nTo better understand the ActiveDuty System™ capabilities ….imagine leveraging the domain knowledge of a large team of dedicated subject-expert analysts who are able to digest and contextualize any and all research materials associated with the focal area. Then add the skills of an international social media research group that has access to all consumer-generated posts in any language across the full spectrum of shared digital communities (Bulletin Board System (BBS) to discussion groups to tweets). Layer in a global network of news analysts who specialize in understanding how the history of a news event impacts the trajectory of current and future news events along with a team of anthropologists and behavioral economists to outline definable patterns of human behaviors from across the spectrum of research, social media and news data - historically, currently and predictively. Then combine all of these empowering attributes into a proprietary, repeatable protocol utilizing machine learning (AI), computational linguistics and mathematical epidemiology ....this is the power of the ActiveDuty System™.\nAbout Wellness Center USA, Inc.\nWellness Center USA, Inc.
