    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 1:01 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago UK PM May visits city where Russian double agent was poisoned William James 3 Min Read SALISBURY, England (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday visited Salisbury, the elegant English cathedral city which became the unlikely backdrop to a chemical attack against a Russian former double agent this month. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May visits the city where former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent, in Salisbury, Britain March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville/Pool Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre on March 4 after being exposed to what the British authorities have identified as a military-grade, Soviet era Novichok nerve agent. They remain critically ill in hospital. May, who blames Russia for the attack and on Wednesday announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats, visited various locations in Salisbury including the area close to the bench where the Skripals were found. “We do hold Russia culpable for this brazen and despicable act that’s taken place on the streets of what is such a remarkable city where people come and visit and enjoy,” she told reporters during her visit. Moscow denies any involvement and has said May’s accusations are “insane”. The Russian government is expected to retaliate against the expulsion of the diplomats imminently. May said her visit was to thank emergency and health services and reassure the public about their safety. “It’s been great to meet some tourists here in Salisbury, people coming to Salisbury, still enjoying this great city,” she said. Salisbury, dominated by its 13th Century cathedral with England’s highest spire, has witnessed dramatic scenes since the Skripals were found. Police and soldiers in chemical suits and gas masks have been conducting forensic searches and removing vehicles from places visited by the pair. Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russia’s GRU military intelligence service, betrayed dozens of Russian spies to British intelligence before he was arrested in Moscow in 2004. He was given a lengthy jail term in 2006 but was released four years later as part of a swap for 10 Russian spies caught in the United States. Since arriving in Britain, he had lived modestly in Salisbury, keeping out of the spotlight until he was found unconscious, triggering a major diplomatic crisis between London and Moscow.
