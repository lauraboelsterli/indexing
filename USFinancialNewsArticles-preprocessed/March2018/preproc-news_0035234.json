    "text": "Senior Biopharma Executive Brings More Than 25 Years of Global Pharmaceutical Production and Supply Experience Across Vaccines, Biologics and Oligonucleotides\nEMERYVILLE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gritstone Oncology, a next-generation personalized cancer immunotherapy company, today announced that Jayant Aphale, Ph.D. has been appointed as Executive Vice President of Technical Operations.\nDr. Aphale will be responsible for process development and optimization, clinical material manufacturing under cGMP, and ensuring close collaboration with FDA and other regulatory agencies as Gritstone develops novel processes and products for personalized immunotherapy treatments. He will report to Andrew Allen, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, and will be based in the company’s Pleasanton, CA manufacturing facility.\nDr. Aphale brings more than 25 years of global manufacturing and technical operations experience within the vaccines, biologics and oligonucleotide domains. Most recently, he was Vice President of Technical Operations at Sarepta Therapeutics, where he led the technical operations team for internal process development, global supply chain and drug manufacturing across its drug candidate portfolio. He participated directly in launching Sarepta’s first commercial product, an antisense oligonucleotide, by developing and scaling manufacturing processes from Phase 1 through launch and commercialization.\nHis previous experience includes senior manufacturing and technical operations roles at GSK Vaccines, Enobia Pharma, Acambis Vaccines, Wyeth Vaccines, Diosynth and Roche Diagnostics. Dr. Aphale received his Ph.D. in microbiology from Ohio State University and an MBA in finance and strategy from The University of North Carolina.\n“Jayant’s career to date positions him very well to lead all aspects of our manufacturing program, both strategically and operationally. He has led technical operations at all stages of the product life cycle at global life sciences companies, he has worked on viral vectors and oligonucleotides, and he has succeeded in both large and small companies. He is a significant addition to our team at Gritstone,” said Dr. Allen. “His experience at Sarepta and leading vaccine companies will provide us with important leadership and insights as our first personalized immunotherapy program enters clinical development in mid-2018.”\nAbout Gritstone Oncology\nGritstone Oncology is a privately-held, next-generation personalized cancer immunotherapy company.
