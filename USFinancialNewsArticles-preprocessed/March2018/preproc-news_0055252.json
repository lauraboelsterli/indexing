    "text": "HOUSTON, Vantage Drilling International (\"Vantage\" or the “Company”) reported a net loss of approximately $36.6 million or $7.33 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a net loss of $41.1 million or $8.23 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Vantage reported a net loss of approximately $149.8 million or $29.96 per share. For the period from February 10, 2016 to December 31, 2016, Vantage reported a net loss of approximately $147.4 million or $29.48 per share and the Predecessor for the period January 1, 2016 to February 10, 2016 reported a net loss of approximately $471.0 million.\nVantage’s operating results for the fourth quarter reflected rig uptime of 98% and revenue efficiency of 99%.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Vantage had approximately $195.5 million of available cash. Uses of cash during the quarter included, among other things, debt service costs and the re-activation of the Platinum Explorer .\nIhab Toma, CEO, commented, “I am pleased to report that with the commencement of the Platinum Explorer three year contract for ONGC, in India, during the fourth quarter, we successfully reactivated three of our four previously stacked units during a difficult year for the offshore drilling industry and now have six of our seven premium assets working.”\nUpon emergence from the Company’s Chapter 11 restructuring on February 10, 2016, Vantage adopted fresh-start accounting, which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. References to “Successor” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Vantage as of and subsequent to February 10, 2016. References to “Predecessor” refer to the financial position of Vantage as of and prior to February 10, 2016 and the results of operations prior to February 10, 2016. As a result of the application of fresh-start accounting and the effects of the implementation of our Plan of Reorganization, the financial statements on or after February 10, 2016 are not comparable with the financial statements prior to that date.\nVantage, a Cayman Islands exempted company, is an offshore drilling contractor, with a fleet of three ultra-deepwater drillships and four premium jackup drilling rigs. Vantage's primary business is to contract drilling units, related equipment and work crews primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells globally for major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies. Vantage also provides construction supervision services and preservation management services for, and will operate and manage, drilling units owned by others.\nThe information above includes within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified above or as disclosed from time to time in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of these factors, actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such . Vantage disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nPublic & Investor Relations Contact:\nThomas J.
