    "text": "KALAMAZOO, Mich., March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Austin Company ( www.theaustin.com ), a leading design and construction firm headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, recently announced the promotion of Steven Lotz to Regional Safety Manager.\nSteve's career with Austin began in 1988, working as a Field Engineer at the Pfizer, Inc. (formerly Upjohn) campus in Kalamazoo. His work included the construction of Building 300, which at the time, was the largest research and development facility in North America.\nIn 1991, Steve joined the Austin team at Boeing's Seattle, Washington, site as Safety Engineer. His assignments included implementing the safety program on the 1.9 MM sq. ft. Boeing 777 project, seismic upgrades to the 747 assembly building, and renovations of other buildings on campus. Following this project, Steve returned to Pfizer's Kalamazoo campus as Safety Engineer – a position he held until 2002.\nFrom 2002 to 2003, Steve lived in Venezuela performing missionary work. After returning to the United States, Steve was a Safety Officer at demolition of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons complex in Colorado. In 2004 Steve returned to The Austin Company to manage safety for Austin's Michigan operations and served as Interim Corporate Safety Director in 2008.\nUnique to Austin's Michigan operations are the 100-plus self-perform trades group and work environment of a 1200-acre pharmaceutical manufacturing site with 124 buildings. \"This environment requires an expanded safety program, including training for direct-hire subcontractors and incorporation of the client's site-specific safety program,\" stated Steve VanWormer, General Manager with The Austin Company. \"Growth in our operations has required additional safety engineering staff who report to Steve. Austin is honored to have someone with Steve's dedication and knowledge in this role,\" VanWormer continued.\nSteve holds a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering and a Master's in construction management from the University of Illinois. In 2014, Steve was recognized as an Austin All Star – an award based on his dedication to safety and quality.\nAbout The Austin Company\nThe Austin Company was founded in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1878 and its headquarters remain in Cleveland, with regional offices in Georgia, California, Michigan, Missouri, and Mexico.
