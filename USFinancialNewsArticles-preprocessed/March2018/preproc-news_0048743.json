    "text": "0 COMMENTS Shares of gold miners have fared worse than the precious metal itself over the past year—a development that is fueling concern about bullion’s ability to keep climbing.\nGold is up 1.4% so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500, which is down 2.6%, and the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, which has fallen 7%. The divergence between gold and companies that mine it became particularly pronounced starting in late January, when stocks in other sectors attracted more interest from investors. Among the largest producers, Barrick Gold Corp. has fallen 12% year to date.\nTypically, gold-mining stocks tend to be more volatile than gold itself. But that usually occurs in a different fashion: Miners tend to experience outsize losses when the gold price is falling and typically overshoot when prices rally.\nThe current deviation from that trend is a worrying development for investors who are bullish on gold, as it suggests metal prices might not keep rising as interest rates increase.\nIt also is concerning bullish investors that gold, a haven for investors during market turbulence, is struggling despite recent stock slides on worries about trade disruptions and a decline in long-term bond yields.\nWhile both should be positive for gold, prices fell 1.3% to $1,324.20 a troy ounce Wednesday in a second straight session of declines. That creates uncertainty about gold’s ability to sustain this year’s gains.\n“As soon as angst leaves the market on something like trade or geopolitical tensions, then gold begins to accommodate the fact that we’re in a tightening cycle,” said James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC.\nHigher interest rates tend to buoy Treasury yields and make gold less attractive by comparison. The dollar has also been rebounding , which has cooled some optimism for gold bugs, analysts said. A stronger dollar makes commodities denominated in the currency more expensive for overseas buyers.\nGold miners have underperformed despite a strong fourth-quarter earnings season and upbeat 2018 projections. One reason is that some of the companies still aren’t generating as much cash as miners of other metals such as copper, analysts said.\nIn 2017, gold prices had their best year since 2010 , allowing many miners to repair their balance sheets. Barrick Gold, the world’s largest producer, said it paid down $1.5 billion in debt, exceeding its target, while Newmont Mining Corp. reported an 8% rise in production from a year earlier.\nBut the companies still haven’t caught up in free cash flow relative to market value, a commonly-used metric for evaluating performance, according to Citigroup research.\n“It takes some momentum to get people to come back to a sector that has been beaten as badly as mining has,” said Matt Badiali, research analyst at investment research firm Banyan Hill Publishing.\nMr. Badiali said he spoke at the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada convention in Toronto this month, pointing out that gold miners have recently improved earnings, paid down debts and are cheap after a yearslong slump.\n“This crowd was so mad” and took issue with his optimistic outlook, a sign that investor sentiment needs to improve before the sector’s outlook can brighten, he said.\nSentiment for gold miners has been negative, while investors have largely remained positive on the broader stock market and been drawn to other commodities, from cobalt to oil. “Speculative money has other places to go,” Mr. Badiali said.\nStill, some think gold’s climb will continue as money managers seek hedges against inflation and market swings, eventually leading to better performance by the beaten-down miners of the yellow metal.\nGold futures are still 30% below their 2011 all-time highs even after a 14% gain last year, and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF is almost 70% below its 2011 record.\nBouts of volatility have boosted the exchange-traded fund, which recorded inflows in six straight sessions through Tuesday. And some select gold miners such as Newmont, which is up 13% since the start of last year, have attracted investor interest by demonstrating future production will be steady.\nBut others think the gold-mining sector will have to demonstrate more consistency to close the gap on gold.\n“It’s in a very tough spot,” said Mark Stoeckle, CEO and senior portfolio manager of Adams Funds. “What some people are doing is assuming that because [mining stocks are] beaten up, they will come back—not necessarily.”\nWrite to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com",
