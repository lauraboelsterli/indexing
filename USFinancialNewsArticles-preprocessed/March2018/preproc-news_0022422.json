    "text": "COSTA MESA, Calif., March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- El Pollo Loco (Nasdaq:LOCO), the nation’s leading fire-grilled chicken chain, today unveiled a new corporate logo, marking the most significant change in its visual identity since 1980.\nEl Pollo Loco Unveils New Logo\nFeaturing a new, more modernized chicken graphic at its core and a sophisticated red and black color scheme, the new logo is inspired by El Pollo Loco’s vibrant Los Angeles roots and its commitment to offering fresh, authentic Mexican-inspired flavors. The design pays homage to the Company’s legacy by incorporating El Pollo Loco’s original, well-known typeface, but also emphasizes the brand’s continued evolution and strength as it embraces a contemporary shape with clean, bold colors.\n\"Our new logo underscores the heart and soul of our brand – our signature citrus-marinated, fire-grilled chicken – and more cohesively aligns with the distinctiveness of the new ‘Vision Design’ restaurants, which showcase our quality, authenticity and QSR-plus leadership,” said Ed Valle, Chief Marketing Officer of El Pollo Loco. “This update is another milestone in the Company’s ongoing transformation and reinforces our promise to continually innovate, as we aim to not only provide our guests with the freshest, most delicious flavors, but also a great experience.”\nDesigned by On the Edge, the new logo is part of El Pollo Loco’s continual brand evolution that originated with the launch of its ‘Vision Design’ concept in December 2016. Earlier this month, the Company began a gradual rollout of the new logo to all restaurants, including packaging and uniforms, as well as to all branding communications and digital experiences.\nAbout El Pollo Loco:\nEl Pollo Loco (Nasdaq:LOCO) is the nation's leading fire-grilled chicken restaurant chain renowned for its masterfully citrus-marinated, fire-grilled chicken and handcrafted entrees using fresh ingredients inspired by Mexican recipes. With more than 470 company-owned and franchised restaurants in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Utah, El Pollo Loco is expanding its presence in key markets through a combination of company and existing and new franchisee development.
