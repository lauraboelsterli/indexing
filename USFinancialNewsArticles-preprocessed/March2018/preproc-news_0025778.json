    "text": "March 14, 2018 / 9:26 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Slovenian PM Cerar resigns Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar resigned late on Wednesday, hours after the Supreme Court annulled the result of a September referendum that approved a 1-billion-euro railway project, the centre-left government’s biggest investment programme. Slovenia's Prime Minister Miro Cerar arrives at a European Union leaders informal summit in Brussels, Belgium, February 23, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “The coalition partners have been trying for a longtime to undermine some projects,” Cerar told a news conference. He said he would keep the post until a new government is formed. Slovenia is scheduled to hold an election in June. It was not clear if Cerar’s resignation would bring the election forward.
