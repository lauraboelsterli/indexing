It lost more than 2 percent of its value last week.\nJapan’s Nikkei and South Korea’s KOSPI both lost 0.7 percent, while Chinese shares eased too after starting on a positive note.\nU.S. stock futures did not inspire much confidence, with S&P E-Minis down 0.5 percent and Dow futures off 0.4 percent.\n“Frustration with a lack of market access and a lack of fair trade are understandable,” said Peter Jolly, global head of research for National Australia Bank.\n“If this escalation draws that into focus with some improvement, that would be positive. But retaliatory tit-for-tat measures would weigh against market access, a cost to growth with increases in trade prices, costs, and inflation.”\nInvestors will focus on a deluge of data this week, culminating in the U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday. The annual opening of the National People’s Congress in China was another focus for investors. China’s parliament has kept the economy’s growth target at 6.5 percent for this year.\nIn commodities, oil prices climbed ahead of a meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms in Houston, raising expectations that oil producers would discuss further how to clear a global glut.\nBrent crude was up 30 cents at $64.67 a barrel while U.S. light crude added 47 cents to $61.64.\nSpot gold climbed 0.3 percent to $1,325.96.\nEditing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ",
