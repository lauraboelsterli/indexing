Reports that China will pay for oil in yuan will also benefit the crude futures market,” Wang Xiao, head of research with Guotai Junan Futures, said in a note on Friday, adding that the gain in Shanghai crude had outpaced the gain in Brent and WTI.\n$1 = 6.2662 Chinese yuan Reporting by Meng Meng and Josephine Mason; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu\n ",
