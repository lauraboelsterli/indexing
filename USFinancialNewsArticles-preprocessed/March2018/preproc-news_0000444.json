    "text": "CAIRO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - At least 10 people were killed and 15 others were injured in a train crash on Wednesday in Egyptâ€™s northern province of Beheira, the health ministry said.\nTwo passenger carriages separated from one train and collided with a cargo train, the official news agency MENA said, citing the provincial security director.\nEgyptians have long complained that successive governments have failed to enforce basic safety measures for the railways. A string of crashes have further inflamed public anger over the antiquated transport network.\nA collision in August killed 42 people and injured more than 100 people.\nReporting by Mahmoud Mourad and Ahmed Tolba; Writing by Nadine Awadalla Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
