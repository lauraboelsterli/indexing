The industry is building a full-time, multi-scenario and high-efficiency business model to provide such solutions. Suning.com , the retail subsidiary of Suning Holdings Group, who focuses on traffic management, merchandising and affiliate marketing, optimising customer experience and improving Omni-channel operation capabilities, has taken the advantages to meet new opportunities in 2017.\nDuring the reporting period, total online physical trading volume of the company was 126.696 billion yuan (tax included), up 57.37 per cent year-on-year, and the number of monthly active Suning.com APP users increased by 105.73 per cent since the start of the year. In December 2017, the number of orders generated by Suning.com APP reached over 89 per cent of the total online.\nAs of 31 December 2017, Suning owns a total of 3,867 physical stores comprising a total area of 5.093 million square meters. It is notable that through internet technology application, data-oriented management and strong quality control, the business performance of Suning stores continues to improve. Sales revenue grew 4.17 per cent in the firm's mainland China stores with operating efficiency of Suning direct-sale stores jumping 34.90 per cent.\nBy the end of 2018, with the strategic partnership with 300 well-known real estate developers domestic and abroad as Wanda, Evergrande and Sunac, Suning plans to add a further 5,000 physical stores to its rapidly expanding portfolio, all being connected to its online presence and covering diversified consumption scenarios including Suning cloud stores, direct-sale stores, fresh food supermarkets and convenience stores, Redbaby (maternal and child supplies stores), Suning Sports and Suning Cinemas. It says 15,000 Internet-connected stores will open within three years then totally 20,000 in operation by 2020.\nIn addition to the substantial growth of its retail subsidiary, the 'Logistics' and 'Financial Services' businesses of Suning also continued rapid growth. In 2017, Suning Logistics revenue (excluding Tian Tian Express) increased 135.76 per cent. It now has a total area of 686 million square meters of warehousing and related facilities, with 20,871 express outlets. Suning Financial Services (payment business, supply chain finance and etc.) saw the overall size of transactions increase by 129.71 per cent. In 2017 Suning has intended to introduce external strategic investors and partners such as YF Capital and SZVC Capital for related businesses development, demonstrating the independent expansion and funding capability of Suning's logistics and financial services.\n1 Calculated at an exchange rate of 6.328 RMB to 1 USD\nAbout Suning\nFounded in 1990, Suning is one of the leading commercial enterprises in China with two public companies in China and Japan respectively.
