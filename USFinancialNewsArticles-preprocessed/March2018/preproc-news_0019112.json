    "text": "(Reuters) - CommerceHub Inc ( CHUBA.O ) said on Tuesday private equity firms GTCR and Sycamore Partners will acquire the e-commerce software provider in an all-cash deal valued at about $1.1 billion.\nThe buyout offer of $22.75 in cash per share represents a premium of 24.5 percent to the stockâ€™s close on Monday.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.\nThe private equity firms have a history of buying out companies. Last year, GTCR and Carlyle Group LP ( CG.O ) bought Albany Molecular for $922 million and Sycamore acquired Staples in a $6.9 billion deal.\nSycamore has a reputation for taking bets on retail investments others might eschew. Its previous investments include regional department store operator Belk Inc, discount general merchandise retailer Dollar Express and mall and web-based specialty retailer Hot Topic.\nCommerceHub said it will become a privately held company and remain headquartered in Albany, New York.\nEvercore and Baker Botts LLP were advisers to CommerceHub, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP advised to GTCR and Sycamore.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ",
