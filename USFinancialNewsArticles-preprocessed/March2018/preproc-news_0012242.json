    "text": "Legendary heavy-metal band Metallica is teaming up with Dave Pickerell , former master distiller at Maker's Mark, on a whiskey line — and possibly a small distillery.\nPickerell told WhiskeyCast about the project in a story published last week. The band's San Francisco hometown seems to be the front runner site for a distillery, but Pickerell also mentions Louisville and Nashville as possible locations.\n\"San Francisco (is) the home of Metallica, Louisville (is) the home of bourbon, and Nashville (is) the home of music, so one of those three seems to make sense,\" Pickerell told the publication. \"I'm voting for San Francisco and the Bay Area if nothing falls apart.\"\n\nMore from Louisville Business Journal: \nTech unicorns and the horns of the listing dilemma \nCOVER STORY: How many more breweries can Louisville support? \nHere's how much U of L is spending on key exec searches \nWhiskey and heavy metal? Yeah, those mix pretty well. Metallica paid ode to the spirituous beverage while covering Thin Lizzy's \"Whiskey in the Jar.\" And lots of musicians and liquor brands have come together over the years. This post from Ultimate Classic Rock has a whole photo gallery of these collaborations (the Suntory-Rolling Stones whiskey looks expensive.)\nBut can a rock group justify a distillery? Metallica has been one of those enduring acts over the decades, so maybe it'll have a fanbase thirsty enough for it.\nMetallica will play at the KFC Yum Center in Louisville as part of its WorldWired Tour on March 9, 2019. It is one of only 34 dates on the North American leg of the tour in support of Metallica's latest album, \"Hardwired … to Self-Destruct.\"",
