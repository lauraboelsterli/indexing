    "text": "0 COMMENTS As the competition for digital advertising becomes more intense, publishers are trying to make a splash with big events to reel in sponsorships and connect directly with their audiences.\nOne such publisher is PopSugar, a female-focused digital media company that’s stepping up its events business as part of an effort to diversify its revenue. In June, it’s hosting a festival , called Play/Ground, dedicated to entertaining women and furthering their careers that will feature live performances, wellness classes, panels and a shopping bazaar, said Geoff Schiller, chief revenue officer at PopSugar.\nThe festival, which is being produced in partnership with the events planning company Reed Exhibitions, will be held on June 9 and 10 in New York City.\nPopSugar, which said it expects 15,000 attendees at Play/Ground, is experimenting with several revenue streams at the event. Clothing retailer Nordstrom and the pharmaceutical company Shire are among the sponsors that have paid for “brand activations,” face-to-face activities that give attendees a hands-on experience with an advertiser’s product. Sponsors can also pay to have their products in a shopping bazaar for event attendees.\nAttendance costs $70 for a one-day ticket, $125 for the weekend and $399 for a VIP weekend pass.\nIn recent months, executives at digital publishers like BuzzFeed , Refinery29 and Vox Media have all emphasized the importance of trying out new moneymaking strategies as platforms like Google and Facebook continue to attract the majority of digital advertising spending. Many publishers have made investments in video content, launched events businesses or experimented with subscriptions as their growth has slowed or their business models have come under stress.\nPopSugar has experimented with different revenue categories before. In 2007, it acquired Shopstyle, an affiliate marketing product that drives purchases on retailers like Target and Express. Ebates, the cashback shopping website operator owned by Rakuten Inc., acquired Shopstyle in 2017 for an undisclosed sum.\nA PopSugar representative declined to say whether PopSugar is profitable. The company says that its advertising revenue increased in 2017 compared with the previous year and that events are projected to bring in 4% of the company’s revenue in 2018.\nEvents businesses are by now a well-worn moneymaking tactic for publishers, which use them to build their businesses and leverage their brand to make additional revenue. Time Inc., now owned by Meredith Corp. , hosts marquee events like the Time 100 Gala and the Fortune Global Forum. Digital media companies, such as Refinery29 and BuzzFeed have also experimented with events: Refinery29 hosts a semiannual event called 29Rooms in Los Angeles and New York, and Recode hosts annual conferences on media and tech .\nEvents also pose risks , given their expense and the tendency of attendance to track with the overall economic environment. While publishers and marketers can use events to establish deeper connections with their customers, they are also costly to stage, said Michael Rothman, the co-founder of the father-focused media startup Fatherly who has experimented with low-cost events.\n“You think video is expensive?” Mr. Rothman said. “Try producing good events. Events can create much more margin compression than an over-reliance on bespoke video.”\nReed Exhibitions hasn’t seen a sudden glut of publishers rushing to establish events businesses, said Herve Sedky, regional president of Americas for the company. He estimates that there has been some growth in demand among publishers and marketers eager to connect with consumers who are increasingly shunning advertising by using digital ad blockers or turning to commercial-free video streaming.",
