(TASE:BICL), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies to treat cancer, today announced the appointments of Ronald Knickerbocker, Ph.D., as Senior Vice President of Clinical Development and Data Sciences, and Sean Daly as Vice President of Clinical Operations.\nDr. Knickerbocker joins BioCanCell from ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, where he was Vice President, Biomedical Data Sciences and Information and led the Biostatistics and Data Management functions through multiple successful oncology submissions. Prior to his tenure at ARIAD, Dr. Knickerbocker held senior positions leading groups at Sanofi, Genzyme, Pfizer, and Eli Lilly. Dr. Knickerbocker received his Ph.D. in Statistics from Texas A&M University.\nSean Daly also joins BioCanCell from ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, where he most recently served as the Vice President of Clinical Operations. Sean led the clinical operations group at ARIAD for five years, building upon various operational roles held at ARIAD since 2004. In addition to his experience at ARIAD, he has held positions with Wyeth Research (formerly Genetics Institute), and Agouron Pharmaceuticals. Sean is a graduate of the University of California at San Diego, where he received his B.S. in Biochemistry and Cell Biology.\n“We are pleased to welcome Ron and Sean, both accomplished biotechnology executives to our management team,” said Frank Haluska, M.D, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of BioCanCell. \"Ron led protocol design, data analysis, and regulatory data submission for two globally-marketed cancer agents, and Sean implemented and executed the successful world-wide clinical trial program on which the drug submissions were based. They are important additions to BioCanCell at this time, as we advance our lead candidate, BC-819, a first-in-class potential therapy in late-stage development for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.”\nAbout BioCanCell\nBioCanCell is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel therapies to treat cancer, with offices in Cambridge, MA, and Jerusalem, Israel.

For additional information please go to www.biocancell.com .\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of clinical trials, the anticipated effects of receiving Fast Track designation, the anticipated timeframe for conducting additional clinical trials and making regulatory submissions, and other strategic and business plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements are based on information BioCanCell has when those statements are made or its management’s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the success of the approach to discover and develop prospective therapeutic products, which is new and may never lead to marketable products; a lack of history of commercial sales; a dependence on the success of BC-819, the development of which will require significant additional clinical testing before regulatory approval can be sought and commercial sales launched; a need to raise substantial additional funds to complete R&D activities; an ability to overcome scientific or technological difficulties that may be encountered and that may impede R&D activities; and an ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for product candidates, including pursuant to licensed patents.\nCompany Contact:\nFrank Haluska, M.D., Ph.D.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n857-259-4622\ninfo@biocancell.com\nInvestor Contact:\nAshley R.
