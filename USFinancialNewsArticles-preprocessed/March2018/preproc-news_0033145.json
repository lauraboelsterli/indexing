    "text": "MILWAUKEE, March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cimbria Capital, a private equity firm conducting growth capital and early stage buyout investments in the agriculture and water sectors in North America and Europe, today announced the opening of a new office at The Water Council located in the Global Water Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Launched in 2013, the Global Water Center is a 98,000 sq. ft. LEED-certified building that is considered the world's only state-of-the art water business and research facility. The Water Council is a world-leading water hub that drives economic, technology and talent development to support the global water industry. The Water Council convenes international water leaders and supports more than 180 members from small and mid-sized businesses and large corporations.\n\"We are very excited to expand Cimbria's influence in private equity with our new office with The Water Council,\" said Brian V. Iversen, managing partner of Cimbria Capital. \"We look forward to contributing our transatlantic finance capabilities and management expertise to the talented network of water investors, companies, and professionals utilizing The Water Council as a designated cluster of collaboration.\"\n\"We are extremely grateful that Cimbria Capital has selected the Global Water Center and Milwaukee as the location where they see great opportunities to find promising water technology businesses to add to their investment portfolio,\" stated Dean Amhaus, president and CEO of The Water Council. \"Coupled with a solid team of private equity professionals, what especially resonated with us is Cimbria's unique long-term vision for their investments, which will serve as another magnet when we are speaking with companies about Milwaukee's advantage as a water technology hub.\"\nWisconsin and Milwaukee, the Freshwater Capital of the World, have together coalesced over 200 international water companies and a dedicated network of water experts. As global water scarcity mounts due to evolving economies and demographics, water companies are anticipated to be in exceptional demand by industrial companies and governments seeking solutions to water security. Wisconsin's high concentration of water innovators therefore provides unique value to investment firms seeking to leverage quality deal flow and partnership opportunities in the sector.\n\"It is an honor to open Cimbria's second office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and contribute to the region's water-focused investment and innovation,\" said Noah Sabich, director of Cimbria Capital. \"With world demand for clean water growing exponentially, Cimbria looks forward to financing and scaling companies like those in Wisconsin that both address our water challenges and reward investors with outsized gains.\"\nAbout Cimbria Capital: Cimbria Capital is a private equity investment firm based in Houston, Texas and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
