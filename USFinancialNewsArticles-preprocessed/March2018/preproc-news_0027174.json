(Nasdaq:VRA) (“Vera Bradley” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 (“Fiscal 2018”).\nThe current year fourth quarter consisted of 14 weeks compared to 13 weeks in the prior year fourth quarter. Fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in the prior fiscal year ended January 28, 2017 (“Fiscal 2017”). Comparable sales were calculated based on 13 weeks in each fourth quarter and 52 weeks in each fiscal year. Management estimates that the additional week contributed approximately $4.1 million in net revenues and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.01 for both the current year fourth quarter and Fiscal 2018.\nSummary of Financial Performance for the Fourth Quarter\nNet revenues totaled $132.0 million for the current year fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018, compared to $134.8 million in the prior year fourth quarter ended January 28, 2017.\nFor the current year fourth quarter, the Company posted net income of $8.5 million, or $0.24 per diluted share. These results included $3.3 million of after-tax charges comprised of:\na tax charge of $2.1 million related to recent federal tax reform legislation; severance charges of $0.8 million; store impairment charges of $0.3 million; and other Vision 20/20 charges of $0.1 million.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding these charges, the Company’s net income totaled $11.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share.\nFor the prior year fourth quarter, the Company posted net income of $3.5 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. These results included $6.6 million of after-tax impairment charges related to underperforming stores. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding these charges, the Company’s net income totaled $10.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share.\nComments on Fourth Quarter Performance\nRobert Wallstrom, Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are pleased that our fourth quarter revenues were at the high end of our guidance and our gross margin rate exceeded our expectations. These factors led to fourth quarter EPS (excluding the previously outlined charges) of $0.33, at the top of our guidance.”\nSummary of Financial Performance for the Fiscal Year\nNet revenues totaled $454.6 million for Fiscal 2018, compared to $485.9 million in Fiscal 2017.\nFor Fiscal 2018, the Company posted net income of $7.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. These results included $14.5 million of after-tax charges comprised of:\nseverance charges of $4.2 million; store impairment charges of $4.0 million; strategic plan (Vision 20/20) consulting fees of $2.9 million; a tax charge of $2.1 million related to recent federal tax reform legislation; and other charges of $1.3 million, including inventory adjustments related to product categories being discontinued and net lease termination charges.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding these charges, the Company’s net income totaled $21.5 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2018.\nFor Fiscal 2017, the Company posted net income of $19.8 million, or $0.53 per diluted share. Those results included $7.0 million of net after-tax charges comprised of store impairment charges of $8.0 million and severance charges of $0.6 million, partially offset by a $1.6 million release of certain income tax reserves. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding these net charges, the Company’s net income totaled $26.8 million, or $0.72 per share, for the prior year.\nFiscal 2018 Accomplishments\nWallstrom continued, “We had several noteworthy accomplishments in Fiscal 2018.\n“In the Product arena:\nWe reinvigorated and reinvented cotton, which remains the most important piece of our business. Customers are responding to our newly-introduced Iconic cotton collection, featuring micro-quilting, added functionality and innovation, and several new updated silhouettes. We expanded our licensing program by launching technology-related products, swimwear, bedding, stationery, hosiery, and medical uniforms, which is important to extending our brand and reaching new customers and markets. We continue to see an extremely positive response from the market in terms of placement in both existing and new distribution. For example, our smartphone cases are offered in 2,500 AT&T stores, and Vera Bradley bedding is available in over 200 Bed, Bath & Beyond locations.\n“On the Distribution front:\nWe launched our new re-platformed verabradley.com web site, part of our Digital First strategy, which is key to our long-term growth. In order to reduce certain clearance sales from verabradley.com , we created a new online outlet site and conducted our first two Flash Sales in October and January. We continued to strengthen our store base by: completing design upgrades on a number of our go-forward full-line stores, with nearly 40 full-line stores now reflecting our new design aesthetic, and an additional 14 stores with updated signage/façades; opening a new full-line pop-up store in Boston’s Faneuil Hall, a high-traffic tourist destination; continuing to grow our factory business by opening six new stores; and rationalizing and improving the profitability of our base by closing five underperforming full-line stores and one underperforming factory store. We made the decision to exit our small wholesale presence in Japan to better focus on strengthening our core, domestic operations.\n“In Marketing , we drove increased brand awareness with our Digital First strategy, by leveraging social media channels and partnering with key influencers.\n“We continued to strengthen our Balance Sheet by generating over $40 million in operating cash flow, increasing our cash and investment balance to nearly $140 million, and reducing our inventory levels by 14%.\n“Most importantly, we laid out the framework for our future with Vision 20/20 and commenced implementation.”\nLooking Ahead with Vision 20/20\nWallstrom continued, “Vision 20/20 is an aggressive plan to turn around our business over the next three years. Vision 20/20 is designed to restore brand and Company health by moving to a less clearance-driven business model combined with a meaningful reduction in our SG&A expenses. While a primary goal for Fiscal 2019 is to get healthy, driving brand desirability through product and marketing innovation remains top-of-mind, and we will work to lay the foundation for future growth of the business.\n“On the Product and Pricing front, we will focus on three key areas:\nFirst, in February 2018, we began significantly reducing the amount of clearance product available on verabradley.com and in our full-line stores. This will help to reset our customers’ pricing expectations and restore our full-price business. As part of this strategy, we will implement a limited number of flash sale events throughout the year. Second, we are focusing on our best categories and narrowing our current product offerings by eliminating unproductive or incongruent categories and SKUs from our assortment. For example, we are discontinuing our fragrance and jewelry collections this year. As we reduce clearance and narrow our offerings, inventory levels will continue to come down. Lastly, we are focused on building tighter assortment guardrails around introducing new categories, patterns, and pricing, assuring the right fit for our brand and that our products not only provide thoughtful solutions but also reflect our signature attributes of comfortable, casual, and affordable. We have thoroughly analyzed our patterns – determining the DNA and isolating the characteristics of our most successful prints. We are confident we can apply the findings from this comprehensive analysis to drive more pattern success going forward. You should see these changes by fall of this year.\n“The majority of the product and pricing initiatives are being implemented this year, and we believe these changes will negatively impact year-over-year revenues by $30 million to $50 million, which is reflected in our revenue guidance of $405 to $425 million.”\nWallstrom continued, “As we reduce revenues, we also expect to reduce annual SG&A spending by up to $30 million from our Fiscal 2017 baseline spending of $236 million (before severance, Vision 20/20, and other disclosed charges). This expense reduction process began in the fall of Fiscal 2018, and we expect that $20 million to $25 million of the annualized SG&A reductions will be implemented by the end of Fiscal 2019, which is reflected in our SG&A guidance of $210 to $215 million.\n“Reductions are coming through right-sizing our corporate infrastructure to better align with the size of our business, lowering our marketing spend by focusing on efficiencies while keeping our most loyal customers engaged, and taking a more aggressive stance on reducing store operating costs and closing underperforming full-line stores. We are forecasting to close up to 45 additional full-line stores by the end of Fiscal 2021, primarily as leases expire. The remaining SG&A reductions will be made following Fiscal 2019 and are primarily related to store closings in the out years.\n“We have reduced cost of sales over the prior three years by shifting to lower-cost manufacturing, improved raw materials sourcing, and enhancing distribution efficiencies. We believe there are incremental sourcing and supply chain opportunities in Fiscal 2019 and beyond. These savings can help offset the natural overhead deleverage that will occur as we reduce inventory levels and as our channel mix changes. These factors are considered in our flat to slightly up year-over-year gross margin guidance for Fiscal 2019.”\n“By continuing our focus on product and executing Vision 20/20, we expect that our business and brand will become healthier, operating performance will improve, and cash flows will remain strong over the next three years,” Wallstrom concluded.\nFourth Quarter Details\nThe current year non-GAAP fourth quarter income statement numbers referenced below exclude the previously outlined severance, store impairment, and other charges. The prior year non-GAAP fourth quarter income statement numbers referenced below exclude the previously outlined store impairment charges.\nCurrent year fourth quarter net revenues of $132.0 million were at the high end of the Company’s guidance range of $127 to $132 million. Prior year fourth quarter revenues totaled $134.8 million.\nCurrent year fourth quarter Direct segment revenues totaled $110.4 million, a 1.4% increase over $108.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The additional week contributed approximately $3.0 million in net revenues during the current year fourth quarter. Comparable sales (including e-commerce) decreased 4.6% for the quarter (reflecting a 4.2% decline in comparable store sales and a 5.4% decrease in e-commerce sales), which was offset by new store growth (the Company opened one full-line store and six factory outlet stores during the past 12 months). Comparable sales continue to be negatively impacted by year-over-year declines in store and e-commerce traffic.\nIndirect segment revenues decreased 17.0% to $21.6 million from $26.0 million in the prior year fourth quarter, reflecting a reduction in the number of specialty accounts coupled with a reduction in orders from both specialty accounts and certain key accounts. The additional week contributed approximately $1.1 million in net revenues during the current year fourth quarter.\nGross profit for the quarter totaled $74.2 million, or 56.2% of net revenues, compared to $75.1 million, or 55.7% of net revenues, in the prior year fourth quarter. Excluding the previously outlined charges, gross profit for the quarter totaled $74.3 million, or 56.3% of net revenues. The year-over-year 60 basis point adjusted gross profit improvement primarily related to a reduction in product cost, which caused the adjusted gross profit percentage to be above the guidance range of 55.4% to 55.8%.\nSG&A expense totaled $58.8 million, or 44.5% of net revenues, in the current year fourth quarter, compared to $70.6 million, or 52.4% of net revenues, in the prior year fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the previously outlined charges, SG&A expense totaled $57.1 million, or 43.2% of net revenues, in the current year fourth quarter, compared to $60.2 million, or 44.6% of net revenues, last year. Excluding charges, SG&A expenses were lower than the prior year primarily due to diligent expense management and savings realized in conjunction with Vision 20/20. The fourth quarter adjusted rate was modestly higher than guidance of 42.8% to 42.9% primarily due to the timing of savings associated with Vision 20/20.\nThe Company’s operating income totaled $15.6 million, or 11.8% of net revenues, in the current year fourth quarter, compared to $4.7 million, or 3.5% of net revenues, in the prior year fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the previously outlined charges, the Company’s operating income totaled $17.4 million, or 13.2% of net revenues, in the current year fourth quarter, compared to $15.2 million, or 11.2% of net revenues, in the prior year.\nBy segment, Direct operating income was $25.6 million, or 23.2% of net revenues, compared to $15.2 million, or 13.9% of net revenues, in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, Direct operating income was $26.8 million, or 24.3% of net revenues, compared to $25.7 million, or 23.6% of net revenues, in the prior year. Indirect operating income was $7.0 million, or 32.3% of net revenues, compared to $9.4 million, or 36.3% of net revenues, in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, Indirect operating income was $7.6 million, or 35.2% of net revenues, compared to $9.4 million, or 36.3% of net revenues, in the prior year.\nFiscal Year Details\nThe current year non-GAAP income statement numbers referenced below exclude the previously outlined severance, store impairment, consulting, and other charges. The prior year non-GAAP income statement numbers referenced below exclude the previously outlined store impairment and severance charges.\nCurrent year net revenues totaled $454.6 million compared to $485.9 million in the prior year and at the upper end of the $450 to $455 million guidance range.\nDirect segment revenues for the current year totaled $351.8 million, a 1.0% decrease from $355.2 million in the prior year. The additional week contributed approximately $3.0 million in net revenues during the current year. Comparable sales (including e-commerce) decreased 6.7% for the period (reflecting a 5.5% decline in comparable store sales and a 9.3% decrease in e-commerce sales), which was partially offset by new store growth (the Company opened one full-line store and six factory outlet stores during the past 12 months). Comparable sales were negatively impacted by year-over-year declines in store and e-commerce traffic, and first quarter e-commerce sales were negatively affected by the conversion to a new technology platform in February 2017.\nIndirect segment revenues for current year decreased 21.3% to $102.9 million from $130.8 million in the prior year, reflecting a reduction in the number of specialty accounts coupled with a reduction in orders from both specialty accounts and certain key accounts. The additional week contributed approximately $1.1 million in net revenues during the current year.\nGross profit for Fiscal 2018 totaled $254.0 million, or 55.9% of net revenues, compared to $276.0 million, or 56.8% of net revenues, in the prior year. Excluding the previously outlined charges, gross profit for the current year totaled $255.1 million, or 56.1% of net revenues. The year-over-year 70 basis point adjusted gross profit decline primarily related to increased promotional activity at the Company’s factory outlet stores, channel mix changes, and a second quarter adjustment taken against slow moving inventory, partially offset by a reduction in product cost. Excluding charges, the full-year gross profit rate was modestly higher than guidance of 55.8% to 55.9% due to previously outlined positive factors in the fourth quarter.\nSG&A expense totaled $239.8 million, or 52.7% of net revenues, in Fiscal 2018, compared to $249.2 million, or 51.3% of net revenues, in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the previously outlined charges, SG&A expense totaled $221.4 million, or 48.7% of net revenues, in the current year, compared to $235.5 million, or 48.5% of net revenues, in the prior year. Excluding charges, SG&A expense was lower than the prior year primarily due to diligent expense management and savings realized in conjunction with Vision 20/20. The adjusted SG&A rate was in line with guidance.\nThe Company’s Fiscal 2018 operating income was $15.0 million, or 3.3% of net revenues, compared to $28.2 million, or 5.8% of net revenues, in Fiscal 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the previously outlined charges, the Company’s Fiscal 2018 operating income was $34.5 million, or 7.6% of net revenues, in the current year, compared to $41.9 million, or 8.6% of net revenues, in the prior year.\nBy segment, Direct operating income was $61.0 million, or 17.3% of net revenues, compared to $62.6 million, or 17.6% of net revenues, in the prior year.

Indirect operating income was $34.8 million, or 33.8% of net revenues, compared to $51.0 million, or 39.0% of net revenues, in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the previously outlined charges, Indirect operating income was $37.1 million, or 36.1% of net revenues, compared to $51.0 million, or 39.0% of net revenues, in the prior year.\nBalance Sheet\nNet capital spending for the fourth quarter and fiscal year totaled $2.9 million and $11.8 million, respectively. Capital spending for the fiscal year was within the $10 to $12 million guidance range.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased approximately $1.6 million of its common stock (approximately 214,000 shares at an average price of $7.70), bringing the fiscal year total to $7.9 million (approximately 934,000 shares at an average price of $8.47). As of fiscal year end, the Company had approximately $13.4 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization, which is scheduled to expire in December 2018.\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments as of February 3, 2018 totaled $138.4 million compared to $116.5 million at prior fiscal year end. The Company generated operating cash flow of $42.6 million in Fiscal 2018. The Company had no debt outstanding at year end. Year-end inventory was $87.8 million, a 14.1% decline from $102.3 million at last fiscal year end and below guidance of $90 million to $95 million.\nFirst Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Outlook\nAll numbers referenced below are non-GAAP. The prior year non-GAAP numbers referenced below exclude the previously disclosed severance charges, store impairment charges, strategic plan consulting fees, tax reform legislation charge, and other charges.

A gross profit percentage of flat to slightly up over 54.8% in the prior year first quarter.

A gross profit percentage of flat to slightly up over the adjusted gross profit percentage of 56.1% in Fiscal 2018.

Further, the non-GAAP measures utilized by the Company may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nThe Company believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in this earnings release, including gross profit; selling, general, and administrative expenses; operating income; net income and diluted income per share, along with the associated percentages of net revenues, are helpful to investors because they allow for a more direct comparison of the Company’s year-over-year performance and are consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the Company’s supplemental schedules included in this earnings release.\nCall Information\nA conference call to discuss results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year is scheduled for today, Wednesday, March 14, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
