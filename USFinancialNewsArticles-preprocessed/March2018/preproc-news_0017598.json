    "text": "McDonald's announced Tuesday it will use fresh beef in some of its U.S. burgers, prompting rival Wendy's to lay down some fresh-never-frozen ribbing.\nWendy's has for years boasted its beef patties are never-frozen, a distinction it says sets it apart from competitors. So, after McDonald's told the world it will begin to offer fresh beef in Quarter Pounders and Signature Crafted Recipe sandwiches at a quarter of its U.S. restaurants, Wendy's went whole ham.\n\nTweet \n\nThat back-handed how-do-you-do was followed by a series of tweets featuring photos of sad-looking McDonald's burgers.\n\nTweet \n\nTweet \n\nTweet \n\nTweet \n\nTweet \n\nTweet \n\nWendy's put a bow on its tirade with this final heavy handed callback to its motto.\n\"Some people are going to use fresh beef in SOME cheeseburgers, SOME of the time,\" it tweeted. \"We believe in using fresh, never frozen beef in every cheeseburger everyday.\"\nThe company's chief concept and marketing officer Kurt Kane explained the reason for the social media blitz to Business Insider . \n\"We wanted to make sure that people aren't confused about what is communicated and what is reality,\" he said.\nMore from USA Today: \nWhy losing weight has nothing to do with your self-esteem \n50 states: 50 female chefs \nAirlines elevate meals with chef collaborations",
