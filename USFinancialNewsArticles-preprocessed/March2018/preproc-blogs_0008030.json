    "text": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked the University of California at Los Angeles not to share video or audio from his recent discussion at the school after he was heckled and hissed at by protesters, the Washington Post reported Thursday .\nOne heckler, who yelled at Mnuchin over the recently passed tax law, was physically escorted out of the auditorium by police. It was not clear from video footage of the altercation how long she had been berating the treasury secretary.\nJacob Woocher tweet: Steve Mnuchin being called on his plutocratic BS at UCLA. Enemy of the people! Foreclosed on 36,000 people and helped pass the biggest corporate tax cut in history\nThe Post reported that the audience interrupted Mnuchin's remarks with boos, hisses and outbursts throughout the event.\nDemonstrators reportedly stood outside the auditorium, clad in the attire of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and served cake to passersby.\nThe public event was hosted by UCLA's Burkle Center for International Relations on Monday.\nA UCLA spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal that Mnuchin had rescinded his permission for the school to post media of the event on its website.\nMnuchin's office did not immediately responded to CNBC's request for comment.\nMarketplace.com, whose host moderated the discussion with Mnuchin, later published the audio and full transcript of the event.\nRead the full report from the Washington Post.",
