R -1.94% is launching a kind of Airbnb for cargo transportation, a vehicle-sharing marketplace for commercial vehicles. The WSJ’s Austen Hufford writes the service will help companies with idle vehicles rent them out, and give other companies some leeway in making the big investment behind commercial trucks . The Ryder plan reflects the growth of the so-called sharing economy in consumer markets, which has been slow to expand in industrial shipping. Ryder’s plan may set a formula for more shared space in a trucking market that has shippers straining for capacity. But the company is rolling out its marketplace in measured steps, starting only in the Atlanta area. And Ryder may have to manage a delicate balance by serving customers in its new marketplace without having that secondary market drive down prices in its core leasing and fleet-management operations.\nConcerns over a deepening U.S.-China trade conflict are reaching into supply chains around the Pacific Rim. From Japan’s electronics to Australia’s iron ore miners, the Asia-Pacific region’s economies depend on selling parts and materials to feed China’s export machine. The WSJ’s Ben Otto, Rhiannon Hoyle and Chieko Tsuneoka write that countries and companies that ship parts and raw materials around the region are worried about getting caught in the crossfire . Australia, for instance, sends 30% of its exports to China, including iron ore and metallurgical coal, the main ingredients in steel. The impact is already being felt in some areas. U.S. tariffs on imported solar panels were aimed at China but also hurt a Singapore manufacturer that has been a big exporter to the U.S. Yet the U.S. actions may not be bad news for everyone. Greater restrictions on Chinese auto exports, for instance, could boost Japanese and German car shipments.\nThere’s no secret to the growth strategy at online lingerie seller Adore Me Inc. The New York-based startup plans to open 200 to 300 stores in the U.S. over the next five years, the WSJ’s Khadeeja Safdar writes, hoping storefronts help it take market share from industry leader Victoria’s Secret. It’s the latest step by web-based retailers to build their own version of a multi-channel distribution strategy. Several online startups, including eyeglass maker Warby Parker and sneaker brand Greats, have opened physical stores even as some traditional brick-and-mortar chains have retreated. Lingerie has been protected somewhat from web sales because fit and comfort can be hard to assess online. But a shift toward simpler sizing and lenient return policies has made the category more viable online. Adore Me says its annual revenue has reached $100 million, and the store strategy is one way to kick the growth into a higher gear.\nECONOMY & TRADE The NLMK Indiana steel mill in Portage, Ind. Photo: Getty Images There are sighs of relief from some steel-focused U.S. supply chains now that the Trump administration has temporarily exempted selected countries from new tariffs. That’s especially true for some of the largest customers of imported steel, the processors of semifinished steel . The U.S. imported nearly 8 million metric tons of such steel last year, the WSJ’s Bob Tita reports, more than a fifth of all steel imports. Most arrived as the mattress-sized slabs that are reheated and rolled into sheet steel for products including pipe and automotive components. Companies that rely on it say the material should be treated like feedstock, and not subject to the same tariffs as finished products. U.S. steelmakers roll nearly all their production into finished goods, and American manufacturers fear the tariffs will lead to a shortage of slabs. That could change if the tariffs encourage steel companies to restart or build more domestic production capacity, adding new wrinkles to the slab competition.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Because Singapore also makes solar panels, we also become collateral damage. ’\n—Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore’s foreign minister, on U.S. tariffs.\nNumber of the Day 3% Increase in U.S. refrigerated truck volumes in the week ending March 24 after a 9% increase the week before, according to DAT Solutions LLC.\nIN OTHER NEWS U.S. consumer confidence fell in March from an 18-year high the month before.
