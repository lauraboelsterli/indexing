    "text": "NEW YORK, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pioneering marketing agency, Mirrorball, announces the expansion of their leadership team. Beginning this month, Katie Bowman takes the reins as the Experience Production Director, and Rebecca Eyre has been appointed the Director of Strategy & Insights, leading the agency's new consultancy, separately branded as moreHuman.\nJoining the agency from digital media darling Refinery29, Katie Bowman will now lead the agency's award-winning production team. With a deep passion for creativity and immersive experience, Katie is charged with further defining the future of consumer engagement. Before her recent work on Refinery's \"29Rooms\", Katie held a leadership role as the Executive Producer at Rubik, a boutique experiential agency with a niche in film and television. With a hand in all aspects of program management, Katie led national marketing activations for HBO's Game of Thrones, ABC's Shark Tank and 20th Century Fox's X-Men. Aside from her commercial work, Katie is excited to leverage her experience as creative director of Brooklyn art collective Treetops, known for absurdist dance parties at Brooklyn's House of Yes as well as other immersive events at dusty warehouses throughout New York.\nAs part of the agency's ongoing effort to delve deep into the world of experience for both brands and the people they serve, Mirrorball has formed a new consultancy called moreHuman. Chosen to lead this new innovative endeavor is behavioral psychologist Rebecca Eyre. With a Masters in Psychology, Rebecca draws from her years of clinical research and practice, as well as a diverse leadership background including her philanthropic work at Microsoft. Rebecca brings a sharp understanding of the human experience, emotions, and relationships to the world of marketing. She and her team of anthropologists, researchers and strategists will work closely with Mirrorball clients to further improve the value of experience as a marketing tool. moreHuman will offer standalone insights to help companies become more relationally competent and culturally relevant to their consumers.\nCEO and Founder, Michael Blatter shares: \"Our agency's success is dependent on its people. We're very excited to add more powerful women to our primarily female executive team which includes our VP of Client Service, Karma von Burg. We're looking forward to leveraging the unique experience that Katie and Rebecca bring to the agency.\"\nABOUT MIRRORBALL\nMirrorball is an NYC-based Marketing agency with a focus on experience design. We strive to enhance the way brands and businesses participate in people's lives. The Mirrorball team shares a sacred bond, rooted in our passion for contributing to and impacting popular culture.
