A security guard stands outside the Russian Embassy in London, Britain, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls A Reuters photographer outside the Russian embassy in London saw two buses arrive. Russian diplomats and children disembarked but have not left the embassy yet, the photographer said. After the first known offensive use of such a nerve agent on European soil since World War Two, May last Wednesday gave 23 Russians she said were spies working under diplomatic cover at the embassy a week to leave.
