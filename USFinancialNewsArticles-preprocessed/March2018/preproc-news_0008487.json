    "text": "Home / Politics / Boeing executive rules out reviving 767 passenger jet Boeing executive rules out reviving 767 passenger jet 1 min ago \nBoeing on Monday ruled out reviving its dormant 767 passenger plane as it continues to ponder options for a promising niche in the middle of the aircraft market. \n“Bringing back the 767 (passenger version) – I just don’t see it,” Randy Tinseth, vice-president of commercial marketing, told reporters on a conference call. \nThere has been some speculation Boeing would revive the 767 wide-body passenger line to offer airlines a low-price backstop in case a proposed brand-new mid-market plane suffered delays, or in case Boeing decided not to go ahead with that project.
