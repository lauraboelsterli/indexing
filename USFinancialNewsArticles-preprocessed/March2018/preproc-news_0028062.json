    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 3:37 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago U.S. Senators propose bill to bar airlines from placing animals in danger Reuters Staff 1 Min Read March 15 (Reuters) - Two. U.S. senators on Thursday unveiled legislation to explicitly bar airlines from putting animals in danger by placing them in overhead baggage compartments after outrage grew over the death of a puppy. Senators John Kennedy, a Republican, and Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, said the legislation would direct the Federal Aviation Administration to create regulations to prohibit the storing of a live animal in any overhead compartment and impose civil fines for violations. The bill was prompted after a dog died in-flight after a United Airlines Co cabin attendant ordered it stowed in an overhead bin, prompting an apology from the airline.
