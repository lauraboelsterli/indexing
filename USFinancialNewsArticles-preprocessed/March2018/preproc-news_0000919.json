    "text": "PARIS, March 2 (Reuters) - France’s Canal+ media group, part of Vivendi, says it is suspending broadcasts of channels owned by TF1, saying the latter is imposing“unreasonable” fees on its distributors.\n“The Canal+ group reasserts its wish to be able to broadcast Groupe TF1’s free channels but does not intend to pay in order to transmit them,” Canal+ said in a statement, adding that it was taking the case to a commercial court in Paris.\nTF1, part Bouygues, is already engaged in a legal tussle with Orange over a similar fee dispute.
