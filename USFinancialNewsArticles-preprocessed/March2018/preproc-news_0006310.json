    "text": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli Arab motorist injured three security personnel in a ramming attack in northern Israel on Sunday and was shot and wounded, police and the military said.\nA police statement said the driver was taken into custody after carrying out the attack at a market parking lot and outside a train station in the city of Acre. The force said he had acted for nationalistic reasons.\nVideo posted on social media showed a sport utility vehicle turning into the parking lot at high speed and hitting a pedestrian, sending him flying. In other footage, the vehicle is seen mounting a sidewalk.\nPolice said three people were struck by the vehicle, identifying one of them as a paramilitary policeman. The military said the two others hurt in the incident were soldiers. A hospital official said their injuries were not life-threatening.\nThe police statement did not say who shot the driver, who it identified as an Arab citizen of Israel. Local media reports said soldiers at the train station fired at the vehicle. The hospital official said the driver was shot several times and was in a moderate to serious condition.\nWriting by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ",
