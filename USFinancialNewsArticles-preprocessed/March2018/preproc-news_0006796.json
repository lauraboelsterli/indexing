    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tronox Limited (NYSE:TROX) reported revenue of $464 million for the fourth quarter 2017, up 32 percent from $352 million in the year-ago quarter and up 7 percent from $435 million in the prior quarter. Income from operations of $60 million increased from $1 million in the year-ago quarter and $51 million in the prior quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Tronox Limited was breakeven, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to Tronox Limited of $97 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter, which included a corporate reorganization tax benefit and restructuring benefit of $138 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, and a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Tronox Limited of $31 million, or ($0.26) per diluted share in the prior quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Tronox Limited in the fourth quarter included Cristal acquisition-related expenses of $15 million. Excluding acquisition expenses, adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Tronox Limited (Non-GAAP) was $15 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of $135 million increased 125 percent compared to $60 million in the year-ago quarter and 10 percent compared to $123 million in the prior quarter.\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.045 per share payable on March 26, 2018, to shareholders of record of the company's Class A and Class B ordinary shares at the close of business on March 12, 2018.\nJeffry Quinn, president and chief executive officer of Tronox, said: \"The fourth quarter provided a strong finish to a very successful year for us strategically, financially and operationally. We continued to build on the momentum generated in earlier quarters – momentum that we see continuing in 2018. Our TiO 2 business delivered robust performance in the quarter, posting revenue growth of 32 percent, a more than five-fold increase in income from operations, adjusted EBITDA growth of 95 percent and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34 percent. This high level of performance clearly reflects the benefits of our vertical integration, as both our pigment and mineral sands operations delivered strong revenue and profit growth. Our results also reflect the extraordinary work by our global TiO 2 team to reduce costs through the successful implementation of their Operational Excellence program. We are confident that 2018 will be another year of strong performance and a transformational one for us as we look forward to closing the Cristal TiO 2 acquisition and unlocking for our shareholders the significant value inherent in the combination.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017\nTronox TiO 2\nTiO 2 segment revenue of $464 million increased 32 percent compared to $352 million in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher selling prices for pigment, zircon and pig iron. Pigment sales of $316 million increased 28 percent compared to $246 million in the year-ago quarter, as sales volumes increased 2 percent and average selling prices increased 26 percent (23 percent on a local currency basis). Pigment selling prices were higher in all regions.

These , which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the . These and other risk factors are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including those under the heading entitled \"Risk Factors\" in our Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nMoreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can management assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results those contained in any .

These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are a supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to, the company's results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures presented by the company may be different from non-U.S. GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the company's operating performance. Specifically, the company believes the non-U.S. GAAP information provides useful measures to investors regarding the company's financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The presentation of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or guidance prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP results is included herein.\nManagement believes these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures:\nReflect Tronox Limited's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparison and analysis of trends in its business, as they exclude income and expense that are not reflective of ongoing operating results; Provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Tronox Limited's operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods; Provide additional view of the operating performance of the company by adding interest expenses, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization to the net income. Further adjustments due to gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and stock-based compensation charges attempt to exclude items that are either non-cash or unusual in nature; Assist investors to assess the company's compliance with financial covenants under its debt instruments; Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures management uses for planning and budgeting processes and to monitor and evaluate financial and operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to measures of our financial performance as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as net income (loss). Because other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than Tronox, EBITDA may not be, and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this release is not, comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, and We believe that the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure \"Adjusted net loss attributable to Tronox Limited\" and its presentation on a per share basis provide useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts. We also believe that excluding the effects of these items from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period.\nMedia Contact: Melissa Zona\n+1.636.751.4057\nInvestor Contact: Brennen Arndt\n+1.203.705.3730\nTRONOX LIMITED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (U.S. GAAP)\n(UNAUDITED)\n(Millions of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet sales\n$ 464\n$ 352\n$ 1,698\n$ 1,309\nCost of goods sold\n339\n298\n1,310\n1,175\nGross profit\n125\n54\n388\n134\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\n(65)\n(54)\n(251)\n(189)\nRestructuring income (expense)\n-\n1\n1\n(1)\nIncome (loss) from operations\n60\n1\n138\n(56)\nInterest and debt expense, net\n(48)\n(47)\n(188)\n(185)\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt\n-\n-\n(28)\n4\nOther income (expense), net\n(14)\n(5)\n(9)\n(27)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n(2)\n(51)\n(87)\n(264)\nIncome tax (provision) benefit\n4\n150\n(6)\n125\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations\n2\n99\n(93)\n(139)\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n-\n24\n(179)\n79\nNet income (loss)\n2\n123\n(272)\n(60)\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest\n2\n2\n13\n1\nNet income (loss) attributable to Tronox Limited\n$ -\n$ 121\n$ (285)\n$ (61)\nNet income (loss) per share, basic:\nContinuing operations\n$ -\n$ 0.84\n$ (0.89)\n$ (1.20)\nDiscontinued operations\n$ -\n$ 0.21\n$ (1.50)\n$ 0.68\nNet income (loss) per share, basic\n$ -\n$ 1.05\n$ (2.39)\n$ (0.52)\nNet income (loss) per share, diluted:\nContinuing operations\n$ -\n$ 0.81\n$ (0.89)\n$ (1.20)\nDiscontinued operations\n$ -\n$ 0.20\n$ (1.50)\n$ 0.68\nNet income (loss) per share, diluted\n$ -\n$ 1.01\n$ (2.39)\n$ (0.52)\nWeighted average shares outstanding, basic (in thousands)\n120,939\n116,319\n119,502\n116,161\nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted (in thousands)\n120,939\n120,881\n119,502\n116,161\nOther Operating Data:\nCapital expenditures\n$ 28\n$ 27\n$ 91\n$ 86\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense\n$ 46\n$ 46\n$ 182\n$ 177\nTRONOX LIMITED\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED)\n(Millions of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS)\nATTRIBUTABLE TO TRONOX LIMITED (U.S. GAAP)\nTO ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nATTRIBUTABLE TO TRONOX LIMITED (NON-U.S. GAAP)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss) attributable to Tronox Limited (U.S. GAAP)\n$ -\n$ 121\n$ (285)\n$ (61)\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (U.S. GAAP)\n-\n24\n(179)\n79\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Tronox Limited (U.S. GAAP)\n$ -\n$ 97\n$ (106)\n$ (140)\nAcquisition related matters (a)\n15\n-\n48\n-\nRestructuring (income) expense (b)\n-\n(1)\n(1)\n1\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt (c)\n-\n-\n28\n(4)\nTax impact of reorganization (d)\n-\n(137)\n-\n(107)\nAdjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Tronox Limited (non-U.S. GAAP) (e)\n$ 15\n$ (41)\n$ (31)\n$ (250)\nDiluted net income (loss) per share from continuing operations (U.S. GAAP)\n$ -\n$ 0.81\n$ (0.89)\n$ (1.20)\nAcquisition related expense, per share\n0.12\n-\n0.40\n-\nRestructuring (income) expense, per share\n-\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n0.01\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, per share\n-\n-\n0.23\n(0.03)\nTax impact of reorganization, per share\n-\n(1.13)\n-\n(0.92)\nDiluted adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations per share attributable to Tronox Limited (non-U.S. GAAP)\n$ 0.12\n$ (0.33)\n$ (0.27)\n$ (2.14)\nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted (in thousands)\n120,939\n120,881\n119,502\n116,161\n(a) Represents transaction costs associated with the Cristal Transaction which were recorded in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n(b) Represents severance and other costs associated with the shutdown of our sodium chlorate plant and other global restructuring efforts, which was recorded in \"Restructuring income (expense)\" in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(c) Represents a $28 million loss which includes a $22 million loss associated with the redemption of the outstanding balance of our Senior Notes due 2020, $1 million of unamortized original debt issuance costs from the repayment of the UBS Revolver, and $5 million of debt issuance costs from the refinancing activities associated with the term loans.
