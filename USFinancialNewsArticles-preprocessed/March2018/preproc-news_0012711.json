    "text": "DUBAI, March 5 (Reuters) - Qatar’s main stock index slumped to its lowest level in more than two months on Monday as two big Qatari companies went ex-dividend.\nThe Gulf’s markets had earlier opened on weak footing, taking their cue from Asia where investors exited shares amid concerns about a global trade war that could harm the outlook for growth.\nQatar shares closed 3.2 percent after two of its heavyweight stocks went ex-dividend.\nIndustries Qatar dived 7.8 percent and telecom firm Ooredoo dropped 4.1 percent.\nIn its first trading session, Qatar’s first listed exchange traded fund closed 1.6 percent down.\nQatari investment firm Amwal raised funds for the ETF, designed to track the Qatar Exchange Index, which screens for the top 20 listed companies in Qatar by market capitalisation and liquidity.\nOther markets were subdued. Saudi stocks were 0.03 percent lower, weighed down by telecommunications services and healthcare stocks.\nBanque Saudi Fransi also finished 1.9 percent lower after missing forecasts for fourth-quarter profit in its results published on Sunday.\nThe Dubai index was down 0.2 percent, but the Abu Dhabi index was 0.1 percent up.\nReporting by Tom Arnold.
