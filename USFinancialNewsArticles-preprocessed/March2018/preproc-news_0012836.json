FILE PHOTO - A sign is seen outside a branch of Lloyds Bank in central London February 3, 2014. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/File Photo The program, designed to reduce the ordinary share capital of the British lender, will end no later than Feb. 4, 2019. The repurchasing plan, which was earlier announced on Feb. 21, follows a return to full private ownership in 2017 after several years as a state-supported bank.
