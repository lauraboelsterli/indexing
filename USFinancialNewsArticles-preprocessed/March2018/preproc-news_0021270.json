    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OpsRamp , the IT operations platform for the modern enterprise, announces an expanded leadership team with the appointments of Curt DiSibio to CFO and Darren Cunningham to Vice President of Marketing. DiSibio and Cunningham are the latest executives to join OpsRamp, whose cloud-based platform is used by over 1,400 organizations. In November, OpsRamp hired Jim Lampert to run global channel sales and Bhanu Singh to lead products and operations. OpsRamp has built momentum in the market thanks to a robust partner ecosystem and intuitive technology that helps companies manage their entire IT estates.\nAlong with an early background in public accounting, DiSibio brings over 20 years as a CFO of Silicon Valley technology companies, including K2View, Zend Technologies, and Integral Development Corporation. Meanwhile, Cunningham has been in leadership roles in the data management, analytics and performance monitoring market, most recently running marketing for SnapLogic and Portfolio Marketing for New Relic.\n“The legacy IT operations market (ITOM) is ripe for disruption. OpsRamp’s comprehensive SaaS platform has proven to be a critical component of a company’s digital transformation, enabling IT organizations to modernize their infrastructure, and manage cloud, virtual and on-premises systems as one,” said Cunningham. “I’m thrilled to be a part of this world-class team.”\nIn October 2017 OpsRamp announced investment from Sapphire Ventures to accelerate growth and drive platform innovation. Earlier this month, the company announced Unified Service Intelligence , which combines service availability and performance including discovery, hybrid monitoring and service health dashboards, with incident management capabilities including event correlation, alert notifications and service level management.\nOpsRamp is continuing to hire for key roles in the company’s San Jose, CA headquarters as well as other locations.
