    "text": "March 8 (Reuters) - French outdoor advertising company JCDecaux said on Thursday it expects a slowdown in organic growth in the first quarter, due to the cancellation of a contract in Paris and a delay in the opening of the Guangzhou Baiyun airport Terminal 2 in China.\nThe family-controlled group said it expects organic growth of around 2 percent in the first quarter. It reported organic growth of 6.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe company reported full-year net income group share of 193.7 million euros ($240.34 million), down 13.8 percent.
