The China Enterprises Index lost 2.4 percent at 12,001.16.\nTechnology shares led the declines with a 5 percent tumble, after concerns over tighter regulatory controls knocked down the tech sector on Wall Street.\nAnother factor souring the mood for investors was a resurfacing of worries about a confrontation between the United States and China.\nChina’s state-run Global Times reported that the country will soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on United States’ exports to China.\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed “joining forces to counter China’s economic practices and alleged intellectual property theft, the White House said.\nOn top of lingering fears about trade friction, Hong Kong stocks are also vulnerable to further increases in money market rates in te city, brokerage First Shanghai Group said on Wednesday.\n“The market remains volatile, and stability is not in sight,” the brokerage wrote.\n“In the short- to mid-term, Hong Kong stocks are still in a downward trend ... and it’s not time to be greedy.”\nStocks fell across the board.\nSectors including properties, commodities, and finance all dropped more than 2 percent. Defensive stocks such as utilities outperformed the market.\nReporting by the Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ",
