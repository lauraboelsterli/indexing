    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 6:59 PM / Updated 2 hours ago UEFA drops case against Atalanta over racist chanting Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nZURICH (Reuters) - UEFA has dropped its investigation into allegations of racist behaviour by fans of Serie A club Atalanta during the Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, European soccer’s ruling body said on Thursday. \nAtalanta fans had been accused of making monkey chants by UEFA during the 1-1 draw on Feb 22 and Dortmund striker Michy Batshuayi also complained of racism. \n“2018 and still racist monkey noises in the stands ... really ?!,” he said on his Twitter account \nUEFA said its disciplinary board had decided “to close the disciplinary proceedings opened for racist or discriminatory behaviour”. It did not give further details. \nHowever, Atalanta were fined 34,000 euros (£29,808) after fans let off fireworks and threw objects, and because of blocked stairways. \nDortmund, who won the round of 32 tie 4-3 on aggregate, were fined 40,000 euros after their fans also let off fireworks and hurled objects. \nRed Star Belgrade and CSKA Moscow were fined 31,000 euros and 30,000 euros respectively over the use of fireworks by fans at their Europa League match on Feb. 13 which ended 0-0. \nSwiss champions Basel were fined 8,000 euros over the use of fireworks during their 2-1 Champions League win at Manchester City on March 7.
