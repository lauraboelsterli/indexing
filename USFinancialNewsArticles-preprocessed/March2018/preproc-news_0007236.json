    "text": "TOKYO, March 1 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average fell to a one-week low on Thursday morning, with precision machinery makers hit by the euro’s weakness against the yen and most sectors in negative territory.\nThe Nikkei dropped 1.7 percent to 21,684.72 in mid-morning trade, its lowest since Feb. 22.\nThe broader Topix declined 1.6 percent to 1,739.62.\nInvestors were worried about the yen’s strength against the euro, adding to overall risk aversion.\nThe euro dropped to 129.86 yen, its weakest level since early September after benign inflation data in the euro zone dented expectations that the European Central Bank will dial back its stimulus.\nPrecision equipment makers Omron Corp and Terumo Corp, which have a relatively big exposure in Europe, fell 2.8 percent and 3.0 percent respectively.\nOther exporters were also sold down, with Toyota Motor shedding 1.9 percent and Honda Motor falling 1.1 percent.
