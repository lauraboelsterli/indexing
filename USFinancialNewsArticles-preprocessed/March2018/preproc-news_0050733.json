REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton \nThe improvement reverses a decline in February and continues a see-saw pattern of monthly changes, although a modestly positive trend is still intact. \nThe KBC Bank Ireland/ESRI consumer sentiment index increased to 108.1 in March from 105.2 in February. In January, the index hit 110.4, which was the highest level since February 2001. \n“The pick-up in sentiment in March represents a continuation of a trend improvement in confidence as Irish consumers put more distance between themselves and the recent financial crisis,” KBC chief economist Austin Hughes said. \n“This may be no more than a temporary blip but it could be hinting at the appearance of a ‘feel-good’ factor that could signal a step-up in consumer spending and a more rounded Irish economic recovery through 2018.” \nHughes said the financial crisis is still a significant constraint on confidence but the recent data suggests its impact might be diminishing. \n“Irish consumers are increasingly looking forward rather than back,” he added.
