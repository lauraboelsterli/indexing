Miguna Miguna, a lawyer of dual Kenyan and Canadian citizenship, is seen through as glass door at the Jomo Kenyatta airport after he was detained by police in Nairobi, Kenya March 26, 2018, during an attempt to force him onto a plane to Canada. REUTERS/Stephen Mdunga \nThe dispute over Miguna Miguna is part of a wider tussle between the government and the judiciary and it could also strain relations that have recently improved between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga. \nThe two leaders announced on March 9 they would set aside years of acrimony and work together to unite Kenya, which is divided along political and ethnic lines in the wake of elections last year in which around 100 people were killed. \nThe surprise announcement promised a fresh start for politics in Kenya, a country that is east Africa’s richest economy and a hub for diplomacy, trade and security. \nAuthorities deported Miguna in February saying he had rescinded his citizenship.

REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya/File Photo \nHe was also charged with treason because of his role in a mock swearing-in ceremony for Odinga in January that was a direct challenge to Kenyatta, who won a second term in October. \nPolice detained Miguna on Monday at the main airport in the capital as he returned after a court ruled that he should be allowed back into Kenya. The court ordered Miguna, the interior minister and the police chief to appear before it. \nThere was no immediate comment from the police on Wednesday as to why Miguna was not brought to court. \n“The court should bite those disobeying court orders harder,” James Orengo, a senator and lawyer for Miguna, told the court. Government critics say authorities defy court orders in cases involving politics and opposition politicians.
