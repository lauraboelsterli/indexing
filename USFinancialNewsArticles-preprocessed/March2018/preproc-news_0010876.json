Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif shakes hands with French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Tehran, Iran, March 5, 2018. Tasnim News Agency/Handout via REUTERS Le Drian said after a day of tough talks in Tehran that France would continue discussions with Iran, adding that it was imperative to find a way to bring stability to region.
