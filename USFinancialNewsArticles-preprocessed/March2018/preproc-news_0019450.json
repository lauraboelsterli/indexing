    "text": "Records Record Revenues and Earnings; Completes Significant Refinancings\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Clipper Realty Inc. (NYSE: CLPR) (the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of multifamily residential and commercial properties in the New York metropolitan area, today announced financial and operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights for the Three Months and Year Ended December 31, 2017\nGrew revenues by 12.7% to a record $27.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, and by 11.8% to a record $104.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016 Achieved record quarterly income from operations of $7.5 million and record quarterly net operating income (“NOI”) 1 of $14.8 million for the fourth quarter 2017; achieved record annual NOI of $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 Reduced net loss by 51% to $1.5 million, or $0.04 per share, for the fourth quarter 2017, and by 51% to $6.0 million, or $0.15 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016 Increased adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) 1 by 61% to $4.5 million, or $0.10 per share, for the fourth quarter 2017, and by 67% to $16.7 million, or $0.38 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016 Acquired 10 West 65 th Street, a residential property in Manhattan, for $79.0 million in October Declared a dividend of $0.095 for the fourth quarter 2017, representing a 12% increase over the dividend for the same period in 2016\nIn addition to the 2017 highlights above, on February 21, 2018, the Company completed the refinancings (the “Refinancings”) of existing debt on its Flatbush Gardens and Tribeca House properties that lower the interest rates on the loans, fix the rates on the debt of all of its operating properties, reduce annual debt service by approximately $6.6 million and provide additional liquidity. With the proceeds of the Refinancings, the Company repaid the Flatbush Gardens and the Tribeca House loans, and the net remaining proceeds of $21.5 million increased the Company’s cash position.\nDavid Bistricer, Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented,\n“We are pleased with the completion of debt refinancings at our Flatbush Gardens and Tribeca House properties in February. These new facilities improve our capital structure, mitigate interest rate risk, reduce annual debt service requirements, and provide greater flexibility and liquidity for Clipper Realty to execute our strategic plan.\nWe are also pleased with our fourth quarter 2017 results which demonstrate solid revenue growth and continuing high levels of NOI and AFFO, and reflect the quality of our property portfolio and the operational excellence of our team. With strong management and prudent capital improvements, we believe our properties will contribute meaningfully to our cash flow growth over time. As we progress through 2018 and beyond, we remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives, which include driving cash flow, increasing scale, enhancing efficiencies through asset repositioning and expertly operating our high-quality portfolio, to create long-term value for our shareholders. We are excited to continue to grow our portfolio through the acquisition of 10 West 65 th Street.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenues grew by $3.1 million, or 12.7%, to $27.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $24.2 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Revenues grew by $10.9 million, or 11.8%, to $104.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The growth was attributable to a lease renewal on approximately one-third of the office space at the 250 Livingston property effective January 2017, increases in residential rent per square foot at the Flatbush Gardens property, increases in residential rent per square foot and occupancy at the Tribeca House property, the acquisition of the 10 West 65 th Street property in October 2017 and, for the annual period, the acquisition of the Aspen property in June 2016.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter 2017 was $1.5 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to $3.1 million, or $0.09 per share, for the fourth quarter 2016, representing an improvement of approximately 51%. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $6.0 million, or $0.15 per share, compared to $12.3 million, or $0.34 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an improvement of approximately 51%. The reduction in net loss in both periods was due to higher revenue and reduced interest expense, partially offset by higher real estate taxes, operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization and, for the annual period, the acquisition of the Aspen property in June 2016.\nAFFO for the fourth quarter 2017 was $4.5 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.07 per share, for the fourth quarter 2016. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $16.7 million, or $0.38 per share, compared to $10.0 million, or $0.26 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. These increases reflect the above-mentioned improvements in revenue and operating expense changes and, for the annual period, the acquisition of the Aspen property in June 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nNotes payable (excluding unamortized loan costs) was $855.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $764.6 million at December 31, 2016. The balance at December 31, 2017, included the $34.4 million and $59.0 million mortgage loans obtained in connection with the 10 West 65 th Street and 107 Columbia Heights acquisitions, respectively, discussed below.\nIn the first quarter 2017, the Company completed its initial public offering in which it sold approximately 6.4 million shares at $13.50 per share, raising approximately $86.3 million of gross proceeds.\n2018 Refinancings\nAs discussed above, in February 2018, the Company completed the Refinancings.\nThe Company refinanced Flatbush Gardens with a ten-year $246 million initial fixed rate secured first mortgage loan with New York Community Bank, the property’s current lender, which matures March 2028, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.5% per annum for the first five years and is interest-only for thirty months.\nThe Company refinanced Tribeca House with a ten-year $360 million fixed rate secured loan which matures March 2028, bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.506% per annum and is interest-only for the entire term.\nWith the proceeds, the Company repaid (i) both of the Tribeca House loans totaling $410 million due November 2018, which bore interest at a blended one-month LIBOR + 3.75% annual rate, and (ii) both of the Flatbush Gardens mortgage loans totaling approximately $168 million due October 2024, which bore interest at a fixed 3.875% annual rate. Net remaining proceeds of $21.5 million increased the Company’s cash position.\nAcquisitions\nIn October 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of a residential property at 10 West 65th Street in Manhattan, which comprises approximately 76,000 square feet plus 53,000 square feet of air rights, for $79.0 million. The 82-unit property is located near Lincoln Center and Central Park in the Upper West Side neighborhood. The Company plans to invest incremental capital to enhance the property. In connection with the acquisition, the Company obtained a $34.4 million, ten-year mortgage loan secured by the property. The note bears interest at 3.375% for the first five years and thereafter at the prime rate plus 2.75% (subject to an option to fix the rate), and requires interest-only payments for the first two years and monthly principal and interest payments thereafter based on a 30-year amortization schedule.\nIn May 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of a residential property at 107 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn, which comprises approximately 154,000 square feet, in vacant condition, for $87.5 million or $568 per square foot. The property is located in the historic Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. The Company is in the process of repositioning the property. In connection with the acquisition, the Company obtained (a) a $59.0 million mortgage loan, secured by the property, and (b) a construction loan, secured by the property, that will provide up to $14.7 million for eligible capital improvements and carrying costs; the notes bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.85% and mature in May 2020. The property is carried on the balance sheet as real estate under development.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company continues to strategically invest in its properties, selectively repositioning assets and driving ongoing rent growth. The Company incurred $22.8 million, primarily on major renovation projects, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $18.5 million in the same period in 2016. At the Tribeca House property, the expenditures were to upgrade units and common areas, including the lobby. At the Flatbush Gardens property, comprising 59 buildings and nearly 22 acres, the expenditures included the replacement of a major terrace area, installation of security cameras, lighting and refurbishment of all basement areas, and installation of new mailboxes and new laundry rooms. At the 141 Livingston Street property, the expenditures were to refurbish elements of the building as agreed under the lease with the City of New York. At the 107 Columbia Heights property, the expenditures were to commence development of the property and were funded primarily from the associated construction loan.\nDividend\nThe Company today declared its fourth quarter dividend of $0.095 per share to shareholders of record on March 22, 2018, payable March 29, 2018. This amount represents a 12% increase over the dividend for the same period in 2016.\nConference Call and Supplemental Material\nThe Company will host a conference call on March 8, 2018, at 5:00 PM Eastern Time to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results.

We believe that to understand our performance further, FFO, AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA, and NOI should be compared with our reported net income or income from operations and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nFunds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations\nFFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and impairment adjustments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our calculation of FFO is consistent with FFO as defined by NAREIT.\nAFFO is defined by us as FFO excluding amortization of identifiable intangibles incurred in property acquisitions, straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases, amortization costs incurred in originating debt, interest rate cap mark-to-market, amortization of non-cash equity compensation and acquisition costs, less recurring capital expenditures.\nHistorical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. In fact, real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. FFO is intended to be a standard supplemental measure of operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation and valuation adjustments from net income. We consider FFO useful in evaluating potential property acquisitions and measuring operating performance. We further consider AFFO useful in determining funds available for payment of distributions. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent net income or cash flows from operations computed in accordance with GAAP. You should not consider FFO and AFFO to be alternatives to net income as reliable measures of our operating performance; nor should you consider FFO and AFFO to be alternatives to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as measures of liquidity.\nNeither FFO nor AFFO measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs, including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities computed in accordance with GAAP. Further, FFO and AFFO as disclosed by other REITs might not be comparable to our calculations of FFO and AFFO.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of FFO and AFFO for the periods presented to net loss before allocation to non-controlling interests, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 FFO Net loss $ (1,523 ) $ (3,079 ) $ (6,001 ) $ (12,339 ) Real estate depreciation and amortization 4,637 4,649 16,721 15,295 FFO $ 3,114 $ 1,570 $ 10,720 $ 2,956 AFFO FFO $ 3,114 $ 1,570 $ 10,720 $ 2,956 Amortization of real estate tax intangible 392 290 1,568 1,476 Amortization of above- and below-market leases (432 ) (373 ) (1,729 ) (1,730 ) Straight-line rent adjustments 74 116 311 56 Amortization of debt origination costs 736 947 2,899 5,200 Interest rate cap mark-to-market (98 ) (148 ) 261 (139 ) Amortization of LTIP awards 841 632 3,110 2,523 Acquisition costs 32 (81 ) 69 326 Recurring capital spending (116 ) (135 ) (527 ) (670 ) AFFO $ 4,543 $ 2,818 $ 16,682 $ 9,998 AFFO Per Share/Unit $ 0.10 $ 0.07 $ 0.38 $ 0.26 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before allocation to non-controlling interests, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, amortization of identifiable intangibles, straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases, amortization of non-cash equity compensation, interest expense (net) and acquisition costs.\nWe believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP income from operations or net income. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a meaningful financial measure of our core operating performance.\nHowever, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. Further, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Adjusted EBITDA, and accordingly, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that of other REITs.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented to net loss before allocation to non-controlling interests, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Adjusted EBITDA Net loss $ (1,523 ) $ (3,079 ) $ (6,001 ) $ (12,339 ) Real estate depreciation and amortization 4,637 4,649 16,721 15,295 Amortization of real estate tax intangible 392 290 1,568 1,476 Amortization of above- and below-market leases (432 ) (373 ) (1,729 ) (1,730 ) Straight-line rent adjustments 74 116 311 56 Amortization of LTIP awards 841 632 3,110 2,523 Interest expense, net 8,997 9,387 35,505 38,136 Acquisition costs 32 (81 ) 69 326 Adjusted EBITDA $ 13,018 $ 11,541 $ 49,554 $ 43,743 Net Operating Income\nWe believe that NOI is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define NOI as income from operations plus real estate depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs, amortization of identifiable intangibles and straight-line rent adjustments to revenue from long-term leases. We believe that this measure is widely recognized and provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income. We use NOI to evaluate our performance because NOI allows us to evaluate the operating performance of our company by measuring the core operations of property performance and capturing trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. NOI is also a widely used metric in valuation of properties.\nHowever, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. Further, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of NOI for the periods presented to income from operations, computed in accordance with GAAP (amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 NOI Income from operations $ 7,474 $ 6,308 $ 29,504 $ 25,797 Real estate depreciation and amortization 4,637 4,649 16,721 15,295 General and administrative 2,659 2,088 9,944 8,405 Acquisition costs 32 (81 ) 69 326 Amortization of real estate tax intangible 392 290 1,568 1,476 Amortization of above- and below-market leases (432 ) (373 ) (1,729 ) (1,730 ) Straight-line rent adjustments 74 116 311 56 NOI $ 14,836 $ 12,997 $ 56,388 $ 49,625\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180308006262/en/\nInvestors:\nClipper Realty Inc.\nMichael Frenz, Head of Capital Markets\n718-438-2804 x2274\nM: 917-576-7750\nmfrenz@clipperrealty.com\nSource: Clipper Realty Inc.",
