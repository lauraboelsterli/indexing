    "text": "Australia's central bank left its cash rate at 1.5 percent on Tuesday, a widely expected decision given policy makers have signalled a steady outlook for some time to come.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) made the announcement following its monthly policy meeting. In a Reuters poll of 27 analysts, all but one saw a steady outcome this week.\nIt also expects the Australian economy to grow at a faster pace this year as compared to 2017, and that a gradual pick-up in inflation is expected as the economy strengthens.",
