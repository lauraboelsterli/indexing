    "text": "BEIJING, March 30 (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s finance ministry said on Friday it had updated tax rules for semiconductors, making certain chips tax exempt for a period of five years.\nThe new tax rules are effective from January 1, 2018.\nProduction lines that involve chip sizes that are less than 65 nanometres and have an investment of over 15 billion yuan ($2.39 billion) will qualify for the exemption.\nSome production lines involving sizes of less than 130 nanometres will also qualify.\nChina has promoted an aggressive investment policy for semiconductors and plans to be a global leader in the industry by 2030.\n$1 = 6.2687 Chinese yuan Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ",
