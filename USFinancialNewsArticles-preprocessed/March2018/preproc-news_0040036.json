    "text": "China says WTO ruling on Obama tariffs shows US is a 'repeat abuser' Published 8 Hours Ago Jewel Samad | AFP | Getty Images Barack Obama and Xi Jinping. \nChina said that a ruling by the World Trade Organization on Obama-era U.S. tariffs showed that the United States was a \"repeat abuser\" of trade remedy measures, and urged it to take immediate action to correct faulty practices. \nChina's Ministry Of Commerce also asked the United States to provide Chinese companies with a \"fair and stable international trade environment\" in a statement posted on its website late Wednesday. \nThe WTO said on Wednesday said that the United States did not fully comply with a 2014 ruling against its anti-subsidy tariffs on a range of Chinese products. \nHowever, it supported the U.S. claim that Chinese exporters were getting subsidies from \"public bodies,\" despite Beijing's assertions to the contrary. \nChina went to the WTO in 2012 to challenge U.S. anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese exports including solar panels, wind turbines, steel cylinders and aluminium extrusions. \nThe White House said U.S. President Donald Trump will announce tariffs on Chinese imports aimed at curbing theft of U.S. technology that is likely to trigger retaliation from Beijing and stoke fears of a global trade war. \nThere was no indication of the size and the scope of the tariffs, which U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday would target China's high technology sector and which could also include restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States. Other sectors like apparel could also be hit.",
