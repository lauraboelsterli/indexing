    "text": "Anthony Tolliver scored a season-high 25 points, including a career-best six 3-pointers, and the Detroit Pistons had eight players in double figures while rolling past the depleted Chicago Bulls 117-95 on Saturday night in Detroit.\nTolliver, a reserve forward, had not scored more than 20 points this season prior to his outburst, as the Pistons defeated their division rival at Little Caesars Arena for the second time this month.\nAndre Drummond posted 15 points, 20 rebounds, four assists, four steals and four blocks for Detroit, which has won three of its last four games. Reggie Jackson had 15 points, Reggie Bullock tossed in 14 and rookie Luke Kennard supplied 13 points and six assists. James Ennis III delivered 13 off the bench as Detroit’s reserves combined for 63 points.\nBlake Griffin had 25 points, eight rebounds and eight assists when the Pistons defeated the Bulls 99-83 on March 9. He had 10 points and nine assists on Saturday while sitting out the fourth quarter in the lopsided game that Detroit controlled virtually from the opening tap.\nDenzel Valentine paced the Bulls with 18 points, while David Nwaba added 13 points and Noah Vonleh chipped in 12 points.\nThe Bulls, who have lost five straight, played without three starters. Zach LaVine has tendinitis in his left knee, backcourt partner Kris Dunn is nursing a turf toe injury and rookie forward Lauri Markkanen stayed in Chicago to rest his balky back. The Bulls were also playing for the fifth time in eight days.\nThe Pistons made eight 3-pointers in the first, a franchise record for an opening quarter, and raced to a 36-22 lead. They made 13 by halftime, extending the lead to 66-47. Detroit shot 57.8 percent during the half, led by Tolliver’s 16 points.\nVonleh scored six points in the first 4 1/2 minutes of the second half as Chicago pulled within 13. Tolliver’s four-point play with four minutes left in the third quarter made it 83-66. He drained another three later in the quarter, and the Pistons led 95-76 heading into the fourth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
