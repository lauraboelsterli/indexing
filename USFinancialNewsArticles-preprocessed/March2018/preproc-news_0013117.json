    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is starting to move some senior bankers to Frankfurt in preparation for Britain’s exit from the European Union, the investment bank’s co-chief for Germany said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of the Sydney offices of Goldman Sachs in Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo “We’re starting to build infrastructure by making transfers and moving senior people to Frankfurt,” Joerg Kukies said at a conference, without giving the number of staff involved. “The two cities we are looking at the most are Frankfurt and Paris.”\nReuters reported earlier that Goldman Sachs had put more than a dozen UK-based banking, sales and trading staff on notice to move to Frankfurt within weeks, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.
