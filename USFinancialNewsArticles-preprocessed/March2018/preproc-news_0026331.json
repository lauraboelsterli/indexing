RECO is the regulatory body that governs real estate salespeople, brokers, and brokerages by enforcing the law and the rules of professional conduct to protect the public. Nine members on the Board are real estate agents or brokers elected by their professional peers.\nAli Salarian\nSalarian, is one of the thirteen candidates competing for region-1 of central Ontario, while region-3 of eastern and northern Ontario has three candidates, and only two candidates to compete in region-2 eastern and northern Ontario. Voting is restricted to members only and it would be carried out through an online electronic voting system which would be open from Mar. 12 till Mar. 26, 2018.\nAli Salarian believes this yearâ€™s election is crucial due to the recent public and media criticisms of the real estate industry in Ontario, as a result of its very active and busy market during the last few years. Ali Salarian carries under his belt a rich experience in corporate and investment banking as well as his management experience in boutique real estate brokerage in northern Toronto.\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/95ca9def-a997-4e1a-8454-5455d55ddc08\nAli Salarian\nali@ppsrealty.ca\n905-209-7400 ext: 102\nSource: PPS REALTY",
