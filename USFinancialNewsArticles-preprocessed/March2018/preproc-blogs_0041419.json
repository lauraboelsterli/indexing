    "text": "President Donald Trump signed an executive memorandum Thursday that penalizes China for trade practices such as stealing American companies' intellectual property.\nThe new measures impose retaliatory tariffs on about $60 billion in Chinese imports .\nOn hand for the signing was Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson , who oversees the Pentagon's most expensive weapons system, the fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n\"We buy billions and billions of dollars worth of that beautiful F-35,\" Trump said before asking Hewson — whom he introduced as \"Marillyn Lockheed\" — to say a few words.\nHewson, who didn't react to Trump's mixup, said intellectual property is the \"lifeblood\" of the defense industry and welcomed the action taken by the Trump administration.\n\"This is a very important moment for our country, in that we are addressing a critical area for the aerospace and defense industry and that is protecting our intellectual property,\" Hewson said.\nThe F-35, the crown jewel in the defense giant's portfolio, had its sensitive design and electronics data compromised in 2009 . Chinese hackers were believed to be behind the cyber intrusion.\nWhile the U.S.-made Lockheed jets are believed to have better computer software, sophisticated sensors and sensitive stealth coating, the theft of intellectual property gives adversaries the opportunity to avoid the expenses and delays involved with research and development.\nVCG | Getty Images Shenyang J-31 Gyrfalcon model exhibits on the Aviation Expo China. Meanwhile, China announced it was developing a fifth-generation fighter, as well. China's stealth Shenyang J-31 jet bears a remarkably striking resemblance to the F-35.\nBefore the J-31 and the F-35, however, there was curious case of the J-20 and the F-22.\nIn another instance of alleged industrial espionage , the prototypes of China's Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter jet looked suspiciously similar to the sleek design of Lockheed's F-22 Raptor.\nWATCH: F-35 well received by Australia, South Korea and Japan show chapters The F-35 has been well received in Asia by Australia, South Korea and Japan      3:08 AM ET Tue, 6 Feb 2018 | 03:44",
