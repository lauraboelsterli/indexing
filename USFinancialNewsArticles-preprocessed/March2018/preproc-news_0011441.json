It stepped in as the dinar traded at 117.75 to the euro.\nIn a statement, the bank said its intervention bolstered trading on the domestic interbank market.\n“The total turnover in euros between banks ... amounted to 73.9 million euros or more than double the average daily turnover,” it said.\nThe dinar, which has been bolstered by T-bond auctions, traded at 117.99 to euro, Reuters data showed.\n$1 = 0.8189 euros Reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic Editing by Hugh Lawson and Peter Graff\n ",
