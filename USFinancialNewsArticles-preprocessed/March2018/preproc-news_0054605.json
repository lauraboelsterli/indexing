(NYSE American:REED), owner of the nation’s leading portfolio of handcrafted, all-natural beverages, today announced financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2017 ended December 31, 2017. Reed’s also announced today that it has received a letter of intent related to the sale of the Company’s Los Angeles beverage manufacturing facility.\nFinancial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nNet Sales were $9.7 million, a 5.7% increase over the prior year, reversing sales declines in the first three quarters of 2017; core brand gross sales increased 6.0% for the quarter; Gross margin was 21.3%, a 380 basis point improvement compared to the prior year and up 410 basis points from the average in the first nine months of 2017; Operating loss of $6.1 million included a $3.9 million non-cash impairment associated with the planned sale of the beverage manufacturing facility. The fourth quarter operating loss compared to a $1.7 million operating loss in the prior year period; Net loss of $10.9 million or $0.70 per share included the $3.9 million non-cash impairment and a $3.6 million non-cash charge for extinguishment of debt, associated with a change in terms of the Company’s convertible note. The fourth quarter net loss compared to a net loss of $2.4 million or $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Modified EBITDA was a loss of $1.2 million compared to a loss of $1.0 million in the prior year.\nManagement Commentary\n“We made good progress on our transformation and value creation plan during the fourth quarter and are pleased to announce the receipt of a letter of intent related to the sale of the beverage manufacturing facility,” stated Val Stalowir CEO of Reed’s, Inc. “We completed a successful rights offering in late December, raising $12.8 million, net, that allows us to reduce leverage and financing costs and will provide the capital to support our initiatives. The process to enhance margins through improved sourcing, logistics and manufacturing alternatives is well underway, highlighted by our recent strategic partnership with Owen-Illinois as well as today’s announcement regarding the planned sale of our manufacturing facility. The transformation to an asset-light sales and marketing model with improved purchasing and logistics should favorably impact margins and our profit profile. Last year’s SKU rationalization has enhanced our focus on our core brands, simplified our sales and marketing process and should also improve margins. During the fourth quarter, we generated both higher revenue per case and lower costs of goods sold per case on our core brands as a result of pricing actions, our enhanced focus on our core brands and our new vendor partnerships.”\n“The upcoming launch of Virgil’s brand refresh and Zero Sugar line has been well received by the trade, is the next market leading innovation that will support our growth goals and enhance our leadership position in the all-natural craft soda category. We expect to launch a similar brand refresh and Zero Sugar line for the Reed’s brand later this year. We will continue to execute against our transformation plan and look forward to expected improvements to our financial performance as the year progresses.” Stalowir concluded.\nFinancial Overview for the Fourth Quarter of 2017 Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2016\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales increased $0.5 million or 5.7% to $9.7 million compared to the same period in 2016, primarily driven by a 6.0% increase in core brand gross sales.\nGross profit during the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 28.9% to $2.1 million compared to the same period in 2016. Gross margin was 21.3% of net sales during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 17.5% of net sales in the same period in 2016, and up from an average of 17.2% during the first nine months of 2017. The 410 basis point improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue compared to the first 9 months of 2017 was primarily driven by the benefits of SKU rationalization and the price increase taken during the third quarter.\nDelivery and handling costs increased 11.4% to $1.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily driven by exit costs due to warehouse rationalization. Selling and marketing costs decreased 14.3% to $0.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to a reduction in staff and lower sales support expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $6.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 from $1.2 million in the prior year period. Not including non-cash impairments, general and administrative expense increased $1.2 million to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to increased share based compensation associated with the restructuring of the Board of Directors of $0.8 million, bad debt expense of $0.2 million associated with an exit from a co-packer and other incremental expenses in support services, insurance and labor. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company also recognized a $3.9 million non-cash impairment associated with the planned sale of its beverage manufacturing facility.\nOperating loss increased to $6.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 from $1.7 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating loss primarily reflected the non-cash impairment, as well as the higher operating costs, each noted above, partially offset by an increase in gross profit.\nInterest expense and other financing costs, net, increased to $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $0.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a non-cash charge of $3.6 million for extinguishment of debt associated with a change in terms of the Company’s convertible note.\nNet loss increased to $10.9 million, or $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, from a loss of $2.4 million, or $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nModified EBITDA was a loss of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to a loss of $1.0 million in the prior year period.\nFinancial Overview for the Full Year of 2017 Compared to the Full Year of 2016\nDuring the full year 2017, net sales decreased $4.8 million or 11.2% to $37.7 million compared to the same period in 2016. Gross sales of core brands decreased at the lower rate of 3.8% for the entire year.\nGross profit during the full year 2017 decreased 23.3% compared to 2016 to $6.9 million. Gross margin was 18.3% of sales during for the full year 2017 compared to 21.1% in 2016. The decline in overall margin was primarily due to lower revenues and higher idle plant costs.\nDelivery and handling costs increased 1.0% to $3.9 million during 2017 primarily due to an increase in freight costs that were partially offset by a reduction in warehouse rental expenses. Selling and marketing costs decreased 18.4% to $3.0 million during 2017 due to a reduction in staff, lower trade show related expenses and lower sales support expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $11.7 million during 2017 from $4.4 million in the prior year. Not including non-cash impairments, general and administrative expenses increased $1.7 million to $5.8 million in 2017 largely due to higher share based compensation associated with the restructuring of the Board of Directors and higher support service costs, including costs indirectly related to the rights offering completed in December 2017. During 2017, the Company also recognized non-cash impairment costs of $5.9 million related to the planned sale of its beverage manufacturing facility and for equipment that was not being utilized for the originally intended purposes. During 2016, the Company recognized $0.3 million of impairment costs.\nOperating loss increased to $11.7 million during 2017 from $3.1 million in the prior year. The increase in operating loss primarily reflected the increase in non-cash impairment costs, as well as lower gross profit, higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower selling and marketing costs.\nInterest expense and other financing costs, net, increased to $6.6 million during 2017 from $2.0 million during the full year 2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher interest charges related to distinct financing transactions including financing costs and warrant modifications of $4.0 million, offset by a benefit from a change in fair value of warrant liability of $3.3 million, and a charge of $3.6 million for extinguishment of debt, associated with a change in terms of the Company’s convertible note.\nNet loss increased to $18.4 million, or $1.24 per share for the full year 2017, from a loss of $5.0 million, or $0.37 per share for the full year 2016.\nModified EBITDA was a loss of $4.1 million for the full year 2017 as compared to a loss of $1.3 million in the prior year period.\nLiquidity and Cash Flow\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company generated $1.3 million of cash from operations compared to $0.9 million of cash used in operations in the prior year period. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and equivalents of $12.1 million and total debt and long-term financing obligations of $15.4 million. On December 28, 2017, the Company completed an equity capital raise in the form of a rights offering, raising net proceeds of $12.8 million. The Company intends to utilize the capital to reduce payables and debt, and is evaluating alternative financing arrangements with the intention of substantially lowering borrowing costs as a result of the Company’s improved financial position and liquidity.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call Details\nThe Company will conduct a conference call at 4:30 pm eastern time today, March 28, 2018 to discuss its 2017 fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.
