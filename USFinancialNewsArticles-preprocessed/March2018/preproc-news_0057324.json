    "text": "March 30 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Friday that vehicle logs from last weekâ€™s fatal accident of a Tesla Model X in California showed that the autopilot had been engaged prior to the crash.\nTesla said that the autopilot was on with adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum.\nThe company also said no action had been taken by the driver, who had a 5-second view of the concrete divider.\n\"The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision,\" Tesla said. ( bit.ly/2GpD3V6 )\nThe fatal crash and vehicle fire of the Tesla Model X near Mountain View, California, last week involved two other cars. Tesla vehicles have a system called Autopilot that handles some driving tasks. The 38-year-old Tesla driver died at a nearby hospital shortly after the crash.
