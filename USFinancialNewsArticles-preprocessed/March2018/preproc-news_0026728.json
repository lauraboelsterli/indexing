    "text": "SUGAR LAND, Texas, March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Team, Inc. (NYSE:TISI) (“Team,” “we,” “our,” or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nConsolidated revenues of $316.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 were the highest of the year. Consolidated net loss improved to breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2017 from a net loss of $9.4 million ($0.32 loss per diluted share) in the 2016 fourth quarter. Adjusted net income of $12.9 million ($0.43 adjusted earnings per diluted share) this year compared to $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 ($0.08 adjusted earnings per diluted share). Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $23.4 million improved 11.0% compared to last year’s fourth quarter, the highest Adjusted EBITDA since the second quarter of 2016. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.4% was the highest of 2017 and the highest since the second quarter of 2016. Quest Integrity revenues increased 21% in the fourth quarter of 2017; full year 2017 revenues of $82 million were an annual record. All three business segments achieved their highest Adjusted EBITDA margin performance of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAmerino Gatti, Team’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are encouraged with our fourth quarter 2017 earnings improvement and the early outlook on 2018 activity levels. As we begin 2018, we continue to instill a strong culture of safety, management discipline and accountability while stabilizing and improving our overall business performance. Team is the premier global industrial services company, and we are transforming the organization to become more efficient and cost competitive.\n“We are focused on integrating and transforming the organization by leveraging our strengths— our people, technology, scale and blue-chip customer base. With phase one of the cost reductions complete, the second phase of business integration and transformation is under way and focuses on 3 key pillars—revenue enhancement, operations excellence and center-led functional support cost improvement. By focusing on these pillars, we will create a stronger organization to support organic growth and accomplish our goal of increasing profitability, cash flows and shareholder returns.”\nRevenues for the current quarter decreased by 1% to $316.3 million compared to revenues of $319.8 million for the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting lower revenues in our TeamQualspec and TeamFurmanite segments, largely offset by a 21% improvement in Quest Integrity revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenues of approximately $5.0 million. Team reported essentially breakeven results for the current year quarter versus a net loss of $9.4 million ($0.32 loss per diluted share) for the prior year comparable quarter.\nThe fourth quarter reported results include certain items that are not indicative of Team’s core operating activities: a loss of $5.5 million associated with the conversion feature of Team’s convertible debt, which is accounted for as a derivative liability under GAAP, $6.0 million of certain legal, professional fees and other costs, $1.9 million of non-capitalized enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system implementation costs, $1.2 million of restructuring and executive transition costs, and $1.0 million of asset write-offs and natural disaster costs.\nExcluding these items that are not indicative of core operating activities, adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $12.9 million ($0.43 adjusted earnings per diluted share) for the current quarter versus adjusted net income of $2.5 million ($0.08 adjusted earnings per diluted share) for the prior year quarter. The excluded items totaled $12.9 million (net of tax), or $0.43 per diluted share, for the current year quarter and $11.9 million (net of tax), or $0.40 per diluted share, for the prior year quarter. (See the accompanying reconciliation of non-GAAP items at the end of this news release.)\nSegment Results\nThe following table illustrates the composition of the Company’s revenue and operating income (loss) for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Increase (Decrease) 2017 2016 $ % (unaudited) (unaudited) Revenues by business segment: TeamQualspec $ 148,690 153,449 (4,759 ) (3.1 )% TeamFurmanite 144,819 147,565 (2,746 ) (1.9 )% Quest Integrity 22,825 18,811 4,014 21.3 % Total $ 316,334 $ 319,825 $ (3,491 ) (1.1 )% Operating income (loss): TeamQualspec $ 9,989 $ 10,323 (334 ) (3.2 )% TeamFurmanite 11,325 2,279 9,046 396.9 % Quest Integrity 5,085 1,917 3,168 165.3 % Corporate and shared support services (28,612 ) (20,222 ) (8,390 ) 41.5 % Total $ (2,213 ) $ (5,703 ) $ 3,490 (61.2 )% On an adjusted basis, operating income (also referred to as Adjusted EBIT) in the 2017 fourth quarter was $11.3 million and $11.5 million for TeamQualspec and TeamFurmanite, respectively compared to $10.8 million and $8.3 million, respectively, for the same period last year. Despite the lower revenues, our adjusted operating income improved in the 2017 fourth quarter, reflecting our cost savings initiative completed earlier in 2017.\nQuest Integrity’s increase in revenues was driven by higher activity levels in its inspection and assessment services. On an adjusted basis, Quest Integrity reported operating income of $5.1 million in the 2017 quarter versus operating income of $3.6 million in the 2016 quarter.\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain items that are not indicative of Team’s core operating activities. (See the accompanying reconciliation of non-GAAP items at the end of this news release.)\nSupplemental Financial Information\nInterest expense: The Company recorded $7.6 million of interest expense during the fourth quarter of 2017, which includes $1.7 million of non-cash interest expense. The non-cash interest expense is primarily attributable to the amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization of the discount on our convertible debt.\nCredit Facility: At December 31, 2017, Team had $26.6 million of cash on hand and had approximately $41 million of available borrowing capacity through the Company’s banking credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). As previously announced, we recently entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility to eliminate the total leverage ratio covenant for the remaining term (matures in July 2020) and to modify certain other financial covenants.\nLoss on convertible debt embedded derivative: The Company recorded a non-cash loss of $5.5 million related to the embedded conversion feature associated with the Company’s convertible debt during three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily a result of the increase in the Company’s stock price from during the fourth quarter. The valuation of such derivative liability is highly sensitive to changes in the price of Team’s common stock. Generally, decreases in the Company’s stock price will result in gains, while increases will result in losses.\nERP implementation: Through December 31, 2017, Team has capitalized $46.6 million associated with the ERP project, which includes $1.6 million of capitalized interest, and has recognized $2.6 million of amortization expense. In the fourth quarter, we completed our U.S. rollout of the new ERP system.\nGAAP Earnings and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain items that management believes are not indicative of Team’s core operating activities have been excluded from net income (loss) reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) when arriving at adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) (which the Company also refers to as adjusted EBIT), each a non-GAAP financial measure. In the current quarter, the most significant of such items pertained to legal, professional and other costs of $6.0 million and a loss on the Company’s convertible debt embedded derivative of $5.5 million.\nA reconciliation of these financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in the accompanying schedule.\nConference Call\nTeam, Inc. has scheduled a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, which will be broadcast live over the Internet, on Wednesday, March 14, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 9:00 a.m. Central Time.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures which are derived from the consolidated financial information including adjusted net income (loss); adjusted net income (loss) per share, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”); adjusted EBIT (defined below); and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”) to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, each as defined by the Company, exclude the following items from net income (loss): acquisition costs associated with business combinations, legal costs associated with Quest Integrity patent defense litigation, professional fees for acquired business integration and changing our fiscal year end, gains and losses on the revaluation of contingent consideration, non-capitalized ERP implementation costs, restructuring and other related charges, goodwill impairment losses, executive severance/transition costs, gains (losses) on our convertible debt embedded derivative, write-off of deferred loan costs, and certain other items that management does not believe are indicative of core operating activities and the related income tax impacts. We also exclude the income tax impacts of certain special income tax items including certain changes to valuation allowances and the effects of certain tax legislation changes. The identification of these special tax items is judgmental in nature, and their calculation is based on various assumptions and estimates. EBIT, as defined by the Company, excludes discontinued operations, income tax expense, interest charges and items of other (income) expense and therefore is equal to operating income (loss) reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBIT further excludes the following items: acquisition costs associated with business combinations, legal costs associated with Quest Integrity patent defense litigation, professional fees for acquired business integration and changing our fiscal year end, gains and losses on the revaluation of contingent consideration, non-capitalized ERP implementation costs, restructuring and other related charges, goodwill impairment losses, executive severance/transition costs, and certain other items that management does not believe are indicative of core operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes from adjusted EBIT depreciation, amortization and non-cash share based compensation costs.\nManagement believes that excluding certain items from GAAP results allows management to better understand the consolidated financial performance from period to period and to better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Moreover, the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures will provide its stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate operating performance. However, there are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies who may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than Team does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented below. You are encouraged to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented.\nTEAM, INC.

The identification of these special tax items is judgmental in nature, and their calculation is based on various assumptions and estimates.
