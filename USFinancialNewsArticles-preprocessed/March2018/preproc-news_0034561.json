    "text": "Former \"Sex and the City\" star Cynthia Nixon says she'll challenge Gov. Andrew Cuomo in New York 's Democratic primary in September.\nHer announcement Monday sets up a race pitting an openly gay liberal activist against a two-term incumbent with a $30 million war chest and possible presidential ambitions.\nIn a video on Twitter, the public education advocate says, \"We want our government to work again.\"\nNixon in recent speeches has called on Democrats nationally to carve out a strong liberal identity instead of being merely the \"anti-Trump party.\"\nNixon is a 51-year-old Manhattan mother of three and an ally of Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , who frequently clashes with Cuomo on various issues.\nThe 60-year-old Cuomo was favored 66 percent to 19 percent over Nixon in a recent Siena College poll.",
