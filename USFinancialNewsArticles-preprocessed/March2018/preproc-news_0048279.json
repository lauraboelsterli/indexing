    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 1:42 PM / Updated an hour ago Automakers keep wary eye on tariff impact, possible trade war Nick Carey , David Shepardson 3 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Executives from major automakers raised concerns at the New York auto show this week about the possibility of a trade war after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports earlier this month, especially at a time when U.S. sales of new vehicles are in decline. Hinrich J. Woebcken, president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, speaks near a 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 9, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \n“Protectionism doesn’t have winners,” Hinrich Woebcken, Volkswagen AG’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) North American chief executive, told Reuters. “When you start to raise bars, you are bringing an imbalance of trade that will not produce any winners.” \nU.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel imports earlier this month that industry experts and manufacturers say could lower profits for companies making everything from pickup trucks to canned soup, or result in higher prices for consumers. \nTrump has criticized Germany for levying tariffs on vehicles shipped from the United States, and threatened to impose higher tariffs on German-made vehicles. That has made executives nervous in an industry that is global. The Trump administration has also proposed tariffs on Chinese goods.
