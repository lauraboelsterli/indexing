    "text": "Published: Mar 27, 2018 3:42 a.m. ET Share Reuters Stormy Daniels, an adult-film star and director whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is interviewed by Anderson Cooper for CBS News's “60 Minutes” in early March. The interview aired Sunday. \nBy Joe Flint \nCBS’s “60 Minutes” drew more than 21 million viewers Sunday night for an interview with former adult-film star Stephanie Clifford about her alleged sexual encounter with President Donald Trump, marking the news magazine’s biggest audience in 10 years. \nAccording to preliminary figures from ratings firm Nielsen, 21.3 million people watched Anderson Cooper’s interview with Clifford, who goes by the professional name Stormy Daniels. The telecast benefited from a strong lead-in provided by an NCAA men’s tournament basketball game that went into overtime and drew 24.5 million viewers. \nThe interview marked the first time Clifford, 39 years old, has spoken publicly about the alleged encounter with Trump since the Wall Street Journal reported in January news of a nondisclosure agreement she reached with Michael Cohen, a personal lawyer of Trump’s, before the 2016 presidential election. \nIn the CBS CBS, +0.85% interview, Clifford said she had a consensual sexual relationship with Trump in 2006 . She said she accepted a $130,000 payment from Trump’s attorney to keep silent about the matter because she feared for her family’s safety. She said she was threatened by a man in 2011 after a failed attempt to sell her story to a magazine.",
