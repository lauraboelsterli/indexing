    "text": "11 COMMENTS The challenges of the American student debt crisis are widespread here in the Bronx.\nNineteen percent of people default on their student loans, similar to the national rate of 22%.\nBut students here at Bronx Community College are in a program that helps them graduate with a two-year associate’s degree and no debt.\nThe ASAP program started in New York City 10 years ago to tackle the problem of kids taking student loans without knowing the financial impact. Now it’s gaining attention nationwide, and being adapted for schools in California and Ohio.\nRead about the WSJ Financial Inclusion Challenge and see more related videos Eligible students’ tuition is paid for by federal Pell Grants students don’t have to pay back. Plus, they get money for books and a monthly MetroCard. But only if they meet regularly with their personal advisor.\n“They may owe $3,000, $5,000, 10,000... What we found is that the biggest financial burden for these students is not tuition, it’s really non-tuition costs, so the cost of transportation, of books,” says Thomas J. Hilliard, a senior researcher at the Center for an Urban Future, nonpartisan policy think tank.\nIn the video above, we take a closer look at the program, which aims to lift students who are most likely to default up the economic ladder.",
