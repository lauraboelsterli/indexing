    "text": "TORONTO, March 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeedMD Inc. (TSX-V:WMD) (OTC:WDDMF) (FSE:4WE) (“ WeedMD ” or the “ Company ”), a federally-licensed producer and distributor of medical cannabis, is pleased to announce that the Company has appointed Dr. Jonas Vanderzwan as Medical Director and Chair of its Clinical Advisory Board. The Clinical Advisory Board will oversee all areas related to WeedMD’s medical research and development initiatives.\n“We are honoured to have Dr. Vanderzwan join WeedMD. This is a strategic and important appointment for our patient base who are seeking standardized treatment options and more precise strain selection and dosing from their medical practitioner,” said Bruce Dawson-Scully, CEO, WeedMD. “An obstacle for many cannabis patients is the limited information coming from the medical community about cannabis use for specific ailments. Dr. Vanderzwan brings a wealth of experience, knowledge and the willingness to support patients and medical practitioners. He will also be participating in studies alongside leading institutions and their researchers from around the world.”\nDr. Vanderzwan is a physician with more than 15 years of primary care experience, and recently served as the lead physician of a London, Ontario based medical cannabis patient assessment clinic. Recognized in Southwestern Ontario as a cannabis educator and specialist, he has been actively providing medical staff with guidance on cannabis prescribing protocols, cannabis pharmacology, physiological effects and assessment tools. Dr. Vanderzwan is assisting with the establishment of an interest group at the Ontario Medical Association (OMA) with the purpose of continued advocacy and promotion of cannabis. He is also a member of the International Cannabinoid Research Society (ICRS), Canadian Consortium for the Investigation of Cannabinoids (CCIC), and International Association for Cannabinoid Medicines (IACM).\n“As an enthusiastic proponent of prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative treatment option for patients, I’m pleased to be joining WeedMD – a licensed producer that takes great pride in its commitment to providing patients with responsible and innovative products and therapies – as well as encouraging sound practices in the seniors’ community,” said Dr. Vanderzwan. “While it is important that all the players in the cannabis industry take an active role in public education, it is also integral that we promote funding initiatives that aim to further establish cannabis as a legitimate medicine and WeedMD is actively pursuing such initiatives.”\nWeedMD is committed to establishing credibility for cannabis in the medical community, and is in the process of securing a Health Canada Dealer’s License [read here] . A Dealer’s License will allow the Company to conduct R&D activities, store cannabis derivatives, process natural health products and export cannabis oils and concentrates to international markets.\nAbout WeedMD Inc.\nWeedMD Inc. is the publicly-traded parent company of WeedMD Rx Inc., a federally-licensed producer and distributor of medical cannabis and cannabis oil under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”). The Company operates a 26,000 sq. ft. indoor facility in Aylmer, Ontario, and is awaiting its second-site cultivation license for its greenhouse facility located in Strathroy, Ontario, representing 610,000 sq. ft. or 14 acres under glass. WeedMD has entered into supply agreements in addition to strategic relationships with established cannabis brands.\nThe Company is focused on providing medical cannabis to the seniors’ market in Canada through its specialized and comprehensive platform.
