In a year of change, we want to reiterate our commitment to championing agriculture and the rural communities we call home,” added Hebrink.\n“Our board of directors is happy to share the profitability and equity Compeer Financial grew in 2017, even as agriculture experienced tightened margins and we united three organizations,” said Mark Cade, Compeer Financial Board Chair. “Together we navigate both the good and challenging times.
