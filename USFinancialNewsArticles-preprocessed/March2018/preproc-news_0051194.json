    "text": "ATHENS, March 30 (Reuters) - Greek retail sales by volume rose 1.5 percent in January compared to the same month a year ago after a downwardly revised 1.7 percent increase in December, statistics service ELSTAT said on Friday. Retail sales were led higher by furniture, appliances, books, apparel and footwear, the data showed. Greece's economy grew for a fourth straight quarter in October-December, driven by stronger investment spending, but the pace was slower than in the previous quarter. Gross domestic product rose 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, the expansion decelerating from an upwardly revised 0.4 percent in July-September. The government expects the economy to grow by 2.5 percent this year.
