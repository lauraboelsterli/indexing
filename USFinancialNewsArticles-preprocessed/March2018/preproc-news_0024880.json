    "text": "SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Abraxas Petroleum Corporation (NASDAQ:AXAS) today reported financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial and Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nThe three months ended December 31, 2017 resulted in:\nProduction of 808 MBoe (8,788 Boepd) Revenue of $29.6 million Net loss of $4.1 million, or $0.02 per share Adjusted net income (a) (excluding certain non-cash items) of $7.1 million, or $0.04 per share EBITDA (a) of $17.6 million Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants of $17.8 million (a)\n(a) See reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures below.\nFinancial and Operating Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nThe twelve months ended December 31, 2017 resulted in:\nProduction of 2.7 MMBoe (7,391 Boepd) Revenue of $86.3 million Net income of $16.0 million, or $0.10 per share Adjusted net income (a) (excluding certain non-cash items) of $20.3 million, or $0.13 per share EBITDA (a) of $53.1 million Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants of $58.0 million (a)\n(a) See reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures below.\nOperational Update\nDelaware Basin\nIn Ward County, Texas, Abraxas recently drilled and cased three wells and is drilling the fourth well on the Company’s 660’ downspacing test at Caprito. The four-well downspacing test consists of two Wolfcamp A2 wells, the Caprito 99-301H and Caprito 99-311H, and two Wolfcamp A1 wells, the Caprito 99-202H and Caprito 99-211H. With success, Abraxas' assumed well spacing will move from 1320’ spacing to the apparent industry norm 660’ spacing in the Wolfcamp A1 and A2. These wells are scheduled for an April completion date. Abraxas owns a 57.8% working interest in the Caprito 99-301H, Caprito 99-311H, Caprito 99-202H and Caprito 99-211H.\nAbraxas' next pad will be the Greasewood 201H and 301H. These locations are four sections north of our Caprito acreage and will test the Wolfcamp A1 and A2. Abraxas owns a 100% working interest in these wells.\nOn February 28, 2018, Abraxas closed on the acquisition of 944 net acres in Winkler County for $14.3 million. Abraxas' combined net Bone Spring/Wolfcamp acreage position now consists of 9,211 net acres.\nWilliston Basin\nAt Abraxas' North Fork prospect, in McKenzie County, North Dakota, the Company recently drilled and cased the Yellowstone 5H-7H wells in which the Company owns a 52% working interest. These wells are scheduled for a June completion date. Abraxas also recently drilled and cased the Lillibridge 9H-12H wells in which the Company owns a 25-29% working interest. These wells are scheduled for a July completion date. Abraxas' next pad will be the Ravin 9H-12H in which we estimate we will own a 50% working interest.\nComments\nBob Watson, President and CEO of Abraxas, commented, “2017 was a year of tremendous accomplishments for Abraxas. In early 2017, Abraxas commenced and executed a successful equity offering with four distinct goals: de-risk four zones on our Ward County assets, add Bone Spring/Wolfcamp acres in the Delaware Basin at a reasonable cost, grow our production base to critical mass and maintain our balance sheet. We are happy to report that we successfully de-risked the Wolfcamp A1, Wolfcamp A2, Wolfcamp B and Third Bone Spring on our acreage position in Ward County. Since January 2017, we added approximately 4,000 net Bone Spring/Wolfcamp acres to our Delaware Basin position. We reached critical mass with our production base as evidenced by our 11,480 Boepd production average during the month of January 2018. Finally, we ended the year with a solid balance sheet that will enable us to continue our two rig program and remain acquisitive in the Delaware Basin.\n“Our goals for 2018 remain largely unchanged. We will look to continue to expand our acreage position in the Delaware Basin at a reasonable cost while protecting our balance sheet, streamline our portfolio by continuing to divest non-core assets, further delineate our acreage position by drilling outside of Caprito and test downspacing to the industry norm 660 feet between wells in the same zone. Ultimately, success on these fronts will position Abraxas for an optimal multi-year, high return and focused development program in the Delaware Basin. We look forward to updating the street on the results of these efforts in the near future.\"\nConference Call\nAbraxas Petroleum Corporation (NASDAQ:AXAS) will host its fourth quarter and year end 2017 earnings conference call at 11 AM ET on March 14, 2018.

EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, deferred income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, impairments, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, and stock-based compensation. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity. EBITDA excludes some, but not all items that affect net income and may vary among companies. The EBITDA presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe have also disclosed Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants. Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules. Our management believes that information regarding Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants is material to an understanding of our financial condition and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods presented.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (In thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income $ (4,109 ) $ (5,301 ) $ 16,006 $ (96,378 ) Net interest expense 1,072 969 2,947 4,318 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 8,560 6,500 26,226 24,431 Amortization of deferred financing fees 69 256 423 1,019 Impairment — — — 67,626 Stock-based compensation 739 784 3,238 3,194 Unrealized loss on derivative contracts 11,258 6,285 4,299 19,818 EBITDA $ 17,589 $ 9,493 $ 53,139 $ 24,028 EBITDA $ 17,589 $ 9,493 $ 53,139 $ 24,028 Realized loss on derivative monetization — — — 349 Monetized derivative contracts — — — 14,370 Expenses related to equity offering/loan amendments/permitted acquisitions 164 29 4,856 1,776 Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants $ 17,753 $ 9,522 $ 57,995 $ 40,523 This release also includes a discussion of “adjusted net income (loss), excluding certain non-cash items,” which is also a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss), excluding ceiling test impairment and unrealized changes in derivative contracts. Management believes that net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP is the most directly comparable measure to adjusted net income (loss), excluding certain non-cash items. The calculation of adjusted net income (loss), excluding certain non-cash items presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nUnrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts are based on mark-to-market valuations which are non-cash in nature and may fluctuate drastically from period to period. As commodity prices fluctuate, these derivative contracts are valued against current market prices at the end of each reporting period in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815: Derivatives and Hedging as amended and interpreted, which requires Abraxas to record an unrealized gain or loss based on the calculated value difference from the previous period-end valuation. For example, NYMEX oil prices on December 31, 2016 were $53.72 per barrel compared to $60.42 on December 29, 2017; therefore, the mark-to-market valuation changed considerably from period to period.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (In thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income $ (4,109 ) $ (5,301 ) $ 16,006 $ (96,378 ) Impairment — — — 67,626 Unrealized loss on derivative contracts 11,258 6,285 4,299 19,818 Realized loss on derivative monetization — — — 349 Adjusted net income (loss), excluding certain non-cash items $ 7,149 $ 984 $ 20,305 $ (8,585 ) Net (loss) income per share – basic $ (0.02 ) $ (0.04 ) $ 0.10 $ (0.79 ) Net (loss) income per share – diluted $ (0.02 ) $ (0.04 ) $ 0.10 $ (0.79 ) Adjusted net income (loss), excluding certain non-cash items, per share – basic $ 0.04 $ 0.01 $ 0.13 $ (0.07 ) Adjusted net income (loss), excluding certain non-cash items, per share – diluted $ 0.04 $ 0.01 $ 0.12 $ (0.07 ) Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.\n(In thousands) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Borrowing base $ 135,000 $ 115,000 Cash and cash equivalents 1,618 — Revolving credit facility - outstanding borrowings (84,000 ) (93,000 ) Outstanding letters of credit (250 ) (250 ) Liquidity $ 52,368 $ 21,750\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180313006433/en/\nAbraxas Petroleum Corporation\nGeoffrey King, 210-490-4788\nVice President – Chief Financial Officer\ngking@abraxaspetroleum.com\nwww.abraxaspetroleum.com\nSource: Abraxas Petroleum Corporation",
