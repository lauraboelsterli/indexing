Our utility products and related service continued to expand its profitability and generate cash flow. Revenues from our Live.me and mobile game business continued to grow, thanks to our efforts in product innovation, creative operations, and content enrichment. Cheetah Mobile is a user- and product-focused company, so it is encouraging that our products continue to achieve notable progress. In this quarter, Live.me remained the No.1 grossing social app in the U.S. on Google Play and one of the top 6 in the Apple App Store. CM Launcher and Cheetah Keyboard were among the top 10 personalized apps in the U.S. on Google Play. Recently, we became one of the top 10 game publishers in the U.S. on both Google Play and the Apple App Store. Going forward, we will continue to use artificial intelligence (\"AI\") to enhance our products and services. We also believe that technologies such as blockchain will create opportunities for us to expand our product offerings.\"\nMr. Vincent Jiang, Cheetah Mobile's Chief Financial Officer, commented, \"Driven by considerable growth in our mobile utility products and related services businesses in China and the overall growth of Live.me and mobile games, our total revenues exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our operating profits continued to improve and achieved all-time highs in the quarter, driven by robust revenue growth and continued optimization of the cost and expense structure for utility products and related services. In the fourth quarter, we closed two significant disposals, News Republic and our interests in Musical.ly, which generated a gain of RMB1,089.0 million (US$167.4 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 and greatly boosted our balance sheet. In addition, our core business continues to generate strong cash flow, which allows us to reallocate our resources to execute expansion plans in order to drive our long-term growth.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Consolidated Financial Results\nREVENUES\nTotal revenues increased by 8.9% year over year and 16.2% quarter over quarter to RMB1,387.8 million (US$213.3 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRevenues from utility products and related services decreased by 4.2% year over year but increased by 17.3% quarter over quarter to RMB967.2 million (US$148.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to (i) a decline in revenues from mobile utility products and related services business in the overseas markets as certain ad formats, i.e., ads on mobile phone lock screens, have been discontinued by one of our overseas third-party advertising partners, and (ii) a decline in PC revenues. This decrease was largely offset by an increase in our mobile utility products and related services business in China. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to the strong growth of our mobile utility products and related services business in China and seasonality in advertising spending in both China and the overseas markets. Revenues from the mobile entertainment business increased by 50.5% year over year and 10.2% quarter over quarter to RMB399.5 million (US$61.4 million). The year-over-year increase was primarily a result of the rapid growth in Live.me's broadcasting revenues and the Company's continued efforts to expand the mobile game portfolio by introducing several new mobile games in early 2017. The quarter-over-quarter growth was mainly attributable to Live.me's increased revenues in the overseas market and mobile game revenues in China, where the Company's mobile games continue to gain popularity.\nBy platform , revenues generated from the mobile business increased by 17.8% year over year and 15.9% quarter over quarter to RMB1,217.5 million (US$187.1 million), or 87.7% of our total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nBy region , revenues generated from the overseas markets increased by 1.4% year over year and 5.4% quarter over quarter to RMB843.8 million (US$129.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenues generated from the Chinese market increased by 23.0% year over year and 38.0% quarter over quarter to RMB544.0 million (US$83.6 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The growth of our revenues in the Chinese market was attributable to a ramp-up of mobile utility products and related services businesses in China and increased mobile game revenues in the Chinese market, where the Company's mobile games continue to gain popularity. Revenues generated from the overseas markets constitutes 60.8% of our total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCOST OF REVENUES AND GROSS PROFIT\nCost of revenues decreased by 0.6% year over year but increased by 15.4% quarter over quarter to RMB461.4 million (US$70.9 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter increase was a result of one-time higher channel costs associated with our mobile game business in China, and higher revenue sharing fees with online broadcasters associated with the Live.me business. Non-GAAP cost of revenues decreased by 0.2% year over year but increased by 15.7% quarter over quarter to RMB462.4 million (US$71.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGross profit increased by 14.3% year over year and 16.5% quarter over quarter to RMB926.4 million (US$142.4 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP gross profit increased by 14.1% year over year and 16.4% quarter over quarter to RMB925.4 million (US$142.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES\nTotal operating expenses decreased by 5.9% year over year but increased by 6.3% quarter over quarter to RMB704.4 million (US$108.3 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Total non-GAAP operating expenses increased by 0.7% year over year and 9.2% quarter over quarter to RMB700.1 million (US$107.6 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development (R&D) expense decreased by 35.5% year over year and 13.0% quarter over quarter to RMB151.9 million (US$23.3 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decreases were due to lower share-based compensation expenses and reduced R&D headcount resulting from the disposal of News Republic and the Company's strategy to optimize the cost and expense structure for its utility products and related services business. Non-GAAP R&D expenses , which exclude share-based compensation expenses, decreased by 30.7% year over year and 14.2% quarter over quarter to RMB147.4 million (US$22.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 2.9% year over year and 2.7% quarter over quarter to RMB420.1 million (US$64.6 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increases were mainly due to increased promotional activities for the Company's mobile utility products in China and Cheez, a short video application operated by Live.me in the overseas markets. Non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses , which exclude share-based compensation expenses, increased by 3.7% year over year and 3.0% quarter over quarter to RMB423.1 million (US$65.0 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. General and administrative expenses decreased by 9.3% year over year but increased by 29.7% quarter over quarter to RMB115.1 million (US$17.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher professional service fees and employee benefits, which was offset by lower share-based compensation expenses. The quarter-over-quarter increase primarily resulted from increased professional service fees and employee benefits. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses , which exclude share-based compensation expenses, increased by 16.6% year over year and 63.9% quarter over quarter to RMB112.2 million (US$17.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets were RMB38.7 million (US$5.9 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to a one-time non-cash write-down of intangible assets, which the Company considered other-than-temporary. Their carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition.\nOperating profit increased to RMB222.0 million (US$34.1 million) from RMB62.2 million in the same period last year and RMB132.3 million in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit increased by 93.7% year over year and 46.6% quarter over quarter to RMB225.4 million (US$34.6 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Company has reported its operating profit along the following segments since the second quarter of 2017:\nOperating profit for utility products and related services increased by 3.0% year over year and 25.5% quarter over quarter to RMB327.0 million (US$50.3 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 mainly due to the optimization of the cost and expense structure and the increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating loss for the mobile entertainment business was RMB61.8 million (US$9.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to operating losses of RMB201.1 million in the same period last year and RMB105.0 million in the third quarter of 2017. The reduced loss was mainly a result of increased revenues generated from the Company's Live.me and mobile game businesses and reduced costs and expenses from the News Republic business, partially offset by the Company's increased investments in Live.me and Cheez, the short video business operated by Live.me in overseas markets.\nShare-based compensation expenses decreased by 93.8% year over year and 84.2% quarter over quarter to RMB3.4 million (US$0.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease resulted from a combination of several factors. The Company employed an accelerated method to recognize share-based compensation expenses. A significant number of share-based awards that were granted by the Company during its IPO in 2014 approached the end of their vesting periods in 2017. Furthermore, fewer share-based awards were granted in 2017 than in previous years and more unvested awarded shares were forfeited in 2017.\nIMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS\nImpairment of investments were RMB209.6 million (US$32.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to a one-time non-cash write-down of some investment assets, which the Company considered other-than-temporary, to its fair value. This write-down was the result of lower-than-expected performance and financial position of the investment assets.\nOTHER INCOME, NET\nOther income, net, was RMB1,089.0 million (US$167.4 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, mainly resulting from the disposals of the Company's interests in Musical.ly and the Company's News Republic business.\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHEETAH MOBILE SHAREHOLDERS\nNet income attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders increased to RMB1,047.1 million (US$160.9 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB58.8 million in the same period last year and RMB139.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders increased to RMB1,050.5 million (US$161.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB113.0 million in the same period last year and RMB161.1 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nNET INCOME PER ADS\nDiluted income per ADS increased to RMB7.27 (US$1.12) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB0.41 in the same period last year and RMB0.95 in the third quarter of 2017.

The decrease was primarily due to a decline in PC revenues as internet traffic in China continued to migrate from PC to mobile devices. Revenues from the mobile entertainment business increased by 115.9% year over year to RMB1,496.4 million (US$230.0 million). The increase was primarily due to the rapid growth in Live.me's revenues and the Company's enriched mobile game portfolio as a result of the introduction of several new mobile games in early 2017.\nBy platform , revenues generated from the mobile business increased by 22.2% year over year to RMB4,315.0 million (US$663.2 million), or 86.7% of our total revenues in 2017.

Non-GAAP research and development expenses , which exclude share-based compensation expenses, decreased by 12.3% year over year to RMB664.2 million (US$102.1 million). Selling and marketing expenses remained relatively flat year over year at RMB1,656.5 million (US$254.6 million) in 2017, which was primarily due to increased product promotional activities for the Live.me business. This was partially offset by reduced spending on product promotional activities for utility applications in the overseas markets. Non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses , which exclude share-based compensation expenses, remained relatively flat year over year at RMB1,656.5 million (US$254.6 million). General and administrative expenses decreased by 27.5% year over year to RMB407.4 million (US$62.6 million) in 2017, which was a result of lower share-based compensation expenses and a decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts.

Operating loss for the mobile entertainment business was RMB417.4 million (US$64.1 million) in 2017, compared to operating loss of RMB532.0 million in 2016. The reduced loss was mainly a result of the year-over-year increases in revenues generated from the Company's Live.me and mobile game businesses and reduced costs and expenses from News Republic business, partially offset by the Company's increased investments in Live.me and Cheez, the short video business operated by Live.me in the overseas markets.\nShare-based compensation expenses decreased by 76.1% year over year to RMB73.3 million (US$11.3 million) in 2017.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS is non-GAAP net income attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders excluding net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests, divided by weighted average number of diluted ADSs. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, other non-operating income and share-based compensation expenses. Free cash flow is net cash generated by operating activities less capital expenditure.\nThe Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of share-based compensation expenses and the use of Adjusted EBITDA add clarity to the constituent parts of its performance from the cash perspective. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses the non-GAAP financial measures for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the effect of share-based compensation expenses, which have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in its business. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company's net income for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Cheetah Mobile Inc. Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" and \"Cheetah Mobile Inc. Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Cheetah Mobile Shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\" at the end of this release.\nInvestor Relations Contact\nCheetah Mobile Inc.\nHelen Jing
