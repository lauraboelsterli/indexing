    "text": "March 22, 2018 / 3:49 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Trump to hold off steel tariffs for EU, six others: Lighthizer Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will not apply new steel and aluminium tariffs to the European Union and other trading partners which are currently negotiating exemptions, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Thursday. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer testifies before a Senate Finance Committee hearing on \"President Trump's 2018 Trade Policy Agenda\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque “The idea that the president has is that, based on a certain set of criteria, that some countries should get out,” he told a Senate committee hearing. “There are countries with whom we’re negotiating and the question becomes the obvious one that you think, as a matter of business, how does this work. So what he has decided to do is to pause the imposition of the tariffs with respect to those countries.” He then listed these as Canada and Mexico, “Europe ... Australia ... Argentina ... Brazil and ... (South) Korea”. Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop in Brussels; Editing by Alastair Macdonald",
