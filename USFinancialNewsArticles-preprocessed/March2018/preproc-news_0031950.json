    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- A10 Networks (NYSE: ATEN) today announced that it will delay the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, beyond the filing’s due date.\nAs previously disclosed, the company’s Audit Committee, with the assistance of outside counsel, is conducting an investigation regarding certain revenue recognition and internal control matters. The investigation is focused on the time period of the fourth quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2017 inclusive. The Audit Committee has not reached any conclusions because the investigation is ongoing. Consequently, the company is not in a position to file the Form 10-K until after the completion of the Audit Committee’s investigation. While the company continues to work expeditiously to conclude this review and to file the Form 10-K as soon as practical, it does not anticipate filing its Form 10-K within the 15-day extension period provided under Rule 12b-25(b).\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
