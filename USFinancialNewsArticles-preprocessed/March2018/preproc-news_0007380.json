    "text": "March 4, 2018 / 10:41 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Oil Search to take 8 weeks to restore production at Papua New Guinea LNG project Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Adds background on quake, Santos statement) March 5 (Reuters) - Australiaâ€™s Oil Search Ltd said ExxonMobil PNG, operator of its Papua New Guinea LNG Project, would take about eight weeks to restore production at the project, following damage caused by the earthquake that struck the region on Feb. 26. Oil Search will provide a revised production forecast and the likely impact on its 2018 earnings and capital outlook once it has more clarity on the progress of repair works, the company said in a statement on Monday. The magnitude 7.5 quake struck a week ago, triggering landslides, flattening buildings, killing at least 31 people and prompting ExxonMobil and Oil Search to suspend LNG exports. The Agogo Production Facility and the Moran field were the most impacted by the earthquake, and major repairs will be required before production can restart, the company added. The timeframe to restart production through Agogo is still being reviewed. (Reporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis)",
