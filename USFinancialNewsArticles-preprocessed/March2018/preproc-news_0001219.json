    "text": "NEW YORK, March 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Royce Micro-Cap Trust, Inc. (NYSE-RMT) has declared a quarterly distribution of $0.18 per share on its Common Stock. The distribution, optionally payable in additional shares of Common Stock, or in cash by specific stockholder election, is to be paid on March 23, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 2018 (ex-dividend on March 9, 2018). The price of shares issued for reinvestment will be determined on March 19, 2018.\nThe Fund has adopted a Distribution Policy of paying quarterly distributions on its Common Stock. Distributions are being made at the annual rate of 7% of the rolling average of the prior four calendar quarter-end net asset values (NAVs), with the fourth quarter distribution being the greater of 1.75% of the rolling average or the minimum distribution required by IRS regulations. The policy, including the annual rate, is subject to change at the discretion of the Fund's Board of Directors.\nThe Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'.\nThe Fund's estimated sources of the distribution to be paid on March 23, 2018 and for 2018 year-to-date are as follows:\nEstimated Allocations as of February 28, 2018\nFund\nDistribution\nPer Share\nNet Investment Income\nNet Realized\nShort-Term\nGains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term\nGains\nReturn of Capital\nRMT\n$0.18\n$0.0193 (11%)\n$0.0544 (30%)\n$0.0689 (38%)\n$0.0374 (21%)\nEstimated Allocations for 2018 through February 28, 2018\nFund\nDistribution\nPer Share\nNet Investment Income\nNet Realized\nShort-Term\nGains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term\nGains\nReturn of Capital\nRMT\n$0.18\n$0.0193 (11%)\n$0.0544 (30%)\n$0.0689 (38%)\n$0.0374 (21%)\nYou should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the current distribution or from the terms of the Fund's Distribution Policy. The amounts and sources of distributions reported herein are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nFund Performance and Distribution Rate Information:\nFund\nAverage Annual Total Return (in relation to NAV for the 5-year period ending on 2/28/2018) 1\nAnnualized Current Distribution Rate (expressed as a percentage of NAV as of 2/28/2018) 2\nCumulative total return (in relation to NAV for the fiscal year through 2/28/2018) 3\nCumulative fiscal year distributions (as a percentage of NAV as of 2/28/2018) 4\nRMT\n11.84%\n6.99%\n-1.72%\n1.75%\n1 Average Annual Total Return in relation to NAV represents the compound average of the Annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the five year period ended February 28, 2018.
