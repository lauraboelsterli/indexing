    "text": "0 COMMENTS BEIJING— Foxconn Technology Group posted a better-than-expected 4% rise in fourth-quarter profit, bouncing back after major customer Apple Inc. AAPL 0.78% overcame production troubles for the iPhone X.\nTaiwan-based Foxconn, which assembles Apple’s iPhones in China, said Friday its profit for 2017’s final period climbed to 71.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($2.5 billion), from 68.8 billion New Taiwan dollars a year earlier. \nAnalysts polled by S&P Capital IQ were expecting on average a fourth-quarter profit of 64.4 billion New Taiwan dollars.\nRevenue rose 23% to 1.7 trillion New Taiwan dollars, after flat results for the preceding quarter.\nFoxconn, known formally as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. 2317 1.56% , is the world’s largest contract electronics maker. In the third quarter, its profit fell 39% from a year earlier, likely reflecting production troubles for the iPhone X that delayed initial sales of the device until November. Foxconn doesn’t hold earnings conference calls and hasn’t commented iPhone X production.\nApple, which is Foxconn’s largest customer, booked record revenue for its latest quarter, and said in February that the iPhone X, with a starting price of $1,000, boosted the average selling price for its iPhones by nearly 15%.\nFor all of 2017, Foxconn posted a profit of 138.7 New Taiwan dollars, down 7% from the prior year, and revenue of 4.7 trillion New Taiwan dollars, up 8%.\nFoxconn Chairman Terry Gou has been working to expand the company’s business beyond contract manufacturing and into consumer brands of its own. A Foxconn unit recently agreed to buy smartphone and electronics accessories maker Belkin International Inc. for $866 million.\nAnother subsidiary, Foxconn Industrial Internet Co., which makes smartphones and wireless-equipment components, recently won regulatory approval in China for an initial public offering to raise at least 27.3 billion yuan (US$4.3 billion) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\nThe unit said it plans to use the funds to invest in cloud computing, 5G technology and smart manufacturing.\nWrite to Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com",
