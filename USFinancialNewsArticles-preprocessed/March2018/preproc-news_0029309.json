    "text": "NEW YORK, March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Gener8 Maritime, Inc. (NYSE: GNRT) (\"Gener8 Maritime\" or the \"Company\"), a leading U.S.-based provider of international seaborne crude oil transportation services, today announced its financial results for the three months and twelve months\nHighlights\nRecorded net loss of $45.4 million, or $0.55 basic and diluted loss per share, for the three months , compared to a net income of $5.8 million, or $0.07 basic and diluted income per share for the same period in the prior year. Recorded adjusted net loss of $18.6 million, or $0.22 basic and diluted adjusted loss per share, for the three months , compared to adjusted net income of $20.1 million or $0.24 basic and diluted adjusted income per share for the same period in the prior year. Increased full fleet \"ECO\" operating days to 65.1% in the three months , compared to 43.4% in the same period in the prior year. Sold a 2003-built Aframax (Gener8 Pericles), a 2000-built Suezmax (Gener8 Argus), a 2002-built VLCC (Gener8 Poseidon), and a 2010-built VLCC (Gener8 Zeus) for net cash proceeds of $33.2 million after debt repayment of $63.8 million and release of working capital from the Navig8 pools. Entered into an Agreement and Plan or Merger with Euronav NV and Euronav MI Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Euronav NV.\nMerger Agreement\nOn December 20, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Euronav NV and Euronav MI Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Euronav NV (\"Merger Sub\"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing its corporate existence as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Euronav NV (which transactions we refer to as the \"Merger\").\nAt the effective time of the Merger, each common share, par value $0.01 per share, of Gener8 (the \"Gener8 common shares\"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to such time (other than certain Gener8 common shares that will be canceled as set forth in the Merger Agreement), will be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive 0.7272 of an ordinary share, no par value per share, of Euronav in the manner described in the Merger Agreement.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, the approval of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of the outstanding Gener8 common shares. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Merger. Each party's obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to certain qualifications and exceptions) and the performance in all material respects of the other party's covenants under the Merger Agreement.\nIn connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Euronav and certain significant holders (the \"Covered Shareholders\") of Gener8 common shares have entered into a Shareholder Support and Voting Agreement (the \"Voting Agreement\"). The Voting Agreement requires the Covered Shareholders, representing approximately 42% of the issued and outstanding shares of Gener8 to (i) appear (in person or by proxy) at any meeting of the shareholders convened for the purpose of approving the Merger and the Merger Agreement (the \"Special Meeting\") and (ii) so long as neither the transaction advisory committee of the Gener8 board of directors (the \"Gener8 Transaction Committee\") nor the Gener8 board of directors has made an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the Merger Agreement), vote the Covered Shares in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and against any action that would reasonably be expected to impede the Merger or result in a breach of the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreement. If either the Gener8 Transaction Committee or the Gener8 board of directors does make an Adverse Recommendation Change, then the Covered Shareholders are each required to vote 50% of their respective Covered Shares in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and may vote their remaining Covered Shares in any manner they determine.\nIn addition, at the request (and expense) of Euronav, certain Gener8 shareholders (the \"Proxy Shareholders\") have agreed to grant an irrevocable proxy (the \"Proxies\") to a representative of an affiliate of such Proxy Shareholders whereby, subject to the terms and conditions in the Proxies, such representative has the authority to direct the vote of Gener8 common shares owned by the Proxy Shareholders, representing in the aggregate approximately 6% of the issued and outstanding shares of Gener8, at the Special Meeting. In addition, the Proxy Shareholders have agreed, among other things, not to transfer or dispose any of their Gener8 common shares during the term of the Proxies unless the transferee agrees to be bound thereby.\nFor more information about the Merger, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on December 22, 2017.\nFleet Performance\nThe average TCE rates earned by Gener8 Maritime's vessels are detailed below:\nGener8 Maritime Average Daily TCE Rates (1)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDec-17\nDec-16\nDec-17\nDec-16\nVLCC\nAverage Spot TCE Rate\n$23,752\n$36,282\n$28,329\n$40,130\nAverage Time Charter TC Rate\n-\n-\n-\n$42,542\nSUEZMAX\nAverage Spot TCE Rate\n$16,070\n$21,095\n$17,365\n$26,839\nAverage Time Charter TC Rate\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAFRAMAX\nAverage Spot TCE Rate\n-$19,516\n$14,028\n$11,238\n$18,036\nAverage Time Charter TC Rate\n-\n-\n-\n-\nPANAMAX\nAverage Spot TCE Rate\n$10,122\n$7,194\n$8,717\n$13,304\nAverage Time Charter TC Rate\n-\n-\n-\n-\nFULL FLEET\nAverage Spot TCE Rate\n$21,104\n$28,190\n$23,755\n$31,551\nAverage Time Charter TC Rate\n-\n-\n-\n$42,542\nFULL FLEET TCE Rate\n$21,104\n$28,190\n$23,755\n$31,745\n(1)\nTime Charter Equivalent, or \"TCE,\" is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. The Company calculates TCE by dividing net voyage revenue by total operating days for its fleet. Net voyage revenues are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses. The Company evaluates its performance using net voyage revenues. The Company believes that presenting voyage revenues, net of voyage expenses, neutralizes the variability created by unique costs associated with particular voyages or deployment of vessels on time charter or on the spot market and presents a more accurate representation of the revenues generated by its vessels. Please refer to the tables at the end of this release for a reconciliation of TCE and net voyage revenues to voyage revenues. Spot TCEs include all spot voyages for the Company's vessels, including those that were in Navig8 pools.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results Summary\nThe Company recorded net loss for the three months of $45.4 million, or $0.55 basic and diluted loss per share, compared to net income of $5.8 million, or $0.07 basic and diluted income per share, for the prior year period.\nAdjusted net loss was $18.6 million, or $0.22 basic and diluted adjusted loss per share, for the three months , compared to adjusted net income of $20.1 million, or $0.24 basic and diluted adjusted income per share, for the prior year period. Please refer to the tables at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of Net loss to Net loss, adjusted.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three months was $25.0 million, compared to $64.3 million for the prior year period. Please refer to the tables at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA to net income.\nThe average daily spot TCE rate obtained by the Company's VLCC fleet, including its vessels that were deployed in the Navig8 pools, was $23,752 for the three months During the three months , the Company's \"ECO\" VLCC fleet earned an average daily TCE rate of $24,385 and the Company's non-\"ECO\" VLCC fleet earned an average daily TCE rate of $18,907. The average daily TCE rate obtained by the Company on a full-fleet basis was $21,104 during the three months , compared to $28,190 for the prior year period.\nNet voyage revenues, which are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses, decreased by $43.2 million, or 43.4%, to $56.4 million for the three months compared to $99.6 million for the prior year period. The decrease in net voyage revenues was primarily due to the decrease in the Company's average daily fleet TCE rate by $7,086, or 25.1%, to $21,104 for the three months compared to $28,190 for the prior year period. The decrease in the Company's average daily fleet TCE rate resulted in a decrease in net voyage revenue of approximately $25.0 million during the three months compared to the prior year period. Also contributing to the decrease in net voyage revenues was a 24.4% decrease in vessel operating days to 2,671 for the three months compared to 3,533 for the prior year period. The decrease in vessel operating days resulted in a decrease in net voyage revenue of approximately $18.2 million.\nDirect vessel operating expenses, which include crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, and maintenance and repairs for owned vessels decreased by $6.1 million, or 20.1%, to $24.2 million for the three months compared to $30.3 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in crew costs of $3.4 million, or 22%, and the decrease in insurance expense of $0.6 million, or 15%, compared to the prior year period. The decrease in crew costs and insurance expense was primarily due to a decrease in our average fleet size to 31.5 vessels for the three months from 38.6 vessels for the prior year period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $3.2 million, or 57.1%, to $8.8 million for the three months , compared to $5.6 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.9 million in professional and legal fees compared to the prior year period, primarily related to the Merger.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased by $2.8 million, or 10.3%, to $23.8 million for the three months compared to $26.6 million for the prior year period. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to a decrease in vessel depreciation of $1.7 million, or 6.9%, to $23.1 million for the three months compared to $24.8 million in the prior year period.\nLoss on disposal of vessels, net increased by $11.2 million, or 80.0%, to $25.2 million for the three months compared to a loss of $14.0 million for the prior year period. The loss on disposal of vessels, net during the three months , was primarily related to sales of the Gener8 Argus and Gener8 Zeus.\nNet interest expense increased by $1.4 million, or 8.0%, to $19.7 million for the three months compared to $18.3 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in capitalization of interest expense to $0 for three months compared to $3.3 million for the prior year period. The capitalized interest expense in the prior year period was associated with vessels under construction as a result of the funding of the acquisition of our VLCC newbuildings. Capitalized interest results in a reduction of interest expense, net. We do not capitalize interest expense associated with the funding of our VLCC newbuildings after delivery of the vessels. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $1.2 million in commitment fees and an increase of $0.4 million in interest income due to a higher cash balance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's cash balance was $200.5 million, compared to $94.7 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's total debt was $1.4 billion and net debt was $1.1 billion. Please refer to the tables at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of net debt to total debt.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were 83,267,426 shares of the Company's common stock outstanding.\nFull Year 2017 Results Summary\nThe Company recorded net loss for the twelve months of $168.5 million, or $2.03 basic and diluted loss per share, compared to net income of $67.3 million, or $0.81 basic and diluted income per share, for the prior year period.\nAdjusted net loss was $20.9 million, or $0.25 basic and diluted adjusted loss per share, for the twelve months , compared to adjusted net income of $124.8 million, or $1.51 basic and diluted adjusted income per share, for the prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the twelve months was $165.2 million, compared to $256.5 million for the prior year period.\nThe average daily spot TCE rate obtained by the Company's VLCC fleet, including its vessels that were deployed in the Navig8 pools, was $28,329 for the twelve months During the twelve months , the Company's \"ECO\" VLCC fleet earned an average daily TCE rate of $29,094 and the Company's non-\"ECO\" VLCC fleet earned an average daily TCE rate of $23,909. The average daily TCE rate obtained by the Company on a full-fleet basis was $23,755 during the twelve months , compared to $31,745 for the prior year period.\nNet voyage revenues decreased by $93.8 million, or 23.9%, to $298.4 million for the twelve months compared to $392.1 million for the prior year period. The decrease in net voyage revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in our average daily fleet TCE rate by $7,990, or 25.2%, to $23,755 for the twelve months , compared to $31,745 for the prior year period primarily due to the decrease in rates in the spot charter market. The decrease in average daily fleet TCE rate resulted in a decrease in net voyage revenue of approximately $98.7 million during the twelve months compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net voyage revenues was partially offset by an increase in our fleet operating days by 208 days, or 1.7% to 12,561 days for the twelve months compared to 12,353 days for the prior year period due to improved utilization of our VLCC vessels in the Navig8 pools. The increase in our vessel operating days resulted in an increase in net voyage revenue of approximately $4.9 million during the twelve months compared to the prior year period.\nDirect vessel operating expenses was $107.4 million for the twelve months , or substantially flat as compared to $107.3 million for the prior year period. An increase in crew costs and surveys expenses of $2.9 million for the twelve months compared to the prior year period was partially offset by a $2.8 million decrease in overall direct vessel operating expenses for the twelve months compared to the prior year period due to the sale of 12 vessels during the twelve months Daily direct operating expenses per vessel decreased by $379, or 4.5%, to $8,079 per day, compared to $8,458 per day for the prior year period, primarily related to an increase in our calendar days of 606 days, or 4.8%, to 13,293 days compared to 12,687 days in the prior year period, which was due to an increase in our average fleet size during fiscal 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $6.0 million, or 21.5%, to $33.8 million for the twelve months compared to $27.8 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.1 million in professional and legal fees, primarily related to the Merger. Also contributing to the increase were a $1.5 million write-off of assets, litigation loss of $0.4 million and a $1.4 million increase in employee bonuses for the twelve months compared to the prior year period. Additionally, during fiscal 2017 we recorded $1.3 million of compensation expenses related the issuance of 525,000 options granted on January 5, 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $16.8 million, or 19.2%, to $104.0 million for the twelve months compared to $87.2 million for the prior year period. This increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to an increase in depreciation of vessels of $18.5 million, or 23.4%, to $97.6 million during twelve months , as a result of new vessel deliveries, compared to $79.1 million for the prior year period. The increase in depreciation and amortization was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of dry dock costs of $1.5 million, or 20.6%, to $5.7 million, due to sale of older vessels, compared to $7.2 million for the prior year period.\nLosses on disposal of vessels, net increased for the twelve months by $115.7 million, or 478.6%, to $139.8 million compared to $24.2 million for the prior year period, primarily due to losses on the sale of 12 vessels during the twelve months\nNet interest expense increased by $33.1 million, or 66.8% to $82.8 million for the twelve months compared to $49.6 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in capitalized interest of $24.4 million, or 88.5%, to $3.2 million compared to $27.6 million for the prior year period, related to the capitalization of interest expense associated with vessels under construction as a result of the funding of the acquisition of our VLCC newbuildings. Also contributing to the increase in interest expense, net during the twelve months , was an increase in amortization of loan fees of $3.6 million, of which $2.6 million was related to the write-off of debt financing costs associated with the sales of the Gener8 Noble and Gener8 Theseus.\nOther income (expense), net increased by $0.3 million, or 38.5% to $0.9 million for the twelve months compared to $0.6 million for the prior year period. During the year and 2016, we recognized $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively of earnings, as other income (expense), net, related to the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, entered in fiscal 2016 and amended in 2017.\nGener8 Maritime Fleet Profile (as of March 14, 2018)\nVessels on the Water\nType\nVessel Name\nDWT\nYear Built\nEmployment\n1\nVLCC\nGener8 Nestor\n297,638\n2017\nVL8 Pool\n2\nVLCC\nGener8 Ethos\n298,991\n2017\nVL8 Pool\n3\nVLCC\nGener8 Hector\n297,363\n2017\nVL8 Pool\n4\nVLCC\nGener8 Miltiades\n301,038\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n5\nVLCC\nGener8 Oceanus\n299,011\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n6\nVLCC\nGener8 Perseus\n299,392\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n7\nVLCC\nGener8 Macedon\n298,991\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n8\nVLCC\nGener8 Chiotis\n300,973\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n9\nVLCC\nGener8 Constantine\n299,011\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n10\nVLCC\nGener8 Andriotis\n301,014\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n11\nVLCC\nGener8 Apollo\n301,417\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n12\nVLCC\nGener8 Ares\n301,587\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n13\nVLCC\nGener8 Hera\n301,619\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n14\nVLCC\nGener8 Nautilus\n298,991\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n15\nVLCC\nGener8 Success\n300,932\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n16\nVLCC\nGener8 Supreme\n300,933\n2016\nVL8 Pool\n17\nVLCC\nGener8 Athena\n299,999\n2015\nVL8 Pool\n18\nVLCC\nGener8 Strength\n300,960\n2015\nVL8 Pool\n19\nVLCC\nGener8 Neptune\n299,999\n2015\nVL8 Pool\n20\nVLCC\nGener8 Atlas\n306,005\n2007\nVL8 Pool\n21\nVLCC\nGener8 Hercules\n306,543\n2007\nVL8 Pool\n22\nSuezmax\nGener8 Spartiate\n164,925\n2011\nSuez8 Pool\n23\nSuezmax\nGener8 Maniate\n164,715\n2010\nSuez8 Pool\n24\nSuezmax\nGener8 St. Nikolas\n149,876\n2008\nSuez8 Pool\n25\nSuezmax\nGener8 Kara G\n150,296\n2007\nSuez8 Pool\n26\nSuezmax\nGener8 George T\n149,847\n2007\nSuez8 Pool\n27\nSuezmax\nGener8 Harriet G\n150,296\n2006\nSuez8 Pool\n28\nAframax\nGener8 Defiance\n105,538\n2002\nSpot\n29\nPanamax\nGener8 Companion\n72,749\n2004\nSpot\n30\nPanamax\nGenmar Compatriot\n72,749\n2004\nSpot\nVessels on the Water Total\n7,493,398\nFinancial Information\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nFor the Three Months\nFor the Year\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nEnded December 31,\nEnded December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nVOYAGE REVENUES:\nNavig8 pool revenues\n$ 54,402\n$ 97,929\n$ 292,975\n$ 368,889\nTime charter revenues\n-\n-\n-\n9,278\nSpot charter revenues\n4,430\n4,432\n14,844\n26,455\nTotal voyage revenues\n58,832\n102,361\n307,819\n404,622\nVoyage expenses\n2,459\n2,780\n9,446\n12,490\nNet voyage revenues\n56,373\n99,581\n298,373\n392,132\nOPERATING EXPENSES:\nDirect vessel operating expenses\n24,170\n30,267\n107,395\n107,308\nNavig8 charterhire expenses\n-\n(181)\n6\n3,059\nGeneral and administrative\n8,843\n5,604\n33,831\n27,844\nDepreciation and amortization\n23,824\n26,569\n103,951\n87,191\nGoodwill impairment\n-\n-\n-\n23,297\nLoss on disposal of vessels, net\n25,192\n13,992\n139,836\n24,169\nGoodwill write-off for sales of vessels\n-\n-\n-\n2,994\nTotal operating expenses\n82,029\n76,251\n385,019\n275,862\nOPERATING (LOSS) INCOME\n$(25,656)\n$ 23,330\n$ (86,646)\n$ 116,270\nOTHER EXPENSES:\nInterest expense, net\n(19,724)\n(18,272)\n(82,764)\n(49,627)\nOther financing costs\n(4)\n1\n(59)\n(7)\nOther income (expense), net\n(8)\n745\n928\n670\nTotal other expenses\n(19,736)\n(17,526)\n(81,895)\n(48,964)\nNET (LOSS) INCOME\n$(45,392)\n$ 5,804\n$(168,541)\n$ 67,306\n(LOSS) INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\nBasic\n$ (0.55)\n$ 0.07\n$ (2.03)\n$ 0.81\nDiluted\n$ (0.55)\n$ 0.07\n$ (2.03)\n$ 0.81\nSelected Balance Sheet Data\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nBALANCE SHEET DATA, at end of period\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCash & cash equivalents\n$ 200,501\n$ 94,681\nCurrent assets, including cash\n253,466\n215,285\nTotal assets\n2,618,217\n2,992,669\nCurrent liabilities, incl. current portion of LTD\n151,005\n216,566\nCurrent portion of LTD\n120,336\n181,023\nTotal LTD, incl. current portion & excl. discount\n1,361,826\n1,581,951\nShareholders' equity\n1,274,326\n1,437,411\nReconciliation Tables\nEBITDA represents net income (loss) plus net interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude the items set forth in the table below, which represent certain non-cash, one-time and other items that the Company's believes are not indicative of the ongoing performance of its core operations. Adjusted Net Income represents Net Income adjusted to exclude the same non-cash, one-time and other items, as well as commitment fees. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are included in this presentation because they are used by management and certain investors as measures of operating performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are used by analysts in the shipping industry as common performance measures to compare results across peers. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not items recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), and should not be considered in isolation or used as alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activity or any other indicator of the Company's operating performance or liquidity required by GAAP. The Company's presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income is intended to supplement investors' understanding of its operating performance by providing information regarding its ongoing performance that exclude items the Company believes do not directly affect its core operations and enhancing the comparability of its ongoing performance across periods. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income in addition to EBITDA and Net Income because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income eliminate the impact of additional non-cash, one-time and other items not associated with the ongoing performance of its core operations, including charges associated with stock-based compensation, gains and losses on the sale of vessels and costs associated with its financing activities, that the Company believes further reduce the comparability of the ongoing performance of its core operations across periods. The Company's management considers EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to be useful to investors because such performance measures provide information regarding the profitability of its core operations and facilitate comparison of its operating performance to the operating performance of the Company's peers. Additionally, the Company's management uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income as performance measures and they are also presented for review at the Company's board meetings. While the Company believes these measures are useful to investors, the definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income used here may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. In addition, these definitions are also not the same as the definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income used in the financial covenants in the Company's debt instruments.\nDuring the twelve months , we included in Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA $1.4 million of professional fees related to the recently announced Merger transaction and Loss on litigation of $0.4 million, which is related to the Atlas charter dispute. On May 9, 2017, the arbitration tribunal before which the dispute is being heard ruled that GMR Atlas LLC (one of our subsidiaries) had been in breach of certain customer eligibility requirements as claimed by the Atlas claimant. As a result, the Company recorded as general and administrative expenses a write-off of $1.5 million during its second quarter.\nPlease see below for a reconciliation of the following adjusted amounts to Net Income (dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDec-17\nDec-16\nDec-17\nDec-16\nNet (Loss) Income\n$(45,392)\n$ 5,804\n$(168,541)\n$ 67,306\n+ Goodwill Impairment\n-\n-\n-\n23,297\n+ Goodwill write-off for sales of vessels\n-\n-\n-\n2,994\n+ Stock-based compensation expense\n598\n1,352\n4,205\n5,651\n+ Loss on disposal of vessels, net\n25,192\n13,992\n139,836\n24,169\n+ Other financing costs\n4\n(1)\n59\n7\n+ Professional fees related to interest rate swaps\n-\n-\n260\n327\n+ Commitment Fees\n5\n654\n629\n5,201\n+ Impact of interest rate swaps fair value\n-\n(698)\n(530)\n(698)\n+ Non-cash G&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation\n(379)\n(1,025)\n1,413\n(3,414)\n+ Loss on litigation\n-\n-\n400\n-\n+ Merger related costs\n1,404\n-\n1,404\n-\nNet (Loss) Income, adjusted\n$(18,568)\n$ 20,078\n$ (20,865)\n$ 124,840\nWeighted average shares outstanding, basic, in thousands\n83,083\n82,776\n83,003\n82,075\nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted, in thousands\n83,083\n82,776\n83,003\n82,075\nBasic net (loss) income per share, adjusted\n$ (0.22)\n$ 0.24\n$ (0.25)\n$ 1.51\nDiluted net (loss) income per share, adjusted\n$ (0.22)\n$ 0.24\n$ (0.25)\n$ 1.51\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDec-17\nDec-16\nDec-17\nDec-16\nNet (Loss) Income\n$ (45,392)\n$ 5,804\n$ (168,541)\n$ 67,306\n+ Interest expense, net\n19,724\n18,272\n82,764\n49,627\n+ Depreciation and amortization\n23,824\n26,569\n103,951\n87,191\nEBITDA\n$ (1,844)\n$ 50,645\n$ 18,174\n$ 204,124\n+ Goodwill Impairment\n-\n-\n-\n23,297\n+ Goodwill write-off for sales of vessels\n-\n-\n-\n2,994\n+ Stock-based compensation expense\n598\n1,352\n4,205\n5,651\n+ Loss on disposal of vessels, net\n25,192\n13,992\n139,836\n24,169\n+ Other financing costs\n4\n(1)\n59\n7\n+ Professional fees related to interest rate swaps\n-\n-\n260\n327\n+ Impact of interest rate swaps fair value\n-\n(698)\n(530)\n(698)\n+ Non-cash G&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation\n(379)\n(1,025)\n1,413\n(3,414)\n+ Loss on litigation\n-\n-\n400\n-\n+ Merger related costs\n1,404\n-\n1,404\n-\nEBITDA, adjusted\n$ 24,975\n$ 64,265\n$ 165,221\n$ 256,457\n(1)\nNon-cash G&A expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense, include accounts receivable reserves, amortization of lease assets that were recorded in connection with fresh start accounting and amortization of straight line rent expense. The presentation of prior year amounts have been conformed to the current year presentation.\nNet debt represents total debt less cash, discounts and deferred financing costs. Net debt is included is this presentation because it is used by management and certain investors as a measure of the Company's overall liquidity, financial flexibility and leverage. Furthermore, certain investors, creditors, and credit analysts monitor the Company's net debt as part of their assessments of its business. Net debt is not recognized by GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or used as alternatives financial condition or liquidity required by GAAP. In particular, the Company typically needs a portion of its cash for purposes other than debt reduction. The deduction of these items from total debt in the calculation of net debt should thus not be understood to mean that any of these items are available exclusively for debt reduction at any given time.\nLong-term debt reconciliation table\nPlease see below for a reconciliation of the following adjusted amounts to long-term debt (dollars in thousands)\nReconciliation of total long-term debt\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nLong-term debt less unamortized discount and debt financing costs\n$ 1,191,711\n$ 1,337,782\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n120,336\n181,023\nTotal long-term debt, incl. current portion, less unamortized discount and DFC\n$ 1,312,047\n$ 1,518,805\nCash & cash equivalents\n200,501\n94,681\nNet Debt\n$ 1,111,546\n$ 1,424,124\nNet Voyage Revenue & Operating Days Reconciliation Tables\nGener8 Maritime Net Voyage Revenue & Operating Days\n(Dollars in thousands, except Operating Days data)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDec-17\nDec-16\nDec-17\nDec-16\nVLCC\nECO Fleet Net Voyage Revenue (1)\n$ 42,367\n$ 57,325\n$ 204,307\n$ 163,935\nECO Fleet Operating Days (1)\n1,737\n1,532\n7,022\n4,067\nNon-ECO Fleet Net Voyage Revenue (1)\n$ 4,297\n$ 14,763\n$ 29,092\n$ 78,886\nNon-ECO Fleet Operating Days (1)\n227\n455\n1,217\n1,984\nSpot Charter & Navig8 Pool Net Voyage Revenues\n$ 46,664\n$ 72,088\n$ 233,399\n$ 242,821\nSpot Charter & Navig8 Pool Operating Days\n1,965\n1,987\n8,239\n6,051\nTime Charter Revenue\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 9,278\nTime Charter Operating Days\n-\n-\n-\n218\nSUEZMAX\nSpot Charter & Navig8 Pool Net Voyage Revenues\n$ 8,149\n$ 21,030\n$ 50,324\n$ 104,516\nSpot Charter & Navig8 Pool Operating Days\n507\n997\n2,898\n3,894\nTime Charter Revenue\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTime Charter Operating Days\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAFRAMAX\nSpot Charter & Navig8 Pool Net Voyage Revenues\n$ (302)\n$ 5,163\n$ 9,264\n$ 25,730\nSpot Charter & Navig8 Pool Operating Days\n15\n368\n824\n1,427\nPANAMAX\nSpot Charter Revenue\n$ 1,863\n$ 1,300\n$ 5,225\n$ 9,595\nSpot Operating Days\n184\n181\n599\n721\nGener8 Maritime Full Fleet Net Voyage Revenues\n(Dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDec-17\nDec-16\nDec-17\nDec-16\nTotal Voyage Revenues\n$ 58,832\n$ 102,361\n$ 307,819\n$ 404,622\nTotal Voyage Expenses\n2,459\n2,780\n9,446\n12,490\nTotal Net Voyage Revenues\n$ 56,373\n$ 99,581\n$ 298,373\n$ 392,132\n(1)\nIncludes all spot voyages for the Company's vessels, including those that were in the Navig8 Pools.\nAbout Gener8 Maritime\nAs of March 14, 2018, Gener8 Maritime has a fleet of 30 wholly-owned vessels comprised of 21 VLCCs, 6 Suezmaxes, one Aframax, and two Panamax tankers.
