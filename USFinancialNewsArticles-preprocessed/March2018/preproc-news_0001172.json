    "text": "ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) announced that it has priced $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior notes due 2021 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior notes due 2023 (together, the “Notes”). AES intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to fund the concurrent tender offer to purchase AES’ outstanding 8.00% senior notes due 2020 and 7.375% senior notes due 2021 (together, the “Outstanding Notes”) and to pay certain related fees and expenses. AES intends to use any remaining net proceeds from this offering after completion of the tender offer to retire certain of its outstanding indebtedness. In conjunction with the tender offer, the Company is soliciting consents to the adoption of certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing the Outstanding Notes to alter the notice requirements for optional redemption with respect to each series of Outstanding Notes. The closing of the offering of the Notes is expected to occur, subject to certain customary conditions, on March 15, 2018 (T + 10).\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor does it constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. An effective shelf registration statement related to the Notes has previously been filed by AES with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The offering and sale of the Notes are being made only by means of a prospectus supplement dated March 1, 2018 and an accompanying base prospectus dated February 23, 2016 related to the offering. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus and the preliminary prospectus supplement in that registration statement and other documents AES has filed with the SEC for more complete information about AES and this offering.
