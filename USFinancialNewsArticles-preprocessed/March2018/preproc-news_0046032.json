    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Defence Ministry said more than 105,000 people have left Syria’s Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave, including another 700 on Saturday since government forces began an assault to retake it a month ago, RIA news agency reported, citing the military.\nFILE PHOTO: A girl looks out of a bus window during evacuation from the besieged town of Douma, Eastern Ghouta, in Damascus, Syria March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh RIA referred to evacuations taking place during “humanitarian pauses”. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s main ally in the conflict, ordered daily five-hour ceasefires and the creation of a “humanitarian corridor” to allow civilians to leave Eastern Ghouta.\nIn the event, the offensive - among the fiercest of the seven-year civil war - was largely carried out in defiance of international pleas to halt and honor a truce, and about 90 percent of eastern Ghouta is back under government control.\nReporting by Denis Pinchuk; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ",
