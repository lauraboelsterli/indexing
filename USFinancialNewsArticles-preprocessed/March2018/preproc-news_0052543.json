    "text": "LIMA, March 27 (Reuters) - Shares of Peruvian construction company Grana y Montero rose more than 7 percent on the Lima stock exchange on Tuesday, boosted by expectations that activity in the sector will strengthen under the countryâ€™s new president.\nPresident Martin Vizcarra took office after former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned last week amid a corruption scandal. Vizcarra traveled to a northern region hit by severe flooding on Tuesday and promised to prioritize delayed efforts to rebuild homes and infrastructure.
