Gross domestic product grew for a fourth straight quarter in October-December.\nEstablished in 2001 by the Greek government, Taneo invests in venture capital funds, specialising in Greek small and medium size enterprises in the telecommunications, information technology, e-commerce, biotechnology, and new materials sectors.\nMubadala, active in 13 sectors and more than 30 countries, is joining up with the Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC) as part of a consolidation in Abu Dhabi’s investment funds, it was announced last week.\n$1 = 0.8068 euros Reporting by Tom Arnold; editing by Jason Neely and Louise Heavens\n ",
