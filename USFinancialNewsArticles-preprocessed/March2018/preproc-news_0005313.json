    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s trade deficit in services widened to $21.8 billion in January from $20.6 billion in December, the foreign exchange regulator said on Wednesday.\nThe deficit was largely due to a $18.9 billion gulf in tourist spending, data from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) showed. When Chinese go abroad, they splurge more than do foreign visitors traveling in China.\nReporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ",
