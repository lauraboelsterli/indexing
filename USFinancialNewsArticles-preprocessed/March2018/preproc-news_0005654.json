Ashton Poole, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “There were several positive developments for Triangle in the fourth quarter, as the Company earned net investment income of $0.38 per share and saw its net asset value increase to $13.43 per share. We continued the transition of our portfolio to more senior-oriented investments, with five of our six new debt investments in first or second lien positions. We also continued to work through our legacy under-performing investments, including the repayment or restructuring of three non-accrual debt investments. Our Board continues its exploration of strategic alternatives, and we look forward to communicating the results once the process has been completed.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal investment income during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $31.7 million, compared to total investment income of $29.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in quarter-over-quarter total investment income resulted primarily from a $2.6 million increase in non-recurring dividend and fee income, partially offset by a decrease in portfolio debt investments quarter-over-quarter.\nNet investment income during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $17.9 million, compared to net investment income of $17.2 million for the third quarter of 2017. Net investment income per share during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.38, based on weighted average shares outstanding during the quarter of 47.7 million, compared to $0.36 per share during the third quarter of 2017, based on weighted average shares outstanding of 47.7 million.\nThe Company’s net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $23.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $57.5 million during the third quarter of 2017. The Company’s net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $0.50 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017, based on weighted average shares outstanding of 47.7 million, compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $1.20 per share during the third quarter of 2017, based on weighted average shares outstanding of 47.7 million.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total investment income was $123.0 million, compared to total investment income of $113.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributed to an increase in portfolio debt investments and a $2.8 million increase in non-recurring dividend and fee income, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average yield on our debt investments from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 and a decrease in investment income relating to non-accrual assets.\nNet investment income for 2017 was $72.2 million, compared to net investment income of $58.9 million during 2016. Net investment income per share during 2017 was $1.55, based on a weighted average share count of 46.5 million, compared to $1.62 per share during 2016, based on a weighted average share count of 36.4 million.\nThe Company’s net decrease in net assets resulting from operations during the year ended December 31, 2017, was $28.7 million, compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company’s net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was $0.62 per share during 2017, based on weighted average shares outstanding of 46.5 million, compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $0.94 per share in 2016, based on weighted average shares outstanding of 36.4 million.\nThe Company’s net asset value, or NAV, at December 31, 2017, was $13.43 per share, as compared to $13.20 per share at September 30, 2017 and $15.13 per share at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s weighted average yield on its outstanding, currently yielding debt investments was 11.0%, as compared to 11.2% at September 30, 2017 and 11.7% at December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $191.8 million and outstanding borrowings under its senior secured credit facility of $156.1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had outstanding non-callable, fixed-rate SBA-guaranteed debentures totaling $250.0 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.90%. In addition, the Company’s third SBIC license that was approved in January of 2017 provides up to $100.0 million of additional borrowing capacity for SBA-guaranteed debentures.\nDividend Information\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share. This is the Company’s 45th consecutive quarterly dividend since its initial public offering in February 2007.\nThe Company’s dividend will be payable as follows:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Dividend Amount Per Share: $0.30 Record Date: March 14, 2018 Payment Date: March 28, 2018 Dividend Reinvestment Plan\nAt the time of its IPO in February, 2007, Triangle adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) that provides for reinvestment of dividends and distributions on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, when the Company declares a cash dividend or distribution, stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP will have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock, rather than receiving cash.\nWhen the Company declares and pays dividends and distributions, it determines the allocation of the distribution between current income, accumulated income and return of capital on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP). At each year end, the Company is required for tax purposes to determine the allocation based on tax accounting principles. Due to differences between GAAP and tax accounting principles, the portion of each dividend distribution that is ordinary income, capital gain or return of capital may differ for GAAP and tax purposes. The tax status of the Company’s distributions can be found on the Investor Relations page of its website.\nRecent Portfolio Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made twenty-nine new investments, including recapitalizations of existing portfolio companies, totaling $408.9 million, additional debt investments in eighteen existing portfolio companies totaling $70.4 million and additional equity investments in eleven existing portfolio companies totaling $4.4 million. The Company had twenty-one portfolio company loans repaid at par totaling $332.5 million and received normal principal repayments, partial loan repayments and PIK interest repayments totaling $54.5 million. The Company recognized $25.6 million of realized losses related to two portfolio company restructurings. The Company wrote off equity investments in eight portfolio companies and recognized realized losses on the write-offs of $15.1 million and wrote off or sold debt investments in six portfolio companies and recognized realized losses of $31.6 million. In addition, the Company received proceeds related to the sales of certain equity securities totaling $29.6 million and recognized net realized gains on such sales totaling $20.9 million.\nNew investment transactions which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2017 are summarized as follows:\nIn October, 2017, the Company made a $32.5 million senior debt investment in Deva Holdings, Inc.
