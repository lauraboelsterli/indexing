REUTERS/Damir Sagolj “Yesterday, I was on floor and I felt something go on take-off and sadly I have snapped my Achilles. I feel so upset and heartbroken, words can’t describe how I’m feeling right now! “I don’t know when I will be back competing again but I have the greatest people around me that will help me recover mentally and physically. This won’t be the end for me I will come back stronger. Lots of love X.” She will begin her rehabilitation under the guidance of the British Gymnastics medical team and English Institute of Sport support staff. The Commonwealth Games will be staged from April 4 to 15 on the Gold Coast, Queensland. Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar",
