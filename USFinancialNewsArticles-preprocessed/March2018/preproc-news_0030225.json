    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 4:31 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Sports court upholds four-year ban for Polish weightlifter Zielinski Reuters Staff 1 Min Read ZURICH (Reuters) - The Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Thursday confirmed a four-year period of ineligibility for Tomasz Zielinski, a Polish weightlifter who tested positive for a banned substance two years ago. Poland's Tomasz Bernard Zielinski lifts on the men's 94Kg group B weightlifting competition at the ExCel venue at the London 2012 Olympic Games August 4, 2012. REUTERS/Dominic Ebenbichler Zielinski, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics, was given a four-year ban after testing positive for 19-Norandrosterone during a doping control during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. CAS rejected Zielinski’s appeal, deciding “it could not conclude otherwise than that the athlete had committed the anti-doping rule violation intentionally. Furthermore, the Panel did not find any reasons to reduce the four-year period of ineligibility”. Reporting by John Miller, editing by John Revill",
