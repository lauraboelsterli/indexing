The logo of Austrian specialty steelmaker Voestalpine is seen in front of the company's premises in Linz, Austria August 24, 2017. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader “The extent to which other sales are affected by import restrictions is being thoroughly examined. The fact is, however, already based on these figures that a maximum of about 3 percent of current Voestalpine group sales can be affected by the U.S. tariffs and the economic risk remains very manageable even in extreme cases,” it said in a statement.
