    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Layne Christensen Company, (NASDAQ: LAYN) (\"Layne\" or the \"Company\"), the largest water well drilling company in the United States and a leading provider of water infrastructure solutions, today commented on a recently filed letter by Cetus Capital, LLC (\"Cetus\") relating to Layne's pending merger with Granite Construction Incorporated (\"Granite\").\nThe Company welcomes constructive input from its stockholders with the common goal of maximizing stockholder value. However, the Layne Board of Directors (the \"Board\") believes Cetus' analysis results in inaccurate and misleading conclusions. The Company recommends that stockholders review the definitive proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which will include additional information addressing Cetus' commentary and which is expected to be filed in the second quarter of 2018.\nAs previously noted in the Company's draft proxy statement contained in Granite's Registration on Form S-4 recently filed with the SEC, the Board, in consultation with the Company's independent financial and legal advisors, conducted a thorough financial analysis of the Company's business and explored a variety of strategic alternatives focusing on growing its business and developing value for its stockholders. In connection with this process, Layne considered its prospects on a standalone basis and evaluated potential strategic transactions that included raising growth capital from new and existing sources of capital and potential acquisition, sale and expansion opportunities relating to one or more divisions of Layne's business. Following the completion of the review process, the Board unanimously concluded that the transaction with Granite offered a more favorable opportunity for Layne's stockholders than the alternatives considered.\nThe Board strongly believes that the proposed merger with Granite is in the best interest of Layne's stockholders and that it will create the greatest value for investors over the long-term. As a result of the proposed merger, Layne stockholders will share in the upside of a combined company with substantially greater financial resources to invest in growth initiatives and a more diversified, expanded national platform of businesses that is expected to be positioned as a leader across both the transportation and water infrastructure markets.\nAbout Layne\nLayne is a global water management, infrastructure services and drilling company, providing responsible solutions to the world of essential natural resources â€” water, minerals and energy. We offer innovative, sustainable products and services with an enduring commitment to safety, excellence, and integrity.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this communication may constitute \" \" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ indicated in such , including but not limited to: failure to obtain applicable regulatory or shareholder approvals in a timely manner or otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the proposed merger; risks that Layne will not be integrated successfully or that Granite will not realize estimated cost savings, synergies and growth or that such benefits may take longer to realize than expected; failure to realize anticipated benefits from Layne's operations; risks relating to unanticipated costs of integration; reductions in customer spending, or a slowdown in customer payments; unanticipated changes relating to competitive factors in the industry in which Layne and Granite participate; ability to hire and retain key personnel; ability to successfully integrate Layne's businesses; the potential impact of announcement or consummation of the proposed merger on relationships with third parties, including customers, employees and competitors; ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers in the manner anticipated; reliance on and integration of information technology systems; changes in legislation or governmental regulations affecting the companies; international, national or local economic, social or political conditions that could adversely affect the companies or their customers; conditions in the credit markets; risks associated with assumptions the parties make in connection with the parties' critical accounting estimates and legal proceedings; the continuing recovery in the mining industry; prevailing prices for various commodities; the timing and extent of future oil and gas drilling and production in the Delaware Basin; longer term weather patterns; the availability of credit; the availability of equity or debt capital needed for the business and foreign currency fluctuations that may affect Layne's and Granite's results of operations.
