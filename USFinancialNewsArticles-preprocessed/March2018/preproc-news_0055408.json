    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GWG Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:GWGH), a financial services company committed to transforming the life insurance industry through disruptive and innovative products and services, today announced its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights for the Year\nReported record $65 million in benefits realized from its portfolio of life insurance assets, which totaled $1.7 billion in policy benefits at year end. Entered into a strategic relationship with The Beneficient Company Group, L.P. that is expected to provide a significant increase in assets, common shareholder equity and earnings. The Company’s insurtech subsidiary filed patents for two epigenetics-based tests for measuring smoking and alcohol consumption, both of which are key health underwriting parameters for the global life insurance industry.\n“The close of 2017 marks an important milestone in our corporate development as we have now built a portfolio of life insurance assets of the scale and diversification we believe is necessary to deliver returns that will meet our projections, while at the same time providing significant value to the senior consumers whom we have had the honor of serving,” said Jon Sabes, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “In addition, we entered into a strategic relationship that will further enhance the scale and diversification of our total portfolio of alternative assets. Finally, we began executing our plan to further innovate within the life insurance industry with game changing technology aimed at increasing the accuracy and precision of life insurance underwriting.”\n1. Financial & Operating Highlights\n($ Thousands except per share information) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 FY 2017 FY 2016 Revenue $ 17,681 $ 16,875 $ 64,134 $ 69,477 Expenses 24,127 17,587 86,864 68,752 Per Share Data 1 : Net Income (Loss) 2 (2.77 ) (0.52 ) (5.72 ) (0.53 ) Excluding Non-Recurring Items 2,4 (1.18 ) N/A (3.91 ) N/A Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Income 3,5 0.21 0.53 3.16 4.04 Capital Raised 55,218 44,222 259,076 210,915 Liquidity 6 159,430 121,659 159,430 121,659 Life Insurance Portfolio 7 1,676,148 1,361,675 1,676,148 1,361,675 Life Insurance Acquired 7 78,826 103,682 379,191 465,283 Face Value of Matured Policies 25,061 14,085 64,719 48,452 TTM Benefits / Premiums 8 123.8 % 120.4 % 123.8 % 120.4 % Attributable to common shareholders Per basic and fully diluted share outstanding Per fully diluted share outstanding See Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders Excluding Non-Recurring Items table below See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below Includes cash, restricted cash and policy benefits receivable as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 Face amount of policy benefits The ratio of policy benefits recognized to premiums paid on a trailing twelve month (TTM) basis Total revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $17.7 million, compared to $16.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the following: Increased realized gain from policy benefits due to increased recognition of policy benefits – $25.1 million of life insurance policy benefits for the quarter compared to $14.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Lower unrealized gain from policy acquisitions reflecting lower policy acquisition volume – $79 million for the quarter versus $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. A charge of $6.3 million related to the fair value impact of updating life expectancy estimates on certain policies in our portfolio – this compares to a charge of $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $24.1 million, compared to $17.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was due to the following: Increased interest expense due to increase in average debt outstanding and interest rates on our senior credit facility. Increased equity-based compensation expense. Impairment of a secured MCA loan (fully written off at 12/31/17) and related legal expenses. Increased sales and marketing costs associated with growing and servicing our network of independent financial advisors and insurance agents. Total revenue for the full year 2017 was $64.1 million, compared to $69.5 million in 2016 due to the following: Higher realized gain from policy benefits due to increased recognition of policy benefits – $64.7 million of life insurance policy benefits in 2017 compared to $48.5 million in 2016. A positive impact of $14.9 million due to changes in the discount rate used to value the Company’s portfolio of life insurance. This compares to a positive impact of $3.2 million in 2016. Lower unrealized gain from policy acquisitions reflecting lower policy acquisition volumes and lower purchase yields due to continued competition in the broker and tertiary markets – $379 million of benefits acquired in 2017 versus $465 million of benefits acquired in 2016. A charge of $20.3 million in 2017 related to the fair value impact of updated life expectancy estimates on certain policies in our portfolio – this compares to a charge of $6.0 million in 2016. Total expenses for the full year 2017 were $86.9 million, compared to $68.8 million in 2016. The increase was due to the following: Increased interest expense due to an increase in average debt outstanding. Higher employee compensation and benefits including severance costs primarily due to $2.1 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in severance payments made to former executives. Impairment of a secured MCA loan (fully written off at 12/31/17) and related legal expenses. Increase in sales and marketing costs associated with growing and servicing our network of independent financial advisors and appointed agents. Increased technology costs relating to systems development and cybersecurity.\nIn 2017 we recognized significant charges that we believe are non-recurring and not reflective of our underlying financial performance as per the table below.\nNet Income Attributable to Common Shareholders Excluding Non-Recurring Items:\n(After-tax impact in $ Thousands except per-share information) Q4 Q4 EPS 2017 2017 EPS Net Income (Loss) 1 $ (16,086 ) $ (2.77 ) $ (33,335 ) $ (5.72 ) Non-Recurring Items: Series A Preferred Stock Redemption 2 2,041 0.35 2,041 0.35 MCA 3 413 0.07 1,678 0.29 Income Tax – Valuation 4 6,827 1.17 6,827 1.17 Total Non-Recurring Items 9,281 1.59 10,546 1.81 Net Income (Loss) Excluding Non-Recurring Items 1 $ (6,805 ) $ (1.18 ) $ (22,789 ) $ (3.91 ) Attributable to common shareholders Redemption premium on Series A Preferred Stock which was fully redeemed on October 9, 2017 Legal, loan loss provision and other costs relating to a secured loan in the Merchant Cash Advance industry Reflects a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset due to uncertainty regarding future realization\n2.

Life Insurance Policy Origination\nLife Insurance Portfolio Activity:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Total policy benefits purchased $ 78,826,000 $ 103,682,000 $ 379,191,000 $ 465,283,000 Total life insurance policies purchased 68 72 255 317 Average policy benefit purchased $ 1,156,000 $ 1,440,000 $ 1,487,000 $ 1,468,000 Direct policy benefits purchased $ 6,340,000 $ 25,020,000 $ 50,218,000 $ 59,523,000 Direct insurance policies purchased 11 31 51 97 Life insurance policy purchases were lower in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 reflecting increased price competition and underwriting quality deterioration in the broker and tertiary market which caused us to be more selective in our purchases. We expect this to continue in 2018. Direct purchases of life insurance policies (not through a broker) were lower because we refocused our direct origination strategy and resources during the year. We expect direct origination volumes to grow in 2018 and in future periods. We continue to make progress in growing the number of life insurance agents and financial advisors that are able to source insurance policies directly for GWGH, ending the year with a record number of Appointed Agents, demonstrating that our strategy of targeting Insurance Marketing Organizations (IMOs) and Broker General Agents (BGAs), in addition to individual insurance agents, is gaining traction.\n4. Strategic Investment in The Beneficient Company Group, L.P.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Company announced an investment in and strategic relationship with The Beneficient Company Group, L.P. (BEN) that the Company expects will provide it with a significant increase in assets, common shareholder equity and earnings.\nSeveral important due diligence and transaction closing requirements have been completed and the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nTransaction highlights (see transaction diagram below)\nThe transaction brings together the Company, a leading innovator in the life insurance industry, and an innovative service and liquidity provider in the rapidly expanding alternative asset industry. The strategic relationship is expected to provide significant increase in assets, common shareholder equity and earnings. The Company will continue executing on announced strategies while also exploring providing its existing independent broker-dealer and registered investment advisor (RIA) network with BEN’s alternative asset liquidity products. The Company provides BEN and institutional investors exposure to the life insurance asset class and ownership in an acknowledged industry leader.\n5. Insurtech Initiative\nThe Company’s insurtech subsidiary, Life Epigenetics Inc., continues to position itself as a leader in the research, testing and application of epigenetics to human mortality prediction and life insurance underwriting. “Using the mortality prediction technology we licensed from UCLA, and our internally developed patent pending technology, we are making significant progress in applying this cutting edge science to the global life insurance industry,” Sabes said. “We anticipate reaching additional key scientific and business milestones and launching specific products available for the global life insurance industry that measure all-cause mortality, smoking and alcohol consumption.”\n2017 highlights:\nFiled patents for proprietary epigenetic tests to measure smoking and alcohol consumption. Hired Dr. Brian Chen, first author of the DNA Methylation Mortality Predictor, as our Chief Science Officer. Hired Dr. Randal S. Olson, a leading artificial intelligence and machine learning expert, as our Lead Data Scientist. Announced pilot programs and commenced research projects designed to validate and enhance our epigenetic tests. Received strong confirmation from a survey of financial professionals showing that 97 percent of respondents believe their clients would submit saliva to get a better price for life insurance.\n6.

The application of current GAAP standards during a period of significant growth in the Company’s business, in which period the Company is building a large and actuarially diverse portfolio of life insurance, results in current period operating performance that may not be reflective of the Company’s long-term earnings potential. Management believes that the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures permit investors to better focus on this long-term earnings performance without regard to the volatility in GAAP financial results that can occur during this phase of growth.\nNon-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including other companies within our industry. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures described above can be found below.\nAdjusted Non-GAAP Net Income . The Company calculates the adjusted net income by recognizing the actuarial gain accruing within our life insurance policies at the expected internal rate of return of the policies it owns without regard to fair value.
