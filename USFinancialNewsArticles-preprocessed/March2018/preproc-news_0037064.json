    "text": "Published: Mar 19, 2018 7:04 a.m. ET Share \nPrivately held chain, led by Elliott Management and Monarch Alternative Capital, aims to lower debt by around $1.9 billion Getty Images \nBy Allison Prang \nClaire’s Stores Inc. has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and said it plans to lower its debt by about $1.9 billion. \nThe teen retailer said it has an agreement with an ad hoc group of first-lien creditors that will provide the company with $575 million in new capital. That group is being led by Elliott Management Corp. and Monarch Alternative Capital LP. The group owns 72% of its first lien debt, Claire’s said. \nClaire’s said it expects the chapter 11 process to be completed in September. \nThe company said its chapter 11 filings don’t include its international subsidiaries. \nClaire’s went private in 2007 in a leveraged buyout for $3.1 billion spearheaded by Apollo.
