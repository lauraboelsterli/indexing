(OTCQB: FRLF ), a group of diversified, international, vertically-integrated cannabis/hemp businesses and media companies, today announced that its Co-Founders, CEO Clifford J. Perry and Richard Cowan, are currently in Spain to visit newly acquired Green Market Europe S.L. hemp cultivation operations and explore new business opportunities at the Spannabis Expo.\nOn March 6, Cowan visited two of the flowering greenhouses operated by Green Market Europe S.L. in Spain. (See photos and videos from the trip.) Green Market Europe is a b2b cultivator and has an indoor greenhouse grow area of 43,000 sq. ft. (4000 m2), plus a light deprivation greenhouse with an area of 21,000 sq. ft. (2000 m2), and outdoor cultivation and production capabilities of 240 acres (over 100 hectares).\nLuis Miguel Santos, managing director of Green Market Europe S.L., reported, “The greenhouse HEMP crop to be harvested in 3 weeks has a projected revenue of approximately €160,000 ($198,585) . There is an ever-growing demand for our high-quality hemp products.”\nAs in their United States operations, Freedom Leaf Europe will seek to vertically integrate its production with the quality CBD Freedom Leaf branded products, especially targeting the Latin American markets and “Cannabis Light¨ (CBD Hemp Flower) boom in Europe. FRLF’s branded CBD and industrial hemp products sold directly to consumers can be considerably more profitable than wholesaling to distributors.\nFreedom Leaf Executives will also be attending the Spannabis Expo (March 9 - 11) has grown to over 18,000 square meters (193,750 square ft.) and expects more than 30,000 visitors at the fairgrounds of Cornellà de Llobregat. http://spannabis.com/barcelona/en/\nClifford Perry explained, “Spannabis is a great place to network and find new opportunities and meet the leaders of the cannabis industry from around the world alongside all of our new Spanish business partners.”\nFederico Pando, Freedom Leaf Licensee in Spain and Portugal, states, ¨We are confident with the current and upcoming acquisitions, collaborations, and partnerships, Freedom Leaf will be a major international company leading the medical cannabis industry, industrial hemp research, and CBD production, with lifestyle brands catering to sophisticated and mainstream consumers.”\nLast year, Freedom Leaf also acquired LaMarihuana.com , the world’s leading Spanish language cannabis portal with an average 1.7 million hits a month and 1.2 million likes on Facebook. As part of the acquisition, Freedom Leaf additionally acquired www.Marihuana-Medicinal.com , which is one of the largest medical cannabis information website in Spanish with over 122,000 page visits a month.\nLa Marihuana was founded in 2001 and currently has more than 12,000 articles published and over 1 million visitors per month, making it the most visited online portal by the Spanish-speaking community with 73% of its traffic coming from Latin America, and the rest of the world.\nPerry explained, “This year we are focusing on upgrading our online technology to increase traffic, monetizing our current traffic, and build our e-commerce sites to maximize our profit margins and revenue generation.”\nIn January, Freedom Leaf completed its acquisition of Green Market Europe S.L. and intends to become a global leader in mass production of highest quality EU certified industrial hemp and related research.\nJust this week, FRLF signed an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire Irie CBD , a California-based product line that has been operating since 2015. Irie CBD formulates, manufactures and distributes CBD tinctures, CBD edibles, CBD topicals and CBD concentrates to retail markets across the country. Irie boasts a large inventory of more than 25 different products and recorded approximately $1.5 million of revenue in 2017. Irie also leases a full manufacturing and processing facility in Oakland, California that is included in the acquisition.\nAbout Freedom Leaf®\nFreedom Leaf, Inc., The Marijuana Legalization Company®, is a fully-reporting and audited, publicly-traded company trading under the symbol (OTCQB: FRLF ), a group of diversified, international, vertically-integrated Cannabis/Hemp/CBD businesses and media companies\nFreedom Leaf, Inc. is a leading, go-to resource in the cannabis, medical and recreational marijuana, CBD and industrial hemp industries.
