    "text": "LA JOLLA, Calif., March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nvia NetworkWire - INmune Bio, Inc., a cancer immunotherapy company focused on developing therapies that harness the patient’s innate immune system to attack their cancer, announces the appointment of Scott Juda, J.D., to its board of directors. Juda is the co-founder and managing member of Fossick Capital, a technology-focused hedge fund.\n“On behalf of my fellow directors, I am delighted to welcome Scott Juda to the INmune Bio board. Scott’s considerable experience in the capital markets and corporate law will significantly add to the depth and sophistication of our board. His expertise will be extremely valuable as we prepare to initiate Phase I clinical trials and prepare to potentially tap the capital markets to support the development of our two product platforms,” said RJ Tesi, M.D., CEO and co-founder of INmune Bio.\nFrom 2012 to 2016, prior to his founding Fossick Capital, Juda was co-founder and chief executive officer of The Juda Group, Inc., an institutional capital markets-focused broker-dealer. From 2002 until 2011, Juda was with Sanders Morris Harris Capital, where he served as a managing director in the investment banking group, as well as chief operating officer of The Juda Group subsidiary. Prior to these roles, Juda was an institutional salesperson-trader for Sutro & Co., Inc. and a corporate and securities attorney at Buchalter Nemer LLP in Los Angeles.\nJuda received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Southern California and a J.D. from Pepperdine University School of Law.\nDescribing how he will apply his background as a member of INmune’s board of directors, Juda stated, “I am excited to be joining the INmune board at this important stage in its development. INmune faces a bright future, and while rapid growth has opportunities and challenges, I look forward to bringing my experience to bear in advising the Company on balancing both. I also look forward to working with my fellow INmune board members and the management team to help the Company achieve its strategic objectives.”\nAbout INmune Bio, Inc.\nINmune Bio, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapies targeting the innate immune system. INmune Bio is developing two product platforms that reengineer the patient’s innate immune system’s response to their cancer, INKmune and INB03. INKmune is an NK cell therapeutic that primes the patient’s NK cells to attack their cancer. INB03 inhibits myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which often cause resistance to immunotherapy, such as anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors. INmune Bio’s product platforms reprogram the patient’s innate immune system to help it attack their cancer. The platforms can be used alone or as part of combination therapy to treat a variety of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.
