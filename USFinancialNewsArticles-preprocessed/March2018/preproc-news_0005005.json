    "text": "LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Sterling could slump to $1.20 and hit parity with the euro if Britain fails to secure itself a deal with the European Union when departing the bloc, the chief investment officer of Pictet Wealth Management said on Thursday.\n“If there is no deal it (sterling) can really underperform. $1.20 versus the dollar and parity versus the euro,” Cesar Perez Ruiz told journalists. The pound is currently trading at $1.3744 and 88.56 pence per euro.\nThe chairman of European Union leaders, Donald Tusk, will meet May in London on Thursday, a day after the bloc’s Brexit negotiator weakened sterling by issuing another warning to Britain, which is due to leave the bloc in March 2019.\nPictet Wealth manages 200 billion Swiss francs ($211 billion) in assets. ($1 = 0.9463 Swiss francs) (Reporting by Marc Jones Writing by Tommy Wilkes)\n ",
