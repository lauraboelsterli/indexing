    "text": "(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) said on Wednesday that Illinois’ Cook County, which includes the city of Chicago, will extend the property tax deadline for online taxpayers due to a computer glitch at the U.S. bank.\nThe deadline will be pushed to 11:59 p.m. on March 2 for anyone paying the first installment of their 2017 Cook County property tax online, the bank said in a statement.\nAn issue with the bank’s online property tax payment system prevented taxpayers from making payments late on Wednesday morning, JPMorgan said.\nJPMorgan said it was working to restore service as soon as possible.\nA JPMorgan spokeswoman said by email, “We’re long-standing partners with the county and the treasurer’s office and we’ll work with them on solutions to any issues this matter caused.”\nAbout 20 other counties use the service for collecting tax payments but only Cook County has an approaching deadline, she said.\nReporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru and David Henry in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ",
