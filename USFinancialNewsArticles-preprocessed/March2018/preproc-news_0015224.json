    "text": "President Donald Trump‚Äôs top economic advisor, Gary Cohn, plans to resign, marking just the latest departure by a top White House official in recent months.\nThe pending exit, announced on Tuesday , added to the perception of chaos in the Trump Administration, which has careened from leaks about the ongoing Russia investigation to Trump‚Äôs surprise announcement about tariffs to the recent departure of White House communications chief Hope Hicks. Tuesday‚Äôs announcement also set off a huge reaction on Twitter, where Cohn‚Äôs fans and critics chimed in to praise his 14-month tenure or to attack his service.\nCohn, a former Goldman Sachs president who served as Trump‚Äôs Director of the White House National Economic Council, announced the departure just days after reportedly failing to change Trump‚Äôs mind about imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. In terms of policy victories, Cohn played a major role in the recent tax overhaul.\nHere‚Äôs what the Twittersphere had to say:\nCohn‚Äôs former boss, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein\nGary Cohn deserves credit for serving his country in a first class way. I‚Äôm sure I join many others who are disappointed to see him leave.\n‚Äî Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) March 6, 2018\nRepublican strategist and Trump critic Ana Navarro:\nGary Cohn reportedly thought about leaving last year, over Trump‚Äôs response to Charlottesville, equating Neo-Nazis to those protesting against them. But he didn‚Äôt leave then.\nInstead, he left over tariffs. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n‚Äî Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) March 6, 2018\nSatirical news site The Onion:\nGary Cohn Resigns In Protest Of Trump‚Äôs Bigoted Comments Towards Aluminum https://t.co/cm2smdHb0B pic.twitter.com/JoHjOCo1X2\n‚Äî The Onion (@TheOnion) March 6, 2018\nMick Mulvaney, director, White house Office of Management and Budget:\n. @MickMulvaneyOMB 's statement on the departure of Gary Cohn. pic.twitter.com/PgpOH6rcdE\n‚Äî OMB Press (@OMBPress) March 6, 2018\nHoward Fineman, NBCNews.com political commentator:\nYou knew #GaryCohn was leaving once he got vaporized by #Trump on trade. I hear he blamed the new trade policy on the prez‚Äôs being ‚Äúunhinged‚Äù by #Russia probe. This is the most rivalrous, paranoid, amateurish, disloyal & chaotic WH crew in modern times. Who hired them I wonder?\n‚Äî Howard Fineman (@howardfineman) March 6, 2018",
