Belvedere, CNBC Published 1:29 p.m. ET March 1, 2018 | Updated 2:16 p.m. ET March 1, 2018 CLOSE Two years after Alan Greenspan left his nearly 20-year tenure as Federal Reserve Chairman in 2006, one of the biggest financial downturns in history occurred. \"Greenspan went from hero when he was Chairman to zero after the [2008] crisis,\" said Sebastian Mallaby, author of a new biography about Greenspan, titled The Man Who Knew. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook 1995: Alan Greenspan served as Federal Reserve chairman from 1987 to 2006. Before he became the Fed chair, Greenspan and Walters had dated, which she described in her 2008 memoirs, \"Audition.\" (Photo: 1995 photo by Joe Marquette, AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan told CNBC on Thursday the decades-long bull market in bond prices is coming to an end. \"We are in a bond market bubble\" that's beginning to unwind, he said on Squawk on the Street , as new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell appeared on Capitol Hill for the second time this week. \"Prices are too high\" on bonds, Greenspan added. Bond prices move inversely to bond yields, which spiked higher in the new year, recently hitting four-year highs of just under 3%. Greenspan is in good company in predicting a bond price bubble. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, in an interview with Goldman Sachs, predicted a rise in inflation and a surge in the 10-year Treasury yield. Noted bond investor Bill Gross recently said the bear market in bond prices has begun. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday he believes long-term investors should buy stocks over bonds. \"As real long-term interest rates rise, stock prices fall,\" Greenspan said, but added that's probably not the cause of the recent wild market swings. \"The last few weeks are responding to the good part of the tax cut,\" he said, meaning that any tax-cut inspired economic growth could increase inflation, which Wall Street worries could result in the Fed raising rates more aggressively than the projected three hikes for this year to tamp down rising prices and wages. Greenspan said he's optimistic about growth in the short term due to the new GOP tax reform law, particularly the federal corporate rate cut from 35% to 21%. But long term, he said he's \"rather dismal\" due to the \"gradual encroachment of entitlement spending on gross domestic savings,\" which is defined as GDP minus total spending. Powell talked on Thursday about the economy and interest rates before the Senate Banking Committee. On Tuesday, before the House Financial Services Committee, he made it clear the Fed could find reason in growth or inflation to increase rates more than three times this year.",
