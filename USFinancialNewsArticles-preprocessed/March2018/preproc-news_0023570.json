    "text": "(Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group is in talks to sell some or all of its 25 percent stake in Hilton Grand Vacations Inc ( HGV.N ), the timeshare business spun off last year from Hilton Worldwide Holdings ( HLT.N ), the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.\nA HNA Group logo is seen on the building of HNA Plaza in Beijing, China February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee HNA would sell its shares into the open market instead of finding a direct buyer, the report said here , citing people familiar with the matter.\nWhile an announcement could come as soon as this week, HNA’s plans could still change, the report added.\nHNA bought a 25 percent stake in U.S. hotel chain Hilton Worldwide from Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) in 2016. Thanks to that deal, the Chinese firm built similar stakes in Hilton’s two spun-off units — Park Hotels and Hilton Grand Vacations.\nThe Journal’s report comes days after Park Hotels disclosed HNA’s plans to sell some or all of its 25 percent stake in Park.\nHNA’s 25 percent interest in Hilton Grand Vacations is worth more than $1 billion, according to Reuters calculations.\nHNA, an aviation-to-financial services conglomerate, is racing to raise cash following a $50 billion acquisition spree over the past two years.\nIt could make a profit of nearly $570 million on paper from selling its stake in Hilton Grand Vacations, before accounting for leverage that could further boost its gain, the Journal said.\nHNA did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment outside regular business hours. Hilton Grand Vacations declined to comment.\nReporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ",
