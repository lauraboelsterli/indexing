FILE PHOTO - Mar 4, 2018; Mexico City, MEX; Shubhankar Sharma watches his shot from the seventh tee during the final round of the WGC - Mexico Championship golf tournament at Club de Golf Chapultepec. Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports Sharma, who led last week’s WGC-Mexico Championship after three rounds before finishing in a share of ninth, will become the fourth Indian player to compete in the year’s first major, following Jeev Milkha Singh, Arjun Atwal and Anirban Lahiri. “Golf is a global game, and throughout our history we have extended invitations to deserving international players not otherwise qualified,” Fred Ridley, Chairman of Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament, said in a statement. “As his results have proven, Shubhankar Sharma is a remarkable young player, and we look forward to welcoming him to Augusta National in April.” The 21-year-old Indian, who is ranked 66th in the world, has won twice in the past four months, at the European Tour’s Joburg Open in December and the Maybank Championship in February. The Masters will be played from April 5-8. Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Toby Davis",
