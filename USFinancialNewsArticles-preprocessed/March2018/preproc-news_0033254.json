    "text": "March 18, 2018 / 6:13 PM / in 8 minutes UPDATE 1-  -sources Reuters Staff (Adds background on the companies) By Mike Stone and Greg Roumeliotis March 18   has offered to merge with larger peer CSRA Inc,   Corp, people familiar with the matter said. The   shares have jumped by more than a fifth in the last four months, emboldening the Arlington, Virginia-based company to use its currency to pursue a transformative deal, the three sources said on Sunday. CACI has a market capitalization of $3.9 billion, compared with CSRA’s $6.7 billion. CACI’s   CACI   CACI, CSRA and General Dynamics did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on CACI’s offer for CSRA earlier on Sunday. CSRA provides information technology and related services to the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. General Dynamics is hoping that CSRA will help it grab more of the recently increased U.S. defense budget. Under the terms of their deal, CSRA would have to pay General Dynamics a $204 million breakup fee to do a deal with someone else. CACI has also been seeking to build scale through dealmaking. In 2016, it acquired the government services division of L3 Technologies Inc for $550 million in cash. It also made an unsuccessful offer to merge with Lockheed Martin Corp’s government information technology and services businesses. Other recent deals in the sector include U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp’s agreement last September to buy Orbital ATK Inc for about $7.8 billion, a deal that gives it greater access to lucrative government contracts and expands its arsenal of missile defense systems and space rockets.
