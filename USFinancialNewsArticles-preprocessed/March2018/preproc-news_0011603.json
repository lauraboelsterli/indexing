REUTERS/Jean-Pierre Amet The decision follows discussions with new Dutch coach Ronald Koeman, who went to see him in Qatar, the Dutch football association KNVB said in a statement. “Wesley is one of the best Dutch internationals in recent years, an amazing player with a great attitude. But I want to build a new team and therefore have to make choices,” Koeman said in the statement. The 33-year-old Sneijder said he knew his international career would be in jeopardy when he left Nice in January to play at Al Gharafa in Qatar. “On top of that I understand that Koeman wants to start a new era with newer, younger players. We spoke about this openly in a friendly discussion and I respect his decision,” Sneijder said. The KNVB said they would now discuss with Sneijder a possible role for him in the national team structures once he stopped playing and had achieved the necessary coaching qualifications. Sneijder last June set a new record for most caps by a Dutch international when he played for a 131st time and his 133rd and last cap came in November’s 3-0 away win against Romania in a friendly. He made his debut in 2003 and was a World Cup runner-up in South Africa in 2010. Reporting by Mark Gleeson; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly",
