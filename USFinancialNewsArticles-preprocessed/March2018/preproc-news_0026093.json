Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “continue” or other similar words or terms. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Board’s plans to consider whether to declare preferred and common dividends quarterly. Such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies that may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations, intentions, beliefs, strategies or predictions of the future expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and contingencies include, but are not limited to, whether the Board will continue to declare dividends on RAIT’s preferred shares or continue to suspend the declaration of the dividend on RAIT’s common shares based on its analysis of RAIT’s financial position, liquidity and capital resources at the relevant time; RAIT’s ability to meet New York Stock Exchange continued listing standards; whether RAIT will be able to implement actions that will increase RAIT’s liquidity and better position RAIT to meet its financial obligations as they come due and to continue to operate as a going concern; whether RAIT will be able to obtain sufficient liquidity through distributions from its consolidated securitizations and servicing and managing RAIT’s existing commercial real estate loan portfolio to better position RAIT to meet its financial obligations as they come due; whether RAIT will be able to continue to divest RAIT’s legacy real estate owned portfolio and existing property management operations and the majority of RAIT’s non-lending assets and repay any related debt and generate additional liquidity; final accounting determinations on gains or losses realized in the event properties are sold or divested for prices that differ from their carrying value or if property valuations are adjusted in the process of revaluating properties when they are characterized as held for sale; RAIT’s ability to attract and retain members of its management team and key employees; and other factors described in RAIT’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings with the SEC.
