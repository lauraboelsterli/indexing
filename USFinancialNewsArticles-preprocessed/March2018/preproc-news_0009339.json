This will play out as long as it doesn’t start to escalate and investors will start to focus back on the strengthening global economy,” said Arian Vojdani, investment strategist at MV Financial in Bethesda, Maryland.\nAt 11:09 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.33 percent, at 24,618.74.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.40 percent to 2,702.12 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 percent to 7,279.45.\nShares of Clearside Biomedical jumped 43 percent after the drug developer’s eye drug met the main goal in a late-stage study, while Dermira plunged 63 percent after the company abandoned its acne drug.\nEurope’s second-biggest insurer XL Group Ltd rose 30 percent after being acquired by France’s AXA for $15.3 billion.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,408 to 1,355. On the Nasdaq, 1,369 issues fell and 1,350 advanced. (Reporting by Ankur Banerjee and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham and Sriraj Kalluvila)\n ",
