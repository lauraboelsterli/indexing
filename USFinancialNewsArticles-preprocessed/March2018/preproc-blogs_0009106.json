    "text": "GRAINS-Wheat firms, holds near 7-mth top on U.S. dry weather woes Published 8:52 PM ET Tue, 27 Feb 2018 Reuters \nSYDNEY, Feb 28 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat edged higher on Wednesday to linger near a seven-month high as dry weather across a key U.S. producing region threatens curb crops, already damaged by recent adverse weather. \nFUNDAMENTALS \n* The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 0.2 percent to $4.78 a bushel by 0120 GMT, having closed up 0.9 percent on Tuesday when prices hit a high of $4.79 a bushel - the highest since July 31, 2017. \n* The most active soybean futures were up 0.3 percent to $10.52-1/2 a bushel, having closed up 0.3 percent on Tuesday. \n* The most active corn futures were unchanged at $3.70-1/2 a bushel, having gained 0.5 percent in the previous session. \n* U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday rated the wheat crop in top growing state Kansas at only 12 percent in good to excellent condition, down 2 points from a month ago. \n* Wheat ratings also declined in Oklahoma, Montana, the Dakotas, Nebraska and Colorado. \n* Severe cold in Europe this week was also keeping attention on weather risks, although snow cover was expected to limit the impact of deep frosts in top wheat exporter Russia. \n* Soybeans draw support from scant rainfall in Argentina that continued to threaten harvest prospects in the No. 3 global producer after Brazil and the United States. \n* However, the impact on global supply could be curbed by Brazil's harvest which some forecasters expect to set a record volume. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The dollar stood near a three-week high against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's upbeat views on the economy bolstered bets on further Fed interest rate hikes this year. \n* U.S. oil prices extended declines into a second day after industry data showed an increase in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles, with surging production in the country hampering OPEC attempts to end a global glut. \n* U.S. stocks suffered on Tuesday their biggest daily drops since the selloff three weeks ago, after the Fed chairman's comments. \nDATA/EVENT AHEAD (GMT) \n0100 China Official manufacturing PMI Feb 0100 China Official non-manufacturing PMI Feb 0700 Germany GfK consumer sentiment Mar 0745 France Consumer spending Jan 0745 France Detailed GDP Q4 \nGrains prices at 0120 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 478.00 1.00 +0.21% +1.11% 460.63 65 CBOT corn 370.50 0.00 +0.00% +0.54% 361.96 70 CBOT soy 1052.50 3.00 +0.29% +0.62% 1012.59 80 CBOT rice 12.18 $0.02 +0.16% +0.70% $12.42 39 WTI crude 62.60 -$0.41 -0.65% -2.05% $63.13 53 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.223 $0.000 -0.02% -0.71% USD/AUD 0.7787 0.000 -0.03% -0.85% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
