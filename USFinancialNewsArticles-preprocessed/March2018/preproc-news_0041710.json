    "text": "The craze over the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies isn't just limited to traders. It's also spread to college campuses nationwide.\nCornell, Carnegie Mellon, Duke, MIT and Stanford are just a few of the elite universities offering courses in cryptocurrencies and blockchain, the technology underlying them.\n\"Blockchains have created a sea change in the relationship between academia and industry,\" said Ari Juels, a Cornell University professor and co-director of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts .\n\"Suddenly topics that were once of purely academic interest have become an integral part of the latest technologies and systems, a phenomenon that has drawn academic researchers into the vortex of change.\"\nThe courses are often jam-packed, and most have waiting lists. At U.C. Berkeley, \"Blockchain, Cryptoeconomics, and the Future of Technology, Business, and Law,\" is the first course cross-listed in three departments: engineering, law and business.\nBesides offering the graduate-level course, the university also boasts a robust student group, Blockchain at Berkeley. Membership to the club is in such high demand that students go through a three-round application process, and only 4 percent were accepted in the last application window. Students in the club work for Fortune 500 companies like Airbus and Qualcomm. One group within the club even formed a hedge fund, which has raised $20 million.\nStill, most students say they're not driven by the financial prospects of blockchain. Rather, students like Noah Johnson, a 6th year Ph.D candidate, says he wants to make a difference: \"I'm more motivated by building something that will change the world.\"",
