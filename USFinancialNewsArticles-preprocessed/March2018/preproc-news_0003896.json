    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Halcón Resources Corporation (NYSE:HK) (“Halcón” or the “Company”) today announced its fourth quarter 2017 results and provided an update on recent well results and operations.\nNet production for the three months ended December 31, 2017 averaged 6,283 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d). Production was comprised of 70% oil, 15% natural gas liquids (NGLs) and 15% natural gas for the quarter.\nHalcón generated total revenues of $25.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company reported a net loss available to common stockholders of $(93.1) million or a net loss per basic and diluted share of $(0.63) for the fourth quarter of 2017. After adjusting for selected items (see Selected Item Review and Reconciliation table for additional information), the Company generated a net loss of $(18.1) million, or $(0.12) per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (see EBITDA Reconciliation table for additional information) totaled $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nExcluding the impact of hedges, Halcón realized 95% of the average NYMEX oil price, 47% of the average NYMEX oil price for NGLs and 71% of the average NYMEX natural gas price during the fourth quarter of 2017. Realized hedge proceeds totaled approximately $0.6 million during the fourth quarter.\nTotal operating costs per unit, after adjusting for selected items (see Selected Operating Data table for additional information), were $41.08 per Boe for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $19.30 per Boe for the third quarter of 2017. This increase in per unit total operating costs was primarily driven by the loss of economies of scale related to reduced quarterly production driven by the Company’s divestiture of its Williston Basin assets.\nAcquisitions\nAs previously reported, in December 2017, the Company acquired 4,413 net acres adjacent to its Monument Draw area for approximately $104 million. In January 2018, Halcón closed on the acquisition of 8,320 net acres in its Monument Draw north option for $108 million (the “Monument Draw North Option”). On February 6, 2018, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to purchase 10,524 net acres and ~1,100 Boe/d of associated current production in Western Ward County for $200 million (the “West Quito Draw Acquisition”). The West Quito Draw Acquisition is expected to close in early April 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Spending\nAs of December 31, 2017, Halcón’s liquidity was $678 million pro forma for the January 2018 exercise of the Monument Draw North Option ($108 million) in addition to the Company’s net proceeds from the February 2018 offering of common stock ($61 million) and unsecured notes ($203 million). This liquidity consists of $580 million of pro forma cash on hand plus an undrawn senior secured revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of $100 million less letters of credit outstanding.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Halcón incurred capital costs of approximately $94 million on drilling and completions and $37 million on infrastructure, seismic and other.\nHedging Update\nAs of February 28, 2018, Halcón had 9,510 barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil hedged for 2018 at an average price of $52.65 per barrel. For 2019, the Company has 8,247 bbl/d of oil hedged at an average price of $54.41 per barrel. Halcón also has Midland vs. Cushing basis differential swaps in place for 10,526 bbl/d in 2018 at an average swap price of -$1.23 per barrel and 12,000 bbl/d in 2019 at an average swap price of -$1.02 per barrel.\nAs of February 28, 2018, Halcón had 7,500 MMBtu/d of natural gas hedged in 2018 at an average price of $3.16 per MMBtu. The Company had WAHA vs. NYMEX basis differential swaps in place for 5,000 MMBtu/d for the second half of 2018 through year-end 2019 at an average swap price of -$1.05 per MMBtu/d.\nOperations Update\nHalcón is currently producing in excess of 12,000 Boe/d net. The Company expects first quarter 2018 production to average between 10,500 and 11,500 Boe/d net. Halcón is currently running three operated rigs in the Delaware Basin and is considering adding a fourth rig later in 2018 to focus on West Quito Draw once that acquisition closes. The Company also has one full-time frac crew operating which will continue to work for Halcón for the remainder of 2018. Halcón also plans to source a spot frac crew from time to time in 2018 to ensure its drilled but uncompleted well inventory stays at reasonable levels.\nHalcón currently holds 21,679 net acres in its Monument Draw area in addition to an option to acquire an additional 7,680 net acres on the eastern side of its acreage (the “East Option Acreage”). The Company has five horizontal lower Wolfcamp wells producing in this area with two additional wells currently being drilled. Halcón recently put the SR7902H and SR7903H lower Wolfcamp wells online. These wells are located in the southern portion of Halcón’s Monument Draw acreage and were completed with an average lateral length of 9,524 feet. These two wells averaged a peak 24 hour IP rate of 1,817 Boe/d and have a current average 20 day IP rate of 1,593 Boe/d (81% oil) which continues to increase. This well is located on the Company’s East Option Acreage and was completed with a lateral length of 9,267 feet. This well had a peak 24 hour IP rate of 1,863 Boe/d and has a current 10 day IP rate of 1,100 Boe/d (87% oil) which continues to increase.\nHalcón currently holds 27,035 net acres in its Hackberry Draw area. Since acquiring most of this acreage in early 2017, the Company has drilled and completed 10 horizontal wells (nine Wolfcamp and one 3rd Bone Spring). Halcón currently has one well waiting on completion and three additional wells currently being drilled in Hackberry Draw (two Wolfcamp and one 2nd Bone Spring well). The Company’s two most recent Wolfcamp wells put online, the Jose Katie East 1H and the Jose Katie West 1H, were completed with an average lateral length of 9,817 feet. These two wells averaged a peak 24 hour IP rate of 1,341 Boe/d and have a current 20 day IP rate of 1,071 Boe/d (86% oil) which continues to increase. The early time production of these wells is greater than Halcón’s Wolfcamp type curve for this area. These two wells are spaced at 660' in the Wolfcamp B interval. Early time results here also indicate a positive test at this spacing interval.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nHalcón Resources Corporation (NYSE:HK) has scheduled a conference call for Thursday, March 1, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. EST (10:00 a.m. CST).

Forward-looking statements may often, but not always, be identified by the use of such words such as \"expects\", \"believes\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\", \"plans\", \"estimates\", “projects”, \"potential\", \"possible\", or \"probable\" or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"will\", \"should\", or \"could\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations and involve certain assumptions or estimates that involve various risks and uncertainties that could reflected in the statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, those set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and other filings submitted by the Company to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), copies of which may be obtained from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or through the Company's website at www.halconresources.com .

These quantities do not constitute “reserves” the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System or SEC rules and are subject to substantially greater uncertainties relating to recovery than reserves. For areas where the Company has no or very limited operating history, EURs are based on publicly available information relating to operations of producers operating in such areas. For areas where the Company has sufficient operating data to make its own estimates, EURs are based on internal estimates by the Company’s management and reserve engineers.\nHALCÓN RESOURCES CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts) Successor Successor Predecessor Period from Period from September 10, 2016 January 1, 2016 Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended through through 2017 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 September 9, 2016 Operating revenues: Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids sales: Oil $ 21,202 $ 118,526 $ 340,674 $ 139,786 $ 248,064 Natural gas 1,143 5,933 16,194 6,756 9,511 Natural gas liquids 2,190 5,220 18,969 6,018 7,929 Total oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids sales 24,535 129,679 375,837 152,560 265,504 Other 742 576 2,128 802 1,339 Total operating revenues 25,277 130,255 377,965 153,362 266,843 Operating expenses: Production: Lease operating 2,921 18,591 61,743 22,382 50,032 Workover and other (474 ) 8,945 21,739 10,510 22,507 Taxes other than income 1,608 10,191 30,757 12,364 24,453 Gathering and other 6,143 12,040 40,783 14,677 29,279 Restructuring 5,455 -

(3) For illustrative purposes, the Company has combined the Successor and Predecessor results to derive combined results for the year ended December 31, 2016. The combination was generated by addition of comparable financial statement line items. However, because of various adjustments to the consolidated financial statements in connection with the application of fresh-start reporting, including asset valuation adjustments and liability adjustments, the results of operations for the Successor may not be comparable to those of the Predecessor. The financial information preceding the table above provides the Successor and the Predecessor GAAP results for the applicable periods. The Company believes that subject to consideration of the impact of fresh-start reporting, combining the results of the Predecessor and Successor provide meaningful information about, for instance, production, revenues and costs, that assist a reader in understanding the Company’s financial results for the applicable periods.\nHALCÓN RESOURCES CORPORATION SELECTED ITEM REVIEW AND RECONCILIATION (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts) Successor Successor Predecessor Period from Period from September 10, 2016 January 1, 2016 Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended through through 2017 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 September 9, 2016 As Reported: Net income (loss) available to common stockholders, as reported $ (93,130 ) $ (28,501 ) $ 487,679 $ (479,984 ) $ (32,794 ) Non-cash preferred dividend - - 48,007 - - Series A preferred dividends - - - - 8,847 Preferred dividends and accretion on redeemable noncontrolling interest - - - 791 35,905 Net income (loss) $ (93,130 ) $ (28,501 ) $ 535,686 $ (479,193 ) $ 11,958 Impact of Selected Items: Unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives contracts: Crude oil $ 27,844 $ 81,335 $ 17,740 $ 111,658 $ 262,813 Natural gas (366 ) 776 (1,272 ) 791 919 Total mark-to-market non-cash charge 27,478 82,111 16,468 112,449 263,732 Full cost ceiling impairment - - - 420,934 754,769 (Gain) loss on sale of oil and natural gas properties 5,947 - (721,573 ) - - Other operating property and equipment impairment - - - - 28,056 Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt 28,866 - 114,931 - (81,434 ) Deferred financing costs expensed, net (1) 232 - 537 - 3,582 Reorganization items - 1,493 - 2,049 (913,722 ) Restructuring 5,455 - 7,535 - 5,168 Rig termination / stacking charges, key employee retention agreements, transaction costs and other 7,099 5,519 26,973 6,443 40,689 Selected items, before income taxes 75,077 89,123 (555,129 ) 541,875 100,840 Income tax effect of selected items (2) - - - - - Selected items, net of tax $ 75,077 $ 89,123 $ (555,129 ) $ 541,875 $ 100,840 As Adjusted: Net income (loss) available to common stockholders, excluding selected items $ (18,053 ) $ 60,622 $ (19,443 ) $ 62,682 $ 112,798 Net income (loss) from assumed conversions - - - - 10,778 Net income (loss) available to common stockholders after assumed conversions, excluding selected items (3) $ (18,053 ) $ 60,622 $ (19,443 ) $ 62,682 $ 123,576 Basic net income (loss) per common share, as reported $ (0.63 ) $ (0.31 ) $ 3.67 $ (5.26 ) $ (0.27 ) Impact of selected items 0.51 0.97 (3.82 ) 5.95 1.21 Basic net income (loss) per common share, excluding selected items (3) $ (0.12 ) $ 0.66 $ (0.15 ) $ 0.69 $ 0.94 Diluted net income (loss) per common share, as reported $ (0.63 ) $ (0.31 ) $ 3.65 $ (5.26 ) $ (0.27 ) Impact of selected items 0.51 0.97 (3.80 ) 5.95 1.13 Diluted net income (loss) per common share, excluding selected items (3)(4) $ (0.12 ) $ 0.66 $ (0.15 ) $ 0.69 $ 0.86 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 12,369 $ 90,814 $ 114,591 $ 103,136 $ 175,348 Changes in working capital, net of acquisitions (29,117 ) (1,057 ) (21,793 ) (12,404 ) 1,733 Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital (16,748 ) 89,757 92,798 90,732 177,081 Cash components of selected items 13,125 19,338 36,679 42,953 66,092 Income tax effect of selected items (2) - - - - - Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital, adjusted for selected items (3) $ (3,623 ) $ 109,095 $ 129,477 $ 133,685 $ 243,173 (1) Represents charges related to the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the revolving credit facility. (2) For the 2017 and 2016 columns, this represents tax impact using an estimated tax rate of 0.0% due to the Company maintaining a full valuation allowance. (3) Net income (loss) and earnings per share excluding selected items and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital adjusted for selected items are non- GAAP measures presented based on management's belief that they will enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. Additional ly, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods. These financial measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, earnings per share and cash flow from operations, as defined by GAAP. These financial measures may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures that other companies may use and may not be useful in comparing the performance of those companies to Halcón's perf ormance. (4) The impact of selected items for the three months ended and year ended December 31, 2017 was calculated based upon weighted average diluted shares of 148.5 millio n and 132.8 million, respectively, due to the net loss available to common stockholders excluding selected items. The impact of selected items for the three months ended December 31, 2016, the period of September 10, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the period of January 1, 2016 through September 9, 2016 was calculated based upon weighted average diluted sh ares of 91.5 million, 91.3 million and 144.3 million, respectively, due to the net income available to common stockholders, excluding selected items.\nHALCÓN RESOURCES CORPORATION EBITDA RECONCILIATION (Unaudited) (In thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (2) Net income (loss), as reported $ (93,130 ) $ (28,501 ) $ 535,686 $ (467,235 ) Impact of adjusting items: Interest expense 8,383 23,126 74,524 152,477 Depletion, depreciation and accretion 9,419 37,848 110,207 167,454 Full cost ceiling impairment - - - 1,175,703 Other operating property and equipment impairment - - - 28,056 Income tax provision (benefit) - 1,387 (5,000 ) (3,922 ) Stock-based compensation 3,209 8,323 36,757 26,395 Interest income (1,404 ) (3 ) (2,255 ) (36 ) (Gain) loss on sale of other assets 102 276 (253 ) 706 Restructuring 5,455 - 7,535 5,168 Reorganization items - 1,493 - (911,673 ) Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt 28,866 - 114,931 (81,434 ) (Gain) loss on sale of oil and natural gas properties 5,947 - (721,573 ) - Loss (gain) on mark-to-market of embedded derivative and tranche rights - - - (5,734 ) Unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives contracts 27,478 82,111 16,468 376,181 Write-off of deferred loan costs 232 - 537 3,582 Rig termination / stacking charges 966 3,003 6,825 12,467 Transaction costs, key employee retention agreements and other 6,662 2,516 20,677 40,399 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 2,185 $ 131,579 $ 195,066 $ 518,554 (1) Adjusted EBITDA are non-gaap measures.

(2) For illustrative purposes, the Company has combined the Successor and Predecessor results to derive combined results for the year ended December 31, 2016. The combination was generated by addition of comparable financial statement line items. However, because of various adjustments to the consolidated financial statements in connection with the application of fresh-start reporting, including asset valuation adjustments and liability adjustments, the results of operations for the Successor may not be comparable to those of the Predecessor.
