    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Affinion Group Holdings, Inc. (\"Affinion Holdings\" or the \"Company\"), a global leader in loyalty and customer engagement, announced today the financial results for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 (the \"fourth quarter\" or \"quarter\" and \"full year,\" respectively).\nKey Highlights\nNet revenues were $231.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $953.1 million for the full year. Income from operations was $37.0 million in the fourth quarter and $140.8 million for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Note (d) of Table 6) was $58.5 million in the fourth quarter and $235.2 million for the full year.\n\"During the fourth quarter, we saw solid results across our core businesses, highlighted by 23% revenue growth in our Global Loyalty segment and 7% Adjusted EBITDA growth in our core businesses,\" said Todd Siegel, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. \"Over the past year, we have positioned ourselves with a solid foundation for long-term success. We have capitalized on the positive momentum in the Global Loyalty segment, continued to make significant investments in our technology platform and data analytics capabilities, and simplified our capital structure and extended debt maturities.\"\n\"For 2018, we are focused on continued growth in our core businesses, led by new client launches in our Global Loyalty segment and engagement solutions platform business, and continued solid performance in Insurance,\" continued Siegel. \"Given the positive trends we see in the marketplace, we anticipate continued earnings growth in our core businesses, as compared to 2017 results.\"\nResults Highlights\nNotes: Adjusted EBITDA as referred to above excludes any pro forma impact of acquisitions and other actions. See Table 5 for a complete description of Adjusted EBITDA by segment and the related reconciliations to GAAP measures. See Table 6 for a complete description of Adjusted EBITDA and the related reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nFourth Quarter Net Revenues\nNet revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 0.4%, from $232.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $231.5 million. The decrease in overall net revenues was primarily due to the expected revenue declines in our non-core Legacy Membership and Package segment, mostly offset by higher Global Loyalty revenue. Net revenues for the three core business segments (Global Loyalty, Global Customer Engagement and Insurance Solutions) for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 5.1%, from $191.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $201.3 million. Net revenues for the Legacy Membership and Package segment decreased 26.7%, from $41.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $30.2 million.\nFourth Quarter Operating Results\nIncome from operations was $37.0 million as compared to $27.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Note (d) of Table 6) was $58.5 million as compared to $55.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.0%. Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note (1) of Table 5) increased $6.5 million primarily as a result of lower marketing and commission expenses and lower general and administrative expenses, which were partially offset by lower net revenues. Segment EBITDA for the three core business segments (Global Loyalty, Global Customer Engagement and Insurance Solutions) increased $3.2 million primarily due to an increase in Global Loyalty and Insurance Solutions Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA for the Legacy Membership and Package segment increased $2.8 million as the lower net revenues were more than offset by lower marketing and commissions and lower operating and general and administrative costs. As compared to Segment EBITDA, fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA reflects the exclusion of, among other items, $3.3 million in costs related primarily to restructuring of certain operations including related severance costs, $1.1 million related to facility exit costs, $0.7 million in costs related to certain litigation matters, and $0.7 million of stock compensation expense.\nFull Year Net Revenues\nNet revenues for 2017 decreased 1.7%, from $969.4 million in 2016 to $953.1 million. The decrease in overall net revenues was primarily due to the expected revenue declines in our non-core Legacy Membership and Package segment and lower revenues in our Global Customer Engagement segment, partially offset by higher Global Loyalty revenue. Net revenues for the three core business segments for 2017 increased 4.2%, from $781.1 million in 2016 to $813.7 million. Net revenues for the Legacy Membership and Package segment decreased 26.4%, from $189.4 million in 2016 to $139.4 million.\nFull Year Operating Results\nIncome from operations was $140.8 million as compared to $133.0 million for 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $235.2 million as compared to $235.0 million for 2016, an increase of 0.1%. Segment EBITDA decreased $2.1 million primarily as a result of lower net revenues and higher operating costs, which were partially offset by lower marketing and commissions and lower general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA for the three core business segments decreased $7.4 million primarily due to a decrease in Global Customer Engagement Segment EBITDA, partially offset by an increase in Global Loyalty Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA for the Legacy Membership and Package segment decreased $1.0 million as the lower net revenues were mostly offset by lower marketing and commissions and lower operating and general and administrative costs including cost savings initiatives. As compared to Segment EBITDA, full year Adjusted EBITDA reflects the exclusion of, among other items, a $23.2 million charge recorded in relation to the external gift card inventory cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017, $12.0 million in costs related primarily to restructuring of certain operations including related severance costs, $4.4 million in costs related to certain litigation matters, $2.8 million of stock compensation expense, and $1.2 million related to facility exit costs.\nSegment Commentary\nGlobal Loyalty net revenues increased by $10.1 million, or 22.9%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 to $54.3 million as compared to $44.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and increased $58.1 million, or 34.8%, from $167.0 million to $225.1 million for the full year. Global Loyalty net revenues increased for the quarter and the full year primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients.\nGlobal Loyalty Segment EBITDA increased by $2.4 million to $17.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $15.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and increased by $7.6 million to $64.0 million from $56.4 million for the full year. For the quarter, Global Loyalty Segment EBITDA increased as the impact of the higher net revenue was partially offset by higher servicing costs, including the opening of an additional call center in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the impact of the higher net revenue was partially offset by higher servicing costs and a charge of $23.2 million recorded in relation to the external gift card inventory cyber theft that occurred in the first quarter of 2017.\nGlobal Customer Engagement net revenues decreased by $1.0 million, or 1.1%, to $90.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $91.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and decreased $27.0 million, or 7.0%, from $386.3 million to $359.3 million for the full year. Net revenues decreased for the quarter primarily as a result of lower net revenues in our revenue enhancement business. For the full year, net revenues decreased primarily from lower net revenues in our engagement solutions business principally due to the timing of product launches with new clients, lower revenue in our revenue enhancement business, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.\nGlobal Customer Engagement Segment EBITDA decreased by $0.4 million to $15.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $16.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and decreased by $15.4 million to $55.7 million from $71.1 million for the full year. For the quarter, Global Customer Engagement Segment EBITDA decreased as the lower net revenues were partially offset by lower operating expenses. For the full year, lower net revenues and higher general and administrative expenses were partially offset by lower marketing and commission expense and lower operating costs.\nInsurance Solutions net revenues increased by $0.7 million, or 1.3%, to $56.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $55.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and increased $1.5 million, or 0.7%, from $227.8 million to $229.3 million for the full year. Insurance Solutions net revenues increased for the quarter primarily due to a slightly lower claims experience partially offset by lower average supplemental insureds. For the full year, net revenues increased as the impact from lower average supplemental insureds was more than offset by an increase in the average revenue per supplemental insured along with slightly lower claims experience.\nInsurance Solutions Segment EBITDA increased by $1.2 million to $17.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $16.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and increased by $0.4 million to $78.3 million from $77.9 million for the full year. Insurance Solutions Segment EBITDA increased for the quarter primarily due to higher net revenues and slightly lower operating expenses. For the full year, the impact of higher net revenues was mostly offset by an increase in operating expenses.\nLegacy Membership and Package net revenues decreased by $11.0 million, or 26.7%, to $30.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $41.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and decreased by $50.0 million, or 26.4%, from $189.4 million to $139.4 million for the full year. Legacy Membership and Package net revenues decreased for both the quarter and the full year primarily due to the expected attrition of legacy members and cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with partners, including large financial institutions, as well as a decline in package revenue primarily due to the impact of lower average package members.\nLegacy Membership and Package Segment EBITDA increased by $2.8 million to $11.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $8.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and decreased by $1.0 million to $39.9 million from $40.9 million for the full year. Legacy Membership and Package Segment EBITDA increased for the quarter as the impact from lower net revenues was more than offset by lower general and administrative expenses, lower marketing and commission expense and lower operating costs. For the full year, Segment EBITDA decreased as the impact from lower net revenues was partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses, lower marketing and commission expense and lower operating costs.\nCorporate costs include certain departmental service costs such as human resources, legal, corporate finance and accounting functions, and unallocated portions of information technology. Expenses, such as professional fees related to debt financing activities and stock compensation costs, are also recorded in corporate. Corporate costs decreased by $0.5 million to $13.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $13.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and decreased by $6.3 million from $56.6 million to $50.3 million for the full year.\nSelected Liquidity Data\nAt December 31, 2017, there was $1,300.8 million of Affinion Group, Inc.'s term loans outstanding (net of discounts) and $572.4 million (net of discounts) outstanding under Affinion Group, Inc.'s senior cash 12.5%/PIK step-up to 15.5% notes due 2022.\nAt December 31, 2017, there were outstanding borrowings of $52.6 million (net of discounts) against Affinion Group, Inc.'s revolving credit facility and $50.0 million of Affinion Group, Inc.'s credit facility was available for borrowing, after giving effect to the issuance of $5.0 million of letters of credit.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Affinion Group, Inc. was in compliance with the restrictive covenants under Affinion Group Inc.'s debt agreements.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, Affinion Holdings' net cash provided by operating activities was $7.0 million and the net loss attributable to Affinion Holdings was $25.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, Affinion Holdings had $39.8 million of unrestricted cash on hand.\nConference Call Information\nAffinion Holdings will hold an informational call to discuss the results for the quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. (ET) on Thursday, March 1, 2018.

Gross Transactional Sales Volume per Transaction is calculated by taking the Gross Transactional Sales Volume reported for the period and dividing it by the total transactions for the same period.\n(2)\nAverage Subscribers, Average Supplemental Insureds and Average Legacy Members for the period are all calculated by determining the average subscribers, insureds or members, as applicable, for each month in the period (adding the number of subscribers, insureds or members, as applicable, at the beginning of the month with the number of subscribers, insureds or members, as applicable, at the end of the month and dividing that total by two) and then averaging that result for the period. A subscriber's, insured's or member's, as applicable, account is added or removed in the period in which the subscriber, insured or member, as applicable, has joined or cancelled.\n(3)\nAnnualized Net Revenue per Average Subscriber, Supplemental Insured and Legacy Member are all calculated by taking the revenues from subscribers or insureds, as applicable, for the period and dividing it by the average subscribers or insureds, as applicable, for the period. Quarterly periods are then multiplied by four to annualize this amount for comparative purposes. Upon cancellation of a subscriber or an insured, as applicable, the subscriber's or insured's, as applicable, revenues are no longer recognized in the calculation.\nTABLE 5\nAFFINION GROUP HOLDINGS,

Segment EBITDA is the measure management uses to evaluate segment performance and we present Segment EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. We use Segment EBITDA as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe that Segment EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, Segment EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Segment EBITDA as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. For a reconciliation of Affinion Holdings' consolidated net income (loss) attributable for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to Affinion Holdings' Segment EBITDA, see Table 6.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA for each segment provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze performance period to period, to analyze a company's ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparisons among companies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA also provides additional supplemental information to compare results among our segments. However, Adjusted EBITDA by segment is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA by segment may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA by segment as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. For a discussion of the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Affinion Group Holdings, Inc., see Table 6.\nTABLE 6\nAFFINION GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (UNAUDITED)\n(In millions)\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of Affinion Holdings' consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Affinion Group Holdings, Inc. for the years and three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to Affinion Holdings' Adjusted EBITDA.\nFor the Year Ended\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(in millions)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Affinion Group Holdings, Inc.\n$\n(25.2)\n$\n15.7\n$\n3.3\n$\n(1.5)\nInterest expense, net\n186.2\n109.4\n57.8\n27.4\nIncome tax expense\n(17.9)\n7.4\n(24.3)\n1.7\nNon-controlling interest\n0.8\n0.6\n0.1\n0.1\nOther (income) expense, net\n0.4\n(0.1)\n0.1\n(0.1)\nGain on extinguishment of debt\n(3.5)\n—\n—\n—\nDepreciation and amortization\n46.8\n56.7\n11.9\n14.8\nBusiness optimization expenses and restructuring charges or expenses (a)\n16.2\n14.4\n5.6\n3.0\nExtraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges (b)\n27.9\n25.4\n1.0\n8.1\nOther, net (c)\n3.5\n5.5\n3.0\n2.2\nAdjusted EBITDA, excluding pro forma adjustments (d)(e)\n235.2\n$\n235.0\n$\n58.5\n$\n55.7\nEffect of the pro forma adjustments (f)\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA, including pro forma adjustments (g)\n$\n235.2\n(a)\nRepresents the elimination of the effect of business optimization expenses and restructuring charges or expenses.\n(b)\nRepresents the elimination of extraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges.\n(c)\nPrimarily represents the elimination of (i) net changes in certain reserves, (ii) share-based compensation expense and (iii) foreign currency gains and losses related to unusual, non-recurring intercompany transactions.\n(d)\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of income from operations before depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude non-cash and unusual items and other adjustments permitted in our debt agreements to test the permissibility of certain types of transactions, including debt incurrence. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and as a basis for determining payment of bonuses under our annual incentive plan. We present Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
