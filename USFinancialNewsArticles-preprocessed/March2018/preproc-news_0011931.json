Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including future financial and operating results. Actual results, including with respect to our targets and prospects, could differ materially due to a number of factors, including the possibility that anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction will not be realized; the risk that we may not obtain sufficient orders to achieve our targeted revenues; price competition in key markets; the risk that our results will suffer if we are unable to balance fluctuations in customer demand and capacity; the risk that we are not able to enter into contractual arrangements with the customers of the acquired business; risks associated with acquisitions generally; the risk that we are not able to develop and expand customer bases and accurately anticipate demand from end customers, which can result in increased inventory and reduced orders as we experience wide fluctuations in supply and demand; our ability to lower costs; product mix; risks associated with our ability to complete development and commercialization of products under development; risks associated with the ramp-up of production of new products and our entry into new business channels; the rapid development of new technology and competing products that may impair demand or render our products obsolete; the potential lack of customer acceptance for our products; and other factors discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2017, and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements represent Cree's judgment as of the date of this release. Except as required under the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, Cree disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this release, whether as a result of new information, future events, developments, changes in assumptions or otherwise.\nCree ® is a registered trademark and Wolfspeed ™ is a trademark of Cree, Inc.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306005988/en/\nCree, Inc.\nClaire Simmons, 919-407-7844\nCorporate Marketing\nmedia@cree.com\nor\nInfineon Technologies AG\nBernd Hops, +49 89 234 23888\nBernd.Hops@infineon.com\nor\nInfineon Technologies Americas Corp.\nSian Cummings, +1-310-252-7148\nSian.Cummings@infineon.com\nSource: Cree, Inc.",
