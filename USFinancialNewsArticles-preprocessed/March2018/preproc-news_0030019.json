Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan greets the audience during a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Ankara, Turkey, February 21, 2018. Murat Cetinmuhurdar/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS In speech, Erdogan had said he hoped Turkish forces would completely capture the town of Afrin by Wednesday evening. “The ‘I hope Afrin will completely fall by tonight’ sentence in our president’s speech should be understood as ‘The circle of encirclement will be completed by tonight’,” the source said.
