    "text": "MEXICO CITY, March 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Petróleos Mexicanos (\"PEMEX\") announces the final tender results for (a) its offers to purchase for cash (i) any and all of its outstanding series of notes listed below under the heading \"Any and All Offers\" (collectively, the \"Any and All Notes\", and such offers, the \"Any and All Offers\") and (ii) the series of notes set forth in the table below under the heading \"Waterfall Tender Offers\" (collectively, the \"Waterfall Notes\", and such offers, the \"Waterfall Tender Offers\") for a specified maximum aggregate purchase price payable per series of Waterfall Notes, and (b) its concurrent solicitation of consents (the \"Consent Solicitation\") from holders of each series of Any and All Notes to a proposed amendment to the indenture governing the Any and All Notes. The Any and All Offers and the Waterfall Tender Offers are collectively referred to as the \"Tender Offers.\"\nThe Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation were made pursuant to the offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement dated February 1, 2018 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the \"Statement\"), and the related consent and letter of transmittal dated February 1, 2018, which set forth in more detail the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation.\nAny and All Offers\nThe following table summarizes the final tender results for the Any and All Offers as of 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 1, 2018 (the \"Expiration Date\"), and the principal amount of each series of Any and All Notes that PEMEX has accepted for purchase:\nTitle of\nSecurities\nCUSIP\nISIN\nPrincipal\nAmount\nOutstanding\nTender Offer\nConsideration (1)\nTotal\nConsideration (2)\nPrincipal Amount\nTendered\nPrincipal\nAmount\nAccepted for\nPurchase\n3.125% Notes\ndue 2019\n71654QBQ4\n71656MAW9\nUS71654QBQ47\nUS71656MAW91\nU.S.$327,409,000\nU.S.$979.64\nU.S.$1,009.64\nU.S.$138,598,000\nU.S.$138,598,000\n5.500% Notes\ndue 2019\n71654QBZ4\n71656M BH1\nUS71654QBZ46\nUS71656MBH16\nU.S.$750,000,000\nU.S.$999.64\nU.S.$1,029.64\nU.S.$558,644,000\nU.S.$558,644,000\n(1)\nPer U.S.$1,000.\n(2)\nPer U.S.$1,000. The Total Consideration includes an early tender premium equal to U.S.$30.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount for each series of Any and All Notes accepted for purchase.\nHolders of (i) US$100,000 principal amount of 3.125% Notes due 2019, and (ii) U.S.$1,285,000 principal amount of 5.500% Notes due 2019 (the \"5.500% Notes\"), tendered their notes after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 14, 2018 (the \"Early Tender Date\"), and on or prior to the Expiration Date. PEMEX has accepted for purchase all of the Any and All Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date and on or prior to the Expiration Date. The final settlement date on which PEMEX will make payment for Any and All Notes accepted after the Early Tender Date is expected to be March 5, 2018 (the \"Final Settlement Date\").\nHolders of Any and All Notes that validly tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date and whose Any and All Notes were accepted for purchase received the applicable total consideration set forth in the table above, which included an early tender premium, and accrued and unpaid interest on their accepted Any and All Notes from the last interest payment date to, but not including, February 16, 2018, the early settlement date of the Any and All Offers. Holders of Any and All Notes that validly tendered after the Early Tender Date but on or prior to the Expiration Date and whose Any and All Notes have been accepted for purchase are entitled to receive only the applicable tender offer consideration set forth in the table above, which is equal to the total consideration set forth in the table above minus the applicable early tender premium, and to receive accrued and unpaid interest on their accepted Any and All Notes from the last interest payment date to, but not including, the Final Settlement Date.\nThe total cash payment to purchase the accepted Any and All Notes on the Final Settlement Date will be approximately U.S.$1.4 million, including accrued and unpaid interest. Any and All Notes that have been validly tendered after the Early Tender Date and on or prior to the Expiration Date cannot be withdrawn, except as may be required by applicable law.\nAs a result of PEMEX's acceptance for purchase of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of 5.500% Notes by the Early Tender Date, on February 16, 2018, PEMEX executed a supplemental indenture with the Trustee to amend the indenture governing the 5.500% Notes to shorten the minimum notice period for the optional redemption of the 5.500% Notes to not less than three business days and no more than 10 days prior to the redemption date. This amendment will become operative on the Final Settlement Date, upon PEMEX's consummation of the Any and All Offer for the 5.500% Notes in a manner resulting in the purchase of all validly 5.500% Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date and on or prior to the Expiration Date.\nWaterfall Tender Offers\nThe following table summarizes the final tender results for the Waterfall Tender Offers as of 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date, and the principal amount of each series of Waterfall Notes that PEMEX has accepted for purchase:\nTitle of\nSecurity\nCUSIP\nPrincipal Amount\nOutstanding\nMaximum\nSeries Cap\nTender Offer\nConsideration (1)\nTotal\nConsideration (2)\nPrincipal Amount\nTendered\nPrincipal Amount\nAccepted for\nPurchase\n8.000% Notes\ndue 2019\n71654QAU6\n71656MAA7\n71656LAA9\nU.S.$1,312,275,000\nU.S.$100,000,000\nU.S.$1,035.92\nU.S.$1,065.92\nU.S.$590,853,000\nU.S.$91,843,000\n6.000% Notes\ndue 2020\n71654QAW2\n71656LAC5\n71656MAC3\nU.S.$1,000,000,000\nU.S.$200,000,000\nU.S.$1,035.96\nU.S.$1,065.96\nU.S.$503,858,000\nU.S.$183,017,000\n3.500% Notes\ndue 2020\n71654QBU5\n71656LBC4\n71656MBC2\nU.S.$1,500,000,000\nU.S.$833,433,382.72\nU.S.$987.50\nU.S.$1,017.50\nU.S.$817,353,000\nU.S.$817,303,000\n(1)\nPer U.S.$1,000.\n(2)\nPer U.S.$1,000. The Total Consideration includes an early tender premium equal to U.S.$30.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount for each series of Waterfall Notes accepted for purchase.\nOn the Early Settlement Date, PEMEX made a payment for the Waterfall Notes tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase in the Waterfall Tender Offers. Because the Waterfall Tender Offers were oversubscribed as of the Early Tender Date, holders of Waterfall Notes who tendered after the Early Tender Date and on or prior to the Expiration Date will not have any of their Waterfall Notes accepted for purchase. Any tendered Waterfall Notes that have not been accepted for purchase will be returned or credited without expense to the holder's account.\nThe Tender Offers have now expired. No Any and All Notes or Waterfall Notes tendered after the Expiration Date will be accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers. Any tendered Any and All Notes or Waterfall Notes that are not accepted for purchase will be returned or credited to the holder's account.\nGlobal Bondholder Services Corporation acted as the Depositary and Information Agent for the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation.\nPEMEX retained Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to act as dealer managers in connection with the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation (the \"Dealer Managers\").\nThis announcement is for informational purposes only. This announcement is not an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities described herein. The Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation were not made to holders of notes in any jurisdiction in which PEMEX was aware that the making of the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation or the acceptance of consents would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction. In any jurisdiction in which the securities laws or blue sky laws required the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the respective Tender Offer and the Consent Solicitation were deemed to be made on PEMEX's behalf by the Dealer Managers or one or more registered brokers or dealers that are licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.\nNeither the Statement nor any documents related to the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation have been filed with, and have not been approved or reviewed by any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority of any country. No authority has passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the Statement or any documents related to the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation, and it is unlawful and may be a criminal offense to make any representation to the contrary.\nThis communication and any other documents or materials relating to the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation have not been approved by an authorized person for the purposes of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the \"FSMA\"). Accordingly, this communication and such documents and/or materials are not being distributed to, and must not be passed on to, persons in the United Kingdom save in circumstances where section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply.

This communication is directed only at Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not Relevant Persons.
