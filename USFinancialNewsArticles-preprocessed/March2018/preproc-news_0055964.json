The joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the proposed combination, the related business combination agreement and the proposals to be considered at the special meetings. CB&I shareholders should expect to receive a separate mailing that contains documents related to an exchange offer that McDermott intends to commence for the outstanding common stock of CB&I.\nAs previously announced on December 18, 2017, McDermott and CB&I have agreed to combine in an all-stock transaction to create a premier fully vertically integrated onshore-offshore company, with a broad engineering, procurement, construction and installation service offering and market leading technology portfolio.
