    "text": "FT. WASHINGTON, Pa., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CMC Energy Services announced the appointment of Kateri Callahan as President and CEO effective April 2. Callahan will succeed Eileen McGinnis, who is stepping down after 10 years of building CMC into a nationally recognized and respected energy efficiency services company.\nUnder McGinnis' leadership, CMC grew from a small company that focused on households in several states, to a thriving, multi-regional company delivering a broader range of services to residential, multifamily and commercial utility customers.\nCallahan joins CMC following 14 years at the helm of the Alliance to Save Energy , the country's premier nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing energy efficiency. Callahan is widely regarded within the energy efficiency industry as a skilled leader, a passionate and effective advocate of energy efficiency, and an innovator and entrepreneur – skills that will contribute to CMC's continued and expanded growth. Alliance's successes under Callahan include passage of the most significant national energy efficiency policies ever enacted; the creation of the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance ; the European Alliance to Save Energy ; and the world's premier energy efficiency conference, EE Global .\n\"Kateri has served on CMC's Board of Directors for the past year, and we were delighted when she accepted our offer to succeed Eileen,\" said Mimi Iklé-Khalsa, chair of CMC's Board of Directors. \"CMC will benefit greatly from Kateri's national and international reputation and skills in the energy efficiency industry.\"\n\"I am honored and excited to join CMC at a time when the energy efficiency services industry is evolving so rapidly,\" Callahan said. \"CMC's owners, board and senior management are committed to seizing every opportunity to expand and diversify the company's offerings while also fiercely guarding its core mission and values. I look forward to working with this talented leadership team, as well as all 220 employees, to make CMC the industry's standard bearer for innovation in program design and excellence in the delivery of energy efficiency.\"\n\"Many thanks to Eileen for her service to the company,\" said Iklé-Khalsa, the daughter of CMC's founder, Doris Iklé. \"We have all heard statistics that many second-generation companies do not survive, but during Eileen's tenure, CMC thrived. We were a good team, and together we accomplished a great deal.\"\n\"I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to CMC's success,\" McGinnis said. \"It takes a lot of teamwork to build a company as strong as CMC is today. I gave it all I had, and now it is time for new leadership. I am confident that Kateri will be an excellent leader – and I will be rooting for her as well as the company's continued success.\"\nAbout CMC Energy Services\nCMC Energy Services is a certified women-owned business (WBENC) that supports more than 30 utility energy efficiency programs, representing residential, low-income, multifamily and commercial markets.
