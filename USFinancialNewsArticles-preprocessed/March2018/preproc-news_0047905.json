(\"Enel Chile\") (NYSE: ENIC) announced today the results of its tender offers for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Enel Generación Chile S.A. (\"Enel Generación\"), including in the form of American Depositary Shares (\"ADSs\"), that are not owned by Enel Chile and that all of the conditions to the corporate reorganization of Enel Chile (the \"Reorganization\") have been satisfied. The Reorganization includes (i) the Tender Offers (as defined below), (ii) a capital increase by Enel Chile in connection with the Tender Offers and a related preemptive rights offering (the \"Rights Offering\"), and (iii) a merger of Enel Green Power Latin América S.A. (\"EGPL\") with and into Enel Chile (the \"Merger\").\nEnel Chile made a tender offer in Chile for common shares of Enel Generación other than shares owned by Enel Chile (the \"Chilean Offer\") and a concurrent tender offer in the United States for Enel Generación common shares held by U.S. holders and for Enel Generación ADSs held by all holders (the \"U.S. Offer\" and together with the Chilean Offer, the \"Tender Offers\"). Each Enel Generación ADS represents 30 common shares of Enel Generación. The Chilean Offer and the U.S. Offer each commenced on February 16, 2018 and expired at 5:30 p.m., Santiago time, and 4:30 p.m., New York City time, respectively, on March 22, 2018.\nNo shares of common stock and a total of 5,691,996 ADSs of Enel Generación were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the U.S. Offer. In addition, according to the definitive notice of results published on March 25, 2018 by Enel Chile in Chile, a total of 2,582,336,287 common shares of Enel Generación were tendered pursuant to the Chilean Offer. The common shares and ADSs of Enel Generación tendered pursuant to the Tender Offers represent an aggregate of 2,753,096,167 common shares of Enel Generación.\nAll common shares and ADSs of Enel Generación tendered in the Tender Offers have been accepted for payment and payment is expected to be made on April 2, 2018 in accordance with Chilean practice.\nIn the Rights Offering, holders of subscription rights issued to existing Enel Chile shareholders elected to exercise subscription rights to purchase an aggregate of 47,863,307 new common shares of Enel Chile.\nAs a result of the successful Tender Offers and the other conditions precedent to the transactions that are part of the Reorganization, including the Merger and the capital increase being satisfied:\nThe amendments to the Bylaws of Enel Generación that were approved by the shareholders of Enel Generación on December 20, 2017, became effective as of March 25, 2018; The Merger will become effective on April 2, 2018; and The payment of the consideration by Enel Chile to the holders of Enel Generación shares and ADSs tendered in the Tender Offer (including the delivery of Enel Chile shares and ADSs subscribed for using a portion of the cash consideration) is expected to occur on April 2, 2018.\nPrior to the completion of the Reorganization, Enel Chile owns approximately 60.0% of the common shares of Enel Generación and Enel S.p.A. owns approximately 60.6% of the common shares of Enel Chile. Based on preliminary results: (i) upon purchase of the common shares and ADSs of Enel Generación pursuant to the Tender Offers, Enel Chile's ownership in Enel Generación will increase to 7,672,584,961 common shares (including those represented by ADSs) or approximately 93.55% of the total outstanding common shares of Enel Generación, which will leave 529,169,619 common shares of Enel Generación (including those represented by 4,233,476 ADSs) held by parties other than Enel Chile, and (ii) after giving effect to the Rights Offering and the Merger, Enel S.p.A. will own 42,832,058,393 common shares of Enel Chile, or approximately 61.93% of the total outstanding common shares of Enel Chile.\nThis announcement is for information purposes only and does not constitute the legal announcement required under Chilean law of the final results of the Chilean Offer, which announcement was made in Chile on March 25, 2018.\nNo Offer or Solicitations\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security and does not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction.
