They want a piece of the West Wing,\" he said. \"And not only in terms of, it looks great on their resume — it's just a great place to work.\"\nCohn, a former Goldman Sachs president who worked as White House chief economic advisor, resigned shortly afterward .\nTrump made his comments as part of an effort to push back against reports that the White House is in turmoil in the wake of a several high-profile departures .\nThe idea of Cohn's resignation was feared by markets , which had seen him as a stable, experienced presence and pro-trade voice within the White House.\nU.S. stock futures pointed sharply lower after news of Cohn's imminent departure.\nWATCH: Cohn's exit strongly indicates tariffs will go through show chapters Cohn's departure strong indicator Trump will go through with tariffs 3 Hours Ago | 04:46",
