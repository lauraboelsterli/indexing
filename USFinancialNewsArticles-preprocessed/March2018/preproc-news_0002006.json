In her new role, Johnson will oversee Cardlytics’ growing network of financial institutions, helping Cardlytics’ financial institution partners expand their loyalty programs for increased customer engagement.\n“At Cardlytics, we only hire forward-thinking people who want to push the boundaries of the status quo, and that’s why we’re thrilled to add Randall and Shannon to our team,” said COO and Co-Founder Lynne Laube. “Randall’s strong background in helping major advertising brands move the bottom line and Shannon’s extensive experience in driving bank customer engagement will make them both instrumental players as we continue to help marketers execute more effective campaigns and financial intuitions increase customer loyalty.”\nBeard joins Cardlytics after serving as Global President for Ad Solutions, Expanded Verticals and Innovation at the Nielsen Company from 2009 to 2017, where he was one of two representatives of Turner's Ad Lab Advisory Board. Before working at Nielsen, Beard served as SVP and Global Head of Marketing and Product at American Express and as Global Head of Marketing at UBS. He began his career with Procter & Gamble.\nJohnson joins Cardlytics from SunTrust, where she was SVP and Head of Consumer Direct Lending. Prior to this role, she served as SVP and Head of Consumer Deposits and Payments, where she sponsored and launched Cardlytics’ SunTrust Deals program. Previously, Johnson held numerous senior positions at PNC, where she co-developed one of Cardlytics’ first large bank contracts and implementations, PNC Purchase Payback. She began her career at McKinsey & Company, where she served clients in the Retail and Financial Services industries.\nAbout Cardlytics\nCardlytics (NASDAQ: CDLX) uses purchase intelligence to make marketing more relevant and measurable.
