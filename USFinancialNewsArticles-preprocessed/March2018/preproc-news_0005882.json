    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Akridge announced today that is has acquired the historic Trust Building from New South Ventures. The 41,000-square-foot building, located in the heart of downtown Durham at 212 West Main Street, sits on the corner of West Main and Market Streets. The Trust Building offers plentiful restaurants and retailers just steps from the building. One of the most iconic buildings in Durham, it was reportedly the tallest building in North Carolina when it was constructed in 1905.\nIn purchasing the Trust Building, Akridge has strengthened its commitment to Durham. Founded over forty years ago in Washington, DC, Akridge is dedicated to investing in, building, and operating properties that provide lasting value for its investors, quality work environments for its Clients, and vibrant neighborhoods for its communities. Akridge first entered Durham in 2016 and is proud to further expand its presence in Durham's thriving market with a building as noteworthy as the Trust Building. Akridge expanded into Durham working with Northwood Ravin to develop 555 Mangum Street, a trophy office building. 555 Mangum will be one of Durham's most prominent downtown buildings adjacent to the American Tobacco Campus. Akridge and Northwood Ravin plan to begin construction on the 240,000-square-foot building in March.\nMichael Lemanski, the CEO of New South Ventures, was excited to attract a firm with Akridge's track record to the market. Lemanski said, \"Attracting this quality of buyer to downtown Durham is a great indication of the success we have had with redeveloping formally distressed assets.\"\nAccording to Joe Svatos, Senior Vice President at Akridge, \"We are thrilled to acquire this noteworthy building in downtown Durham as we continue to expand our presence in Durham and The Triangle.\"\nSara Owen and David Finger of Cushman & Wakefield represented the seller in this transaction.
