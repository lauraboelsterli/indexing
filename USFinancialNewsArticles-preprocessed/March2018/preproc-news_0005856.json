    "text": "CHARLOTTE, Mich., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Spartan Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAR) (\"Spartan\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in specialty chassis and vehicle design, manufacturing and assembly, today reported operating results for the fourth quarter and full year periods ending December 31, 2017.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nFor the full year 2017 compared to the full year 2016:\nSales increased $116.3 million, or 19.7%, to $707.1 million from $590.8 million Net income improved $7.3 million, or 85.2%, to $15.9 million, or $0.46 per share, from $8.6 million, or $0.25 per share Adjusted EBITDA increased 37.0% to $31.3 million, or 4.4% of sales, from $22.9 million, or 3.9% of sales Adjusted net income improved 34.5% to $14.9 million, or $0.43 per share, from $11.1 million, or $0.32 per share Emergency Response segment was profitable – achieving $3.2 million of adjusted EBITDA\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016:\nSales increased $35.2 million, or 24.1%, to $181.1 million from $145.9 million Gross profit margin improved 130 basis points to 13.6% of sales from 12.3% of sales Net income improved $1.5 million, or 158.9%, to $2.4 million, or $0.07 per share, from $0.9 million, or $0.03 per share Adjusted EBITDA increased 118.3% to $9.3 million, or 5.1% of sales, compared to $4.3 million, or 2.9% of sales Adjusted net income improved 156.4% to $3.9 million, or $0.11 per share from $1.5 million, or $0.04 per share Emergency Response segment was profitable – achieving $2.7 million of adjusted EBITDA\n\"With our 2017 fourth quarter net income more than doubling, which also marks our eighth consecutive profitable quarter on an adjusted basis, Spartan has successfully completed its turnaround and is now focused on its growth strategy as we move into 2018 and beyond,\" said Daryl Adams, Spartan President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We can take pride in the strong performance we posted throughout the year, which was based on the actions we took to transition our company to a leader in purpose-built specialty vehicles that is focused on performance and innovation.\"\nFull Year 2017 Segment Results\nFor the full year 2017 compared to the full year 2016:\nFleet Vehicles and Services (FVS)\nFVS segment sales decreased 9.8% to $251.1 million from $278.4 million. Revenues declined primarily due to the timing of a large last mile delivery upfit order that did not reoccur in 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $4.2 million to $27.0 million, or 10.7% of sales, from $31.2 million, or 11.2% of sales, a year ago, primarily due to the nonrecurring last mile delivery upfit order, which was partially offset by operational improvements.\nThe Segment backlog at December 31, 2017 totaled $267.7 million, up 198.9%, compared to $89.5 million at December 31, 2016, as a result of the previously announced multi-year contract with the United States Postal Service (USPS).\nEmergency Response (ER)\nER segment sales increased 65.5% to $302.9 million from $183.0 million. The sales increase reflects increased product optimization resulting from the successful integration of Smeal and rationalization of the Company's dealer network.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $10.7 million to $3.2 million, or 1.1% of sales, from an adjusted EBITDA loss of $7.5 million a year ago. The increase was primarily the result of increased sales, improved operational performance and warranty cost reduction. Adjusted EBITDA loss in 2016 included adjustments totaling $3.5 million in legacy product recalls.\nThe Segment backlog at December 31, 2017 totaled $233.6 million, up 67.0%, compared to $139.9 million at December 31, 2016.\nSpecialty Chassis & Vehicles (SCV)\nSCV segment sales increased 17.9% to $158.8 million from $134.8 million. Sales of motorhome chassis increased 27.1% to $124.6 million from $98.0 million, primarily due to increased motorhome shipments year-over-year as a result of market share gains.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $5.8 million to $14.1 million, or 8.9% of sales, from $8.3 million, or 6.2% of sales, a year ago, primarily due to increased sales and improved operational performance.\nThe Segment backlog at December 31, 2017 totaled $33.8 million, up 68.7%, compared to $20.0 million at December 31, 2016, as a result of increased motorhome orders.\n\"The performance of each of our business segments was powerful in 2017, but perhaps the most dramatic performance was the turnaround in ER,\" continued Adams. \"With the integration of Smeal, we were able to grow top-line ER revenue by 66% while improving adjusted EBITDA by nearly $11 million. We continued to make good progress in SCV, with solid growth in revenues and adjusted EBITDA with the introduction of new innovative products and platforms to expand our addressable market and market share in motorhomes. In the FVS business, we saw some topline headwinds in 2017 relating to the timing of follow-on last-mile delivery orders, but we are encouraged with the prospect of significant growth in 2018 with normalized order flow and the addition of the USPS contract, the largest in Spartan's history.\"\n2018 Outlook\n\"We are proud of our financial performance in 2017, which will provide a sound foundation for future long-term growth, increased shareholder value and an acceleration of earnings growth in 2018,\" said Rick Sohm, Chief Financial Officer of Spartan Motors. \"Our strong financial position will enable Spartan to invest in our future growth in 2018 and beyond by expanding R&D efforts for new product innovations and enhancing our operational competencies, exploring alternative fuel technologies and expanding our manufacturing capabilities at our Ephrata, Pennsylvania facility to meet the growing last mile delivery demand. With each of our business segments now profitable, we expect our incremental investments and the new USPS order to drive additional revenues, positioning Spartan to achieve its financial objectives in 2020.\"\nOutlook for full year 2018 is expected to be as follows:\nRevenue to be in the range of $790.0 - $815.0 million Net income of $18.8 - $21.0 million Adjusted EBITDA of $39.0 - $42.0 million Effective tax rate of approximately 28% Earnings per share of $0.54 - $0.60, assuming approximately 35.3 million shares outstanding Adjusted earnings per share of $0.56 - $0.62\nAdams concluded, \"It's an exciting time for Spartan Motors, as we have worked as a team to bring significant change and improved financial performance to our Company. Exceeding our targets for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 is about more than hitting our numbers. It's proof positive that the changes we made to execute the turnaround and position Spartan for a future of sustainable, profitable growth continue to pay dividends. We have a formula in place that has successfully driven operational improvements within each of our business units. We will continue to apply this winning formula, as we aggressively take the turn into growth mode. We are confident that the near-term investments we'll make, coupled with the momentum achieved over the past two years, will have a positive impact in 2018 and beyond.\"\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release contains adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, forecasted adjusted EBITDA, and forecasted adjusted earnings per share, which are all non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are calculated by excluding items that we believe to be infrequent or not indicative of our continuing operating performance. For the periods covered by this release such items include expenses associated with restructuring actions taken to improve the efficiency and profitability of certain of our manufacturing operations, expenses related to product recall campaigns, non-cash charges related to the impairment of assets, expenses related to business acquisition activities, the impact of the step-up in inventory value associated with the recent business acquisition, and the impact of the business acquisition on the timing of chassis revenue recognition.\nWe present the non-GAAP measures adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance. The presentation of adjusted EBITDA enables investors to better understand our operations by removing items that we believe are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer term operating trends. The presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share enables investors to better understand our operations by removing the impact of tax adjustments, including the impact that our deferred tax asset valuation allowance that we recorded in 2015 has had on our tax expense and net income in 2015 and subsequent periods, the impact of a tax deduction for the write-off of an investment in a subsidiary, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on tax expense recorded in 2017, and other items that we believe are not indicative of our longer term operating trends. We believe these measures to be useful to improve the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors, as well as to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not indicative of our continuing operating performance. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our historical performance. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained in the absence of these disclosures.\nOur management uses adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to our segments. In addition, non-GAAP measures are used by management to review and analyze our operating performance and, along with other data, as internal measures for setting annual budgets and forecasts, assessing financial performance, and comparing our financial performance with our peers. Adjusted EBITDA is also used, along with other financial and non-financial measures, for purposes of determining annual and long-term incentive compensation for our management team.\nFinancial Summary
