The import curbs Mr. Trump imposed through a proclamation grant the administration flexibility on the levies that could spare critical U.S. allies , the WSJ’s Jacob M. Schlesinger, Michael C. Bender and Peter Nicholas report, and would exempt Canada and Mexico from the outset as the countries negotiate a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement. China lashed out against the tariffs today, saying they are aimed at undermining the country’s place in global trade and promising to “take effective measures to protect China’s rights.” Mr. Trump effectively tied the steel and aluminum tariffs to broader negotiations over trade, noting “we’ll be doing something” with Australia and “other partners.” In the long run, many U.S. allies will likely seek exemptions, notably European countries, Japan and South Korea, a country administration trade officials consider one of the worst offenders in dumping cheap steel products originating from China.\nThe so-called metal-benders in American supply chains worry that new U.S. curbs on steel and aluminum imports could break them. While tariff supporters, including some steelmakers and unions, say U.S. prices have been weighed down by cheap imports, smaller metal-consuming manufacturers say the new levies may significantly increase their prices and trigger job cuts . The WSJ’s Andrew Tangel, Bob Tita and Josh Zumbrun write that companies including Batesville Tool & Die Inc. and Allied Machine and Engineering Corp. are concerned about rising prices and whether supplies for specialty steel products will be available. M&B Metal Products Co. Inc. says the tariffs may call into question its plans to upgrade its Alabama factory that makes clothing hangers. Some companies say tariffs on imported steel could send the customers of suppliers to competitors overseas that wouldn’t be burdened by the trade barriers, in a bet that shipping costs would be lower than the higher production costs in the U.S.\nKroger Co. is pushing to keep its freight costs down as investment in online operations grows more expensive. The largest U.S. supermarket chain reported a big boost in fourth-quarter profit but gross margins declined, the WSJ’s Heather Haddon reports, while the company puts more resources behind digital operations . Kroger has seen commodity prices and freight costs rise, and the company is telling suppliers they need to cut costs rather than look to the chain for help in an increasingly competitive distribution market. Chief Financial Officer John Michael Schlotman said in an earnings call that the company’s dedicated fleet keeps it “well protected” as tight capacity boosts domestic shipping market prices. He says some of Kroger’s consumer-packaged goods supplies have seen freight disruptions but adds, “That’s their issue, not our issue…We agreed to pay a certain price for their product and their obligation is to get it to us for that price.”\nCOMMODITIES An iron ore bulk vessel at the Yangshan deep-water port in Shanghai. Photo: Bloomberg News A key element in growing electronics supply chains is about to get more expensive. Congo is setting a new mining code aimed at making more money from its natural resources, and the WSJ’s Nicholas Bariyo writes the action will add new uncertainty and potentially higher costs for cobalt , a key metal in industries including smartphones and electric cars. Congo is the world’s top supplier of cobalt, and with the majority of its 80 million people mired in poverty the country is trying to get a bigger share of the profits that come from its rich natural resources. Mining companies have been fighting the new structure, which would increase royalties on cobalt fivefold and raise levies on metals including copper. Cobalt prices have doubled in the last year as companies rush to secure supplies, and higher market prices will likely push miners to accelerate their efforts to find and extract more of the metal.\nToys “R” Us Inc. is no longer playing around. The troubled toy chain may liquidate all of its U.S. stores and abandon efforts to restructure through the bankruptcy process , the WSJ’s Lillian Rizzo and Paul Ziobro report. The big-box retailer filed for chapter 11 protection in September with hopes of reorganizing its heavy debt load, revamping its stores and operations, and continuing as a mainstay toy business. But now it is now evaluating bids to liquidate the rest of its U.S. locations, a plan that would effectively close off hopes of a rebound after a weak holiday season torpedoed plans to reorganize. Toy manufacturers are anxious over losing a key selling channel that for years set the market for toy manufacturing and distribution. Online sales and digital products have undermined the Toys “R” Us role in the world of children, however, and the retailer’s place in toy supply chains.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Manufacturing does not stop at a steel plant. ’\n—Roy Hardy, president of the Precision Metalforming Association, which represents about 800 U.S. parts-makers.\nNumber of the Day 9.8% Year-over-year decline in loaded container exports from the Port of Virginia in the first two months of 2018.\nIN OTHER NEWS Ford Motor Co.’s sales in China plunged 23% in the first two months of 2018 despite an overall uptick in the market.
