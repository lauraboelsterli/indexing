    "text": "HOUSTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Two influential U.S. senators pushed President Trump on Friday to be more nuanced in his approach to trade, in the wake of his controversial decision to impose tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.\n“I would hope that we would not treat every country like a one size fits all,” U.S. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and Senate majority whip, said at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, one of the largest gathering of energy industry executives.\nU.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican of Alaska and head of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Trump’s decision to impose tariffs caught her by surprise and advised Trump: “Let’s be cautious here.” (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by David Gregorio)\n ",
