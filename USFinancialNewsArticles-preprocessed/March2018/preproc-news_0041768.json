    "text": "March 22, 2018 / 2:13 AM / Updated 10 hours ago Cricket-Boult rips through England, tourists on 23-8 Reuters Staff 1 Min Read AUCKLAND, March 22 (Reuters) - New Zealand’s Trent Boult ripped through England’s top-order to reduce the visitors to 23 for eight inside the first hour of the day-night first test at Eden Park on Thursday. Left armer Boult bowled England captain Joe Root (nought), all-rounder Ben Stokes (nought) and Chris Woakes (five) and had Alastair Cook (five) and Dawid Malan (two) caught behind. His fellow new ball partner Tim Southee had opener Mark Stoneman caught behind by wicketkeeper BJ Watling (11), then took a return catch from Jonny Bairstow (nought) and then bowled Moeen Ali (nought). New Zealand captain Kane Williamson had won the toss and had no hesitation in choosing to bowl first with the pink ball. Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
