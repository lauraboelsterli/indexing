(NYSE:GSL) (the “Company”) announced today that the Company’s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.546875 per depositary share, each representing a 1/100 th interest in a share of its 8.75% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Shares (the “Series B Preferred Shares”) (NYSE:GSLPrB). The dividend represents payment for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018 and will be paid on April 2, 2018 to all Series B Preferred Shareholders of record as of March 23, 2018.\nAbout Global Ship Lease\nGlobal Ship Lease is a containership charter owner.
