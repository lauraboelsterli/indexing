    "text": "March 5, 2018 / 8:37 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago London mayor blasts water suppliers as thaw bursts pipes across UK Elizabeth Burden 2   London’s mayor Sadiq Khan said on Monday it was“unacceptable” that thousands of people across the British capital were left without water after pipes burst as normal weather conditions returned following a cold snap. Local residents collect bottled water distributed by Thames Water after mains supplies to homes were cut off following bad weather, in Balham, south London, March 5, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville The worst snowstorms in Britain for nearly 30 years froze water in pipes last week, water suppliers said, during a blast of Siberian cold dubbed“the Beast from the East” which ground planes, stopped trains, blocked roads and shut schools.

REUTERS/Toby Melville At a supermarket in Balham, south London, Thames Water employees distributed crates of bottled water to a waiting queue of people, while in Hampstead to the north of the capital, they ferried crates to residential streets in their own cars. Suppliers warned disruption would continue as they worked to fix leaks and refill pipes and Thames Water advised its 15 million customers to cut their usage.

Severn Trent, a supplier of water to 4.3 million homes and businesses in the middle of England, said the number of burst pipes was up 4000 percent, while in Wales, Welsh Water said“unprecedented challenges” had affected 4,500 homes. Farther north, Scottish Water said there was no significant impact on its customers because Scotland had not suffered the same rapid thaw.
