Firefighters douse water after a fire engulfed the Manila Pavilon hotel in Metro Manila, Philippines March 18, 2018. REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco The fire broke out at the Manila Pavilion Hotel where about 20 people earlier listed as trapped had been evacuated safely, Johnny Yu, chief of the Manila Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office, said. The death toll had been reduced from four to three, he said.
