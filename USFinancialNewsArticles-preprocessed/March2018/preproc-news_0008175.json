    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Highview Capital, LLC (“Highview”), a Los Angeles-based opportunistic private equity investment vehicle, today announced the addition of two associates, Tyler Kavanaugh and Zepher Loesch, to its Business Development team, which is led by Brice Baradel. Mr. Baradel, Mr. Kavanaugh and Mr. Loesch will drive Highview’s transaction sourcing efforts and cultivate relationships with key intermediaries, corporate sellers, and business owners. The announcement comes after the first expansion of Highview’s investment team in November 2016 and the launch of Highview’s inaugural $500 million evergreen fund in October 2016.\nRyan McCarthy, Founder and Senior Portfolio Manager of Highview, said, “As Highview continues to expand our market position, this is a natural time to grow and strengthen our team. Since our founding, we have been committed to our core philosophy of identifying and investing in opportunities where we can provide flexible capital to middle-market businesses at any point in their development. With the additions of Tyler and Zepher, and under Brice’s leadership, we are building out our sourcing capabilities, and I am confident that 2018 will be a year of growth for Highview as we continue to identify untapped opportunities for businesses undergoing transformation.”\nBrice Baradel, Principal and Head of Highview’s Business Development, said, “Tyler and Zepher are strong additions to the Highview team and will play an integral role in the execution of our strategy over the long term. With their track records of catalyzing successful connections between capital sources and companies seeking liquidity, Tyler and Zepher will enhance and broaden access to our solutions-oriented approach in the market. We look forward to building the Highview portfolio and finding investment opportunities for middle-market businesses in transition – from those navigating operational challenges to those looking to achieve next level growth.”\nMr. Kavanaugh joins Highview from investment banking firm CB Capital, where he led business development as an associate with a focus on M&A, capital raises, and debt placements. Previously, he worked on deal sourcing and acquisition searches at Harvey & Company, a buy-side advisor. Mr. Kavanaugh holds a BS in Information Science and Applied Economics & Management from Cornell University's College of Engineering and is a candidate for the CFA Level II.\nMr. Loesch joins Highview from M&A advisory firm Genz & Associates, where he served as a senior associate focusing on transactions across multiple sectors for private equity and corporate clients.
