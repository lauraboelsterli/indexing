    "text": "NEW YORK, March 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital Arts Media Network, Inc. (OTCMKTS:DATI), a specialized tech accelerator leveraging the Public Accelerator-Incubator (PAI) model, announced today that as publicized by truCrowd, Inc. (owner and operator of www.truCrowd.com ), the Company has completed talks and executed an agreement with truCrowd, to acquire up to 39.89% in the SEC registered, FINRA member crowdfunding portal.\ntruCrowd is 1 of only 38 Reg. CF portals currently registered with FINRA . As one of the first crowd funding portals to register with the SEC, DATI’s management targeted truCrowd due to its management’s long-standing experience in the crowdfunding space. With approximately 6,000 registered users, truCrowd has been successful in meeting their client’s/issuer’s capital targets. Furthermore, truCrowd is positioned to have a positive impact on DATI’s business model.\nAs part of Invest+ , DATI has purchased a 19.9% equity stake in truCrowd that will vest over 6 months, with an option to acquire an additional 19.99%. In this bold move, DATI has strengthened its service offerings to startup and development stage companies, in addition to bolstering DATI’s value proposition to angel investors and “disenfranchised investors” (microcap and non-accredited investors). The opportunity for more startup and development stage companies to leverage Angels+ has also increased significantly with this agreement; truCrowd itself will leverage DATI’s Angels+.\n“Tech startups are continuously looking for alternate, faster ways to raise capital, while keeping some semblance of control and remaining compliant with securities laws,” said Digital Arts Media Network CEO, Ajene Watson. “This is especially true as we have seen a surge in blockchain related projects and we want to position DATI at the forefront of a changing business landscape.”\nHaving the ability to appropriately leverage a FINRA member crowdfunding portal, gives DATI’s client-startups additional avenues to access capital, faster. The truCrowd portal can also offer an additional method to introduce a company and its products to their marketplace. By adding the truCrowd platform to DATI’s service offerings, the Company can further its initiative to offer private, high-growth / high-valued, high-tech startup opportunities that would normally not be available to microcap and non-accredited investors. DATI also helps angel investors to more effectively participate in the crowdfunding process through Angels+ ; receiving the benefits of early liquidity without giving up any equity in their private investment.\nMr. Watson concluded, “truCrowd not only strengthens our ability to offer traditional and accelerated capital formation solutions in our end-to-end service offerings but will improve the way we onboard and seek to initially fund client-startups, market and test a company’s market acceptance, and support the launch of properly developed blockchain related projects.”\nIt is important to note, the parties to the transaction are requesting comments from truCrowd’s regulatory body prior to consummating the transaction. Accordingly, the parties may be required to eliminate or modify some of the provisions of the transaction prior to the final closing.\nABOUT Digital Arts Media Network, Inc.\nDigital Arts Media Network, Inc. (OTCMKTS:DATI) is the first company to utilize the Public Accelerator-Incubator (PAI) model, with the intent to follow the global success of accelerators and incubators around the world, adding niche opportunities to both the microcap and startup communities. As a PAI, Digital Arts Media Network will develop and acquire innovations that solve problems through digital platforms and other electronic applications.\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DigitalArtsDATI\nLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/digital-arts-media-network\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DigitalArtsMediaNetworkDATI/\nMedium: https://medium.com/@DigArtsMedNet\nABOUT truCrowd, Inc.
