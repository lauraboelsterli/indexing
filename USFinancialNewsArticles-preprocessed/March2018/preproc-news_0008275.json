    "text": "(Reuters) - Netflix Inc is rolling out features that will give parents more control over access to content by allowing them to block individual movies and specific shows.\nFILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., on January 18, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Users can currently restrict content with only a specific maturity rating by using a numeric password. ( bit.ly/2D21wcj )\nThe new features will be available globally in the coming months, Mike Hastings, Netflix’s director of enhanced content, wrote in a blog post.\nNetflix has more than 100 million users across the world and spends billions of dollars in creating original shows such as“The Crown” and“Stranger Things.”\nNudity is common in several of its popular shows such as“Sense8”,“Orange is the New Black” and“House of Cards”. Those shows, however, come with a“adult” rating.\nNetflix added that it will“more prominently” show the maturity level of a film or a series once users play it.\nSeparately, Netflix released a teaser of the final season of its hit political drama“House of Cards,” in which Robin Wright plays the role of the first female U.S. president, after Kevin Spacey’s exit from the show.\nNetflix cut ties with Spacey, who earlier played protagonist Francis Underwood in the drama, after allegations of sexual misconduct against him.\nReporting by Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ",
