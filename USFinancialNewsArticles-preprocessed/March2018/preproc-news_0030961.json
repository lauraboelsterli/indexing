Jonathan Fa’auli, Mitch Brown, Solomon Alaimalo and Anton-Leinert-Brown also crossed for the home side, who had to twice fight back from a 14-point deficit as the Bulls threw the ball around. Divan Rossouw (two), Warrick Gelant and Handre Pollard all crossed for the Bulls, who were kept scoreless in the second half, but were outstanding with the ball in hand in the first 40 minutes.
