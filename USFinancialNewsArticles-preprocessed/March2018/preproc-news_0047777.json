REUTERS/Michaela Rehle \n“We want to grow significantly and we are in a position to handle large acquisitions,” Uebber said. \nThe two leading German luxury carmakers unveiled plans on Wednesday to combine their businesses in new services such as car-sharing and electric vehicle charging to compete with Uber [UBER.UL] in the United States and Didi Chuxing in China. \nThey will each hold half of a new joint venture company, which Daimler’s Uebber said was likely to be headquartered in Germany. \nHe said that Daimler and BMW’s financial strength could help the venture fund takeovers but said they were also open to adding new partners. \nThe idea of listing the new company is currently not in focus, Uebber said, saying the main priority was for now to close the deal.
