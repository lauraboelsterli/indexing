    "text": "Published: Mar 19, 2018 3:46 a.m. ET Share \nU.S., U.K. lawmakers slam tech giant after Cambridge Analytica revelations Getty Facebook executives argue that what happened didn’t constitute a data breach — even as they and the company acknowledged Cambridge Analytica abused user data. \nBy Deepa Seetharaman \nFacebook Inc. ignited a firestorm over how it manages third-party access to its users’ information, after the social network said a firm with ties to the 2016 Trump campaign improperly kept data for years despite saying it had destroyed those records. \nU.S. and British lawmakers slammed Facebook FB, -7.11% over the weekend for not providing more information about how the data firm, Cambridge Analytica, came to access information about potentially tens of millions of the social network’s members without their explicit permission. \nRead: Data firm tied to Trump campaign harvested data from millions of Facebook users: report \n“This is a big deal, when you have that amount of data. And the privacy violations there are significant,” Sen. Jeff Flake, R., Ariz., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an appearance on CNN. “So, the question is, who knew it? When did they know it? How long did this go on? And what happens to that data now?” \nThe attorney general in Massachusetts said in social-media posts Saturday that her office planned to launch an investigation into the matter. Damian Collins, the U.K. lawmaker who chairs a parliamentary committee on media and culture, said he intended to ask Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the group, or send a senior executive to do so, as part of its inquiry into how social-media manipulation affected Britain’s referendum decision to exit from the European Union.",
