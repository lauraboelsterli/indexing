The Board is comprised of eight top tax and legal Partners from Andersen Global member firms that will work alongside Global Chairman and Andersen Tax LLC CEO, Mark Vorsatz, to provide counsel and guidance in the direction and operations within Latin America.\nThe announcement of the Regional Board follows Andersen’s major expansion in Latin America over the past four years, having added a presence in 12 locations since 2013 in several major economic hubs—Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador and Brazil—through its member firms and collaborating firms.\nThe members of the new Latin America Regional Board are well-respected in their markets as leaders in the industry. The members are:\nLeonardo Mesquita , Regional Managing Director for Latin America (São Paulo) - Chair Irene Itzel Bolivar Cisneros , Partner at Rivera Bolivar y Castañeda Asociados (Panama) Gil Andrés Lara Morales , Partner at Andersen Tax & Legal in Mexico (Mexico City) Bernardo Oliveira , Partner at Andersen Tax & Legal in Brazil (São Paulo) Stuardo Ralon , Office Managing Director at Ralon Orellana & Associates (Guatemala) Juan Landa Tobar , Managing Partner at Andersen Tax (Chile)\nIn addition, the following collaborating firm Partners will contribute to the board as adjunct participants:\nMauricio Durango , Partner at FidesProfile (Ecuador) Juan Federico Fischer , Partner at Fischer & Schickendantz (Urguay)\n“The establishment of our first regional board is a significant milestone for our growing firm. Each of these individuals embodies the spirit of our global organization and they all bring leadership and unique perspective to this regional responsibility,” said Mark Vorsatz. “It is very important that, as we grow, we have a participatory management which represents the best interests of the Partners and results in getting broad input on how we expand and grow the firm. Andersen Global will benefit from the insights and direction of these Partners and I look forward to working with them in this capacity.”\nAndersen Global has grown in Latin America, but also has expanded its presence around the world. In 2017 the global organization added a presence in 35 new locations on five continents.\nLeonardo Mesquita, Regional Managing Director for Latin America and Chair of the Regional Board, commented, “Businesses know Andersen’s commitment to providing them with the highest quality tax and legal services found anywhere in the world. Client demand has helped drive our rapid global expansion as companies and individuals recognize the benefit that our structure and culture affords: seamless, best-in-class service and solutions—both tax and legal—that are free from the conflicts associated with an audit practice.”\nAndersen Global is an international association of legally separate, independent member firms comprised of tax and legal professionals around the world. Established in 2013 by U.S. member firm Andersen Tax LLC, Andersen Global now has more than 2,500 professionals worldwide and a presence in over 86 locations through its member firms and collaborating firms.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180307005279/en/\nAndersen Tax\nShereen Ameri, 650-289-5742\nSource: Andersen Tax",
