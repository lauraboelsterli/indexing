    "text": "  6:56 a.m. ET Share \nJudge rules National Indemnity is responsible for paying more than $43 million to victims in Montana lawsuit Getty Images Berkshire’s growth has been built upon the use of insurance float, starting with Buffett’s acquisition of National Indemnity in 1967, premium money that it holds to pay claims in the future and can invest and profit from in the meantime. \nBy Nicole Friedman \nBerkshire Hathaway Inc.’s National Indemnity Co. has to pay more than $43 million of Montana’s asbestos-related settlement costs, a state judge has ruled. \nMontana had reached a $43 million settlement in 2009 with people injured by asbestos at a vermiculite mining operation in Libby, Mont. The victims claimed the state had knowledge of unsafe conditions at the mine for decades and failed to protect workers. \nNational Indemnity BRK.A, -0.08% BRK.B, -0.12% provided general liability insurance to the state between 1973 and 1975. It argued those insurance policies didn’t cover the asbestos-related claims. \nJudge Holly Brown said in a state district court ruling on March 1 that National Indemnity breached its duty to defend the state from lawsuits related to the Libby mine. \nBerkshire, a conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, has taken on growing responsibility for asbestos-related insurance claims in recent years. Insurers including Liberty Mutual and American International Group Inc. AIG, -1.24% have paid Berkshire billions of dollars to take responsibility for future asbestos claims tied to past policies, in an arrangement known as retroactive reinsurance.",
