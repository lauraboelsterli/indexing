Across all Canadian issues there were 6 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows. * The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Canopy Growth Co, which rose 3.4 percent, while the largest decliner was First Quantum Min, down 3.3 percent. * Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Neovasc Inc, up 2.9 percent at $0.18; Klondex Mines , up 66.7 percent at $11.07. ** Gold miner Klondex was up after U.S. miner Hecla Mining Co said it would buy the company in a $462 mln cash-and-stock deal. * Volume on the TSX index was 17.83 million shares, while total volume on Monday was 33.64 million shares.
