I would like to highlight the continued growth in our core Payment Services segment that demonstrated 19% segment net revenue growth and 34% segment net profit growth in 2017 driven by the development of our payment ecosystem as well as secular trends towards digitalization of payments in our focus market verticals,” said Sergey Solonin, QIWI’s chief executive officer. “We achieved strong financial results in our payment services business this year and thus were able to continue investing in our new business lines and projects. We continued to expand our Consumer Financial Services segment represented by the SOVEST project and have seen positive dynamics across few key metrics of the project, which makes us believe that we have entered an interesting niche with a significant potential.\nWe believe we will be able to grow our payment services business by focusing on building a wider digital infrastructure and enriching our product offering, expanding and penetrating further our focus markets and generate substantial operating cash flows. At the same time we see 2018 as a year of investments in our new projects and will continue to focus on executing our strategy and developing our new initiatives.”\nNew Segment Presentation of the Results of Operations\nOur payment services business historically has been and continues to be a major part of our operations and currently generates most of our revenues as well as significant free cash flows that we can invest in developing new businesses and projects. We are constantly striving to diversify our product offering and range of services with certain new projects contributing to our payment services business and others aiming to penetrate new areas of the financial services market. Following the development of SOVEST and certain other initiatives that we have undertaken throughout 2017, we revised our organizational structure to better reflect our operational and management strategy as well as the expansion of our business operations, including the broadening of our products and services, distinguishing two key operating segments as well as Corporate and Other category, as set below:\nPayment Services (PS) , which encompasses our virtual distribution services, including QIWI Wallet and other QIWI applications, payment channels and methods; physical distribution, including our kiosks, terminals and other retail points of service, Contact Money Remittance System; and our merchant focused services; Consumer Financial Services (CFS) , which encompasses our consumer lending business SOVEST; and Corporate and Other (CO) , which encompasses expenses associated with the corporate operations of QIWI Group as well as our R&D, projects and emerging business models that we are testing.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenues: Total Adjusted Net Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was RUB 4,116 million ($71.5 million), an increase of 46% compared with RUB 2,821 million in the prior year. The increase was mainly driven by Payment Services Segment and Corporate and Other Category Net Revenue growth.\nPayment Services Segment Net Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was RUB 3,500 million ($60.8 million), an increase of 24% compared with RUB 2,816 million in the prior year.\nPS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue was RUB 3,005 million ($52.2 million), an increase of 26% compared with RUB 2,389 million in the prior year. PS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue growth was predominantly driven by a volume growth in the E-commerce and Money Remittance market verticals as well as by an improvement in yields in E-commerce market vertical resulting from the shift in the product mix towards higher yielding merchants. Growth was partially offset by a decrease in payment volumes in the Financial Services and Telecom market verticals.\nPS Other Adjusted Net Revenue 3 , which is principally composed of revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments, interest revenue, revenue from overdrafts provided to agents, rent of space for kiosks, cash and settlement services and advertising, was RUB 495 million ($8.6 million), an increase of 16% compared with RUB 427 million in the prior year. PS Other Adjusted Net Revenue increase in the fourth quarter was due to the increase revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments.\nFees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 were RUB 322 million ($5.6 million) compared with RUB 228 million for the corresponding period in the prior year, when certain changes in the Company’s approach towards recognition of revenue for unclaimed payments were implemented. PS Other Adjusted Net Revenue excluding revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments decreased 13% compared with the same period in the prior year.\nPayment Services Segment Net Revenue excluding revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments increased 23% compared with the same period in the prior year.\nConsumer Financial Services Segment Net Revenue 4 that represents the results of operations of the SOVEST project for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was RUB 35 million ($0.6 million) compared with the Net Revenue Loss of RUB 3 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year as a result of the development of the SOVEST project.\nCorporate and Other Category Net Revenue, which is principally composed of revenue from cash and settlement services (mostly associated with the information and technology service agreements with Otkritie Bank related to the operations of the Tochka project) and interest revenue, was RUB 581 million ($10.1 million) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to RUB 8 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Such increase resulted mostly from the launch of operations of the Tochka project and recognition of corresponding revenues from information and technology service agreements with Otkritie Bank for providing services to Tochka clients that have their accounts with Otkritie Bank in the amount of RUB 578 million attributable to the period from August 2017 to December 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA: For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was RUB 965 million ($16.8 million), a decrease of 23% compared with RUB 1,260 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA decrease was largely driven by growth of SG&A expense due to an increase in: (i) compensation to employees (excluding effect of share based payments) to RUB 656 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to RUB 453 million for same period in the prior year as a result of hiring of a significant number of employees in connection with the launch of the Tochka project as well as continues hiring for SOVEST; (ii) advertising, client acquisition and related expenses to RUB 332 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to RUB 65 million for same period in the prior year related to the SOVEST project; (iii) other administrative expenses to RUB 659 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to RUB 158 million for same period in the prior year primarily driven by the expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of assets of Tochka and Rocketbank from Otkritie Bank partially offset by a lower bad debt expenses as compared to the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA decline was also offset by an increase in Adjusted Net Revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Total Adjusted Net Revenue) was 23.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared with 44.7% for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA excluding fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments was RUB 643 million ($11.2 million), a decrease of 38% compared with RUB 1,032 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin excluding fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments was 16.9% compared with 39.8% in the prior year.\nAdjusted and Segment Net Profit: For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted Net Profit was RUB 642 million ($11.1 million), a decrease of 32% compared with RUB 940 million in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted Net Profit was primarily driven by the same factors impacting Adjusted EBITDA as well as recognition of an income tax expense of RUB 173 million in fourth quarter 2017 as opposed to the income tax credit of RUB 34 million for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Profit excluding fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments (net of tax) decreased 49% compared with the prior year.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Payment Services Segment Net Profit was RUB 2,013 million ($34.9 million), an increase of 47% compared with RUB 1,366 million in the prior year driven by Payment Services Segment Net Revenue growth as well as increasing operating leverage in the payment services business. The Consumer Financial Services Segment Net Loss in the fourth quarter 2017 was RUB 647 million ($11.2 million) as compared to a Net Loss of RUB 131 million in the same period of prior year resulting from the expansion of operations of the SOVEST project and associated costs mostly related to consumer acquisition. Corporate and Other Category Net Loss was RUB 723 million ($12.6 million), an increase of 145% compared with the net loss of RUB 295 million in the prior year primarily driven by expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of assets of Rocketbank and Tochka from Otkritie Bank and launch of the Tochka project as well as expenses related to corporate back-office operations of QIWI Group.\nPayment Services Other Operating Data: For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Payment Services Segment payment volume was RUB 250.9 billion ($4.4 billion), an increase of 9% compared with RUB 231.1 billion in the prior year. The increase in payment volume was driven by mixed trends across market verticals with growth in Money Remittances market vertical resulting largely from secular growth in digital money remittances including card to card and peer-to-peer transfers and E-commerce market vertical offset by declining volumes across Financial Services and Telecom market verticals. Payment average adjusted net revenue yield was 1.20%, an increase of 17 bps compared with 1.03% in the prior year primarily due to the higher average net revenue yield in the E-commerce market vertical as well as shift of product mix towards higher yielding E-commerce volumes.\nPayment Services Segment Net Revenue Yield was 1.39%, an increase of 17 bps as compared with 1.22% in the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA decrease was largely driven by growth of SG&A expense due to increase in (i) advertising, client acquisition and related expenses to RUB 1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to RUB 165 million for same period in the prior year related to the SOVEST project; (ii) compensation to employees (excluding effect of share based payments) to RUB 1,967 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to RUB 1,537 million for the prior year driven mostly by the same factors affecting fourth quarter dynamics; (iii) other administrative expenses to RUB 1,035 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to RUB 363 million for same period in the prior year primarily driven by the expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of assets of Tochka and Rocketbank from Otkritie Bank; (iv) tax, advisory and audit expense.

Consumer Financial Services Segment Net Revenue Yield was 0.27%.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of assets of Tochka and Rocketbank: In August 2017, we have executed a series of transactions to acquire the brands, software and hardware of Tochka, a digital banking service focused on offering a broad range of services to small and medium businesses and Rocketbank, a digital banking service offering debit cards and deposits to retail customers, from Otkritie Bank. We have also entered into certain operational agreements with Otkritie Bank in connection with these transactions.\nCurrently we continue our negotiations with the new administration of Otkritie Bank regarding our future cooperation and development of both businesses. We believe that our negotiations in respect of Tochka are currently in an advanced phase and we will be in a position to frame a mutually beneficial resolution that would establish the basis for our future joint activities.\nAs of December 31, 2017 we have launched our Tochka project on QIWI infrastructure and concluded the development of the Rocketbank project. We started offering Tochka services in Qiwi Bank in August 2017 and since than the project is operating as a multi-bank service providing its customers the opportunity to open accounts with either Qiwi Bank or Otkritie Bank.\nRocketbank operations have not been launched so far and we presume that given the early stages of our negotiations in respect of this project we may not launch Rocketbank operations in the nearest future.\nDividend: Throughout 2017, we have been heavily investing in our new project SOVEST and we anticipate that we will continue to bear significant costs related to the SOVEST project and certain other projects that we are developing now or plan to develop in the future. Thus, starting from the third quarter 2017 our Board of Directors have taken a decision to refrain from paying dividends. We expect that throughout the following twelve months we will concentrate on investing into our future growth. While long-term we remain committed to distributing all excess cash to our shareholders, the commencement of dividend distribution within this timeframe is unlikely.\n2018 Guidance 7\nQIWI provides its guidance in respect of 2018 outlook:\nTotal Adjusted Net Revenue assuming no contribution from Tochka and Rocketbank projects is expected to increase by 12% to 16% over 2017; Payment Services Segment Net Revenue is expected to increase by 12% to 16% over 2017; Adjusted Net Profit is expected to decline by 10% to 0% over 2017; Payment Services Segment Net Profit is expected to increase by 10% to 15% over 2017.\nGiven substantial uncertainty in respect of the future arrangements regarding the development of the Tochka and Rocketbank projects and the outcome of our negotiations in respect thereon with Otkritie Bank, we believe that we are not in a position to provide any reliable estimates of revenues or expenses associated with Tochka and Rocketbank projects for 2018, we therefore only include in our guidance for 2018 actual expenses associated with the Tochka and Rocketbank projects for the first quarter of 2018. Actual results of these projects for 2018 may differ substantially from the data that we used in our guidance.\nEarnings Conference Call and Audio Webcast\nQIWI will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results today at 8:30 a.m. ET.

The updated methodology is applied starting fourth quarter 2016 with all previous data revised retrospectively. (2) Calculated using a ruble to U.S. dollar exchange rate of RUB 57.6002 to U.S. $1.00, which was the official exchange rate Quote: d by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation as of December 31, 2017. (3) Payment Services Segment payment volume by market verticals and consolidated payment volume consist of the amounts paid by our customers to merchants or other customers included in each of those market verticals less intra-group eliminations. The methodology of payment volumes allocation between different market verticals in Contact and Rapida may differ from the methodology used by QIWI. We therefore retain the right to restate the presented volumes, net revenues and net revenue yields data in case the methodology of Contact and Rapida will be brought in conformity with the methodology used by QIWI. (4) In 2016 we introduced consumer commissions for certain types of P2P (wallet to wallet) transactions including cross currency transactions and transactions above certain limits. Corresponding volumes and payment adjusted net revenues are accounted for in our Money Remittances market vertical. (5) PS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue is calculated as the difference between PS Payment Revenue and PS Cost of Payment Revenue (excluding D&A) plus compensation to employees and related taxes allocated to PS Payment Revenue. PS payment Revenue primarily consists of merchant and consumer fees. Cost of PS payment revenue primarily consists of commission to agents. (6) We measure the numbers of our kiosks and terminals on a daily basis, with only those kiosks and terminals being taken into calculation through which at least one payment has been processed during the day, which we refer to as active kiosks and terminals. The period end numbers of our kiosks and terminals are calculated as an average of the amount of active kiosks and terminals for the last 30 days of the respective reporting period. (7) Active Qiwi Wallet accounts calculated on a yearly basis, i.e. an active account is an account that had at least one transaction within the last 12 months from the reporting date.

The updated methodology is applied starting fourth quarter 2016 with all previous data revised retrospectively. (2) Calculated using a ruble to U.S. dollar exchange rate of RUB 57.6002 to U.S. $1.00, which was the official exchange rate Quote: d by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation as of December 31, 2017. (3) Payment Services Segment payment volume by market verticals and consolidated payment volume consist of the amounts paid by our customers to merchants or other customers included in each of those market verticals less intra-group eliminations. The methodology of payment volumes allocation between different market verticals in Contact and Rapida may differ from the methodology used by QIWI. We therefore retain the right to restate the presented volumes, net revenues and net revenue yields data in case the methodology of Contact and Rapida will be brought in conformity with the methodology used by QIWI. (4) In 2016 we introduced consumer commissions for certain types of P2P (wallet to wallet) transactions including cross currency transactions and transactions above certain limits. Corresponding volumes and payment adjusted net revenues are accounted for in our Money Remittances market vertical. (5) PS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue is calculated as the difference between PS Payment Revenue and PS Cost of payment revenue (excluding D&A) plus compensation to employees and related taxes allocated to PS Payment Revenue. PS Payment Revenue primarily consists of merchant and consumer fees. Cost of PS Payment Revenue primarily consists of commission to agents.
