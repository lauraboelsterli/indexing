    "text": "26 COMMENTS Weinstein Co. once again appeared headed toward a bankruptcy filing Tuesday after its would-be buyer said it was withdrawing from a deal.\nA buyers’ group organized by investor Ron Burkle and publicly led by businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet said it called off a deal for most of the beleaguered film and TV studio’s assets less than a week after saying it would buy them by assuming $225 million of debt. The group also planned to invest $275 million to relaunch Weinstein Co. with a new name.\n“We have received disappointing information about the viability of completing this transaction,” Ms. Contreras-Sweet said in a statement. A person familiar with the group said it had found about $65 million of additional liabilities.\nWeinstein Co.’s board in a statement called the notion that the investors had learned new information “an excuse” and said the company “has been transparent about its dire financial condition to the point of announcing its own LIKELY bankruptcy.” It said the company would explore options while continuing to pursue a bankruptcy process.\nThe exact fate of the company was unclear following weeks of on-and-off-again talks and threats of a bankruptcy filing. The once-renowned studio, which won Oscars for films such as “The King’s Speech” and “Django Unchained” and produced “Project Runway,” has been in chaos since allegations of sexual misconduct against former co-chairman Harvey Weinstein were first reported in October. Mr. Weinstein has admitted mistakes but denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.\nThe Burkle-Contreras group on Monday began due diligence and soon found the additional liabilities, the person said. “That’s an enormous amount of money compared to $225 million,” this person said.\nThe fate of Weinstein Co, which was co-founded by Harvey Weinstein, was unclear following weeks of on-and-off again talks and threats of a bankruptcy filing. Photo: John Carucci/Associated Press A person close to Weinstein Co. said the buyers’ group had been aware of most of the liabilities, some of which accrued during the past several months of negotiations.\nThe Burkle-Contreras group was to wire $1.7 million to Weinstein Co. Tuesday to help it meet obligations such as payroll and its rent, according to a person familiar with the deal. Now, with the studio running on fumes, a bankruptcy filing appears imminent, said people with knowledge of its financial situation.\nA week ago Sunday, Weinstein Co. said it would file for bankruptcy because the Burkle-Contreras group hadn’t agreed to provide adequate interim financing. However, the two sides re-entered talks last week and on Thursday reached an agreement.\nThe talks were organized by the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who in February filed a lawsuit against Weinstein Co. and its founders Bob and Harvey Weinstein alleging longstanding sexual harassment and other civil-rights violations. The lawsuit stated Bob Weinstein, in his role as co-chairman, failed to investigate and root out the harassment. At the time, the Weinstein Co. board said in a statement that many of the allegations related to the board are inaccurate.\nThrough Miramax and then The Weinstein Company, Harvey and Bob Weinstein became two of the leading forces behind the independent film movement of the 1990s -- in the process making millions of dollars and earning more than 200 Oscar nominations. WSJ's Mark Kelly reports. A spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman said, “We’ll be disappointed if the parties cannot work out their differences and close the deal. Our lawsuit against the Weinstein Company, Bob Weinstein, and Harvey Weinstein remains active and our investigation is ongoing.”\nAs part of the deal brokered by Mr. Schneiderman, the buyers were to create a settlement fund worth up to $90 million for victims of alleged sexual assault and harassment by Harvey Weinstein. The studio and Mr. Weinstein face numerous lawsuits related to his behavior.\nA bankruptcy filing would halt lawsuits currently pending against the Weinstein Co. Women who have sued the studio over Harvey Weinstein’s alleged sexual misconduct would see their claims for compensation fall behind banks who lent the company money. A judge would have to approve the sale of Weinstein Co. assets in a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\nMs. Contreras-Sweet had been set to become executive chairwoman of the renamed Weinstein Co. and would have led a majority-female board, she previously said. Mr. Burkle, who arranged the offer and led the recent negotiations, was to be a minority investor along with investment firm Lantern Capital, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations. The buyers’ group hasn’t disclosed its other backers.\nIn her statement, Ms. Contreras-Sweet said her group “will consider acquiring assets that may become available in the event of bankruptcy proceedings, as well as other opportunities that may become available in the entertainment industry.”\nWrite to Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.com , Keach Hagey at keach.hagey@wsj.com and Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com",
