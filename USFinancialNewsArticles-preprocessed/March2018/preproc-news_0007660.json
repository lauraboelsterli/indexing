The 47-year-old Hall of Famer sank a par putt on the 17th hole for his first win since the 2013 British Open. The Americans had finished regulation tied at 16-under 268. Thomas had an eagle on the 18th to finish with a seven-under 64. Mickelson later finished with a 66 to force the playoff at Club de Golf Chapultepec in Mexico City.
