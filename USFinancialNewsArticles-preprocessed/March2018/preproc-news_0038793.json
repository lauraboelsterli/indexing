    "text": "TSX: ELD NYSE: EGO\nVANCOUVER, March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Eldorado Gold Corporation, (\"Eldorado\" or \"the Company\") today reports the Company's financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor information relating to the year ahead and the highlights of the Kisladag, Lamaque and Skouries Technical Reports, readers should refer to the Company's press release titled \"Eldorado Gold Reports Results of Technical Studies\", also dated March 21, 2018 (the \"Technical Studies Press Release\").\nFinancial and Operating Results Overview\nLoss attributable to shareholders of $9.9 million ($0.01 per share) , compared to loss attributable to shareholders of $344.2 million ($0.48 per share) in 2016. Adjusted net earnings of $15.2 million ($0.02 per share) 1 compared to an adjusted net earnings of $47.4 million ($0.07 per share) in 2016.\nFull year gold production of 292,971 ounces, including Olympias pre-commercial production and 7,061 ounces of gold produced from a bulk sample at our newly acquired Lamaque project in Quebec (2016: 312,299 ounces from continuing operations).\nGross profit from gold mining operations of $121.2 million (2016: $158.7 million from continuing operations).\nGold revenues of $333.3 million on sales of 264,080 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,262 per ounce.\nAll-in sustaining cash costs averaged $922 per ounce 1 , slightly higher than guidance of $915 per ounce .\nCash operating costs averaged $509 per ounce 1 ; compared to revised 2017 guidance of $500 per ounce.\nThe Company held $485 million in cash, cash equivalents and term deposits, and $250 million in undrawn lines of credit at year end.\nCompleted acquisition of Integra Gold Corp. (\"Integra\"), for a total consideration of $357 million, inclusive of Integra shares held by Eldorado. Commenced pre-feasibility work (including test mining), and advanced construction of the Lamaque mine and refurbishment of the associated Sigma mill.\nHellas Gold S.A. , Eldorado's Greek subsidiary, entered into arbitration proceedings with the Greek Government ; the proceedings are expected to conclude by April 6, 2018.\nIn November, announced the intention to move the Skouries project into care and maintenance due to continued permitting delays. Skouries is expected to be fully ramped down shortly.\nOlympias Phase II commissioning was completed and commercial production was achieved on December 31, 2017.\nContinued exploration success at Lamaque (Canada), Bolcana (Romania), Efemcukuru (Turkey), and Stratoni (Greece), with a total of 114,900 meters of drilling completed in 2017.\nContinued improvement to the overall safety record with a reduction in the total recordable injury frequency rate (for continuous operations) for the fourth consecutive year to 6.61 from 7.18 in 2016.\nGeorge Burns appointed President and CEO in April 2017.\nReconfigured the Board of Directors with retirements of Paul Wright and Jonathan Rubenstein and the appointment of Dr. George Albino as the new Chair.\n1 Throughout this press release we use cash operating cost per ounce, total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining cost per ounce, gross profit from gold mining operations, adjusted net earnings and cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital as additional measures of Company performance. These are non IFRS measures. Please see our MD&A for an explanation and discussion of these non IFRS measures. All dollar amounts in US$, unless stated otherwise.\nReserves and Resources\nThe Company ended 2017 with proven and probable gold reserves of 392 million tonnes at 1.37 grams per tonne gold containing 17.3 million ounces. A gold price of $1,200 per ounce was used in the reserve estimates, the same as in 2016.\nMillion Ounces\nProven and probable in-situ gold ounces as of January 1, 2017\n19,263\nMined ounces including mining depletion during 2017\n-576\nNet discovered ounces and converted resources during 2017\n+948\nNet decrease due to engineering and metallurgy\n-2,308\nProven and probable in-situ gold ounces as of December 31, 2017\n17,327\nThe complete mineral reserve and mineral resource data can be found at the end of this news release and includes the data for tonnes, grades and ounces.\nThe 10% overall reduction in reserve ounces was primarily attributable to the planned conversion of Kisladag from a heap leach asset to a mill processing option, with resulting higher processing costs and higher recoveries. While mineable reserves at Kisladag declined by 1.7 million ounces, incorporating expected higher mill recoveries, the forecast recoverable ounces dropped by only 400,000 ounces. Lower reserves at Olympias are the result of increases in forecast operating costs and mining dilution, both based on actual data seen since start-up.\n2017 Annual Financial Results\n($ million unless otherwise noted)\n2017\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\n2017\nRevenues\n111.9\n82.7\n95.4\n101.4\n391.4\nGold revenues\n90.5\n72.2\n84.4\n86.2\n333.3\nGold sold (ounces)\n74,068\n57,206\n65,439\n67,367\n264,080\nAverage realized gold price ($/ounce)\n1,222\n1,262\n1,290\n1,280\n1,262\nCash operating costs ($/ounce)\n466\n484\n508\n577\n509\nAll-in sustaining cash cost ($/ounce)\n791\n846\n925\n1,104\n922\nGross profit from gold mining operations\n37.0\n28.1\n30.1\n26.0\n121.2\nAdjusted net earnings (loss)\n8.0\n6.3\n1.3\n(0.4)\n15.2\nNet profit (loss) 1\n3.8\n11.2\n(4.2)\n(20.7)\n(9.9)\nEarnings (loss) per share – basic ($/share) 1\n0.01\n0.02\n(0.01)\n(0.03)\n(0.01)\nEarnings (loss) per share – diluted ($/share) 1\n0.01\n0.02\n(0.01)\n(0.03)\n(0.01)\nCash flow from operating activities 2\n28.2\n16.9\n16.3\n5.1\n66.5\n(1)\nAttributable to shareholders of the Company\n(2)\nBefore changes in non-cash working capital\nReview of Annual Financial Results\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, the loss attributable to shareholders of the Company was $9.9 million, (or $0.01 per share), compared to a loss of $344.2 million, or $0.48 per share in 2016. Financial results in 2017 were impacted by lower gross profit from gold mining operations, higher exploration and general and administrative costs, as well as write-downs of assets, partly offset by a gain on marketable securities related to the Integra acquisition. The loss in 2016 was mainly due to the $351.2 million loss recorded on the sale of the Company's Chinese assets.\nAdjusted net earnings for the year were $15.2 million ($0.02 per share) compared to $47.4 million ($0.07 per share) for 2016. Gross profit from gold mining operations was $37.1 million, lower year over year, mainly due to lower sales at the Turkish mines. General and administrative expenses were $16.7 million, higher year over year, due to higher legal and reorganization costs. Exploration expenses were $19.5, million higher due to an increase in exploration activities worldwide. Offsetting these cost increases was a decrease in mine standby costs of $11.3 million as well as $17.6 million in other income mainly related to interest on cash investments and a reversal of liabilities related to Integra flow through shares. Foreign exchange gain was $2.4 million as compared with a loss of $2.7 million in 2016, as the US dollar strengthened against other currencies in 2017.\nReview of Fourth Quarter Results\nLoss attributable to shareholders of the Company for the fourth quarter was $20.7 million ($0.03 per share) as compared to a loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 of $32.5 million ($0.05 per share). Adjusted losses were $0.4 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.9 million. The main factors that impacted adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter year over year were lower sales volumes partly offset by higher gold prices.\nOperations Review\nTURKEY\nKışladağ\nProduction at Kisladag in 2017 was 171,358 ounces of gold, which was lower than the previous year (211,161 ounces in 2016). Cash costs were $500 per ounce ($474 per ounce in 2016). Kisladag reported a reduction in ore tonnes to the leach pad year over year (13.1 million tonnes in 2017 versus 16.6 million tonnes in 2016), with no lower grade run of mine ore being placed on the pad in 2017. The average ore grade in 2017 was 1.03 grams per tonne versus 0.80 grams per tonne in 2016. Gold production, sales and revenue were down year over year due to lower grade solution from the leach pad, as a result of a combination of lower recovery material being placed on the pad later in the year and slower leach kinetics being exhibited earlier in the year. Cash costs during the year were negatively affected by a write down of 40,000 inventory ounces effective October 1 st . Capital expenditures were $27.9 million, and included capitalized waste stripping, leach pad construction, equipment overhauls and various process improvements.\nDuring the third quarter, a significant amount of laboratory test work was undertaken, as the monthly composite samples from material placed on the pad were indicating lower gold recoveries in the 35-40% range. Throughout the remainder of the year, the Company continued to investigate alternative treatment methods, which included studies on finer particle breakage, either through milling or high pressure grinding roll crushers.\nA National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure of Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators (\"NI 43-101\") compliant pre-feasibility study outlining the planned path forward at Kisladag is expected be filed by the Company on March 29, 2018, the results of which are highlighted in the Technical Studies Press Release dated March 21, 2018. This new study indicates that the construction of a conventional carbon in pulp mill at Kisladag is technically and economically feasible and supports a 3.1 million ounce reserve with expected metallurgical recoveries of approximately 80%, to produce an average of 270,000 ounces of gold per year over nine years.\nAs outlined in the Technical Studies Press Release, 2018 production at Kisladag is forecast to be 120,000-130,000 ounces of gold from the leach pad at a cash cost of $600-700 per ounce including roughly $150 per ounce of non-cash inventory changes.\nEfemçukuru\nGold production at Efemcukuru of 96,080 ounces was reasonably consistent year over year with slightly higher processed tonnage (481,600 tonnes in 2017 versus 476,500 tonnes in 2016) and improved recoveries (94.8% in 2017 versus 92.2% in 2016) somewhat offsetting the lower head grade (7.01 grams per tonne in 2017 versus 7.40 grams per tonne in 2016). Cash operating costs of $524 per ounce increased slightly ($514 per ounce in 2016), mainly due to the lower head grade. Capital spending of $28.9 million included costs related to capitalized underground development and various process improvements.\nIn 2018, Efemcukuru is expected to mine and process over 480,000 tonnes of ore at an average grade of 7.0 grams per tonne gold, producing 90,000-100,000 ounces of gold, at operating costs of $530-570 per ounce. Sustaining capital expenditures for 2018 are forecast to be approximately $20 million, spent primarily on underground mine development, equipment purchase and rebuilds and various small capital projects.\nExploration drilling of 20,000 metres during 2017 included resource conversion drilling on the Kestane Beleni vein and resource expansion drilling on the nearby Kokarpinar vein system. The resource conversion drilling targeted inferred resources downdip from the current production levels in the South Ore Shoot, in the transition zone between South and Middle Ore Shoots and at the Kestane Beleni Northwest zone, while resource expansion drilling at Kokarpinar tested the northern part of the vein system. 10,000 meters of exploration drilling in 2018 will continue to further test both vein systems.\nGREECE\nStratoni\nConcentrate tonnes produced at Stratoni were lower year over year due to decreased mill throughput and lower lead grades (5.8% in 2017 versus 6.1% in 2016) and zinc grades (9.4% in 2017 versus 10.2% in 2016). Decreased mill throughput (150,700 tonnes in 2017 vs 185,000 tonnes in 2016) was a result of limited reserves and slower than expected underground development to access the new areas. Average realized price for concentrate increased year over year ($1,227 per tonne in 2017 versus $953 per tonne in 2016) due to an increase in both lead and zinc prices. Gross profit from mining operations was similar year on year due to lower throughput and higher payabilities offsetting each other. Concentrate tonnes sold were similar year over year due to inventory remaining at the end of 2016 sold in 2017.\nMajor expenditures (capitalized and expensed) of $12.8 million included underground mine development related to resource evaluation activities as well as to access new ore. This included development of the hangingwall exploration drift, from which 6,000 metres of resource expansion drilling were completed, confirming the downdip continuity of the orebody from the current resource. The exploration development and drilling programs will continue through 2018, with 10,000 metres of drilling scheduled to continue testing downdip and along-strike extensions of the orebody.\nFor 2018, Stratoni is expected to process 160,000 tonnes of ore at grades 7.2% lead, 8.7 % zinc and 175 grams per tonne silver. Sustaining capital expenditure at Stratoni is expected to be $8 million and development capital expenditure is expected to be $8 million for the year.\nBRAZIL\nVila Nova\nVila Nova remained on care and maintenance during 2017. Two shipments were completed in the first and second quarters of 2017, selling 44,734 tonnes of lump iron ore and 46,488 dry metric tonnes of sinter fines taking advantage of a short period of higher prices or iron ore.\nDevelopment Projects and Exploration\nGREECE\nOn September 14, 2017, Hellas Gold received formal notice from the Greek Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Environment and Energy initiating Greek domestic arbitration proceedings. The arbitration notice alleged that the Technical Study for the Madem Lakkos Metallurgical Plant for treating Olympias and Skouries concentrates in the Stratoni Valley (known as Olympias Phase III), submitted in December 2014, is deficient and thereby is in violation of the Transfer Contract and the environmental terms of the project. The arbitration proceedings are expected to conclude by April 6, 2018. While arbitration proceedings are inherently uncertain, the Company is confident that the Technical Study is robust and consistent with the Transfer Contract, the Business Plan and the approved environmental terms of the project.\nOlympias\nIn 2017, Olympias had pre-commercial production of 18,472 ounces of gold. On December 31, 2017, the Company achieved commercial production at Olympias Phase II. As a reminder, there is a minimum one month lag between production and sale of concentrate, which affects revenue timing and overall cash operating costs.\nAs previously announced, in order to provide maximum operational flexibility for mine backfilling and tailings handling, the Company is constructing a new paste backfill plant (part of the original Phase II scope) and installing an additional tailings filter. The filter press is currently being commissioned and the paste plant is expected to be commissioned during the second quarter 2018.\nIn 2018, Olympias is expected to mine and process 390,000 tonnes of ore at an average grade of 7.5 grams per tonne, producing 55,000-65,000 ounces of payable gold at operating costs of $550-650 per ounce. Sustaining capital expenditure is expected to be $20 million and development capital expenditure is expected to be $28 million and will include completion of the paste plant, installation of a second tailings filter, work on the Kokkinolakas tailings management facility and further drilling. The Olympias mine also produces significant amounts of lead-silver and zinc concentrates and, depending on metal prices, the Company may take advantage of the flexibility inherent in this polymetallic orebody in order to optimize cash flow.\nIn 2018, the exploration drilling program at Olympias is expected to be 7,000 meters and will be focused on the eastern zone.\nSkouries\nCapital expenditure at Skouries in 2017 totalled $73.2 million. Project development was slowed considerably in the second half of 2017 due to continued permitting delays throughout the year. The Company announced its intention to move the project into care and maintenance in November 2017 and the ramp-down to care and maintenance is expected to be complete shortly.\nDevelopment capital expenditure at Skouries for 2018 is expected to be $20 million as the project fully transitions to care and maintenance. Ongoing care and maintenance costs are estimated to be $3-5 million per year once fully ramped down.\nAn updated NI 43-101 compliant technical report is expected to be filed by the Company for the Skouries project on March 29, 2018, the results of which are highlighted in the Technical Studies Press Release. Economic highlights of the study include an after tax IRR of 21.2% and an NPV (5%) of $925 million, using the Company's assumed long term metal prices of $1,300 per ounce of gold and $2.75 per pound of copper.\nPerama Hill\nPerama Hill remains on care and maintenance pending receipt of the necessary permits.\nCANADA\nLamaque\nDuring 2017, the Company completed the Integra acquisition and began work at its 100% wholly-owned Lamaque project. During 2017, test mining extracted 47,750 tonnes of ore with an average head grade of 8.6 g/t gold, with approximately 35,400 tonnes processed at a nearby custom milling facility. Results from the first two batches (32,000 tonnes) with an average grade of 7.35 g/t, which was in line with expectations and recoveries were slightly higher than anticipated at an average 95.4% for the toll treatment. In 2017 the company spent $35.8 million in development capital at Lamaque.\nCapital expenditures at Lamaque to reach commercial production are $122 million plus $57 million of pre-commercial production costs, offset by $80 million in pre commercial gold sales, for a net start-up capital of $99 million. The Company expects to extract roughly 200,000 tonnes of ore grading 8.03 grams per tonne gold, containing approximately 40,000 ounces and anticipates toll milling a portion of the ore and producing 25,000 to 35,000 ounces.\nSince the July 2017 acquisition, over 44,000 metres of resource conversion and resource expansion drilling have been completed and an additional 34,000 metres of exploration drilling is planned for 2018.\nAn NI 43-101 compliant technical report with respect to Lamaque is expected to be filed by the Company on March 29, 2018, the results of which are highlighted in the Technical Studies Press Release. A maiden Reserve of 893,000 ounces was declared for the Triangle Zone, within Measured and Indicated Resources of 1.3 million ounces with a further 1.3 million ounces of Inferred Resources. The technical report outlines an initial seven year mine life with production averaging 117,000 ounces per year. Exploration for 2018 is budgeted at $7 million.\nBRAZIL\nTocantinzinho\nA total of $9.9 million was spent on the project in 2017 on detailed engineering for the tailings dam, CIP tails pond, waste rock dump, basic engineering design, land agreement, administration and others. The installation licences for the project site (mine, process plant and infrastructure), for the tailings structures and for the project power line were received in 2017. The mining concession application is under review by the federal branch of the Mines Ministry and the approval is expected in the second quarter of 2018.\nWork planned for 2018 is limited to permitting support, site maintenance and security, finalizing land agreements for the site and power line and environmental compensation programs. Consideration of a construction decision at Tocantinzinho has been deferred until the mining concession is in place and a development project review is completed. Capital spending in 2018 is expected to be $8 million.\nROMANIA\nCertej\nDuring 2017, a total of $15.4 million (capitalized and expensed) was spent on Certej, mainly on geotechnical and metallurgical testing, site preparation and engineering studies. During 2018, the Company expects to spend approximately $7 million at Certej, with a focus on continuing off site infrastructure projects and advancing permitting.\nBolcana\nThe Bolcana project is a large copper gold porphyry system located approximately six kilometres west of the Company's Certej epithermal gold-silver development project in Romania. The 2017 exploration program at Bolcana totalled over 23,000 metres of drilling in 25 holes and tested an area measuring 1,200 metres by 900 metres, locally to a depth of more than 1,200 metres.\nA further 20,000 metres of drilling is planned for 2018, which will complete drill hole coverage over the porphyry system to a 150 metre drill hole spacing.\n2018 Outlook\nIn 2018 Eldorado expects to produce 290,000-330,000 ounces of gold, including pre-commercial ounces from Lamaque. Cash costs are forecasted at $580-630 per ounce.\nCorporate\nBoard and Senior Management Changes\nDuring 2017, the following changes were made to the Board of Directors and to Senior Management:\nDr. George Albino appointed as Board Chair, effective January 1, 2018 George Burns appointed as President and CEO, and elected to the Board of Directors Paul Wright and Jonathan Rubenstein resigned as directors Reduction in the Board size to eight directors from 10, as well as reduced individual director and overall Board compensation Ross Cory retired from the Board effective April 27, 2017 as he did not stand for re-election at the Annual General Meeting Jason Cho promoted to Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development\nThe following changes were made to the Board Committees:\nCompensation Committee\nSteve Reid appointed as Chair to replace Jonathan Rubenstein Dr. George Albino replaced Robert Gilmore\nSustainability Committee\nMichael Price appointed as Chair to replace Steve Reid Robert Gilmore replaced Dr. George Albino\nNo changes were made to the composition of the Audit Committee or the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.\nSubsequent to year end, the following management changes also occurred:\nDawn Moss, EVP Administration, retired on February 28, 2018 Eduardo Moura, VP Special Advisor to the CEO, departed the Company as of February 28, 2018 Timothy Garvin, EVP General Counsel, joined the Company on February 20, 2018 Andor Lips, joined the Company as VP Government Relations, Europe on February, 19 2018 Announcement that Fabiana Chubbs, Chief Financial Officer, will depart at the end of April 2018\nDividend\nPending the results of the technical reports and potential subsequent capital requirements, the Company suspended cash payment of its semi-annual dividend payment effective the first quarter of 2018.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss the details of the Company's 2017 Fourth Quarter and Year End 2017 Results and Technical Reports will be held by senior management on March 22, 2018 at 8:30 AM PT (11:30 AM ET).

The reader is directed to carefully review such document for a full understanding of the financial information summarized herein.\nExcept as otherwise noted, scientific and technical information contained in this press release was reviewed and approved by Paul Skayman, FAusIMM, Chief Operating Officer for Eldorado Gold Corporation, and a \"qualified person\" under NI 43-101.\nMineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. With respect to \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\", there is a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and a great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of a \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" or \"inferred mineral resource\" will ever be upgraded to a higher category.\nCautionary Note to US Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources\nThe terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\", \"inferred mineral resource\" used herein are Canadian mining terms used in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines set out in the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as may be amended from time to time. These definitions differ from the definitions in the United States Securities & Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Industry Guide 7. In the United States, a mineral reserve is defined as a part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time the mineral reserve determination is made.\nWhile the terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource,\" \"indicated mineral resource\", and \"inferred mineral resource\" are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, they are not defined terms under standards in the United States and normally are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. As such, information contained herein concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources under Canadian standards may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies in SEC filings.\nAccordingly, information herein containing descriptions of our mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by US companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under US federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nQ4 and Fully Year 2017 Gold Production Highlights (in US$)\nFourth\nQuarter\n2017\nFourth\nQuarter\n2016\n2017\n2016\n2018 Outlook 5\nGold Production\nOunces Sold\n67,367\n84,682\n264,080\n311,028\nn/a\nOunces Produced 1\n83,886\n82,804\n292,971\n312,299\n290,000 to 330,000\nCash Operating Cost ($/oz) 2,4\n577\n472\n509\n487\n580 to 630\nTotal Cash Cost ($/oz) 3,4\n603\n482\n534\n502\nn/a\nRealized Price ($/oz - sold)\n1,280\n1,204\n1,262\n1,249\nn/a\nKişladağ Mine, Turkey\nOunces Sold\n44,317\n59,416\n171,505\n211,284\nn/a\nOunces Produced\n44,356\n59,591\n171,358\n211,161\n120,000 to 130,000\nTonnes to Pad\n3,332,990\n3,916,917\n13,061,861\n16,565,254\nn/a\nGrade (grams / tonne)\n1.02\n0.74\n1.03\n0.80\nn/a\nCash Operating Cost ($/oz) 4\n604\n456\n500\n474\n600 to 700\nTotal Cash Cost ($/oz) 3,4\n626\n465\n522\n488\nn/a\nEfemçukuru Mine, Turkey\nOunces Sold\n23,050\n25,266\n92,575\n99,744\nn/a\nOunces Produced\n25,463\n23,213\n96,080\n98,364\n90,000 to 100,000\nTonnes Milled\n119,135\n123,815\n481,649\n476,528\nn/a\nGrade (grams / tonne)\n7.46\n7.39\n7.01\n7.4\nn/a\nCash Operating Cost ($/oz) 4\n525\n512\n524\n514\n530 to 570\nTotal Cash Cost ($/oz) 3,4\n559\n522\n556\n530\nn/a\nOlympias, Greece\nOunces Sold\n-\n-\n-\n-\nn/a\nOunces Produced 1\n7,174\n-\n18,472\n2,774\n55,000 to 65,000\nTonnes Milled\n-\n-\n-\n87,350\nn/a\nGrade (grams / tonne)\n-\n-\n-\n2.47\nn/a\nCash Operating Cost ($/oz) 4\n-\n-\n-\n-\n550 to 650\nTotal Cash Cost ($/oz) 3,4\n-\n-\n-\n-\nn/a\nLamaque, Canada\nOunces Sold\n-\n-\n-\n-\nn/a\nOunces Produced 1\n7,061\n-\n7,061\n-\n25,000 to 35,000\nTonnes Milled\n35,411\n-\n35,411\n-\nn/a\nGrade (grams / tonne)\n7.69\n-\n7.69\n-\nn/a\nCash Operating Cost ($/oz) 4\n-\n-\n-\n-\nn/a\nTotal Cash Cost ($/oz) 3,4\n-\n-\n-\n-\nn/a\n1\nOunces produced includes pre-commercial production in 2017 at Olympias and Lamaque and production from tailings retreatment in 2016 at Olympias.\n2\nCost figures calculated in accordance with the Gold Institute Standard.\n3\nCash operating costs, plus royalties and the cost of off-site administration.\n4\nCash operating costs and total cash costs are non-IFRS measures.

Mineral reserves are included in the mineral resources. The mineral reserves and mineral resources are disclosed on a total project basis.\nMineral Reserve Notes\n1. Long Term Metal Price Assumptions\nGold price: $1,200/oz Silver price: $16.00/oz (for Stratoni it was $8.14/oz Ag as governed by a streaming agreement with Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd.) Copper price: $2.50/lb Lead price: $1,800/t Zinc price: $2,000/t\nDue to a limited mine life for Stratoni (3 years) current Pb and Zn prices were used for its mineral reserves ($2,400/t Pb and $2,712/t Zn)\n2. Skouries\nThe open pit design is based on permit limits, not metal prices, therefore insensitive to a falling or rising metal price environment. The underground designs were based on a Cu price of $3.00/lb. The change in the Cu price to $2.50/lb has no impact to the underground portion of the mineral reserves developed at that time given that the margin on the lowest value ore has been demonstrated to remain positive against the backdrop of updated operating costs. Nevertheless, it is recognized that at the lower Cu price approximately 17 Mt of the mineral reserves have marginal value, and a further decrease in metal prices would render these uneconomic. The impact would not be felt until the latter part of the project's long minelife as the lower grade resources are located on the periphery of the orebody and at depth. Furthermore, the loss of these resources would not change the design philosophy or placement of long-term underground infrastructure, the result would be simply a shorter minelife.\n3. Cut-off Grades\nKisladag: $12.25 NSR ; Efemcukuru: 3.08 g/t Au; Lamaque: 3.50 g/t; Perama: 0.8 g/t Au; Tocantinzinho: 0.42 g/t Au; Skouries: $12.00 NSR (open pit), $33.33 NSR (underground); Olympias: $130 NSR; Stratoni: 14.3% Zn Equivalent grade (=Zn%+Pb%*1.1+Ag%*114); Certej: 0.90 g/t Au Equivalent grade (=Au(g/t)+Ag(g/t)*0.0121).\n4. Qualified Persons\nJohn Nilsson, P.Eng., of Nilsson Mine Services, is responsible for the Kisladag, Skouries (open pit), Certej and Tocantinzinho mineral reserves; Doug Jones (Registered Member - SME), consultant for the Company, is responsible for the Efemcukuru, Olympias, Stratoni and Perama mineral reserves; Colm Keogh, P.Eng, Manager, Underground Mining for the Company, is responsible for the Skouries (underground) and Lamaque mineral reserves.\nMineral Resource Notes\n1. Cut-off Grades\nKisladag: 0.30 g/t Au for M+I, 0.35 g/t for Inferred; Efemcukuru: 2.5 g/t Au; Lamaque: 2.5 g/t; Perama: 0.5 g/t Au; Tocantinzinho: 0.3 g/t Au; Certej: 0.7 g/t Au; Skouries: 0.20 g/t Au Equivalent grade (open pit), 0.60 g/t Au Equivalent grade (underground) (=Au g/t + 1.6*Cu%); Olympias: $50 NSR; Piavitsa: 3.5 g/t Au; Sapes: 2.5 g/t Au (underground), 1.0 g/t Au (open pit). Resource cut-off for Stratoni are geological based due to the sharpness of the mineralized contacts and the high grade nature of the mineralization.\n2.
