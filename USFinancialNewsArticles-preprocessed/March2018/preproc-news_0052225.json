All 15 analysts who submitted a forecast for the overnight deposit rate also predicted no change. The majority of analysts see no change in rates before 2020.\nInflation slowed in February in line with most Central European peers. Analysts in the poll said inflation was unlikely to drift far from 3 percent, the centre of the central bank’s target range, in the next three years.\nIn contrast to Hungary, central banks in the Czech Republic and Romania have already begun raising interest rates to fight a rebound in inflation.\nThe NBH is due to release new inflation and economic growth forecasts at 1300 GMT.\nIt can afford to leave monetary policy loose, because interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve are unlikely to lead to a big flow of capital out of Hungarian assets, analysts said.\nThe NBH started buying mortgage bonds earlier this year. It also launched new interest rate swaps for banks with the aim of curbing yields on longer-dated bonds.\nThe forint traded at 312.80 to the euro on Tuesday after the rate decision, unchanged from levels before the announcement.
