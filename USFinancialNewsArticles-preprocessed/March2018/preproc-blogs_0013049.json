    "text": "The question of America's oil growth prospects may boil down to logistics, cash and technology, according to LeBlanc. Challenges begin above ground \nThe most immediate challenges facing the shale industry are bottlenecks for the services on which frackers rely. The key that unlocks shale drilling is hydraulic fracturing, the process of injecting water, sand and chemicals underground to fracture shale rock and let hydrocarbons flow to the wellbore. \nA sharp recovery in drilling — following a drop in activity after the 2014 oil price collapse — has created a tighter supply of the crews that exploration and production companies employ to frack wells and has taxed the mines that provide sand. \nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration \nThese bottlenecks will present aggravations that potentially slow production growth over the next couple years, LeBlanc says. However, these are solvable problems and shouldn't impact the long-term growth prospects too much. \nThe industry also has to build out new pipelines and other transportation infrastructure to move oil from wells to market. The industry has seen a surge of opposition around megaprojects, like the Dakota Access and the Keystone XL pipelines, but LeBlanc said projects within oil-friendly states like Texas are unlikely to run into significant roadblocks. \nBut there is still a longer-term structural problem. Infrastructure companies typically need a roughly 30-year commitment to justify building a pipeline. That can be a risky endeavor in shale fields, where the decline rates of wells or a sudden exit of drillers from a region could impact how much crude is flowing through lines — and the profitability of expensive projects. \n\"There's a real mismatch between the risk profile of upstream players and the risk profile of midstream players,\" LeBlanc said, using industry terms for oil drillers and pipeline operators, respectively. Cash is king \nOver the next five years, the amount of cash that gets put to work in U.S. shale fields will play a major factor in future output. \nRight now few drillers have assets that are good enough to produce cash sufficient to cover the cost of future production. That means frackers remain dependent on debt, equity and other types of outside capital to replenish rapidly depleting wells. \n\"It's the secret fuel for the shale revolution — the U.S. capital market and the ability to get lots of money very quickly,\" said LeBlanc. \nU.S. shale regions \nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration \nAt least some flows could start drying up soon. Last year shareholders began signaling to drillers that they want to start seeing a return on their investments after years of debt fueled growth. Now more drillers are exercising tighter discipline and trying to fund growth with cash generated from operations. \nIf drillers start dialing back reinvestment, annual growth rates could look more like 200,000 barrels a day, with better returns for shareholders, rather than 1 million barrels a day, said LeBlanc. \nStill, he believes capital will remain available. For one, private equity firms still have a lot of dry powder to invest. (Dry powder is money raised but not yet invested.) Also, oil giants like ExxonMobil and Chevron have pivoted to U.S. shale fields, and they may increasingly redirect money to those operations from more conventional projects in places like Nigeria and Kazakhstan. Technology drives the drill bit \nWhile there is still plenty of shale oil to produce, drillers have already burned through the best acreage in some of the nation's shale fields, LeBlanc said. Other regions could soon be headed for what he calls \"sweet spot exhaustion.\" \nMore from CERAWeek:",
