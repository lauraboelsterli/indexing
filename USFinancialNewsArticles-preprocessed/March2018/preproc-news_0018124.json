    "text": "NEW YORK, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XpresSpa Group Inc. (Nasdaq:XSPA) (“XpresSpa” or the “Company”), a health and wellness holding company, today provided an update on the disposition of certain key non-core assets. These include:\nOn March 7, 2018, the Company signed a definitive merger agreement to sell Group Mobile Int’l LLC (“GM”), a supplier of built-to-order rugged computers, mobile devices and accessories, to Route 1, Inc. (TSXV:ROI) (OTCQB:ROIUF), a Canadian software developer, in exchange for Route1 common stock and warrants with an estimated preliminary value of $1.0 million and an earn-out with an estimated preliminary value of $1.0 million. In addition, the Company expects to collect approximately $0.75 million in cash upon the sale of certain GM inventory. The transaction is expected to close on or before March 30, 2018. These values are preliminary and are based on our management’s estimate of expected earnout payments and of the values related to the stock and warrants and are subject to change. In October 2017, the Company sold FLI Charge, Inc., an early stage company that designs, develops, licenses, manufactures and markets power transfer and charging solutions, to FLI Charge’s management team for approximately $1.05 million in cash, of which $0.25 million was paid upon closing and $0.8 million was paid in the first quarter of 2018, as well as a 5% perpetual royalty and warrants representing a 5% ownership in FLI Charge Inc. In January 2018, the Company sold certain patents to Crypto Currency Patent Holdings Company LLC, a unit of Marathon Patent Group, Inc., for approximately $1.25 million, comprised of $0.25 million in cash and 250,000 shares of common stock valued at approximately $1.0 million at the time of the transaction. Separately, the Company has settled outstanding litigation and made additional patent sales for cash consideration totaling $0.4 million.\n“Our strategic focus is to build XpresSpa into a preeminent health and wellness services company, and the monetization of these key non-core assets frees our time and attention for deployment into our core business growth,” said Andrew Perlman, CEO of XpresSpa Group. “We are nearing completion of creating a pure play wellness business, and will continue to work on completing sales of the few remaining non-core assets.”\nAbout XpresSpa Group, Inc.\nXpresSpa Group, Inc.
