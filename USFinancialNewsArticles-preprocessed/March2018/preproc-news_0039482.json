Holders of such Securities accepted for purchase will receive accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the last interest payment date for their tendered Securities to, but not including, the early settlement date, which is expected to be March 23, 2018 (the “Early Settlement Date”), rounded to the nearest cent.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Offer, the withdrawal deadline for the Offer was 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 21, 2018, and has not been extended for any series of Securities. Securities tendered may no longer be withdrawn unless otherwise required by law. The Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 4, 2018, unless extended or earlier terminated by Sysco, with respect to any or all series of Securities. Although the Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 4, 2018, because holders of Securities subject to the Offer validly tendered and did not validly withdraw Securities at or prior to the Early Tender Time in an amount equal to the Tender Cap, Sysco does not expect to accept for purchase any tenders of Securities after the Early Tender Time.\nThe Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, as specified in the Offer to Purchase.\nCapitalized terms used in this press release and not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Offer to Purchase.\nGoldman Sachs & Co.
