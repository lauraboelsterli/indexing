    "text": "U.S. government debt yields were largely unchanged Wednesday after President Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn announced his resignation.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was lower at around 2.874 percent at 1:48 p.m. ET, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was slightly higher at 3.144 percent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nGlobal markets came under pressure Wednesday after news emerged that the White House's Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn had chosen to resign from President Donald Trump's administration Tuesday.\nCohn, the free trade advocate and former Goldman Sachs president, chose to step down from his position after Trump announced that he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a move that has frustrated Capitol Hill and Wall Street alike.\n\"The Cohn exit creates more uncertainty with regard to economic policy. ... Markets do not like uncertainty,\" said Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management. \"This will remove some support from risky assets like equities and it should add some support to bonds.\"\nCohn was widely respected for his market knowledge and pro-trade view; equity futures sank following the announcement of his exit, with the Dow Jones industrial average set to fall triple digits.\n\"Cohn has been a voice of moderation, he's been a voice of who understands markets, who understands investors, a voice that's committed to U.S. playing a leadership role in the global system,\" said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"In addition, he's been a counterweight to others in the administration who have pushed for protectionist policies and other policies that may potentially disrupt U.S. trade.\"\nSymbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR --- In economic news, February proved another strong month for job creation, with companies adding 235,000 positions, ADP and Moody's Analytics reported Wednesday. The total beat Wall Street expectations, as economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting payrolls to grow by 195,000.\nOn Wednesday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will be in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to speak at a Broward Workshop event. New York Fed President William Dudley will be in Puerto Rico where he is expected to talk about restoration efforts following last year's hurricane season.\nThe Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book is set to be published at 2 p.m. ET, while consumer credit is due out at 3 p.m. ET.",
