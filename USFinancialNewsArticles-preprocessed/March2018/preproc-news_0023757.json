(Nasdaq:KURA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of precision medicines for oncology, today provided a regulatory update for its lead product candidate, tipifarnib, and reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\n“Following a successful end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we plan to initiate a single-arm, registration-directed trial of tipifarnib in at least 59 recurrent or metastatic patients with HRAS mutant squamous cell head and neck cancer (HNSCC) with objective response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint,” said Troy Wilson, Ph.D., J.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Kura Oncology. “We expect to initiate this trial, which we are calling the AIM-HN trial, in the second half of 2018. We are encouraged by the feedback we received from the FDA regarding the development path for tipifarnib in HRAS mutant HNSCC, and we look forward to providing more specific information regarding the design and execution of the trial in the months ahead.”\nRecent Operational Highlights\nFeedback from end of Phase 2 clinical meeting with the FDA – Based on feedback from the FDA, Kura is planning for the initiation of its AIM-HN trial of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant HNSCC patients, pending completion of site feasibility activities and submission of the final protocol to the FDA. The AIM-HN trial will be a global, multi-center, single-arm, study of at least 59 recurrent or metastatic patients with measurable disease as determined by RECIST version 1.1 criteria. The primary endpoint will be ORR, as determined by independent radiological review. The FDA indicated in the minutes from the meeting that the AIM-HN trial, as currently designed, may be adequate to support an NDA seeking accelerated approval.\nUpdate on Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant HNSCC – In February 2018, Kura reported updated preliminary results from its Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant HNSCC at the 2018 Multidisciplinary Head and Neck Cancers Symposium. The update showed that five of the six evaluable patients achieved a confirmed, partial response. Two of these patients achieved durable responses beyond a year and a half. The one evaluable patient who did not achieve a response, based on standard RECIST criteria, experienced prolonged disease stabilization for more than six months. Tipifarnib has been generally well-tolerated with adverse events observed consistent with its known safety profile.\nPotential biomarkers identified for tipifarnib in hematologic malignancies – In December 2017, Kura presented new findings at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting that identified activation of the CXCL12 pathway and bone marrow homing of myeloid cells as potential biomarkers of tipifarnib’s activity in certain hematologic malignancies, including peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on these observations, the company is now prospectively investigating these potential biomarkers in its ongoing Phase 2 trials in various hematologic malignancies.\nUpcoming Potential Milestones and Expectations for Clinical Programs\nPreclinical data for tipifarnib in HRAS mutant squamous non-small cell lung tumor models at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in April 2018\nPreclinical biomarker data from KO-947 in squamous cell carcinomas at AACR in April 2018\nInitiation of the tipifarnib SEQ-HN trial, a screening and outcomes study in HRAS mutant HNSCC in the first half of 2018\nInitiation of the tipifarnib AIM-HN trial in HRAS mutant HNSCC in the second half of 2018\nData from Phase 1 dose-escalation trial of KO-947 in the second half of 2018\nAdditional updates from the ongoing Phase 2 study of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant HNSCC in the second half of 2018\nInitiation of a proof-of-concept study of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant squamous non-small cell lung cancer through the Spanish Lung Cancer Group in 2018\nAdditional clinical data from tipifarnib in hematologic malignancies in the second half of 2018\nSubmission of an investigational new drug (IND) application for KO-539 in late 2018 or early 2019\nFinancial Results for the Fourth Quarter and the Full Year 2017\nResearch and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $8.1 million, compared to $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Research and development expenses for the full year 2017 were $26.4 million, compared to $20.4 million for the prior year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.9 million, compared to $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. General and administrative expenses for the full year 2017 were $9.7 million, compared to $8.0 million for the prior year.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.7 million, compared to a net loss of $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the full year 2017 was $35.4 million, compared to a net loss of $27.6 million for the prior year.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $93.1 million as of December 31, 2017, compared with $100.8 million as of September 30, 2017 and $67.8 million as of December 31, 2016.\nSubsequently, in January 2018, Kura sold an aggregate of approximately 3.1 million shares of its common stock under an ATM facility for net proceeds of $57.4 million.\nManagement expects that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund its current operations into the first half of 2020.\nConference Call and Webcast\nKura’s management will host a webcast and conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT today, March 12, 2018, to discuss the regulatory update and financial results.
