    "text": "CNBC.com Getty Images House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) (2nd L) and Rep. Peter King (R-NY) leave the committee's secure meeting rooms in the basement of the U.S. Capitol House Visitors Center February 6, 2018 in Washington, DC. \nThe Republican-led House Intelligence Committee is preparing to write a report after finishing interviews with more than 50 witnesses in its investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, The Wall Stree t Journal reported Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter . \nThe development in the investigation, which has been active nearly as long as Donald Trump has been president, indicates that the often-polarizing probe may be nearing its conclusion, the Journal reported. \nNeither Republicans nor Democrats on the panel responded to CNBC's request for comment. \nThe House Committee's investigation has been conducted alongside at least two separate investigations within the government. \nIn May 2017, FBI Deputy Director Rod Rosenstein appointed special counsel Robert Mueller , a former director of the FBI , to lead an inquiry into potential Russian collusion and related matters. An additional probe is being conducted by the Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Republican Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and ranking Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia. \nThe House investigation has become a source of intense political strife between Republicans and Democrats. Panel Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who assisted Trump during the presidential transition after the 2016 election, has been accused of partisan bias in favor of the White House by Democrats in Congress. \nOne of Nunes' staunchest critics is the committee's own ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif., who lambasted Nunes and other congressional Republicans \"who have cast aside their duty to uphold the law and perform oversight in favor of protecting the Trump presidency — no matter the cost.\" \nA protracted duel over declassified memos — a Republican memo alleging FBI surveillance abuses and a Democratic rebuttal defending the bureau's methods — crystallized the polarization between the two parties in the committee. \nThe Republican memo passed on a party-line committee vote and was sent to Trump for approval, forgoing intelligence agencies' traditional role in the process. It said that the FBI improperly relied upon an unverified and partially Democrat-funded dossier, which alleged salacious connections between Trump and the Kremlin. \nThe Democrats' response was initially rejected by the White House, which cited national security concerns. The minority's memo accused committee Republicans of a \"transparent effort to undermine\" the FBI and Justice Department in order to delegitimize other investigations involving the president.",
