Futures tied to target policy rates now price in a one-in-three chance of rates rising by a full percentage point in 2018.\nWorld stocks were also set to snap a record 15-month winning streak due to data signaling a slowdown in China’s manufacturing and Japan’s industrial output.\nA Reuters analysis showed global investors cut their equity exposure to a three-month low in February, though most still expect stocks to test new highs despite rising bond yields.\nAt 6:48 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 8 points, S&P 500 e-minis slipped 0.5 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis was 1 point higher.\nAmong early decliners was No. 2 home improvement chain Lowe‘s, whose shares slumped 7 percent after the company’s quarterly profit missed estimates as margins fell.\nCelgene fell about 7 percent after U.S. health regulators rejected the company’s application seeking approval of a key multiple sclerosis drug.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department is set to release its second revised estimate of the fourth-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 a.m. ET. The economy is likely to have expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate, compared with a previous estimate of 2.6 percent.\nReading on the Fed’s favored gauge of inflation, personal consumption expenditure, is due on Thursday.
