    "text": "March 7 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index futures fell on Wednesday after White House economic adviser Gary Cohn resigned, stoking fears President Donald Trump would go ahead with tariffs.\nCohn, the top economic adviser to Trump and a voice for Wall Street in the White House, said on Tuesday he would resign, a move that came after he lost a fight over Trump’s plans for hefty steel and aluminum import tariffs.\nInvestors suspect protectionist forces in the White House favor using a lower dollar to enhance U.S. export competitiveness while making imports more expensive.\nMarch futures on the S&P TSX index were down 0.34 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET.\nThe Bank of Canada is scheduled to make its next interest rate announcement, and expectations are that the central bank will keep interest rates steady at 1.25 percent, after having raised it in January. The data is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nStatistics Canada’s trade report is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET that is likely to show trade deficit having narrowed to C$2.50 billion in January from C$3.19 billion in December.
