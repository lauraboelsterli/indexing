    "text": "TAYLOR, Mich., March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Atlas Oil Company's Vice President of FAS and Fleet Services Rick Shock was named the Industry Leader at the Texas Oil and Gas Awards Wednesday night in Houston, Texas.\n\"It is truly humbling to be recognized for this award and an honor to be named an Industry Leader in my home state,\" said Shock. \"I've dedicated my life to this industry and making sure our teams are kept safe in the field. They're really the ones who deserve recognition.\"\nShock presented the idea of a fully automated fueling system for frac sites called the Fuel Automation Station to Atlas upon joining the team in 2015. These FAS units drastically improve the safety of frac site workers by taking them out of the \"hot zone\". Each FAS unit is dedicated to major E & P and completions companies featuring as many as 28 hose reels to accommodate the growing needs of frac sites.\nShock has over 39 years of experience in the oil industry and remains extremely involved in the Texas community, serving on the board of a local nonprofitâ€”C.A.S.T. for Kids.\nAtlas was named a finalist in two additional award categories including \"Award for Excellence in Health and Safety\" and \"Trucking Company of the Year\".\n\"Atlas has grown tremendously over the past few years, but we've refused to lose sight of our commitment to safety and customer service,\" said Atlas President Robert Kenyon , who attended the award ceremony along with key members of Atlas' leadership team. \"As we expand our oilfield services throughout the country, we're continuing to fuel innovation for our customers with best-in-class service, equipment, and technology.\"\nAbout Atlas Oil Company\nHeadquartered in Taylor, Mich., Atlas Oil is the inaugural Simon Group Holdings company.
