    "text": "March 20, 2018 / 7:35 PM / Updated an hour ago Cambridge Analytica CEO said firm played key Trump campaign role-UK TV Reuters Staff 2 Min Read LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - The suspended chief executive of UK-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica claimed in secretly recorded video that his company played a decisive role in the 2016 election campaign of President Donald Trump, Channel 4 News reported on Tuesday. British broadcaster Channel 4 News mounted a “sting operation” in which it secretly recorded Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Alexander Nix saying he had met the then Republican presidential candidate“many times” and that his firm played a central role in the final months of the campaign. “We did all the research. We did all the data. We did all the analytics. We did all the targetting. We ran all the digital campaign and our data informed their strategy,” Nix told an undercover reporter during a meeting in a London hotel. Nix was suspended by the board of directors of Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday, the company said in a statement, shortly before the second part of the British news programme’s expose on the company.
