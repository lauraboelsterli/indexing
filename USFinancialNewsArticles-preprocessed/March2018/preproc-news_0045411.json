The Australian ASX200 was off 0.5 percent on Monday, with investors continuing to fret over the looming prospect of a tit-for-tat trade war. \n\"Australia is a pragmatic player and what I mean by that is we adopt a position of principle in a range of different areas and we stay hard and firm to those principles,\" Ciobo said. \n\"We're always up front and we don't play games about it and I think that makes a big difference,\" he added. 'No-one wins from a trade war' \nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday that could see charges implemented on up to $60 billion of imports from China, though the proposed measures have a 30-day consultation period before they take effect. \nThe tariffs follow additional duties on steel and aluminum imports on a number of countries worldwide, including China, with the world's second-largest economy hitting back with its own plans to impose charges on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports. \nAustralia is thought to be especially vulnerable position to an ongoing trade dispute between the world's two largest economies â€” in large part because its biggest trading partner is Beijing. Ciobo said that while Australia was not unique in terms of its exposure to China, it does currently have $175 billion worth of two-way trade deals with the Asian giant. Cheriss May | NurPhoto | Getty Images \nSpeaking to reporters in Sydney shortly after Trump signed the memorandum, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: \"No-one wins from a trade war.\" \n\"We look forward to the U.S. and China being able to negotiate a satisfactory arrangement that suits both sides,\" he added.
