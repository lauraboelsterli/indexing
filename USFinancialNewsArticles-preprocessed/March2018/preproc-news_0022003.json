    "text": "Announced Achievement of Primary Endpoint and Additional Key Data from Low-Dose\nMavacamten Cohort of PIONEER-HCM Phase 2 Study in Symptomatic, Obstructive\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\nCompany to Host Conference Call and Webcast Today at 4:30 p.m. ET (1:30 p.m. PT)\nSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MyoKardia, Inc. (Nasdaq:MYOK), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a precision medicine approach for the treatment of heritable cardiovascular diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, the company also announced positive results from the PIONEER-HCM Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, including results from the low-dose cohort, in a press release issued this afternoon.\n“Following an eventful and important year of progress, we are poised in 2018 to move closer to achieving our mission to change the lives of patients suffering from serious cardiovascular diseases,” said Tassos Gianakakos, Chief Executive Officer. “As we prepare to initiate our Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM pivotal trial, the additional PIONEER-HCM study data announced today increase our confidence in mavacamten’s potential to help patients with oHCM. This enthusiasm carries over into our growing clinical pipeline, which also includes the Phase 2 study of mavacamten in non-obstructive HCM and the continued clinical study of MYK-491 in dilated cardiomyopathy patients.”\nFull Year 2017 and Recent Clinical Program Highlights\nMavacamten for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)\nMavacamten Met Primary Endpoint and Key Secondary Endpoints of PIONEER-HCM Study in Both Study Cohorts: In the PIONEER-HCM Phase 2 clinical trial of 21 symptomatic obstructive HCM patients, mavacamten achieved the primary endpoint of reduction in post-exercise left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient from baseline to week 12 with statistical significance across both cohorts tested. Improvements in peak VO 2 , New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and dyspnea rating scores were also observed. Mavacamten was generally well-tolerated.\nMavacamten Activity was Persistent and Safety was not Discernably Impacted by Use of Background Beta Blockers: Benefits were observed across endpoints among those taking once-daily 2mg and 5mg doses of mavacamten who remained on background beta blocker therapy (“Cohort B”), and those who received daily doses ranging from 10mg, 15mg and 20mg who had discontinued background medications (as presented at the Heart Failure Society of America Annual Meeting in September 2017).\nTarget Concentration Range Identified to Inform EXPLORER-HCM Trial: The PIONEER-HCM study has informed a target concentration range at which mavacamten is expected to achieve a clinical improvement in oHCM symptoms (e.g., NYHA class) and exercise capacity (peak VO 2 ) while maintaining normal ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 50 percent. Data from the PIONEER-HCM study will guide the starting dose and inform dose-adjustments for MyoKardia’s planned Phase 3 pivotal EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial expected to start in the second quarter of 2018.\nMavacamten Registration Program Outlined with FDA in September: MyoKardia established key elements of the registration program for mavacamten in symptomatic oHCM, including the Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial and a planned long-term extension study in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products during an end-of-Phase 2 meeting following results from the first cohort of the PIONEER-HCM clinical trial.\nPresented New Data at AHA : MyoKardia researchers presented new digital health and in vivo preclinical data related to its mavacamten program at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in November 2017.\nMYK-491 for Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)\nFirst-in-Human Phase 1 Clinical Trial of MYK-491 Completed: In a single-ascending dose study of healthy volunteers, MYK-491 was generally well tolerated across the range of oral doses tested. Adverse events (AE) observed were benign and transient. Evidence of clinical proof-of-mechanism was observed at higher dose levels in the form of increased contractility, as measured by echocardiographic biomarkers.\nMYK-491 Phase 1b Study in DCM Patients Initiated: A single-ascending dose study of MYK-491 in symptomatic DCM patients was initiated with first patients dosed in February 2018. The objectives of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b trial are to assess safety, tolerability, preliminary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MYK-491 in DCM patients.\nCorporate Updates\nKevin Starr, Partner at Third Rock Ventures, has resigned from MyoKardia’s Board. MyoKardia thanks Mr. Starr for his significant contributions to the company’s formation and growth. He was not a member of any board committees.\nCynthia Ladd joined MyoKardia as General Counsel in January 2018.\n2018 Anticipated Milestones\nPresent complete results from PIONEER-HCM Phase 2 clinical trial of mavacamten in symptomatic oHCM patients, including data from Cohort B assessing lower doses, during the “Highlighted Original Research: Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathies and the Year in Review” session at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 67 th Annual Scientific Session on March 11, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. ET\nBegin Pivotal Study EXPLORER-HCM for Mavacamten in Symptomatic oHCM\n-- Finalize EXPLORER-HCM Phase 3 protocol to assess mavacamten for the treatment of symptomatic oHCM and provide a regulatory update in the second quarter 2018\n-- Initiate patient dosing in the Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial of mavacamten in second quarter 2018\n-- Initiate patient dosing in the long term EXPLORER-HCM extension study before the end of 2018\nBegin open-label extension study for patients who participated in the Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM clinical trial of mavacamten in second quarter 2018 (PIONEER-OLE clinical trial)\nInitiate Phase 2 MAVERICK-HCM clinical study of mavacamten for the treatment of non-obstructive HCM (nHCM) in first quarter 2018\nReport topline data from Phase 1b clinical trial of MYK-491 in DCM patients in the second half of 2018\nBegin Phase 2 clinical trial of MYK-491 in DCM patients in second half of 2018\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nCash Position: Cash and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2017 were $224.6 million, compared to $135.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Investments (short-term and long-term) as of December 31, 2017 were $51.8 million, compared to $16.1 million as December 31, 2016. The increase in the company’s cash position is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the follow-on offering of common stock.\nRevenues: Collaboration and license revenue was $5.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $28.6 million during the same period in 2016. Full-year collaboration and license revenue was $22.5 million compared to $39.2 million for the full year 2016. The decrease in collaboration revenue in 2017 was attributable to recognition of a $25.0 million one-time milestone payment in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the submission of an Investigational New Drug application for MYK-491 with the FDA in November 2016.\nR&D Expenses: Research and development expenses, before consideration of $7.3 million in cost sharing for registration program plan (RPP) costs for the fourth quarter 2017 were $15.5 million, up from $10.0 million for the same period in 2016. Research and development expenses were $48.1 million for the full year 2017, compared to $36.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in R&D expenses over the course of 2017 were primarily driven by the company’s ongoing clinical studies, including the Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM clinical study for mavacamten and the Phase 1 study for MYK-491, expansion of R&D staff and increased costs for contract research, chemistry and biology expenses on discovery and preclinical programs.\nG&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $5.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.3 million for the same period in 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, G&A expenses were $22.0 million, compared to $16.3 million for the prior year. The change in G&A expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in employee headcount, marketing and recruiting expenses and stock compensation expenses.\nNet Loss : Net loss was $7.4 million ($0.21 loss per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net income of $14.3 million ($0.46 net income per share, basic or $0.44 net income per share, fully diluted) for the fourth quarter of 2016. For full year 2017, net loss was $46.0 million ($1.40 loss per share), compared to $13.1 million ($0.48 loss per share) for the same period in 2016. The net loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the net income per share in 2016 was due to the $25 million received in the fourth quarter of 2016 as noted above.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nBased on its current operating plans, MyoKardia expects that its cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2017, together with anticipated payments from Sanofi under its collaboration agreement, will fund anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2020.\nConference Call and Webcast\nMyoKardia management will host a conference call and live audio webcast today, March 8, at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT to review data from the Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM clinical trial, as well as fourth quarter and year end 2017 financial results.

MyoKardia’s initial focus is on the treatment of heritable cardiomyopathies, a group of rare, genetically driven forms of heart failure that result from biomechanical defects in cardiac muscle contraction. MyoKardia has used its precision medicine platform to generate a pipeline of therapeutic programs for the chronic treatment of two of the most prevalent forms of heritable cardiomyopathy – hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MyoKardia’s most advanced product candidate is mavacamten (formerly MYK-461), a novel, oral, allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin intended to reduce hypercontractility. Mavacamten is advancing into a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, known as EXPLORER-HCM in patients with symptomatic, obstructive HCM and a Phase 2 trial, the MAVERICK-HCM study, in patients with non-obstructive HCM. MYK-491, MyoKardia’s second product candidate, is designed to increase the overall extent of the heart’s contraction in DCM patients by increasing cardiac contractility. MyoKardia is currently evaluating MYK-491 in a Phase 1b study in DCM patients. A cornerstone of the MyoKardia platform is the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), a multi-center, international repository of clinical and laboratory data on individuals and families with genetic heart disease, which MyoKardia helped form in 2014. MyoKardia’s mission is to change the world for patients with serious cardiovascular disease through bold and innovative science.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements we make in this press release may include statements which are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are usually identified by the use of words such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"seeks,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" and variations of such words or similar expressions.
