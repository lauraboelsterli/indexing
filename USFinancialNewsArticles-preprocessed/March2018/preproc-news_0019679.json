    "text": "KINSHASA, March 7 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila plans “shortly” to sign into law a new mining code that is vigorously opposed by industry, the government said on Wednesday.\nThe announcement followed a nearly six-hour meeting between Kabila and mining executives in Kinshasa about the new code, which will raise taxes and remove a stability clause in the current law protecting miners from fiscal changes for 10 years.\nThe miners’ concerns “will be taken into account through a constructive dialogue with the government after the promulgation of the new mining law”, a government statement said.
