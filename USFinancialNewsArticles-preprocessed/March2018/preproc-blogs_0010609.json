A lawyer for the soldiers had requested their release earlier on Monday, CNN Turk said. The two were detained last week near the northeastern Greek border after straying onto the Turkish side while on patrol in bad weather, according to Greeceâ€™s army command. A Greek government spokesman had said it expected their swift return. Reporting by Ezgi Erkoyun; Writing by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by David Dolan",
