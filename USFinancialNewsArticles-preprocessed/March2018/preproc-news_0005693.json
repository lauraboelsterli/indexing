    "text": "It's a myth that workers' foremost concerns when looking for a job is finding a company that will offer fancy bells and whistles — bean bags, ping pong tables and craft beer. The truth is that for most workers, pay and benefits are what matters most . In fact, almost one-third of millennials say they would break up with their significant other for a raise .\nThat's why job site Indeed analyzed over 18 million company reviews from current and former employees to see which workplaces were the most generous with compensation. Indeed considered factors such as hourly pay, health care, dental care, parental leave and company matching for retirement plans.\nThey found that the top 15 companies weren't all Silicon Valley tech startups , but rather that organizations from a range of industries across the country managed to make their workers feel respected and taken care of — regardless of whether they offered ping pong tables. \nHere are the 15 best companies for pay and benefits: \nPatrick T.

Kaiser Permanente Headquarters: Oakland, California\nYear founded: 1945\n1. Costco Headquarters: Issaquah, Washington\nYear founded: 1983\nLuke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty Images A bakery employee distributes baked goods onto a display rack inside a Costco Wholesale store in Nashville, Tennessee. Wholesale retailer Costco topped Indeed's list of the best companies for pay and compensation. Costco currently pays all employees more than $13 an hour, well above the minimum wage.\n\"They have a graduated wage program that's based purely on total hours worked. Show up, do your job and your pay goes up on its own,\" says one Costco employee. Another employee said that their benefits were \"second to none.\"\nShipping services company FedEx ranked fourth on Indeed's list, thanks in part to the generous benefits they provide part-time employees.\n\"FedEx provided me a great job with great benefits. I worked there for 20 years with great vacation time, benefits, stability and a great environment. It is a company that still provides a pension, which in these days is rare,\" said one employee.\n\"I had medical, dental, vision benefits that usually are reserved for full-time employees, even though I am a permanent part-time worker,\" another explained.\nSeveral companies on the list provided benefits beyond healthcare and retirement. \n\"They offer education reimbursement and great discounts,\" raved one Apple employee .\n\"Apple offers many benefits like a gym and a doctor's office on campus,\" listed a second Apple employee. \"High-quality dining, on-campus events including beer bashes and bbq cook-offs during work hours, a host of Apple-specific benefits.\"\nLike this story?
