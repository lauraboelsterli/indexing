    "text": "BRENTWOOD, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quorum Health Corporation (NYSE: QHC) (the “Company”) today announced its preliminary operating and financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. These results are unaudited and subject to the finalization of the Company’s regular financial and accounting procedures.\nPreliminary Results for the Fourth Quarter 2017\nThe Company expects operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 to approximately reflect the following:\nNet operating revenues of approximately $515 million, compared to $515 million for the same period in 2016. Net loss attributable to Quorum Health Corporation of approximately $(27) million, compared to $(91) million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $49 million, compared to $31 million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures of approximately $54 million, compared to $44 million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures, is further adjusted to exclude the effect of the divestiture of two hospitals in 2016 and five hospitals in 2017 (collectively, “the divested hospitals”). Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures of approximately $57 million, compared to $46 million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures, is further retrospectively adjusted to exclude the effect of seven hospitals intended for divestiture over the next twelve to twenty four months as of December 31, 2017 (collectively, “the potential divestitures”). Approximately $6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.257 billion of total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, including no borrowings under its senior secured revolving credit facility or senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and approximately $831 million outstanding under the senior secured term loan facility.\nThe following items are expected to have a notable impact on the operating results for the fourth quarter of 2017:\nApproximately a $21 million increase to the provision for bad debts as a result of a change in estimate to reduce the net realizable value of its patient accounts receivable. The Company analyzed self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and refined its estimate of the collectability of these accounts. This analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained through the divestitures of six of the Company’s seven divested hospitals as of December 31, 2017. A benefit of approximately $30 million, before provider taxes, to net operating revenues from the California Hospital Quality Assurance Fee (“HQAF”) program, of which $23 million relates to the first three quarters of 2017. Net of provider fees, the benefit from the California HQAF program to Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is expected to approximate $22 million, of which $17 million relate to the first three quarters of 2017. As previously disclosed, the Company was unable to recognize any revenues or Adjusted EBITDA under the California HQAF program during the first three quarters of 2017 because CMS had not completed its approval process, which occurred on December 15, 2017. Due to timing of regulatory approval, the Company was unable to realize approximately $2 million of net operating revenues from the Medicare Low Volume Hospital adjustment associated with the fourth quarter of 2017, which will now be recorded in the first quarter of 2018. When annualized, this adjustment represents an $8 to $10 million benefit to net operating revenues. Approximately a $26 million increase to Net loss attributable to Quorum Health Corporation from impairment charges related to certain hospitals intended for divestiture or closure subsequent to December 31, 2017. Approximately a $5 million adverse impact to Adjusted EBITDA as a result of the divested hospitals, compared to $13 million for the same period in 2016. Approximately a $3 million adverse impact to Adjusted EBITDA resulting from the potential divestitures, compared to $2 million in the same period in 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company received payments for $51 million of the approximate $65 million in arrears from Illinois Medicaid and state employee patients. As a result of these payments, the Company’s days revenue outstanding decreased to 63 days as of December 31, 2017 from 74 days as of September 30, 2017. The Company also received payments for $31 million of the $50 million in outstanding amounts owed to it from the 2014-2016 California HQAF program and anticipates receiving another $19 million during the first half of 2018. In addition, under the 2017-2019 California HQAF program, the Company is expecting to recognize $57 million, net of provider taxes, over the course of the 30 month program, which includes the $22 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPreliminary Results for the Full Year 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company expects net operating revenues to approximate $2.072 billion compared to $2.138 billion for the same period in 2016. Net loss attributable to Quorum Health Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2017 is expected to approximate $(114) million compared to $(348) million for the same period in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 is expected to approximate $142 million compared to $163 million for the same period in 2016. The divested hospitals negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $21 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures, is expected to approximate $163 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $196 million for the same period in 2016. The potential divestitures group negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 by approximately $8 million. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures is expected to approximate $171 million, compared to $188 million for the same period in 2016.\nPreliminary Operating Statistics for the Fourth Quarter and Year End 2017\nUnaudited Operating Statistics\n% Positive (Negative) Variance for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017, Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\nStatistic Same-Facility Hospitals Continuing Hospitals (1) Admissions (2) 0.4% 3.4% Adjusted Admissions (3) 0.6% 3.7% ER Visits 1.5% 2.6% Surgeries 0.8% 6.1% (1)\nContinuing Hospitals are equivalent to Consolidated Hospitals excluding divested hospitals and the potential divestiture group.\n(2)\nAdmissions represent the number of patients admitted for inpatient services\n(3)\nAdjusted admissions is computed by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues\nUnaudited Operating Statistics\n% Positive (Negative) Variance for the Year Ended December 31, 2017, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nStatistic Same-Facility Hospitals Continuing Hospitals (1) Admissions (2) (0.5%) 0.9% Adjusted Admissions (3) 0.4% 2.2% ER Visits (1.5%) (1.0%) Surgeries (0.8%) 1.5% (1)\nContinuing Hospitals are equivalent to Consolidated Hospitals excluding divested hospitals and the potential divestiture group.\n(2)\nAdmissions represent the number of patients admitted for inpatient services\n(3)\nAdjusted admissions is computed by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues\nCurrent Divestiture Program\nThe Company also provided an update to its asset divestiture program. As previously disclosed, the Company’s business strategy includes an ongoing strategic review of its hospitals based on an analysis of financial performance, current competitive conditions, expected demographic trends, joint venture opportunities and capital allocation requirements. As part of this strategy, the Company is actively engaging in initiatives, among others, to divest underperforming hospitals, reduce its debt and refine its portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins. The Company is currently targeting $203 million to $253 million in incremental asset sales over the next twelve to twenty four months, including assets currently under definitive purchase agreements. As of March 1, 2018, the Company had received $47 million in net proceeds from the divestiture of eight hospitals. Since December 31, 2017 the Company has entered into definitive agreements to sell one hospital, completed the sale of a second hospital and has closed a third hospital. In total, this accounts for $250 million to $300 million in cumulative divestures inclusive of completed and pending divestitures. The Company is continuing to market and evaluate the sale of additional hospitals with negative and low-single digit Adjusted EBITDA margins.\nQuorum Health Divestiture Program ($s in millions) Low High Total Targeted Divestiture Program (1) $250 $300 Less: Net divestiture proceeds received as of March 1, 2018 $47 $47 Targeted Future Divestitures (1) $203 $253 (1) Includes one facility currently under a definitive purchase agreement. Other Matters\nIn addition, the Company announced today that it intends to seek an amendment to certain provisions of the Company’s existing senior credit facility. Among these provisions, the Company intends to seek an add-back for compliance EBITDA of $6.7 million relating primarily to the post divestiture write-off of accounts receivable associated with the divested hospitals. As of December 31 2017, the Company believes that it is in compliance with its current financial covenants.\nSubject to the completion of the amendment mentioned above, the Company will issue a press release announcing its completed financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 on Thursday, March 15, 2018 after the market closes. A conference call to discuss these results will be held the next day, Friday, March 16, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central time, 11:00 a.m. Eastern time. A live broadcast of the conference call will be available online at www.quorumhealth.com .

Shares in Quorum Health Corporation are traded on the NYSE under the symbol “QHC.” More information about the Company can be found on its website at www.quorumhealth.com .\nQUORUM HEALTH CORPORATION\nUNAUDITED AND PRELIMINARY SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES\nSELECTED OPERATING DATA\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that consists of net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is EBITDA adjusted to add back the effect of certain legal, professional and settlement costs, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, net loss (gain) on sale of hospitals, transaction costs related to the spin-off from Community Health Systems, Inc. in April 2016, post-spin headcount reductions and changes in estimates related to the collectability of patient accounts receivable. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by the Company’s management to assess the operating performance of its hospital operations business and to make decisions on the allocation of resources. Additionally, management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA in assessing the Company’s results of operations and in comparing the Company’s results of operations between periods. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is further retrospectively adjusted to exclude the effect of EBITDA of hospitals divested in 2016 and 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is further retrospectively adjusted to exclude the effect of EBITDA of seven hospitals that management has identified for potential divestiture over the next twelve to twenty four month period as of December 31, 2017. The Company continually evaluates other hospitals for potential divestiture, which could result in changes to the hospitals included in this group in future periods. The Company has presented Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures in this press release because it believes these measures provide investors and other users of the Company’s financial statements with additional information about how the Company’s management assesses its results of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. These calculations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income or any other measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures are significant components in understanding and evaluating the Company’s financial performance. The Company believes such adjustments are appropriate, as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance. Additionally, the Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles preliminary Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures each as defined above, to preliminary net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, as derived directly from the Company’s unaudited and preliminary financial statements three months ended and year ended December 31, 2017, its unaudited financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nQUORUM HEALTH CORPORATION\nUNAUDITED AND PRELIMINARY SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES\nSELECTED OPERATING DATA\n(Continued)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ (26,023 ) $ (90,092 ) $ (112,357 ) $ (345,197 ) Interest expense, net 31,873 28,684 122,077 113,440 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes (21,779) (3,555 ) (21,865 ) (53,875 ) Depreciation and amortization 18,714 26,434 82,155 117,288 EBITDA 2,785 (38,529) 70,010 (168,344 ) Legal, professional and settlement costs (518) 1,166 6,001 7,342 Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill 25,820 41,470 47,281 291,870 Loss (gain) on sale of hospitals, net (131) 2,150 (5,243 ) 2,150 Transaction costs related to the Spin-off 49 44 253 5,488 Post-spin headcount reductions — 1,617 2,543 1,617 Change in estimate for collectability of patient accounts receivable 21,000 22,799 21,000 22,799 Adjusted EBITDA 49,005 30,717 141,845 162,922 Negative EBITDA of divested hospitals 5,144 13,140 20,637 33,107 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures 54,149 43,857 162,482 196,029 Negative (Positive) EBITDA of potential divestitures 3,114 2,102 8,337 (8,232) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures $ 57,263 $ 45,959 $ 170,819 $ 187,797 Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risk and uncertainties.
