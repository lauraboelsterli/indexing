    "text": "Marvel's Black Panther is continuing its winning streak at the box office. This weekend, it crossed the $1 billion mark in its worldwide box-office totals, after beating out the four-day totals of Disney's last big movie, Star Wars: The Last Jedi . \nBox Office Mojo says the latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the first to stay in the top box-office slot for four straight weeks . The film was helped by a solid debut in China this weekend, where it earned $66.5 million in its first three days, according to Variety .\nMore from The Verge: Black Panther is the grown-up Marvel movie we've been waiting for \nSXSW 2018: news, films, panels, and activations from Austin, Texas' multimedia festival \nThe Ready Player One tie-in games' final boss is copyright law \nThe massive box office haul only adds to the impressive set of records that the film has already shattered: the largest February debut of all time ( beating Deadpool ), the second largest Marvel debut (after The Avengers ), and the highest grossing film by a black director.",
