    "text": "Internal Justice Watchdog to Review Surveillance of Ex-Trump Adviser \nMarch 28, 2018 3:58 p.m. ET \nWASHINGTON—The Justice Department’s internal watchdog unit will investigate how the FBI and federal prosecutors obtained warrants from the nation’s secret spy court to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser, the inspector general’s office said Wednesday. \nThe statement confirms an investigation that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had requested and disclosed last month. \nThe inspector general will examine the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s compliance with legal requirements in its application for warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, said in the statement. \nRepublican lawmakers have alleged abuses in how top law-enforcement officials sought in 2016 to monitor the former campaign adviser, \nCarter Page. \nThey have alleged that officials didn’t properly disclose to the court the partisan motivations of information they received from an ex-British spy, whose work in gathering the information was being funded by Democratic Party intermediaries. \nA separate memo from Democrats defended federal investigators’ handling of the surveillance. It said the FBI had relied on information beyond what the ex-spy, \nChristopher Steele, \nprovided, had corroborated some of his report and had told the court about Mr. Steele’s motivations. \nThe inspector general will also look at what information the FBI and Justice Department knew about a source that provided information used in the application, the statement said. \nSeparately, the inspector general has been reviewing the FBI’s handling of its probe into \nHillary Clinton’s \nuse of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Some of its findings led to the dismissal of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe this month. \nMr. Sessions’ referral of the issue to the inspector general raised President \nDonald Trump’s \nire last month. “Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse,” he tweeted , adding the decision was “DISGRACEFUL!”. \nComplaints about alleged wrongdoing by Justice Department personnel are generally referred to the inspector general to examine. At the time, Mr. Sessions said he would continue to discharge his duties with “integrity and honor” and the agency would work in a “fair and impartial manner.” \nWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT",
