    "text": "(Adds shares, background)\nMarch 27 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp has temporarily suspended self-driving tests across the globe, a source told Reuters at the GPU conference in San Jose, California, a week after an Uber Technologies Inc self-driving car hit and killed a woman crossing the street.\nThe company's shares reversed course in afternoon trading on Tuesday after the news and were down 4 percent at $234.50, wiping out nearly $6 billion in market value.\nThe chipmaker, which has provided technology to Uber's self-driving cars, is testing self-driving technology globally including in New Jersey, Santa Clara, Japan and Germany.\nNvidia leads the autonomous industry with its artificial intelligence platform and has partnered with major global automakers such as Volkswagen AG, Tesla Inc and Audi AG.\nAround 320 companies involved in self-driving cars - from software developers, automakers and their suppliers, sensor and mapping companies - use Nvidia Drive platform, according to the company's website.\n\"Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being,\" Roger Lanctot, an auto analyst at Strategy Analytics, wrote in a blog post https://bit.ly/2GaIBCN on Tuesday.\n\"This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib,\" Lanctot wrote.\nUber has suspended North American tests of its self-driving vehicles after the accident.\n(Reporting by Alexandria Sage in San Fransisco and Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",
