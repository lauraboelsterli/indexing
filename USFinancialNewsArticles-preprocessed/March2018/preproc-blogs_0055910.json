    "text": "GRAINS-Wheat falls to more than one-month low Published 4 Hours Ago Reuters \nSYDNEY, March 27 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures slipped on Tuesday to more than a one-month low, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture said crops in a key producing region improved last week, easing fears of widespread crop losses from recent dry weather. \nFUNDAMENTALS \n* The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were down 0.3 percent to $4.52-3/4 a bushel by 0023 GMT, having closed down 1.3 percent on Monday when prices hit a low of $4.46-1/2 a bushel - the lowest since Feb. 22. \n* The most active soybean futures were little changed at $10.25 a bushel, having closed down 0.3 percent on Monday. \n* The most active corn futures were up 0.1 percent to $3.74-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 0.9 percent in the previous session. \n* U.S. grain and soybean futures supported as market takes comfort that China has not named those products for possible tariff increases. \n* However, Chinese buyers of soybeans, the United States' biggest agricultural export to the country, have been quietly drawing up contingency plans to ensure supplies of critical raw materials in the event of a trade war, sources said. \n* The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) late on Monday rated 13 percent of top winter wheat producer Kansas in good-to-excellent condition, up from 11 percent a week earlier. \n* Rains expected to relieve Argentina's drought-hit soy and corn crops failed to materialize over the weekend, all but ending hope that yields might recover from four months of unrelenting sun with more heat and dryness expected over the days ahead. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The U.S. dollar fell to a five-week low against a basket of major currencies on Monday, as optimism that the United States and China are set to begin negotiations on trade helped ease fears of a trade war and investors' appetite for risk improved. \n* Crude oil futures slipped on Monday as investors cashed in some profits from last week's rally but concerns about Saudi-Iran tensions kept losses in check. Wall Street scored its best day in 2-1/2 years and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its third-biggest point gain ever on Monday, as trade war fears eased on reports the United States and China are willing to renegotiate tariffs and trade imbalances. \nGrains prices at 0023 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 452.75 -1.50 -0.33% -1.63% 476.57 34 CBOT corn 374.50 0.50 +0.13% -0.73% 380.49 38 CBOT soy 1025.00 -0.50 -0.05% -0.32% 1043.53 41 CBOT rice 12.45 -$0.02 -0.12% +0.69% $12.34 62 WTI crude 65.59 $0.04 +0.06% -0.44% $62.35 70 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.245 $0.001 +0.06% +0.80% USD/AUD 0.7747 0.000 +0.01% +0.66% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
