    "text": "CONCORD, Mass., March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reflecting growing demand for its new SaaS platform and the critical need of global clients to know, reduce the cost of, and transform their networks, GSG today announced it has renamed the company “Sakon,” effective immediately.\nThe move follows the successful January 2018 launch of the Sakon platform, which helps the C-suite and Procurement and Network Service leaders precisely map their entire global network and its costs, manage IT more cost-effectively, and prove the ROI of critical new network investments – all through a single platform . With capabilities spanning IT cost and lifecycle management (including TEM, MMS, and SaaS applications), employee enablement, and network transformation, Sakon delivers a breakthrough information and execution advantage rooted in a mastery of network and end-user inventory.\nThis expertise has made Sakon a destination for Fortune 500 companies seeking a) relief from failed TEM implementations, b) help managing the proliferation of mobility and SaaS applications across their businesses, and c) a partner in evolving their networks to meet strategic demand for growth and innovation.\nHighlighting these strengths, AOTMP notes in a new white paper on the company: “Financial considerations remain important, of course, but they no longer constitute the only ones critical to administering the technology/mobility/telecom environment. Now more than ever, the CIO must innovate while maintaining operational excellence – and continue to adhere to budgetary and practical constraints. Cloud spending is increasing, and business transformation is accelerating rapidly. All of these trends call for expert, experienced guidance. Enter Sakon, formerly GSG.”\nAdded Hyoun Park, Amalgam Insights, in a recent Market Milestone : “Sakon is an important SaaS platform in the technology vendor management space, both in its breadth of network, telecom, mobility, IoT, and SaaS management capabilities and in providing a signature platform for the direct go-to-market efforts of a Top 5 Global TEM solution. Global 2000 organizations should consider Sakon if they are seeking to manage telecom, mobility, Internet of Things, and/or Software as a Service portfolios that have expanded to multi-million-dollar responsibilities with complex inventories.”\nConcluded Andy Goorno, CEO of Sakon: “Response to the Sakon platform and the expanded set of capabilities we are delivering to the enterprise has been overwhelming. By focusing for the last decade on the network needs of customers and diligently building out the technology and services to successfully meet them, we now find ourselves in the sweet spot of an enormous and transformative market opportunity. ‘ Know your network ’ has never been more critical to the success of the enterprise, and, as Sakon, we are perfectly positioned to deliver on that promise.”\nAbout Sakon\nSakon, formerly GSG, is a telecom and network technology leader that has helped global enterprises organize, understand, and intelligently manage their communications ecosystems since 2003. With headquarters in Concord, Massachusetts and a Global Delivery Center in Pune, India, the Sakon team numbers more than 400 employees worldwide.
