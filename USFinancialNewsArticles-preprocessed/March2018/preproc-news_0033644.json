Leftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador greets his supporters after being registered as a presidential candidate of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) in Mexico City, Mexico March 16, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Romero The leftist, who is running for president for the third time, promises to end corruption and fight inequality without disrupting the economy. Critics fear he will put the brakes on economic reforms brought in by President Enrique Pena Nieto.

Leftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, accompanied by his wife Beatriz Gutierrez Mueller, addresses his supporters after being registered as a presidential candidate of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) in Mexico City, Mexico March 16, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Romero Mexican presidents are permitted only one term of six years, and the 64-year-old Lopez Obrador said last week he would not be seeking to change the law to allow him to run again. Lopez Obrador cited famous Mexican presidents Benito Juarez, Francisco I. Madero and Lazaro Cardenas, saying he wanted to be remembered as one of the country’s best leaders.

Mexico’s constitution does not mention recall referendums. He repeated his plan to amend an article in the constitution to make it possible to try presidents for corruption.
