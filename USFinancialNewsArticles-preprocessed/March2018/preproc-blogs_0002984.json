    "text": "Mylan said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings fell due to declining revenue from its EpiPen emergency allergy injector and weak U.S. prices for generic drugs.\nThe drugmaker reported net income of $244.3 million, or 46 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $417.5 million, or 78 cents a share, last year.\nExcluding one-time items, the company said it earned $1.43 a share. Analysts on average were expecting $1.41, according to Thomson Reuters.\nRevenue in the quarter fell 1 percent to $3.24 billion, coming in below the average analyst expectation of $3.3 billion.\nMylan forecast adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.20 to $5.60 for 2018, in line with analyst estimates.\nWATCH: Sen.
