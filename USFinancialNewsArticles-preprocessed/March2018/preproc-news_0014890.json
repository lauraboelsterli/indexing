    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoWeb, Inc. (Nasdaq:AUTO), a pioneer and leading provider of digital automotive services connecting in-market car buyers with dealers and OEMs, is reporting financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. For year-over-year comparisons, certain prior year results are adjusted to exclude the company’s specialty finance leads product, which was divested on December 31, 2016.\nFourth Quarte r 2017 Financial Summary vs. Year-Ago Quarter\nTotal revenues were $33.3 million compared to $40.4 million (adjusted $39.0 million). Advertising revenues increased 14% to $9.2 million, with click revenues up 23% to $7.9 million. Net loss was $65.8 million or $(5.22) per share, compared to net income of $1.4 million or $0.10 per share. Net loss included a non-cash charge to income tax of $25.4 million, as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $37.7 million. Non-GAAP income was $0.1 million or $0.01 per share, compared to non-GAAP income of $4.7 million or $0.35 per share.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Summary vs. 2016\nTotal revenues were $142.1 million compared to $156.7 million (adjusted $150.4 million). Advertising revenues increased 39% to $34.1 million, with click revenues up 56% to $28.3 million. Net loss was $65.0 million or $(5.48) per share, compared to net income of $3.9 million or $0.29 per share (adjusted $3.7 million or $0.28 per share). Non-GAAP income was $8.5 million or $0.64 per share, compared to non-GAAP income of $17.3 million or $1.30 per share (adjusted $16.8 million or $1.27 per share).\nManagement Commentary\n“The board and I have been discussing a succession plan for several months,” said Jeff Coats, president & CEO of AutoWeb. “After more than a decade of leading AutoWeb and 20 years on its board of directors, and after the board completes its process and a new CEO is named during the coming months, I will be stepping down to begin the next phase of my life.\n“In addition, Kimberly Boren will be stepping down as CFO, effective April 12, 2018, to pursue another opportunity. Following her departure, Wesley Ozima will be named Interim CFO. The company will initiate a search for a new permanent CFO, but is in very good hands with Wes, as he has served in AutoWeb’s finance and accounting organization for nearly 14 years.\n“Despite recent struggles with our traffic acquisition, we’ve dramatically increased the company’s addressable market over the last several years through targeted acquisitions, while establishing AutoWeb as the largest supplier of online leads to every major OEM in the country.\"\n“Turning to the quarterly commentary,” continued Coats, “demand for leads and clicks from our customers remained strong in Q4. However, we were unable to fully meet this demand due to higher traffic acquisition costs. Though our Q4 results certainly weren’t acceptable to us, we believe we have been taking the appropriate actions to address these traffic issues and mitigate the impact to profitability. Just last month, we realigned our headcount and expect it to reduce operating expenses by $2 million on an annual basis.\n“Looking ahead, the company will continue to prudently manage its expenses as it works through this management transition, while also remaining diligent in its initiative to improve traffic acquisition. Despite these recent challenges, we believe AutoWeb remains in a strong market position, and will remain focused on its long-established commitment to delivering quality products for dealers and OEMs.”\nFourth Quarte r 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $33.3 million compared to $39.0 million in the adjusted year-ago quarter. The decline was due to unfulfilled demand for the company’s leads as a result of higher traffic acquisition costs, as well as lower retail dealer count, partially offset by continued strong growth of advertising click revenues, which increased 23% to $7.9 million.\nGross profit in the fourth quarter was $8.1 million compared to $14.6 million (adjusted $14.2 million) in the year-ago quarter, with the decrease driven by increased traffic acquisition and optimization costs. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit was 24.4%.\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $48.4 million compared to $12.8 million (adjusted $12.4 million) in the year-ago quarter, with the increase largely driven by a goodwill impairment charge of $37.7 million.\nNet loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $65.8 million or $(5.22) per share, compared to net income of $1.4 million or $0.10 per share in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by the aforementioned non-cash charge to income tax and goodwill impairment charge.\nNon-GAAP income was $0.1 million or $0.01 per share, compared to non-GAAP income of $4.7 million or $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 (see \"Note about Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for further discussion). The decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned lower revenue and gross margins resulting from traffic constraints.\nAt December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $25.0 million compared to $38.5 million (unadjusted) at December 31, 2016, with the reduction driven by the repayment of term loans and licensing technology from DealerX. Total debt was reduced to $9.0 million compared to $23.1 million (unadjusted) at December 31, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenues in 2017 were $142.1 million compared to an adjusted $150.4 million in 2016.\nAdvertising revenues increased 39% to $34.1 million compared to $24.5 million in 2016, with click revenues up 56% to $28.3 million compared to $18.2 million in 2016.\nGross profit in 2017 was $42.8 million compared to $57.9 million (adjusted $56.3 million) in 2016. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit was 30.1% compared to 37.0% (adjusted 37.4%).\nTotal operating expenses in 2017 were $81.4 million compared to $51.8 million (adjusted $50.5 million) in 2016.\nNet loss in 2017 was $65.0 million or $(5.48) per share, compared to an adjusted net income of $3.7 million or $0.28 per share in 2016.\nNon-GAAP income was $8.5 million or $0.64 per share, compared to an adjusted $16.8 million or $1.27 per share in 2016.\nConferenc e Call\nAutoWeb will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, followed by a question-and-answer session.\nDate: Thursday, March 8, 2018\nTime: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-877-852-2929\nInternational dial-in number: 1-404-991-3925\nConference ID: 1396037\nDuring the call, AutoWeb management will refer to a supplementary slide presentation, which will be available for download in the Investors section of the company's website.\nThe conference call will also be broadcast live at www.autoweb.com (click on “Investors” and then click on “Events & Presentations”).

In light of the company's recent stock repurchases, the company reminds stockholders about AutoWeb's Tax Benefit Preservation Plan dated May 26, 2010, as amended on April 14, 2014 and April 13, 2017 (as amended, the \"Plan\") between the company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent.\nThe Plan was adopted by the company's board of directors to preserve the company's NOLs and other tax attributes, and thus reduce the risk of a possible change of ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Any such change of ownership under Section 382 would limit or eliminate the ability of the company to use its existing NOLs for federal income tax purposes. In general, an ownership change will occur if the company's 5% shareholders, for purposes of Section 382, collectively increase their ownership in the company by an aggregate of more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. The Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that the company experiences such an ownership change by discouraging any person or group from becoming a new 5% shareholder under Section 382. Rights issued under the Plan could be triggered upon the acquisition by any person or group of 4.9% or more of the company's outstanding common stock and could result in substantial dilution of the acquirer's percentage ownership in the company. There is no guarantee that the Plan will achieve the objective of preserving the value of the company's NOLs.\nAs of February 28, 2018, there were 13,074,558 shares of the company's common stock, $0.001 par value, outstanding. Persons or groups considering the acquisition of shares of beneficial ownership of the company's common stock should first evaluate their percentage ownership based on this revised outstanding share number to ensure that the acquisition of shares does not result in beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of outstanding shares. For more information about the Plan, please visit investor.autoweb.com/tax.cfm .\nAbout AutoWeb, Inc.\nAutoWeb, Inc. provides high-quality consumer leads, clicks and associated marketing services to automotive dealers and manufacturers throughout the United States.

The company defines (i) non-GAAP income as GAAP net income before amortization of acquired intangibles, non-cash stock-based compensation, acquisition costs, severance costs, gain or loss on investment or sale, litigation settlements, goodwill impairment and income taxes; and (ii) non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP income divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. In addition to the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures, for year-over-year comparisons, prior year results for all periods presented are adjusted to exclude the company’s specialty finance leads product, which was divested on December 31, 2016, which comparisons and prior year results are also non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The company's management believes that presenting non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS and the adjusted year-over-year comparisons and prior year results provides useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company's ongoing operations and are better metrics for monitoring the company's performance given the company's net operating loss (NOL) tax credits and recent acquisitions and divestitures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Tables providing reconciliations of non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS and the adjusted year-over-year comparisons and prior year results are included at the end of this press release.\nForward- Lookin g Statements Disclaimer\nThe statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts are under the federal securities laws.
