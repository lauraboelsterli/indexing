An elevator travels next to electronic boards displaying stock figures at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) building in Mumbai, February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files The broader NSE Nifty closed 1.9 percent higher at 10,421.40, while the benchmark BSE Sensex was up 1.83 percent at 33,917.94.
