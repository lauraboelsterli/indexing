    "text": "12 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—Lawmakers said Tuesday night they were inching closer to a deal to fund the government until October, but they struggled to wrap up negotiations, leaving little time to pass the legislation before current funding expires at week’s end.\nTheir continued wrangling Tuesday over the details of immigration policy, tax provisions and infrastructure projects in the spending bill guaranteed that lawmakers would be racing against the clock later in the week to prevent a third partial government shutdown this year. Current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Lawmakers were hopeful a deal could be announced early Wednesday.\nCongress and President Donald Trump agreed to the bill’s $1.3 trillion funding level last month as part of a two-year budget deal. But they have spent weeks wrestling with the details of how to divvy it up across federal agencies and continued haggling late Tuesday.\n“This is frustrating for a lot of us,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.), noting that lawmakers have known for weeks that the funding deadline was approaching. “The fact that we are struggling to get it done, the deadline’s coming up—is not the way we should be doing business here.”\nTo prevent a partial government shutdown, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the GOP whip, both raised the possibility of passing another short-term spending bill to give Congress more time to pass the larger bill.\n“There may have to be some measures taken to keep the lights on. We’ll get it done,” Mr. Cornyn said.\nHouse lawmakers had expected to vote on the bill Thursday, under the assumption that the spending bill text would be completed later Tuesday night. Missing the Tuesday midnight deadline meant House GOP leaders might be forced to hold a vote with less time than usually required to consider the bill, which would raise objections from many lawmakers.\nThey could also push the vote out until later in the week, but that would delay the bill’s arrival in the Senate, whose time-consuming procedures can be blocked by any one senator.\nObjections from Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) triggered a brief government shutdown last month, and Mr. Paul said Tuesday he was still considering whether to make the same move this week.\n“I haven’t decided,” Mr. Paul said, noting that he wanted to first read the bill once it has been released.\nIf the Senate were to remain in session over the weekend, lawmakers would be in Washington when thousands of students are expected to show up for the “March for our Lives” rally aimed at prodding Congress to pass legislation to reduce gun violence.\nBy Tuesday, a handful of issues were still dividing lawmakers eager to wrap up the spending bill. Democrats and the White House had traded offers over immigration policy and battled over how to parcel out Homeland Security funding. Republicans are pushing to provide funds for building a wall along the border with Mexico, more detention beds and enforcement agents, all of which face resistance from Democrats.\n“That’s where we’re having sticking spots,” said Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs. The spending bill wasn’t expected to include any extension of a program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.\nA proposal to resolve a disparity known as the “grain glitch” in December’s tax law remained in limbo. Lawmakers from both parties have agreed they should scale back an inadvertent tax benefit, created by the tax bill enacted late last year, for farmers who sell to cooperatives. But Democrats’ proposed trade-off—an expansion of the low-income housing tax credit—has met resistance among Republicans.\n“It’s been dead, revived, dead, revived,” said Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), referring to the grain provision.\nThe fate of a proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River also remained unclear. Mr. Trump had threatened to veto the spending bill if it included $900 million funds for the Gateway project.\nLocal officials have said the new tunnel is needed to prevent a catastrophic drop in the capacity of commuter-rail service between New York and New Jersey in the event that one of the existing tunnels must be closed for repairs. Administration officials have said states and cities should be funding these types of projects.\n“This is probably one of the most needed public-works projects,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), warning that problems with the rail tunnels could lead to a national recession. Lawmakers and aides expected the spending bill to leave out provisions overhauling congressional policies on sexual harassment. The House passed a bill last month that would ban lawmakers from using taxpayer funds to pay for settlements and would require regular reports on sexual harassment in Congress. Some Senate Republicans had objections to details of the legislation and wanted to make changes to the bill outside of the spending debate, aides said.\nThe spending bill is expected to face some opposition from members in both parties, meaning its passage will depend on a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers closer to the political center to pass it. Conservatives objected to spending levels that they said exacerbated the federal deficit.\nMany Democrats said they are frustrated the bill doesn’t include protections for young immigrants known as Dreamers and that they still hadn’t seen the bill by Tuesday afternoon.\n“They want our votes, they’ve got to wheel and deal,” said Rep. Linda Sanchez (D., Calif.), referring to GOP leaders. “That’s the bottom line, and they seem to forget that.”\n—Richard Rubin and Ted Mann contributed to this article.\nWrite to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com",
