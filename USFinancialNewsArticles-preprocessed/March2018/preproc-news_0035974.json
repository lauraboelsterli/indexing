    "text": "DENVER, March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) today announced that it has hired Chris Brandt as chief marketing officer, effective April 2. Brandt will report to chief executive officer Brian Niccol.\nMost recently, Brandt was at Bloomin' Brands, where he served as executive vice president and chief brand officer across Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's, Bonefish Grill, and Fleming's. In this capacity, he oversaw a 75-person brand team and held responsibility for product innovation, brand positioning, product pipeline development, consumer insights, creative strategy and development, media strategy, loyalty, and digital marketing across all four dining concepts.\n\"Chris is an extremely talented and effective marketing executive,\" said Brian Niccol, CEO at Chipotle. \"Having worked with Chris in the past, I have seen first-hand his ability to generate sales overnight and build brands over time. His experience and expertise make him an ideal fit for our leadership team at Chipotle as we look to reinvigorate this exceptional brand, and build sales, transactions and profitability.\"\nPrior to his time at Bloomin' Brands, Brandt served as chief brand and marketing officer at YUM! Brands' Taco Bell, where he led marketing and food innovation. He oversaw numerous successful new products including Doritos Locos Tacos and the quesalupa, new dayparts such as Happier Hour and breakfast, digital initiatives such as the Taco Bell app, as well as other innovative media and sponsorship programs. Before joining Taco Bell, he held senior level marketing and brand development positions with Odwalla/Coca Cola and General Mills.\n\"I have admired the Chipotle brand both as a consumer and a marketer over the years,\" said Brandt. \"I'm excited to join the company during this pivotal time and to work with the rest of the leadership team to help reignite the brand and increase relevance with consumers.\"\nBrandt holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics from the University of California, San Diego, and a Master's Degree in Business Administration from the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nABOUT CHIPOTLE\nSteve Ells, founder and executive chairman, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in an interactive style allowing people to get exactly what they want. Chipotle seeks out extraordinary ingredients that are not only fresh, but that are raised responsibly, with respect for the animals, land, and people who produce them. Chipotle prepares its food using real, wholesome ingredients, without the use of added colors, flavors or other additives typically found in fast food. Chipotle opened with a single restaurant in Denver in 1993 and now operates more than 2,400 restaurants.
