(Reuters) - The search for life’s sweetest but most elusive treasure - happiness - brings nearly 1,200 Yale University undergraduates twice a week into an enormous hall on the Connecticut school’s campus for its most popular class ever. \n“Psychology and the Good Life” is such a hit that one in four undergraduate students at the Ivy League university is enrolled in the spring semester course, said Laurie Santos, the psychology professor who teaches the class. It is the largest class enrollment size in the history of Yale, founded in 1701. \nWhat is the draw? Santos says it is the hope that science can help students find blissful relief from the misery that has reached at all-time high at colleges. \n“Students report being more depressed than they have ever been in history at college, more anxious,” she said. \nSocial science has generated many new insights into what makes people happy and how they can achieve that, Santos said. \n“They really want to learn those insights in an empirical, science-driven way,” she said, referring to students enrolled in the course. \nThe third-oldest university in the United States, Yale boasts many famous alumni, including presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and actors Paul Newman and Meryl Streep. \nSantos said feelings of happiness are fostered through socialization, exercise, meditation and plenty of sleep. Money and possessions are often seen as goals in the game of life, but the route to happiness heads in a different direction, she said.
