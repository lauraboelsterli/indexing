    "text": "NEW YORK, Notice is hereby given that Monteverde & Associates PC has filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for The District of Delaware, Case No. 1:18-cv-00301, on behalf of shareholders of Alliqua BioMedical, Inc., (\"Alliqua\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ALQA) who held Alliqua securities and have been harmed by Alliqua and its Board of Directors (the \"Board\") for alleged violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, including certain assets comprising its MIST, Biovance, and Interfyl product lines (the \"Purchased Assets\"), to Celularity Inc. (\"Celularity\").\nUnder the terms of the asset purchase agreement (the \"Agreement\"), Alliqua will receive $29 million in cash for the Purchased Assets (the \"Asset Consideration\"). The complaint alleges that this offer is inadequate and that the Preliminary Proxy Statement on a Schedule 14A (the \"Proxy\") provides materially incomplete and misleading information about the Company's financials and the transaction, in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Specifically, the Proxy contains materially incomplete and misleading information concerning: (i) the valuation analyses conducted by the Company's financial advisor, Cowen and Company, LLC (\"Cowen\"), in support of its fairness opinion; and (ii) the background process leading up to the Agreement.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than 60 days from today.
