    "text": "LEXINGTON, Mass., March 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALDX) (Aldeyra), a biotechnology company devoted to development of next-generation medicines to improve the lives of patients with inflammatory diseases, today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"2017 was a productive year for Aldeyra, highlighted by favorable clinical results in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial in noninfectious anterior uveitis, and receipt of orphan drug designation for reproxalap in Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome,\" commented Todd C. Brady, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Aldeyra. \"Our progress has continued in 2018, having recently enrolled the first patient into our Phase 2b dry eye disease clinical trial, and with the signing of our development partnership with Janssen Research & Development, a Johnson & Johnson company. We look forward to sharing important milestones across multiple pipeline programs in 2018.\"\nKey 2017 Highlights and Upcoming Events\nReported favorable Phase 2a clinical data in dry eye disease and initiated enrollment of Phase 2b clinical trial. In September 2017, Aldeyra reported positive results from a randomized, dose-ranging, parallel-group, double-masked Phase 2a clinical trial of topical ocular reproxalap in dry eye disease patients. Reproxalap demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvement across multiple sign and symptom scores. Improvements in dry eye disease signs and symptoms were evident within one week of therapy and effect sizes increased over the duration of therapy, supportive of rapid drug activity relative to standard of care. Aldeyra enrolled its first patient into a Phase 2b clinical trial of reproxalap in dry eye disease in January 2018, and expects to report results in the second half of 2018.\nPlanned initiation of Phase 3 clinical trial in allergic conjunctivitis. Based on an End of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following favorable results from Aldeyra's Phase 2b clinical trial in allergic conjunctivitis, Aldeyra plans to begin a Phase 3 allergic conjunctivitis clinical trial of topical ocular reproxalap in the first half of 2018. Results of the Phase 3 clinical trial are expected in the second half of 2018, or early 2019.\nPresented Phase 2 clinical results in noninfectious anterior uveitis (NAU) at ophthalmic medical conferences and initiated Phase 3 clinical trial. In May 2017, Dr. John Sheppard, an internationally recognized expert in anterior ocular inflammation, presented the results of Aldeyra's Phase 2 clinical trial of topical ocular reproxalap in NAU as an Emerging Treatments paper at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2017 Annual Meeting. Data from the trial demonstrated activity comparable to Pred Forte®, a standard-of-care topical ocular corticosteroid, in reducing anterior chamber inflammatory cell count in patients with active NAU, without increasing intraocular pressure, a major side effect of corticosteroids. In November 2017, Dr. Sheppard presented additional analyses of Aldeyra's Phase 2 clinical trial at the American Uveitis Society held at the American Academy of Ophthalmology 2017 Annual Meeting. The results of the analyses demonstrated formal statistical non-inferiority of 0.5% reproxalap ophthalmic solution to Pred Forte® in reducing anterior chamber inflammatory cell count. The results also demonstrated that the combination of reproxalap and sub-therapeutic (twice-daily) Pred Forte® administration was also statistically non-inferior to Pred Forte® monotherapy (four-times-daily).\nIn April 2017, Aldeyra initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial of topical ocular reproxalap in patients with NAU. Results of the trial are expected to be announced in 2019.\nPlanned initiation of Phase 3 clinical trial in Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) and receipt of Orphan Drug Designation. Based on an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA following favorable results from a Phase 2 clinical trial in SLS, Aldeyra plans to initiate a global, double-blind, two-part Phase 3 clinical trial of topical dermatologic reproxalap in the first half of 2018. Additionally, in April 2017, the FDA granted reproxalap orphan drug designation for the treatment of congenital ichthyosis, a severe skin disease characteristic of SLS. There are no FDA-approved therapies specifically indicated for the treatment of SLS, and reproxalap is believed to be the only potential SLS therapy in clinical development. Results from part one of the Phase 3 clinical trial are expected to be announced in 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Review\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Aldeyra reported a net loss of approximately $22.3 million, compared to a net loss of approximately $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $1.40 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.65 per share for the same period in 2016. Losses have resulted from the costs of Aldeyra's clinical trials and research and development programs, as well as from general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $13.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase of $3.1 million is primarily related to the increase in research and development expenditures, including manufacturing, preclinical, and clinical development costs, and an increase in personnel costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.5 million for the year ended 2016. The increase of $0.7 million is primarily related to an increase in legal costs, rent, consulting costs, and personnel costs.\nIn 2017, total operating expenses were approximately $22.5 million for the year, compared to total operating expenses of approximately $18.7 million in 2016.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $42.9 million as of December 31, 2017, including $26.9 million in net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of common stock that closed on September 21, 2017.\nConference Call & Webcast Information\nAldeyra will hold a conference call on Thursday, March 29, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. eastern time to discuss the results. The dial-in numbers are 1-877-266-8979 for domestic callers and 1-412-317-5231 for international callers. A live webcast of the conference call will also be available on the investor relations page of the Aldeyra Therapeutics corporate website at www.aldeyra.com . After the live webcast, the event will remain archived on the Aldeyra Therapeutics website for one year.\nAbout Aldeyra Therapeutics\nAldeyra Therapeutics is developing next-generation medicines to improve the lives of patients with inflammatory diseases. Aldeyra's lead product candidate, reproxalap, is a first-in-class treatment in late-stage development for dry eye disease and other forms of ocular inflammation. Aldeyra is leveraging its experience in ocular inflammation to develop other product candidates for systemic inflammatory disease. None of Aldeyra's product candidates have been approved for sale in the U.S. or elsewhere.\nAbout Dry Eye Disease\nDry eye disease is a common and chronic inflammatory disease estimated to affect approximately 20 million people in the United States, and is characterized by insufficient moisture in the anterior surface of the eye, leading to dryness, inflammation, pain, discomfort, irritation, and, in severe cases, decreased vision. Among physicians and patients, existing therapy for dry eye disease is generally regarded as inadequate.\nAbout Allergic Conjunctivitis\nAllergic conjunctivitis is a common allergic disease that affects 20% or more of the population worldwide. The disease is characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva (a membrane covering part of the front of the eye), resulting in ocular itching, excessive tear production, lid swelling, and redness. Antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergic conjunctivitis, but use is limited by lack of durable activity and ocular dryness.\nAbout Noninfectious Anterior Uveitis\nNoninfectious anterior uveitis is a rare, potentially blinding disease that may be mediated in part by pro-inflammatory aldehydes, and is characterized by inflammation in the front of the eye, pain, impaired vision, and photophobia. Topical corticosteroid therapy is the only approved therapy for the resolution of inflammation associated with noninfectious anterior uveitis, but can lead to serious ocular complications, including glaucoma, infections, and cataracts.\nAbout Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome\nSjögren-Larsson Syndrome is a rare inborn error of aldehyde metabolism caused by mutations in fatty acid aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to ichthyosis (scaly, thickened, dry skin), neurological disorders, and retinal disease. No therapy for SLS has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding Aldeyra's plans and expectations for its product candidates.
