    "text": "GREENVILLE, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Actor and comedian Orlando Jones has joined the Board of Advisors for BANDWAGON, a sports technology company that captures and enhances the game day experience for teams and brands.\n“With a career spanning more than 30 years, Jones brings a lot to the BANDWAGON team, but it is more than just name recognition,” said Harold Hughes, BANDWAGON’s founder and CEO.\nJones is a noted writer on the world of Fandoms – MTV has even dubbed him the “King of Fandoms.” His academic papers and studies delve into why people are fans of certain things and films and how they interact.\n“BANDWAGON is about learning what the fan does,” Hughes said. “And then how to make their experiences better. That is exactly what Orlando Jones studies and understands better than most people out there.”\nThere also is a personal connection between Jones and BANDWAGON. Jones graduated from Mauldin High School in Greenville before becoming an award winning writer-producer-singer-songwriter-activist-entrepreneur-actor. Jones starred opposite Laurence Fishburne as Oliver Tambo in Madiba, followed by a show stopping performance as Mr. Nancy in the smash hit American Gods. The Duplass Brothers tapped Jones for their dark comedy Room 104 on HBO while SyFy celebrated their 25th anniversary by having Orlando legally marrying fans in SyFy's Geek Wedding Chapel at San Diego Comicon.\n“The feeling you get when you are fully engaged in fan culture at an event in your own community is electric. Fans are the most valuable part of the entertainment experience. Using technologies like data analytics and blockchain to create a more individualized experience on game day & beyond is a very exciting space to work in. With so little diversity in tech and so few companies focused on improving the lives of fans, I feel especially grateful to do so with a Black founder from my hometown, Greenville, South Carolina,” Jones said.\nAbout BANDWAGON:\nBANDWAGON is a Greenville-based sports technology company that captures and enhances the game day experience for fans, teams, and brands. From customizable ticket options based on fans’ needs, to curated tailgating tips and travel planning for away games, BANDWAGON harnesses the power of data to serve as an online game day headquarters for both the casual fan and the dedicated season ticket holder.
