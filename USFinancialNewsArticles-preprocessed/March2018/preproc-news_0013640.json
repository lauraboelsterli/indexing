    "text": "TORONTO, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (TSX:CIQ.UN) Canadian High Income Equity Fund has renewed its normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 264,300 units (the “Units”) of the Fund representing approximately 10% of the public float of 2,643,835 Units. The Fund may purchase up to 52,876 Units in any 30 day period which is 2% of the 2,643,835 issued and outstanding Units at March 2, 2018.\nAs of March 2, 2018, the Fund had purchased 180,200 Units of the 313,700 Units approved for purchase under its current bid at an average price of $9.46 per unit.\nThe Units may be purchased for cancellation from March 14, 2018 to March 13, 2019 through the facilities of the TSX or other alternative Canadian trading system and may only be purchased at a price per Unit not exceeding the last published net asset value per Unit. The Manager of the Fund believes that such purchases are in the best interest of the Fund and are a desirable use of its available funds.\nAbout Brompton Funds\nBrompton Funds, a division of Brompton Group which was founded in 2000, is an experienced investment fund manager with approximately $2 billion in assets under management.
