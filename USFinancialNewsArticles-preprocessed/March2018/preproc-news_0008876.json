Kala has applied the MPP technology to a corticosteroid designed for ocular applications, resulting in two lead product candidates. The product candidates are INVELTYS™ (KPI-121 1%) for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery, for which the FDA has accepted for review Kala’s NDA submission and has established a PDUFA target action date of August 24, 2018, and KPI-121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties including statements regarding the development and regulatory status of the company's product candidates, including INVELTYS™ (KPI-121 1%) for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery and KPI-121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
