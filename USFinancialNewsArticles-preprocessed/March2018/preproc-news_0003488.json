GAAP operating income in the U.S. was $8.0 million, a decrease of 25% compared to $10.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in GAAP operating income from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a $4.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. International revenue was $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 171% compared to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP operating loss in the International markets was ($7.9) million, an increase of 31% compared to a loss of ($6.0) million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total paying dealers were 27,670 at December 31, 2017, an increase of 30% compared to 21,301 at December 31, 2016. Of the total paying dealers at December 31, 2017, U.S. and International accounted for 25,122 and 2,548, respectively, compared to 20,349 and 952, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Average annual revenue per subscribing dealer (AARSD) in the U.S. was $12,055 as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 16% compared to $10,383 as of December 31, 2016. Average annual revenue per subscribing dealer (AARSD) in the International markets was $4,904 as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 28% compared to $3,830 as of December 31, 2016.

Guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2018 does not include any potential impact of foreign exchange gains or losses.\nCarGurus has not reconciled its non-GAAP operating income guidance to GAAP operating income, or its non-GAAP EPS guidance to GAAP EPS, because stock-based compensation, the reconciling item between such GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, cannot be reasonably predicted due to timing, valuation and number of future employee awards and therefore is not available without unreasonable effort. For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this release, please see the reconciliations of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures and the section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Business Metrics\" below.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nCarGurus will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and first quarter and full fiscal year 2018 financial guidance at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, March 1, 2018.

CarGurus adopted ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017 which requires these differences to be recorded through the income tax provision. Prior to January 1, 2017, these differences were recorded to additional paid-in-capital. As a result, there is no adjustment for the three months or year ended December 31, 2016.\nUnaudited Reconciliation of GAAP Expense to Non-GAAP Expense and GAAP Expense as a Percentage of Revenue to Non-GAAP Expense as a Percentage of Revenue (in thousands, except percentages) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 Cost of Revenue S&M P,T&D (1) G&A Cost of Revenue S&M P,T&D (1) G&A GAAP expense $ 5,242 $ 67,670 $ 8,317 $ 8,590 $ 2,904 $ 45,302 $ 3,319 $ 4,064 Stock-based compensation expense (135 ) (1,803 ) (1,565 ) (1,301 ) (4 ) (44 ) (28 ) (10 ) Non-GAAP expense $ 5,107 $ 65,867 $ 6,752 $ 7,289 $ 2,900 $ 45,258 $ 3,291 $ 4,054 GAAP expense as a percentage of revenue 6 % 75 % 9 % 9 % 5 % 75 % 5 % 7 % Non-GAAP expense as a percentage of revenue 6 % 73 % 7 % 8 % 5 % 74 % 5 % 7 % (1) Product, Technology, & Development Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Cost of Revenue S&M P,T&D (1) G&A Cost of Revenue S&M P,T&D (1) G&A GAAP expense $ 17,609 $ 236,165 $ 22,470 $ 22,688 $ 9,575 $ 154,125 $ 11,453 $ 12,783 Stock-based compensation expense (151 ) (1,911 ) (1,637 ) (1,329 ) (18 ) (163 ) (104 ) (37 ) Non-GAAP expense $ 17,458 $ 234,254 $ 20,833 $ 21,359 $ 9,557 $ 153,962 $ 11,349 $ 12,746 GAAP expense as a percentage of revenue 6 % 75 % 7 % 7 % 5 % 78 % 6 % 6 % Non-GAAP expense as a percentage of revenue 6 % 74 % 7 % 7 % 5 % 78 % 6 % 6 % (1) Product, Technology, & Development\nUnaudited Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA: (in thousands) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP net income $ 2,267 $ 3,838 $ 13,199 $ 6,497 Depreciation and amortization 1,125 691 3,795 2,072 Stock-based compensation expense 4,804 86 5,028 322 Other (income) expense, net (240 ) (114 ) (563 ) (374 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes (1,995 ) 882 2,638 2,448 Adjusted EBITDA $ 5,961 $ 5,383 $ 24,097 $ 10,965\nUnaudited Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash and Cash Equivalents Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow (in thousands) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP net cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating activities $ 7,149 $ (447 ) $ 25,691 $ 20,004 Purchases of property and equipment (910 ) (1,837 ) (5,157 ) (5,846 ) Capitalization of website development costs (728 ) (459 ) (2,215 ) (1,372 ) Non-GAAP free cash flow $ 5,511 $ (2,743 ) $ 18,319 $ 12,786\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Business Metrics\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States, or GAAP, we provide investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics, which we believe are helpful to our investors. We use these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information and other business metrics is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. While our non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics are an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, we urge investors to review the reconciliation of these financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included above, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, other (income) expense, net, the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and other one-time, non-recurring items, when applicable. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of certain items in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can produce a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operations, adjusted to include purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of website development costs. We have presented Free Cash Flow because it is a measure of the Company’s financial performance that represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after expenditures required to maintain or expand our asset base.\nWe also monitor operating measures of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nWhile a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, many of these costs and expenses that we may incur in the future, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial statement tables included in this press release.\nWe define a paying dealer as a dealer, based on a distinct associated inventory feed, that subscribes to our Enhanced or Featured listing product at the end of a defined period.\nWe define average annual revenue per subscribing dealer (AARSD), as measured at the end of a defined period, as the total marketplace subscription revenue during the trailing 12 months divided by the average number of paying dealers during the same trailing 12-month period.\nWe define a monthly unique user as an individual who has visited our website within a calendar month, based on data as measured by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of the monthly unique users in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique device identifier accesses our website during a calendar month. If an individual accesses our website using a different device within a given month, the first access by each such device is counted as a separate unique user.\nWe define monthly sessions as the number of distinct visits to our website that take place each month within a given time frame, as measured and defined by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly sessions as the sum of the monthly sessions in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. A session is defined as beginning with the first page view from a device and ending at the earliest of when a user closes their browser window, after 30 minutes of inactivity, or at midnight Eastern Time each night. A session can be made up of multiple page views and visitor actions, such as performing a search, visiting vehicle detail pages, and connecting with a dealer.\nWe anticipate holding our annual meeting of stockholders on or about Thursday, May 24, 2018 (the “2018 Annual Meeting”) and will file with the SEC a proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting. The deadline for receipt of a stockholder proposal to be submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Rule 14a-8”), for inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2018 Annual Meeting is the close of business on March 27, 2018. In accordance with our Amended and Restated By-Laws, the deadline for receipt of a stockholder proposal submitted outside of Rule 14a-8, or a director nomination, is the close of business on March 10, 2018.\nInvestor Contact:\nSeth Potter\nICR, Inc., for CarGurus, Inc.\n888-508-1190\ninvestors@cargurus.com\nSource:CarGurus, Inc.",
