The ongoing and methodical improvement of our distribution channels outside the United States continues to contribute to our long-term growth, and in the United States we are seeing growth as we continue to refine our sales organization with the addition of dedicated employee sales representatives coached by professional sales managers. In addition, we are seeing the benefits of 'stand out' point of purchase tools designed to drive traffic both in the United States and abroad. Our investments in sales and marketing to increase global brand awareness and launch our growing range of products to a wider group of consumers are producing results as evidenced by increased unit sales while pricing remains stable.\"\n\"We are particularly excited about the consumer response to our 3.0 All Mountain and Enduro helmets for bicycle use,\" continued Mr. Macdonald. \"These products open a wider, global dealer network beyond our existing dealer footprint that we can readily serve. We are encouraged by the momentum we are building with product line expansion, which includes additional award-winning, innovative products, and product endorsements from a variety of accomplished, professional athletes.\"\nFounder and Chairman, Dr. Christopher Leatt, added, \"For years, Leatt has built its reputation on world-class R&D, and industry accolades for the safety, design and style of our products are a strong testament to the expected marketability and demand for our highly innovative products, which we believe are among the best in their class.\"\nFinancial Summary\nTotal consolidated revenues for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 increased to $5.4 million, up 64%, compared to $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, total consolidated revenues increased by $3.7 million, or 23%, to $20.1 million, up from $16.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase for the full year was primarily driven by a 27% increase in Body armor sales, a 48% increase in helmet sales and a 97% increase in other product and accessories sales, which were partially offset by a 9% decrease in Neck brace sales, during the year ended December 31, 2017. Price fluctuations did not impact revenues.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, gross profit was $2.2 million, or 42.0% of revenues, compared to $1.3 million, or 39.6% of revenues, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, gross profit was $9.5 million, or 47.0% of revenues, up 15% compared to $8.2 million, or 50.2% gross margin, for the year-ago period.\nFourth quarter loss from operations was $(283,000), down from $(916,000) for the same period last year. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, income from operations was $226,000 compared to a loss from operations of $(732,000) for the prior year.\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $(107,000), or $(0.02) per basic and diluted share, compared to $(596,000) or $(0.11) per basic and diluted share, during the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased 152% to $237,000, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(455,000), or $(0.09) per basic and $(0.08) per diluted share, for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by a 23% increase in revenues.\nLeatt continued to meet its working capital needs from cash on hand and internally generated cash flow from operations. At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million, a current ratio of 2.1:1 and there was no long-term debt.\nBusiness Outlook\nMr. Macdonald said, \"For the past several years, we have expanded our addressable market by aiming to add approximately one new category per season, and we expect to maintain this aggressive expansion pace. We expect growth to continue as we progress throughout 2018, driven by new product categories, a wider range of product lines and an increased presence around the globe. Although severe weather in Europe this spring may present some challenges in the first half of 2018, we remain confident in the long-term prospects for our business and the marketability and demand for our award-winning exceptional protective gear.\"\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 10 am ET on Tuesday, March 27, 2018, to discuss the 2017 fourth quarter and full year results.\nParticipants should dial in to the call ten minutes before the scheduled time, using the following numbers: 1-877-407-9716 (U.S.A) or +1-201-493-6779 (international) to access the call.\nAudio Webcast\nThere will also be a simultaneous live webcast through the Company's website, www.leatt-corp.com .
