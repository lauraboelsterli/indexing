    "text": "Strong new enrollment growth in fourth quarter 2017\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Capella Education Company (NASDAQ: CPLA), a leading educational services company, today announced financial results for the three months and year ended Dec. 31, 2017.\n“We are pleased with our mid-single digit new enrollment growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. After taking into consideration adjustments for certain items in the fourth quarter, our financial performance was consistent with our expectations,” said Kevin Gilligan, chairman and chief executive officer. “We are executing on our strategies to deliver the most direct path between learning and employment and maintaining our commitment to academic quality.”\nMr. Gilligan continued, “We are continuing to make progress on our merger process with Strayer Education, Inc. and have achieved key milestones, including antitrust and shareholder approvals. We look forward to completing the transaction and creating a national leader for adults looking for the education they need to advance their careers in best-in-class institutions for faculty and employees.”\nSelected Financial Data for the Three Months Ended Dec. 31, 2017\nCapella Education Company revenues were $112.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 0.7 percent compared to $111.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating loss on a GAAP basis was $1.6 million, compared to operating income of $18.3 million for the same period in 2016. On an adjusted, non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2017 operating income was $18.3 million. The fourth quarter 2017 period includes goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $15.0 million within the Job-Ready Skills segment, merger transaction costs of $3.7 million and the impact of tax reform of $2.2 million for Capella Education Company, and restructuring charges of $1.3 million within the Post-Secondary and Job-Ready Skills segments. Diluted net loss per common share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis was $0.63, compared to diluted net income per common share from continuing operations of $0.97 for the same period in 2016. On an adjusted, non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2017 diluted net income per common share from continuing operations was $0.86. In addition, other tax adjustments reduced net income per common share from continuing operations for fourth quarter 2017 by an additional $0.13.\nOperating and Segment Highlights\nThe “Post-Secondary” segment is comprised of Capella University and Sophia Learning; the “Job-Ready Skills” segment consists of Capella Learning Solutions, Hackbright Academy and DevMountain. A summary of adjusted items by segment is included in the notes to the attached non-GAAP reconciliation table.\nPost-Secondary Segment\nFourth quarter 2017 revenues were $109.8 million, up 0.4 percent compared to $109.4 million in the same period a year ago. The increase in revenue is related to higher revenue-per-learner primarily as a result of learners selecting course materials made available to support their academic needs and a slight tuition price increase implemented in July, 2017. Operating income was $19.8 million, compared to operating income of $20.7 million for the same period in 2016. The operating margin was 18.0 percent in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 period includes restructuring charges of $0.7 million to align the organization with 2018 strategic priorities. Post-Secondary segment operating results are primarily attributable to Capella University. Capella University new enrollment increased by 5.7 percent compared to fourth quarter 2016, including positive new enrollment growth across all degree programs. Total Capella University active enrollment decreased 1.0 percent to 37,517 learners, and early cohort persistence improved by approximately 1 percent as improvements moderated given gains of 21 percent over a period of approximately 5 years. FlexPath, Capella University’s fastest-growing offerings, continued to positively impact new and total enrollment in the fourth quarter 2017, and is now 20 percent of Capella University’s Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees total enrollment.\nJob-Ready Skills Segment\nFourth quarter 2017 revenues were $2.2 million compared to $1.9 million in the same period of 2016. Operating loss was $17.7 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to a loss of $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. While the acquisitions of Hackbright and DevMountain have positively impacted revenue growth, the acquisitions have not achieved performance expectations, resulting in fourth quarter 2017 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $15.0 million. In addition, the fourth quarter 2017 period includes restructuring charges of $0.6 million to right-size the cost structure in the Job-Ready Skills segment.\nSelected Financial Data for the Fiscal Year Ended Dec. 31, 2017\nCapella Education Company revenues were $440.4 million in fiscal year 2017, up 2.6 percent compared to $429.4 million in 2016. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $45.1 million, compared to $68.2 million for the same period in 2016. On an adjusted, non-GAAP basis, full-year 2017 operating income was $65.1 million. The full-year 2017 period includes goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $15.0 million within the Job-Ready Skills segment, merger transaction costs of $3.7 million and the impact of tax reform of $2.2 million for Capella Education Company, and restructuring charges of $1.3 million within the Post-Secondary and Job-Ready Skills segments. Diluted net income per common share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis was $1.96, compared to $3.58 for the same period in 2016. On an adjusted, non-GAAP basis, full-year 2017 diluted net income per common share from continuing operations was $3.43.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAt Dec. 31, 2017, Capella Education Company had cash and marketable securities of $181.4 million, compared to $162.3 million at Dec. 31, 2016, and no debt as of these dates.\nCash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2017 was $63.7 million compared to $86.1 million in 2016.\nDividend and Share Repurchases\nA quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per outstanding share of common stock was declared during the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend was paid on Jan. 18, 2018.\nThe Company repurchased approximately 51,000 shares of Capella stock for total consideration of $3.5 million in fiscal year 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Capella Education Company repurchased approximately 14,000 shares of Capella stock for total consideration of $1.0 million. The remaining authorization as of the end of the fourth quarter was $27.0 million.\n2018 Goals and Outlook\nThe Company’s goal for 2018 is to deliver continued revenue growth. To achieve this goal, annual new enrollment growth will be needed in a continuing volatile enrollment environment, as well as stable or improving early cohort persistence and continued revenue growth in the Job-Ready Skills segment. In addition, the Company is managing the Job-Ready Skills segment to be less dilutive in 2018.\nThe tax rate for recurring operations for Capella Education Company in 2018 is currently expected to be about 24 to 25 percent related to the United States tax reform legislation passed at the end of 2017, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate.\nMerger Update\nAs announced on October 30, 2017, Capella Education Company and Strayer Education, Inc. (“Strayer”) (NASDAQ:STRA) agreed to combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction, creating a national leader in education innovation. As previously disclosed, on November 22, 2017, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. In addition, on January 19, 2018, the Company and Strayer announced that shareholders of both companies voted to approve a proposal to effect the merger. The proposed merger remains subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approvals by State regulators, and relevant accreditation bodies. By letter dated February 26, 2018, the Department of Education issued the results of its preacquisition review of the proposed change in ownership of Capella. That letter confirms that, subject to submission of additional documents following the Closing, the University will have uninterrupted participation in the Title IV Programs while the Department of Education completes its review of the relevant documentation. Capella Education Company and Strayer continue to expect that the merger will close in the third quarter of 2018. Following the completion of the merger, Strategic Education, Inc. will be the corporate entity under which both Capella University and Strayer University will continue to operate as independent and separately accredited institutions.\nConference Call\nIn light of the pending merger, the Company will not be providing financial guidance or hold an investor conference call.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain information in this news release does not relate to historical financial information, including statements relating to future prospects and expectations regarding our growth, revenues, enrollment, and operating performance, and should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Additionally, the operating income attributable to the Post-Secondary segment for the three months and year-ended December 31, 2017 includes restructuring charges of $0.7 million. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges represent the excess of the carrying value of the Coding Schools reporting unit relative to the fair value determined as part of the goodwill and intangible asset annual impairment analysis. Restructuring charges relate primarily to severance costs and other termination benefits associated with former Company employees whose employment at the Company was involuntarily terminated during the period as we aligned the organization with 2018 strategic priorities and right-sized the cost structure in the Job-Ready Skills segment.\nNote: The summary of financial information by reportable segment above excludes the results of operations for Arden University, which are presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nQuarterly revenues and operating income (loss) by reportable segment for prior quarters can be found at the Capella Education Company website at www.capellaeducation.com , under ‘Investor Relations’, within the ‘Financial Information’ section in the ‘Fiscal Year & Quarterly Results’ spreadsheet.\nCAPELLA EDUCATION COMPANY\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nReconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Measures\nTo provide additional transparency and clarity, we have provided the following Non-GAAP measures of performance as adjusted for certain items that we believe to be useful to readers of the financial statements. These non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the performance of the Company, as they provide additional insights to users of the financial statements and highlight the impact of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, transaction-related expenses associated with the Company's pending merger agreement, restructuring actions, and tax reform on the financial performance and operating results of the Company. Management uses the following Non-GAAP adjusted items as measures of operating performance for the Company, and certain of these Non-GAAP adjusted items (not including the impact of tax reform) are also components in the determination of management incentive compensation. However, these items (such as adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per common share) are not recognized measurements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these adjusted measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the corresponding unadjusted items (including unadjusted net income and unadjusted diluted net income per common share, as reconciled within the tables below and reported within the Consolidated Statement of Income) as determined in accordance with GAAP. The adjusted Non-GAAP measures are included in the column labeled 'As Adjusted (Non-GAAP)' and the associated most directly comparable GAAP measures are shown within the column labeled 'As Reported (GAAP).' Other companies may calculate these adjusted operating performance metrics differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of this measure for comparisons with other companies.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nThree Months\nEnded December\n31, 2017\nGoodwill and\nIntangible Asset\nImpairment\nCharges (a)\nMerger\nTransaction\nCosts (b)\nRestructuring\nCharges (c)\nTax Reform\nImpact\nThree Months\nEnded December\n31, 2017\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\nNon-GAAP Adjustments As Adjusted\n(Non-GAAP)\n(Unaudited) Operating income (loss) $ (1,640 ) $ 14,955 $ 3,728 $ 1,282 $ — $ 18,325 Other income, net 401 — — — — 401 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (1,239 ) 14,955 3,728 1,282 — 18,726 Income tax expense (d) 6,031 3,747 390 480 (2,224 ) 8,424 Income (loss) from continuing operations (7,270 ) 11,208 3,338 802 2,224 10,302 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax — — — — — — Net income (loss) $ (7,270 ) $ 11,208 $ 3,338 $ 802 $ 2,224 $ 10,302 Basic net income (loss) per common share: Continuing operations $ (0.63 ) $ 0.96 $ 0.29 $ 0.07 $ 0.19 $ 0.89 Discontinued operations — — — — — — Basic net income (loss) per common share $ (0.63 ) $ 0.96 $ 0.29 $ 0.07 $ 0.19 $ 0.89 Diluted net income (loss) per common share: Continuing operations $ (0.63 ) $ 0.94 $ 0.28 $ 0.07 $ 0.19 $ 0.86 Discontinued operations — — — — — — Diluted net income (loss) per common share $ (0.63 ) $ 0.94 $ 0.28 $ 0.07 $ 0.19 $ 0.86 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: Basic 11,628 11,628 Diluted (e) 11,628 11,935 Note: Per share amounts for basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share may not sum across due to rounding.\n(a) Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges relate to non-cash expenses arising from the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances applicable to the Coding Schools reporting unit (included within the Job-Ready Skills segment) as determined during the performance of our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis. Based on the results of the valuation analysis performed, the fair value of the Coding Schools reporting unit, and the fair value of the Hackbright and DevMountain trade names, were determined to be less than their respective carrying values as of the valuation date, and $15.0 million of impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2017. Of this amount, $9.9 million relates to a goodwill impairment charge and $5.1 million relates to an intangible asset (trade name) impairment charge.\n(b) During the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $3.7 million in transaction costs related to the Merger agreement, primarily attributable to consulting, legal, and investment banking fees incurred by the Company in connection with the proposed Merger agreement.\n(c) Restructuring charges relate primarily to severance costs and other termination benefits associated with former Company employees whose employment at the Company was involuntarily terminated during the period as we aligned the organization with 2018 strategic priorities and right-sized the cost structure in the Job-Ready Skills segment, which resulted in restructuring charges of $1.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017. Severance and related termination benefits are recorded during the period in which no additional services are required to be performed by the former employee in order to receive severance benefits.\n(d) During the three months ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate as reported was significantly impacted by Non-GAAP adjustment items presented above. The adjusted effective tax rate after taking into account the Non-GAAP adjustment items included in the Non-GAAP reconciliation above was 45%, which is higher than our historical effective tax rate due to other tax adjustments totaling $1.5 million, which were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n(e) During quarterly periods in which the Company reports a net loss, basic and diluted loss per share are disclosed as the same amount, as including the impact of dilutive securities would be antidilutive to the calculation.\nYear-Ended December 31, 2017\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nGoodwill and\nIntangible Asset\nImpairment\nCharges (a)\nMerger\nTransaction\nCosts (b)\nRestructuring\nCharges (c)\nTax Reform\nImpact\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\nNon-GAAP Adjustments As Adjusted\n(Non-GAAP)\nOperating income $ 45,094 $ 14,955 $ 3,728 $ 1,282 $ — $ 65,059 Other income, net 793 — — — — 793 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 45,887 14,955 3,728 1,282 — 65,852 Income tax expense (d) 22,477 3,747 390 480 (2,224 ) 24,870 Income from continuing operations 23,410 11,208 3,338 802 2,224 40,982 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 95 — — — — 95 Net income $ 23,505 $ 11,208 $ 3,338 $ 802 $ 2,224 $ 41,077 Basic net income per common share: Continuing operations $ 2.01 $ 0.96 $ 0.29 $ 0.07 $ 0.19 $ 3.53 Discontinued operations 0.01 — — — — — Basic net income per common share $ 2.02 $ 0.96 $ 0.29 $ 0.07 $ 0.19 $ 3.53 Diluted net income per common share: Continuing operations $ 1.96 $ 0.94 $ 0.28 $ 0.07 $ 0.19 $ 3.43 Discontinued operations 0.01 — — — — 0.01 Diluted net income per common share $ 1.97 $ 0.94 $ 0.28 $ 0.07 $ 0.19 $ 3.44 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: Basic 11,623 11,623 Diluted 11,950 11,950 Note: Per share amounts for basic and diluted net income per common share may not sum across due to rounding.\n(a) Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges relate to non-cash expenses arising from the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances applicable to the Coding Schools reporting unit (included within the Job-Ready Skills segment) as determined during the performance of our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis. Based on the results of the valuation analysis performed, the fair value of the Coding Schools reporting unit, and the fair value of the Hackbright and DevMountain trade names, were determined to be less than their respective carrying values as of the valuation date, and $15.0 million of impairment charges were recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Of this amount, $9.9 million relates to a goodwill impairment charge and $5.1 million relates to an intangible asset (trade name) impairment charge.\n(b) During the year-ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $3.7 million in transaction costs related to the Merger agreement, primarily attributable to consulting, legal, and investment banking fees incurred by the Company in connection with the proposed Merger agreement.\n(c) Restructuring charges relate primarily to severance costs and other termination benefits associated with former Company employees whose employment at the Company was involuntarily terminated during the period as we aligned the organization with 2018 strategic priorities and right-sized the cost structure in the Job-Ready Skills segment, which resulted in restructuring charges of $1.3 million during the year-ended December 31, 2017. Severance and related termination benefits are recorded during the period in which no additional services are required to be performed by the former employee in order to receive severance benefits.\n(d) During the year-ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate as reported was 49.0%, of which 11.2% was driven by Non-GAAP adjustment items. The adjusted effective tax rate after taking into account the Non-GAAP adjustment items included in the Non-GAAP reconciliation above was 37.8%, which is in line with our historical effective tax rate.\nCAPELLA UNIVERSITY\nOther Information\nDecember 31, Capella University Enrollment by Degree (a) : 2017 2016 % Change Doctoral 9,096 9,110 (0.2 )% Master's 17,437 17,865 (2.4 )% Bachelor's 9,856 9,791 0.7 % Other 1,128 1,116 1.1 % Total 37,517 37,882 (1.0 )% (a) Enrollment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 includes learners who are actively enrolled during the last month of the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301006491/en/\nCapella Education Company\nInvestor and Media Contact:\nHeide Erickson, 612-977-5172\nHeide.Erickson@capella.edu\nSource: Capella Education Company",
