    "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer was not a fan of Walmart's latest earnings report , and he wasn't shy about it in his \"Voice of Cramerica\" strategy session.\n\"I've got to tell you, I've spent a lot of time going over that Walmart quarter and I didn't like it. I didn't like the dramatic decline in e-commerce at all,\" the \"Mad Money\" host told a caller.\nWalmart's fourth-quarter results, released Feb. 20, missed Wall Street's expectations as sales on Walmart.com waned.\nThe weakness in e-commerce overshadowed some of the retailer's more favorable results and put its ongoing battle with Amazon under a spotlight.\n\"I don't want you to bottom-fish yet in Walmart. I don't like the way it's going,\" Cramer said.\nWalmart's stock closed Friday down 0.3 percent, at $88.77 a share.\nBut investors shouldn't sell high-quality stocks out of worry about the market's recent swings, the \"Mad Money\" host told a caller inquiring about selling her position in McDonald's .\nMcDonald's shares rounded out the day on Friday at $148.27 a share, down 4.77 percent.\n\"No, no, no. [CEO] Steve Easterbrook is doing a great job,\" Cramer said. \"This is a tailspin that is inspired by fear. We don't trade on fear; we trade on numbers. Buy some now, buy some after it goes above 3 percent, if that does happen.\"\nWATCH: Cramer's \"Voice of Cramerica\" strategy session show chapters Cramer's strategy session: Don't bottom-fish in Walmart's stock just yet      21 Hours Ago | 06:33 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
