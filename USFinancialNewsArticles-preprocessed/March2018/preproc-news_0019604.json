    "text": "As concerns about inappropriate content on Facebook increase, some advertising agencies are recommending against buying certain types of Facebook ads. But so far, advertisers are not heeding their warnings â€” Facebook's audience is too large and its targeting too good.\nFacebook is maxing out on places to put ads in the Facebook News Feed and Instagram areas without annoying its users . Instant Articles and Audience Network provide alternate Facebook-owned venues to put ads and gain revenue, but several agencies have become concerned enough about fake news and trolling to warn their clients away from these products.\nDigitas, whose clients have included Buick, Dunkin' Donuts and Whirlpool, has expressed concerns about Facebook's Audience Network , a program that lets advertisers buy ads on a network of third-party websites. It is also cautious about Instant Articles, a way for publishers to upload their articles onto the Facebook platform.\n\"Digitas advises clients against running [ads] in Audience Network or Instant Articles until the point at which Facebook provides 100 percent transparency on the partners within its network and simplified tools for us to control where our ads are placed,\" said Jeanne Bright, vice president and group director of paid social at Publicis ' DigitasLBi.\nThe majority of the Facebook ads Digitas buys for its clients are in the Facebook News Feed, Instagram and Instagram Stories, all of which are safe for advertisers, Bright said.\nNoble People, an ad agency that has worked with Coca-Cola and PayPal , is also concerned about Audience Network. Noble's group media director, Matt Borchard, explained, \"there's no control as to where you show up and video is served as mid-roll which as a consumer I absolutely loathe.\"\nTransparency tools 'continuously delayed,' complains one agency Facebook does have tools to prevent ads from appearing next to questionable items, including options to blacklist certain categories and topics. Companies can also blacklist specific websites and apps within Audience Network and Instant Articles. It also increased standards for which types of publishers can receive ad revenue in an effort to boost quality.\nBut Facebook's main olive branch to advertisers has been a promise to list exactly where ads could potentially run and did run, especially on Instant Articles and Audience Network.\nThat feature was announced in September, and still isn't available. Digitas' Bright points out this feature is \"continuously delayed.\"\nshow chapters",
