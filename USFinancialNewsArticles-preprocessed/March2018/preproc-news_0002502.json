RMS has seen significant growth in such countries as Great Britain, Singapore and Australia over the past 12 years since its first expansion to international markets.\nMatt Mathison joined RMS in 2007 as a Senior Analyst in Tampa and was previously based in the company's Singapore office as Managing Director of Asia. His many accomplishments include helping clients generate more than $30 million in incremental sales, implementing a successful cross-training program and helping analysts gain sophisticated technical skills.\nIn his new role as Senior Vice President of International Operations, Mathison will be responsible for the overall management of all hands-on operational aspects of RMS' four international offices located in London, Paris, Singapore and Tokyo. He will also assist the Chief Operating Officer, Mark Kuperman, in continuing RMS' international expansion.\nMathison, who will be based out of RMS' London office, holds his Master of Business Administration from the State University of New York and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a finance specialization from the University of Tennessee.\nWinny Daud joined RMS in 2009 as a Senior Analyst in the company's Singapore office and has been an integral part of the team ever since. She has been promoted several times, and most recently to her current position as Managing Director of Singapore.\nDaud's major successes include coaching and developing a client service team, which due to their valuable work, is seen by her loyal client base as an extension of their own teams. Her achievements also include leading a highly effective rollout of new store-level pricing for a restaurant client in Australia and New Zealand.\nShe received her master's degree in hospitality management from Cornell University and bachelor's degree in economics with a major in finance and accounting. Originally from Indonesia, Daud moved to Singapore in 2001, where she currently resides.\nAs Managing Director of the Singapore office, Daud will be responsible for the Singapore operation and driving revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAbout Revenue Management Solutions:\nRevenue Management Solutions, based in Tampa, Florida USA, is a leader in bringing a data-based approach to pricing and menu optimization for restaurants, providing solutions for a number of leading global restaurant brands, including many of the largest companies in the industry.
