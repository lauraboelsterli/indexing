    "text": "VALLETTA (Reuters) - A super-yacht owned by Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya has been impounded in Malta after its crew demanded payment of back wages, authorities said on Wednesday.\nThe Indian Empress was blocked in Valletta harbor after the 40-member crew began legal action claiming they are owed almost a million dollars.\nThe mariners’ union Nautilus International said the yacht was abandoned by its owners. The crew, including Indians, Britons and East Europeans, have not been paid since September, the union said.\nIt said the court action impounding the yacht is based on a “maritime lien”, under which the crew of a vessel can declare a claim over it to the value of unpaid wages.\nA spokeswoman for Mallya’s company, UB Group, had no immediate comment.\nThe 95-metre Indian Empress, registered in the Isle of Man, is estimated to be worth some 93 million dollars.\nMallya is in Britain pending extradition proceedings initiated by India.\nHe stands accused of fraudulently palming off losses from his now defunct Kingfisher Airlines onto banks by taking out loans he had no intention of repaying.\nHe denies all wrongdoing and his defense team argue that he is being used as a scapegoat by Indian politicians to deflect public anger at the accumulation of bad debts by state-owned banks.\nThe 61-year-old, nicknamed “the King of Good Times” after the slogan on bottles of one of his premium beers and his hard partying lifestyle, has business interests ranging from aviation to liquor.\nHe is also co-owner of Formula One motor racing team Force India.\nReporting by Chris Scicluna; Additional reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Philip Pullella and Peter Graff\n ",
