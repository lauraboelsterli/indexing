    "text": "Blake Griffin scored 25 points with eight rebounds and eight assists as the Detroit Pistons snapped their four-game losing streak with a 99-83 rout of the Chicago Bulls on Friday night in Detroit.\nReggie Bullock added 21 points and Andre Drummond grabbed a game-high 17 rebounds and blocked four shots while scoring only five points for the Pistons.\nDetroit came up just short of ending its skid on Wednesday night in a 121-119 overtime thriller against Eastern Conference-leading Toronto, the Pistons’ second overtime loss during their losing streak.\nCameron Payne had 17 points off the bench to lead Chicago. Kris Dunn was the Bulls’ only other double-digit scorer with 13 points as they fell back to earth following Wednesday’s 119-110 victory against Memphis.\nJames Ennis III finished with 14 points, Ish Smith scored 12 and Luke Kennard had 10 for the Pistons. Detroit shot 46.9 percent from the field (38 of 81) and outrebounded the visitors 50-42.\nChicago was held to 35.5 percent shooting (33 of 93) and made just nine of its 31 3-point attempts (29 percent).\nThe Bulls took the first meeting of the season between the two teams in a 107-105 win on Jan. 13 in Chicago. The teams face off twice more this season, on Mar. 24 in Detroit and in the season finale April 11 in Chicago.\nDetroit led 49-47 at halftime and limited Chicago to just 15 points in the third period to go up 73-62 heading into the fourth.\nThe Bulls were outscored 26-21 over the final 12 minutes as the Pistons opened their biggest lead of the game at 20 points with a Bullock jumper with 1:14 remaining, making it 99-79.\nThe Bulls led 26-21 after one quarter.\nChicago wraps up a quick two-game road trip Sunday against Atlanta. Detroit beings a six-game trip Tuesday in Utah.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
