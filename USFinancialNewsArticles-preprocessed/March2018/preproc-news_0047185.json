Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup and J.P. Morgan are acting as joint book-running managers of this offering. The underwriters may offer shares of Dominion Energy's common stock in transactions on the New York Stock Exchange, in the over-the-counter market or through negotiated transactions at either market prices or at negotiated prices.\nIn connection with the offering, Dominion Energy expects to enter into forward sale agreements with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or affiliates thereof (\"forward counterparties\") under which Dominion Energy will agree to issue and sell to the forward counterparties – subject to Dominion Energy's right to cash settle or net share settle the forward sale agreements – 20 million shares of its common stock. In addition, Dominion Energy expects to grant the underwriters of the offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3 million shares of Dominion Energy's common stock upon the same terms. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares, Dominion Energy expects to enter into additional forward sale agreements with the forward counterparties with respect to, in the aggregate, the additional shares.\nSettlement of the forward sale agreements is expected to occur on or prior to Dec. 31, 2018. Dominion Energy may, subject to certain conditions, elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of its rights and/or obligations under the forward sale agreements.\nThe expected net proceeds from the settlement of the forward sale agreements, assuming physical settlement, are to be used for general corporate purposes, including the reduction of Dominion Energy-level short- and long-term debt and support for Dominion Energy's regulated growth capital investments.\nThe offering is being made pursuant to Dominion Energy's effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
