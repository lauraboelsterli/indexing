    "text": "March 6 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc is laying a foundation of mobile banking tools to support a national digital consumer bank within the next three years, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on Tuesday.\n“I am not making an announcement right now, but I would be really disappointed if it was anything close to being three years away,” Gerspach said at an investor conference. “We really are laying the groundwork for having a national digital bank.”\nGerspach also said first quarter markets revenue is up by a “low-to-mid” single digit percentage from a strong quarter a year earlier.
