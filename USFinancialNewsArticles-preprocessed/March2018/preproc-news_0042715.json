    "text": "(Reuters) - Denmark on Monday announced the expulsion of two Russian diplomats in response to the nerve agent attack in Britain.\n“The Russian explanations of the incident are more or less imaginative, several of them are self-contradictory and are probably mostly a smokescreen to create doubt,” foreign minister Anders Samuelsen told journalists.\nThe two diplomats must leave Denmark within a week, he said.\nPotential economic sanctions will be looked at in cooperation with other EU countries, the minister added.\nEU leaders last week called evidence of Russian involvement presented by British Prime Minister Theresa May a solid basis for further action.\nReporting by Emil Gjerdingnielson; editing by Andrew Roche\n ",
