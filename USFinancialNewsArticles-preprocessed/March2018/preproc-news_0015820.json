Had record attendance at Oktane17, the company's annual customer and partner conference. Registration for the conference grew more than 50% over the previous year. Was named a leader by Gartner in its inaugural Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide and was positioned highest in \"ability to execute.\" The new report evaluated 15 companies, looking at both on-premises and cloud-delivered solutions. Was named a leader by Forrester Research in The Forrester Waveâ„¢: Identity-As-A-Service, Q4 2017 report. The report evaluated seven Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) vendors across strategy, market presence and current offering, and Okta was positioned as a Leader, earning the highest ranking in both the \"current offering\" and \"strategy\" categories. In February 2018, completed a private offering of convertible senior notes due 2023, receiving proceeds of $334 million net of underwriter discounts and commissions and other offering costs. The Company used approximately $27.6 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of bond hedge transactions offset by proceeds from warrant transactions.\nFinancial Outlook:\nThe guidance below and corresponding growth rates are presented under ASC Topic 606, which the Company adopted on February 1, 2018, using the retrospective method. Please refer to the supplemental tables posted on the Company's investor relations website for updated historical financials under ASC Topic 606.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company currently expects:\nTotal revenue of $78 to $79 million, representing a growth rate of 49 to 50% year-over-year Non-GAAP operating loss of $17.1 to $16.1 million Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.16 to $0.15, assuming shares outstanding of approximately 103 million\nFor the full fiscal 2019, the Company expects:\nTotal revenue of $343 to $348 million, representing a growth rate of 33 to 35% year-over-year Non-GAAP operating loss of $72.0 to $67.0 million Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.67 to $0.62, assuming shares outstanding of approximately 106 million\nThese statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to these .\nOkta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share outlook to their most directly comparable GAAP measure because certain items are out of Okta's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation for non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share is not available without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call Information:\nOkta will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on March 7, 2018. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company's website at investor.okta.com prior to the conference call. Interested parties can access the call by dialing (888) 245-0988 or (719) 325-2144, using the passcode 8312374.\nA live webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at investor.okta.com . A telephonic replay of the conference call will be available through March 21, 2018 and may be accessed by dialing (888) 203-1112 or (719) 457-0820 using the passcode 8312374.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers (\"Topic 606\"), which is effective beginning January 1, 2018. Topic 606 supersedes the prior revenue recognition standard (\"Topic 605\"). The financial information under the heading \"Financial Outlook\" above is prepared in accordance with Topic 606. Unless otherwise indicated, all other financial information in this release is prepared in accordance with Topic 605.\nUnder Topic 606, revenue recognition is no longer constrained by the invoicing terms of a contract and will therefore more align with the value delivered by our service over time. Due to the complexity of certain customer contracts, however, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Topic 606 will depend on contract specific terms and may result in greater variability in revenue from period to period. In addition, under Topic 606, revenue for all professional services will be recognized using proportional performance, which will align the revenue with the related costs as the professional services are delivered. We previously recognized revenue on certain fixed fee professional services upon completion.\nUnder Topic 606, we will defer all incremental commission costs to obtain customer contracts, including indirect costs that are not tied to a specific contract. These costs will be amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be generally five years. Under Topic 605, we deferred only direct and incremental commission costs to obtain a contract and amortized those costs over the contract term, which is generally one to three years.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThis press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings, and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets and charitable contributions.\nOkta believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Okta's financial condition and results of operations. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nManagement of the Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Okta urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.\nReconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis press release contains \" \" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook and market positioning.
