He will continue to report into Allen Appen, head of bond financing.\nGuillaume Fleuti, formerly head of corporate debt capital markets, will head the infrastructure group, a joint venture between global corporates and markets.\nCoverage bankers in the global corporates infrastructure group will now report to Fleuti. The infrastructure solutions debt business already reported to him, and will continue to do so.\nCarmalt has worked at Lloyds since 2011 and Fleuti since 2009. The role changes were effective from last week.\nReporting by Alice Gledhill, Editing by Helene Durand\n ",
