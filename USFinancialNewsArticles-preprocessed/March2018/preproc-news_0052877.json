    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 10:11 AM / Updated an hour ago FACTBOX-Cricket-Australia's sacked vice-captain David Warner Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMarch 28 (Reuters) - Factbox on deposed Australian vice-captain David Warner who was banned for 12 months by Cricket Australia on Wednesday for his part in the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. \n*Born: Oct. 27, 1986, Paddington, Australia \n*Made his test debut against New Zealand in 2011, scoring three and 12 at Brisbane. \n*He became the first Australian cricketer to be selected in 132 years for the national team without a single first-class cricket appearance when he made his Twenty20 international debut against South Africa in 2009. \n*An aggressive left-handed opening batsman, Warner has played 74 tests and scored 6363 runs at an average of 48.20, hitting 21 centuries and 29 fifties. \n*He scored his maiden test century in December 2011 in Australia’s unsuccessful run chase against New Zealand in Hobart. \n*In January 2012, he scored a 69-ball century against India at the WACA. At the time, this equalled West Indian Shivnarine Chanderpaul for the fourth fastest test century of all time, in terms of balls faced. \n*He was suspended by Cricket Australia for his “unprovoked physical attack” on England’s Joe Root in June 2013 and fined A$11,500 ($8,882). \n*Warner was named Australia’s vice-captain across tests, one-day internationals formats of the game in August 2015. \n*He is currently ranked fifth in the International Cricket Council’s test batting rankings. ($1 = 1.2947 Australian dollars) (Compiled by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru Editing by Christian Radnedge)",
