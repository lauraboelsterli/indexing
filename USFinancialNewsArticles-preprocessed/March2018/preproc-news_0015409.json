    "text": "A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures for Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations, and Normalized Adjusted Funds from Operations is included in the financial table at the end of this announcement.\nBETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Medical REIT Inc. (NYSE: GMRE) (the “Company”), a Maryland corporation engaged primarily in the acquisition of licensed, state-of-the-art, purpose-built healthcare facilities and the leasing of these facilities to strong clinical operators with leading market share, today announces its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Fourth Quarter and Other Highlights\nTotal revenue increased to $9.9 million from $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss attributable to common stockholders decreased to $(0.2) million, or $(0.01) per share, from $(1.9) million, or $(0.11) per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Funds from Operations (“FFO”) increased to $0.14 per share, from $(0.06) per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\") increased to $0.15 per share, from $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter, the Company completed seven acquisitions comprising 142,666 rentable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $48.4 million. Based on rents in effect at the closing of each transaction, the seven properties are expected to generate aggregate annual cash rent receipts of $3.5 million. See Acquisition table herein for additional detail. Subsequent to year end, the Company has completed four acquisitions containing 323,400 rentable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $48.4 million. Based on rents in effect at the closing of each transaction, these four properties are expected to generate aggregate annual cash rent receipts of $4.2 million. See Acquisition table herein for additional detail. On March 6, 2018, the Company amended its revolving credit facility to increase the aggregate size of the facility by $90 million to $340 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $164.9 million of outstanding borrowings on this facility. On March 6, 2018, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire a four-building medical office portfolio comprising an aggregate of 155,600 rentable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $64.2 million.\nJeff Busch, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We continued building our portfolio in the fourth quarter and up through today we have closed on acquisitions of $97 million of properties since the end of the third quarter of 2017, bringing our aggregate portfolio size to $520 million with a weighted average cap rate of 7.74%. I’m also pleased to report that we currently have two transactions under contract for a combined purchase price of approximately $80 million with an average cap rate of 7.94% that would increase our portfolio to $600 million. In summary, 2017 was a transformative year for us, as we significantly increased the size of our portfolio, stabilized our G&A expenses and made personnel changes at the executive level that we believe put us in the best position to have a successful 2018.”\nAcquisition Activity\nCompleted Acquisitions Since the End of the Third Quarter of 2017\nFrom the end of the third quarter of 2017 to date, the Company completed 11 acquisitions, encompassing an aggregate of 466,066 rentable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $96.8 million at a weighted average cap rate of 7.90%.

We are currently in the due diligence periods for these transactions. If we identify problems with the properties or the operators of the properties during our due diligence review, we may not close the transactions on a timely basis or we may terminate the purchase agreements and not close the transactions.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Financial Review\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, total revenue increased to $9.9 million, compared to $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of increased rental revenue due to the Company’s larger property portfolio. Total expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $8.6 million, compared to $5.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Within total expenses, general and administrative expenses were $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from $1.3 million in the prior year quarter. This decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a reduction in non-cash LTIP expense. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $(0.2) million, or $(0.01) per share, compared to $(1.9) million, or $(0.11) per share for the fourth quarter of the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to significantly higher rental revenue, compared to the prior year quarter. Quarterly FFO per share grew to $0.14, compared to $(0.06) for the fourth quarter in the prior year. Quarterly AFFO per share grew to $0.15, compared to $0.06 for the fourth quarter in the prior year. Quarterly Normalized Adjusted Funds from Operations (“Normalized AFFO”) per share grew to $0.15, compared to $0.06 for the fourth quarter in the prior year.\n2017 Full Year Financial Review\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total revenue increased to $30.3 million, compared to $8.2 million for the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increased size of the Company’s property portfolio. Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $30.4 million, compared to $14.6 million in the prior year. The year-over-year growth in total expenses was largely driven by the significantly increased size of the Company’s property portfolio. Within total expenses, general and administrative expenses were $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.2 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with our Sarbanes-Oxley implementation efforts and a full year’s worth of public company costs. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $(1.8) million, or $(0.09) per share, compared to $(6.4) million, or $(0.68) per share for the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to increased rental revenue driven by the growth in the Company’s property portfolio. The Company’s FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 grew to $0.41, compared to $(0.43) for the prior year. The Company’s AFFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 grew to $0.54, compared to $(0.03) for the prior year. The Company’s Normalized AFFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 grew to $0.56 compared to $(0.02) for the prior year.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $5.1 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $19.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company’s gross investment in real estate as of December 31, 2017 was $471.5 million compared to $206.9 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company’s total debt, which includes outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility, notes payable (net of unamortized deferred financing costs), and related party debt, was $203.4 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $66.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company’s weighted-average interest rate and term of its debt was 3.72% and 2.94 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\nDeclaration of First Quarter Common Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends\nThe Company announced today that its Board of Directors authorized:\na $0.20 per share cash dividend to common stockholders of record as of March 22, 2018, to be paid on April 10, 2018.

The Company considers FFO, AFFO, and Normalized AFFO to be important supplemental measures of its operating performance and believes FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. In accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ (“NAREIT”) definition, FFO means net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP before non-controlling interests of holders of operating partnership units, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and extraordinary items, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company did not incur any gains or losses from the sales of property or record any adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Because FFO excludes real estate related depreciation and amortization (other than amortization of deferred financing costs), the Company believes that FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared period-over-period, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from the closest GAAP measurement, net income or loss.\nAFFO is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors and analysts to measure a real estate company’s operating performance by removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations. Management calculates AFFO by modifying the NAREIT computation of FFO by adjusting it for certain cash and non-cash items and certain recurring and non-recurring items. For the Company these items include recurring acquisition and disposition costs, loss on the extinguishment of debt, recurring straight line deferred rental revenue, recurring stock-based compensation expense, recurring amortization of deferred financing costs, recurring capital expenditures, recurring lease commissions, recurring tenant improvements, an advisory fee settled with the issuance of OP Units, and other items.\nManagement calculates Normalized AFFO, which is also a non-GAAP financial measure, by modifying AFFO by adjusting for non-recurring income and expenses. For the Company this item includes the costs of establishing a system of Sarbanes-Oxley compliant internal controls and procedures. During the second and third quarters of 2017, Normalized AFFO included the portion of our General Counsel and Secretary’s salary for 2017 that is reimbursable by the Company to Inter-American Management, LLC, the Company’s external manager (the “Advisor”). During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company learned that the Advisor may request that such reimbursement arrangement be extended; therefore, until the terms of such potential extension are finalized, the Company is removing such expense from Normalized AFFO.\nManagement believes that reporting AFFO in addition to FFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investment community to use when evaluating the operating performance of the Company on a comparative basis. Management also considers Normalized AFFO to be a useful measure to evaluate the Company’s operating results excluding non-recurring income and expenses. Normalized AFFO can help investors compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other companies. The Company’s FFO, AFFO, and Normalized AFFO computations may not be comparable to FFO, AFFO, and Normalized AFFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does or that compute FFO, AFFO, and Normalized AFFO in a different manner.\nGlobal Medical REIT Inc.\nReconciliation of FFO, AFFO, and Normalized AFFO\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited, in thousands except per share amounts) Net income (loss) $ 1,249 $ (1,930) $ (87) $ (6,353) Less: Preferred stock dividends (1,456) - (1,714) - Depreciation and amortization expense 3,303 849 10,001 2,377 Amortization of above market leases 115 (1) 129 (1) FFO $ 3,211 $ (1,082) $ 8,329 $ (3,977) Acquisition costs 393 1,568 2,523 2,322 Straight line deferred rental revenue (1,064) (459) (3,137) (681) Stock-based compensation expense 315 854 1,796 1,685 Amortization of deferred financing costs 384 135 1,224 350 Non-cash advisory fee 113 - 232 - AFFO $ 3,352 $ 1,016 $ 10,967 $ (301) Professional fees and services related to Sarbanes-Oxley implementation 50 48 430 73 Normalized AFFO $ 3,402 $ 1,064 $ 11,397 $ (228) Net loss attributable to common stockholders per share – basic and diluted $ (0.01) $ (0.11) $ (0.09) $ (0.68) FFO per Share $ 0.14 $ (0.06) $ 0.41 $ (0.43) AFFO per Share $ 0.15 $ 0.06 $ 0.54 $ (0.03) Normalized AFFO per Share $ 0.15 $ 0.06 $ 0.56 $ (0.02) Weighted Average Shares and Units Outstanding – basic and diluted 22,807 17,606 20,242 9,302 Reconciliation of Weighted Average Shares and Units Outstanding Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Weighted Average Common Shares 21,631 17,606 19,617 9,302 Weighted Average OP Units 757 - 204 - Weighted Average LTIP Units 419 - 421 - Weighted Average Shares and Units Outstanding – basic and diluted 22,807 17,606 20,242 9,302\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180307006264/en/\nCOMPANY:\nGlobal Medical REIT Inc.\nDanica Holley, 202-524-6854\nChief Operating Officer\ndanicah@globalmedicalreit.com\nor\nINVESTOR RELATIONS:\nThe Equity Group Inc.\nJeremy Hellman, 212-836-9626\nSenior Associate\njhellman@equityny.com\nor\nAdam Prior, 212-836-9606\nSenior Vice-President\naprior@equityny.com\nSource: Global Medical REIT Inc.",
