This rate is based on our estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented above as well as significant tax adjustments, such as adjustments resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"). Our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events or trends that we believe materially impact the estimated annual rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in the geographic mix of revenue and expenses and other significant events. Due to the differences in the tax treatment of items excluded from non-GAAP earnings, as well as the methodology applied to our estimated annual tax rates as described above, our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income may differ from our GAAP tax rate and from our actual tax liabilities.\n(2) Totals may not sum, due to rounding. Operating margin, tax rate and net income per weighted average share information are calculated based upon the respective underlying, non-rounded data.\n(3) GAAP net loss per weighted-average share, diluted, was based upon 403,383 diluted weighted-average shares for Classes A and B. During the three months ended February 2, 2018, VMware incurred a GAAP net loss. As a result, all potentially dilutive securities were anti-dilutive and excluded from the computation of GAAP net loss per weighted-average share, diluted.\n(4) Non-GAAP net income per weighted-average share, diluted, was calculated based upon 410,096 diluted weighted-average shares for Classes A and B.\nVMware, Inc.

SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE OF PRELIMINARY ASC 606 ADJUSTMENTS (amounts in millions, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) (unaudited) During May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued updates to accounting standards related to revenue recognition (\"ASC 606\"). VMware will adopt ASC 606 using the full retrospective transition method during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The following tables present a preliminary view of selected financial information for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal year 2018, as adjusted under ASC 606, to provide a comparable comparison to VMware's first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal year 2019 guidance. The Company is continuing to evaluate the effect that ASC 606 will have on our consolidated financial statements, and these preliminary adjustments could differ from the final adjusted consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal year 2018 to be disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 4, 2018 and our Form 10-K for the year ended February 1, 2019.

Non-GAAP realignment and loss on disposition was also adjusted by $13 million relating to the preliminary ASC 606 adjustment.\n(2) Under ASC 606, revenue increased during three months ended May 5, 2017 and decreased during the twelve months ended February 2, 2018, primarily due to changes in the timing of revenue recognition for license and services arrangements where revenue was previously deferred.\n(3) Under ASC 606, additional sales commission costs are deferred and are amortized over a longer duration. Adjustments to sales and marketing expense are primarily due to the increased deferral of commission costs, net of related amortization.\n(4) Adjustment to non-GAAP income tax provision reflects the non-GAAP tax rate of 20.5% applied against the preliminary ASC 606 adjustments. The non-GAAP income tax rate excludes the impact of discrete items, such as adjustments resulting from the implementation of the Tax Act. The Company is continuing to evaluate the tax impact on adjustments resulting from ASC 606 and a reasonable estimate of the impact to GAAP income tax provision cannot be made at this time.\n(5) Calculated based upon 414,018 and 413,368 diluted weighted-average shares for Classes A and B for the three months ended May 5, 2017 and twelve months ended February 2, 2018, respectively.\nVMware, Inc.

Adjustments to other assets primarily include the unamortized portion of deferred commission costs.\n(3) Accrued expenses and other under ASC 606 includes customer prepayments related to contracts with various cancellation rights. Previously, these customer prepayments were included in unearned revenue.\n(4) Generally, revenue that was previously deferred for on-premise license sales is accelerated under ASC 606 and reduces unearned revenue. In addition, customer prepayments on contracts with various cancellation rights are included in accrued expenses and other under ASC 606, which reduces unearned revenue.\nThe following table summarizes preliminary unearned revenue by type, as adjusted:\nFebruary 2, 2018 As Reported Preliminary\nASC 606 Adjustments Preliminary\nAs Adjusted Unearned revenue as reported: License $ 523 $ (341 ) $ 182 Software maintenance 5,141 (57 ) 5,084 Professional services 586 (11 ) 575 Total unearned revenue $ 6,250 $ (409 ) $ 5,841\nVMware, Inc.

Operating margin, tax rate and net income per weighted average share information are calculated based upon the respective underlying, non-rounded data.\n(3) Calculated based upon 414,018 diluted weighted-average shares for Classes A and B.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors and others with additional information regarding VMware’s results, VMware has disclosed in this earnings release the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP income per diluted share, and free cash flows. VMware has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures, other than free cash flows, differ from GAAP in that they exclude stock-based compensation, employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, realignment charges, acquisition, disposition and other-related items, gain or loss on share repurchase, certain litigation and other contingencies and discrete items that impacted our GAAP tax rate, each as discussed below. Our non-GAAP financial measures also reflect the application of our non-GAAP tax rate. Free cash flows differ from GAAP cash flows from operating activities with respect to the treatment of capital expenditures.\nVMware’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, to calculate bonus payments and to evaluate VMware’s financial performance, the performance of its individual functional groups and the ability of operations to generate cash. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect VMware’s ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in VMware’s business, as they exclude charges and gains that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating VMware’s operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. Additionally, management believes information regarding free cash flows provides investors and others with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, to repurchase shares, to fund ongoing operations and to fund other capital expenditures.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing VMware’s operating performance due to the following factors:\nStock-based compensation . Stock-based compensation is generally fixed at the time the stock-based instrument is granted and amortized over a period of several years. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of VMware’s employees and executives, the expense for the fair value of the stock-based instruments VMware utilizes may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of VMware’s core business. Employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions. The amount of employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation is dependent on VMware’s stock price and other factors that are beyond VMware’s control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets . A portion of the purchase price of VMware’s acquisitions is generally allocated to intangible assets, such as intellectual property, and is subject to amortization. However, VMware does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. Additionally, the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition. Therefore, VMware believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for the amortization of intangible assets provides investors and others with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. Realignment charges. Realignment charges include workforce reductions, asset impairments, losses on asset disposals and costs to exit facilities. VMware’s management believes it is useful to exclude these items, when significant, as they are not reflective of VMware’s core business and operating results. Acquisition, disposition and other-related items. As VMware does not acquire or dispose of businesses on a predictable cycle and the terms of each transaction can vary significantly and are unique to each transaction, VMware believes it is useful to exclude acquisition, disposition and other-related items when looking for a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. These items include: Direct costs of acquisitions and dispositions, such as transaction and advisory fees. Accruals for the portion of merger consideration payable in installments that may be paid in cash or VMware stock, at the option of VMware. Charges recognized for non-recoverable strategic investments or gains recognized on the disposition of strategic investments are included as other-related items. Gains or losses on sale or disposal of distinct lines of business or product offerings, or transactions with features similar to discontinued operations, including recoveries or charges recognized to adjust the fair value of assets that qualify as “held for sale.” Certain costs incurred related to Dell’s acquisition of VMware’s parent company, EMC Corporation. Gain or loss on share repurchase. In December 2016, VMware entered into a stock purchase agreement with Dell and Dell’s wholly-owned subsidiary, EMC Equity Assets LLC, pursuant to which VMware agreed to purchase $500 million of VMware Class A common stock. Through December 31, 2016, VMware had purchased 4.8 million shares for $375 million, as well as recognized a derivative asset related to its obligation to repurchase $125 million of additional shares. The derivative asset was measured at fair value on a recurring basis and resulted in the recognition of gains and losses, which were recorded to other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of income. On February 15, 2017, the stock purchase agreement with Dell was completed. VMware’s management believes it is useful to exclude the mark-to-market adjustment on the derivative asset, as it is not reflective of VMware’s core business and operating results. Certain litigation and other contingencies. VMware, from time to time, may incur charges or benefits that are outside of the ordinary course of VMware’s business related to litigation and other contingencies. VMware believes it is useful to exclude such charges or benefits because it does not consider such amounts to be part of the ongoing operation of VMware’s business and because of the singular nature of the claims underlying such matters. Tax adjustment . Non-GAAP financial information for the quarter is adjusted for a tax rate equal to VMware’s annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on VMware’s estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating VMware’s non-GAAP income as well as discrete items, such as the estimated net tax expense recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. VMware’s estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events or trends that VMware management believes materially impact the estimated annual rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in the geographic mix of revenue and expenses and other significant events. Due to the differences in the tax treatment of items excluded from non-GAAP earnings, as well as the methodology applied to VMware’s estimated annual tax rates as described above, the estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income may differ from the GAAP tax rate and from VMware’s actual tax liabilities.\nAdditionally, VMware’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flows is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations.\nThe use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations because they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect VMware’s operations. Specifically, in the case of stock-based compensation, if VMware did not pay out a portion of its compensation in the form of stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect VMware’s cash position. VMware compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of VMware’s liquidity. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.\nManagement encourages investors and others to review VMware’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nSource:VMware, Inc.",
