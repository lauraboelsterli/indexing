    "text": "Andre Drummond recorded the 20th 20-20 game of the career and the Detroit Pistons won for the fifth time in six games by downing the Washington Wizards 103-92 victory on Thursday night at Little Caesars Arena.\nDrummond powered for 24 points and 23 rebounds as the Detroit averted a four-game sweep in the season series. Anthony Tolliver and Reggie Bullock had 14 points apiece and Reggie Jackson contributed 13 points and eight assists.\nPistons power forward Blake Griffin was a late scratch due to a right ankle contusion. Griffin missed his first game since joining the team in late January after a blockbuster trade with the Los Angeles Clippers.\nSecond-year forward Henry Ellenson picked up some of Griffin’s minutes and chipped in nine points and five rebounds off the bench.\nBradley Beal led Washington, which has lost four of five, with 15 points but also committed six turnovers. Kelly Oubre Jr. had 14 points, Markieff Morris supplied 11 points, six rebounds, five assists and four blocks, and Tomas Satoransky added 11 points and six assists for the Wizards. Marcin Gortat chipped in a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds.\nWizards forward Otto Porter suffered a sprained right ankle early in the third quarter and did not return.\nAll-Star point guard John Wall was active and in uniform for the first time since undergoing left knee surgery in late January but, as expected, did not play. He missed his 27th consecutive game.\nThe score was tied at 49-all at halftime. The Pistons scored the first five points of the second half and steadily built their lead throughout the quarter. Detroit outscored Washington 32-17 to carry an 81-66 advantage into the fourth quarter.\nDrummond led a 12-2 run during the final three minutes of the third. He had a dunk, two layups and three rebounds during that stretch while Ish Smith contributed two baskets and an assist.\nThe Wizards chipped away and trailed by just six when Oubre made a layup with 6:10 left. A Satoransky layup less than a minute later made it a four-point spread.\nLayups by Bullock and Jackson, sandwiching a Washington turnover, gave Detroit a 95-87 lead. Jackson hit a jumper on the Pistons’ next possession for a double-digit advantage. Washington never got closer than seven the rest of the way.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
