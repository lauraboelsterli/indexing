    "text": "BOULDER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Greenhouse Family of Companies, an innovative business strategy that brings three distinct companies and cultures—and their core competencies—together under one roof, announced that it has opened its new corporate headquarters in Boulder.\nThe newly-remodeled, 14,500-square foot stand-alone facility, located at 1820 Folsom St. near the University of Colorado campus and just east of downtown Boulder, will now be the home for the more than 50 employees of the Greenhouse Family of Companies. This includes employees from Greenhouse Partners , a brand strategy, creative, marketing communications, and innovation firm; The18 , the largest—by cross-platform audience size—digital soccer media company in the U.S.; and Greenhouse Scholars , an education nonprofit that cultivates extraordinary leaders to change low-income families and communities.\n“Our three companies have grown to the point where we needed a new space, not only so we all could fit, but where we have room to continue our growth while nurturing our distinct and shared company cultures,” said Pete Burridge, CEO of the three companies. “We were able to design and build out this facility to our own unique specifications, and we are thrilled with the spectacular home we will enjoy for many years to come.”\nThe building has been transformed into a bright, airy space with distinct areas for the three companies, yet plenty of communal workspaces where employees can collaborate. The facility has a two-story, floor-to-ceiling glass wall as its entry area, contains multiple tech-centered conference rooms, comfortable open meeting spaces, and a phone room decorated as an iconic London red telephone booth. In addition, the building houses The18’s new studio, outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment and containing three different sets to produce the digital media company’s video and photography content.\nThe facility is also packed with amenities for employees, including a full kitchen that includes beer and wine fridges, a long café style booth seating area, and a foosball table, private bicycle parking including communal bikes for employee use, four distinctive wifi-equipped outdoor patios and courtyards, shower facilities, and a library.\nAbout the Greenhouse Family of Companies\nGreenhouse Partners is a brand strategy, creative, marketing communications, and innovation firm founded in 2001. We believe in a holistic definition of brand—where your culture and business strategy has as much impact on your brand as your brand positioning, logo, digital strategy or advertising campaign. We create diverse, brand-centric solutions for clients that range from startups to The Coca-Cola Company and that cut across industries in B2C and B2B categories.\nThe18 is a rising digital sports media company that focuses on the world of soccer and providing fans of the game with fun, engaging, viral content. With more than 14 million unique visitors monthly across all platforms, The18 has become the largest U.S.-based soccer-only site in just four years since its launch.\nGreenhouse Scholars , an education non-profit organization founded in 2005, serves low-income college students who are exceptionally high performing. Scholars are selected based on academic achievement, service to community, demonstrated leadership skills, and financial need. Through its \"Whole Person\" approach of intellectual, academic, professional, and financial support, Greenhouse Scholars cultivates leaders to change low-income families and communities. To date, Greenhouse Scholars has served more than 220 students in Colorado, Illinois, and Georgia, and recently expanded to North Carolina.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228006558/en/\nGreenhouse Family of Companies\nShawn Malayter, 872-267-2636\nsmalayter@greenhousepartners.com\nSource: Greenhouse Family of Companies",
