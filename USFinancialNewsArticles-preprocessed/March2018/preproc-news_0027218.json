    "text": "Three of the biggest winners, in a bill meant to help small and midsize banks, are anything but.\nThe bill, championed by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, would raise the threshold for stricter oversight by the Federal Reserve to $250 billion in assets from $50 billion, a boon for midsize regional lenders. It also contains measures to reduce the burden of regulation on smaller community banks.\nThanks... ",
