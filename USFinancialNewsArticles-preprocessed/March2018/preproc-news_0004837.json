    "text": "Washington, DC,March 02, 2018(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nRecall Release CLASS I RECALL\nHEALTH RISK: HIGH Congressional and Public Affairs\nMitch Adams (202) 720-9113\nPress@fsis.usda.gov\nFSIS-RC-018-2018\nOLLI SALUMERIA AMERICANA FIRM RECALLS READY-TO-EAT MEAT PRODUCTS DUE TO POSSIBLE LISTERIA CONTAMINATION\nWASHINGTON, March 2, 2018 – Olli Salumeria Americana, an Oceanside, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately 3,946 pounds of ready-to-eat meat products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.\nThe not heat treated, shelf stable, ready-to-eat meat items were packaged on January 19, 2018. The following products are subject to recall:\n6 oz. packages of “Gusto NAPOLI APPLEWOOD-SMOKED SALAME” containing lot code 1000012821.\n6 oz. packages of “Gusto CHORIZO SMOKED PAPRIKA” containing lot code 1000012812.\n6 oz. packages of “Gusto SOPRESSATA BLACK PEPPERCORN SALAME” containing lot code 1000012811.\n6 oz. packages of “Gusto TOSCANO FENNEL POLLEN SALAME” containing lot code 1000012805.\n6 oz. packages of “Gusto PEPPERONI CLASSICALLY AMERICAN” containing lot code 1000012804.\n175 gram packages of “OLLI MOLISANA PEPPER + GARLIC SALAMI” containing lot code 1000012808.\n175 gram packages of “OLLI NAPOLI APPLEWOOD-SMOKED SALAMI” containing lot code 1000012810.\n175 gram packages of “OLLI CALABRESE SPICY SALAMI” containing lot code 1000012807.\nThe products subject to recall bear establishment number “M-45334” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide and exported to Canada.\nThe problem was discovered when the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) performed routine Listeria monocytogenes sampling. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.\nConsumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.\nListeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.\nConsumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.\nFSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls .\nMedia and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Oliviero Colmignoli, owner of Olli Salumeria Americana, at oliviero@olli.com .\nConsumers with food safety questions can \"Ask Karen,\" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov .
