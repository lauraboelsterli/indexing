REUTERS/Mukesh Gupta/File Photo Demand for longer-dated debt has waned as yields have surged since mid-2017 on concerns the Reserve Bank of India will raise interest rates as early as this year, while state-run lenders have also refrained from buying debt after sustaining market losses. Indian government officials met a group of primary dealers on Wednesday to discuss the government’s borrowing plans for the year starting in April.
