    "text": "Boeing will not appeal against the U.S. trade commission ruling that allows Canada's Bombardier to sell its newest jets to U.S. airlines without heavy duties, a Boeing spokesman said on Thursday.\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) unanimously voted in January to reject Boeing's complaint and discarded a Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300 percent duty on sales of the 110-to-130-seat Bombardier CSeries jets for five years.\nThe ITC had widely been expected to side with Chicago-based Boeing, the world's largest maker of jetliners, which accused Bombardier of dumping the planes, or selling them below cost, in the U.S. market.\nHowever, the ITC said it rejected placing duties on Bombardier jets partly because Boeing had lost no sales or revenue when Delta Air Lines ordered the aircraft in 2016 from the Canadian planemaker.\nThe ITC ruled the 110-seat CSeries jets ordered by Delta and Boeing's smallest 737 MAX 7 plane do not compete.\nThe smaller end of the jet market is an increasing focus for the major manufacturers. Airbus has agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries in a deal expected to close later this year, while Boeing is in tie-up talks with Bombardier's Brazilian rival Embraer .\nThe Boeing spokesman declined to elaborate on the decision not to appeal.\nIt was not yet clear how Boeing's decision will impact the planemaker's relationship with the Canadian government, which is holding a competition for fighter jets worth between C$15 billion and $C19 billion.\nA Bombardier spokesman was not immediately available to comment.",
