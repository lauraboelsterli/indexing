Ganoza, President and CEO, commented, “Our results in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflect record sales and EBITDA that have contributed to our strongest year to date in financial performance.” Mr. Ganoza continued, “Annual sales of $268.1 million, with EBITDA margins of 46% and strong cash accumulation from our mines attest to the strength of our assets and the positive momentum in our business. Drivers for year over year performance are higher precious metal production, higher base metal prices for our by-products, and improved commercial terms. ” Mr. Ganoza concluded, “Our Lindero gold project in Argentina is in the early stages of construction with on-site activities ramping up during the course of the second quarter”.\n2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and MD&A Highlights\nSales of $268.1 million, compared to $210.3 million in 2016 Net income of $66.3 million, compared to $17.9 million in 2016 Adjusted net income of $48.6 million, compared to $18.1 million in 2016 Earnings per share of $0.42, compared to $0.13 in 2016 Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $122.0 million, compared to $83.1 million in 2016 Impairment reversal at Caylloma of $31.1 million before taxes driven by a successful resource expansion Cash position, including short-term investments as at December 31, 2017 was $212.6 million $120.0 million credit facility in place with $80.0 million undrawn Silver and gold production of 8,469,593 ounces and 56,441 ounces, respectively AISC 2 per ounce of payable silver, net of by-product credits for gold, lead and zinc, was $6.4\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Statements and MD&A Highlights\nSales of $75.4 million, compared to $57.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 Net income of $34.1 million, compared to $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 Adjusted net income of $12.3 million, compared to $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $34.9 million, compared to $29.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 Silver and gold production of 2,310,176 ounces and 15,283 ounces, respectively AISC per ounce of payable silver, net of by-product credits for gold, lead and zinc, was $5.2\nNote:\n1.

Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $34.1 million or $0.21 per share compared to $6.5 million or $0.04 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income in the quarter was positively impacted by an after-tax reversal of impairment of $21.9 million at the Caylloma Mine. Adjusted net income was $12.3 million compared to $7.1 million for 2016.\nThe increase in adjusted net income during the quarter was due primarily to higher sales across all of our products and was partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $6.4 million, related mainly to the mark-to-market effects from share-based payments and higher production costs. Additional items impacting the quarter were $1.5 million of realized losses from derivative contracts, $1.3 million in exploration and evaluation expenses, and partially offset by foreign exchange gains of $1.3 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $34.9 million compared to $29.4 million in the comparable period in 2016 due to increased sales.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $29.0 million or 12% higher than the $25.8 million in 2016 due primarily to higher adjusted EBITDA offset by changes in working capital items.\nA graph accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a23705f0-5368-4c2e-a9db-e2606975e0a9\nAnnual Results\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $66.3 million or $0.42 per share compared to $17.9 million or $0.13 per share for the comparable year in 2016. Net income was positively impacted by the after-tax reversal of impairment of $21.9 million at the Caylloma Mine.\nAdjusted net income for 2017 increased to $48.6 million from $18.1 million in 2016 mostly as a result of higher sales across all our products, reflecting the first full year of production at the expanded capacity of 3,000 tpd at the San Jose mine, strong by-product metal prices of lead and zinc, and significantly improved treatment and refining charges.\nAlso contributing to higher adjusted net income were lower selling, general and administrative expenses by $6.2 million related primarily to mark-to-market effect from share-based payments. Adjusted net income was negatively impacted by higher production cash costs, $2.0 million in foreign exchange losses from the strengthening of the Mexican Peso against the US dollar, and $1.6 million realized losses on derivative contracts.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $122.0 million compared to $83.1 million in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $70.2 million, 33% higher than the $52.7 million in 2016. This increase was due primarily to a $38.9 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and partially offset by higher income taxes paid of $18.7 million.\nA graph accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d1560155-e550-4547-8cd3-e6759f1901e4\nBalance sheet and Liquidity\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $212.6 million (December 31, 2016: $123.6 million), an increase of $89.0 million since the beginning of the year. The increase was due primarily to an equity financing in the first quarter of 2017 for net proceeds of $70.9 million and free cash flows from operations during the period.\nOn January 26, 2018 the Company closed an amendment to its existing credit facility with Scotiabank to expand the facility from $40.0 million to $120.0 million. This takes our total sources of liquidity as at year end to over $290.0 million which along with the current rate of free cash flow by our existing operations, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet our funding needs during the construction of the Lindero project.\nSan Jose Mine, Mexico QUARTERLY RESULTS YEAR TO DATE RESULTS San Jose Three months ended, December 31, Year ended, December 31, Mine Production 2017 2016 2017 2016 Tonnes milled 271,370 273,036 1,070,790 905,467 Average tonnes milled per day 3,015 3,103 3,044 2,596 Silver Grade (g/t) 259 225 238 228 Recovery (%) 92 92 92 92 Production (oz) 2,071,762 1,828,110 7,526,556 6,124,235 Metal sold (oz) 2,089,121 1,832,298 7,481,616 6,102,667 Realized price ($/oz) 16.69 17.10 17.03 17.29 Gold Grade (g/t) 1.89 1.69 1.77 1.72 Recovery (%) 92 92 92 92 Production (oz) 15,177 13,660 55,950 46,018 Metal sold (oz) 15,333 13,746 55,412 45,901 Realized price ($/oz) 1,273 1,216 1,257 1,253 Unit Costs Production cash cost (US$/oz Ag)* 0.04 1.85 0.95 1.77 Production cash cost (US$/tonne) 57.91 55.09 59.70 56.90 Unit Net Smelter Return (US$/tonne) 181.65 154.21 169.78 158.76 All-in sustaining cash cost (US$/oz Ag)* 6.51 6.73 7.11 7.58 * Net of by-product credits from gold Quarterly Results\nThe San Jose Mine produced 2,071,762 ounces of silver and 15,177 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of 2017, 13% and 11% above the comparable period in 2016. Average head grades for silver and gold were 259 g/t and 1.89 g/t, 15% and 12% higher than the comparable period in 2016. Mine production was sourced from Trinidad Central and Trinidad North, with each area contributing 57% and 43% of ore, respectively.\nCash cost per tonne of processed ore was $57.9, 5% above the $55.1 cash cost for the comparable quarter in 2016.\nAnnual Results\nSilver and gold annual production for 2017 increased 23% and 22% above prior year’s production to 7,526,555 ounces and 55,950 ounces. The increases were the result of 18% higher throughput as well as 4% and 3% higher head grades of gold and silver over the comparative period in 2016. Silver and gold annual production were 6% and 8% above 2017 guidance, respectively.\nCash cost per tonne of processed ore for 2017 was $59.7, or 5% higher than the cost in the prior year. Cash cost per tonne for 2017 was 5% above guidance due to higher mine support costs and local inflation on the cost of energy and materials.\nAll-in sustaining cash cost per payable ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, was $7.1 for 2017 and below the annual guidance of $8.4 as a result of higher gold price.\nCash cost per payable ounce of silver, and cash cost per tonne of processed ore, are non-GAAP financial measures.\nCaylloma Mine, Peru\nQUARTERLY RESULTS YEAR TO DATE RESULTS Caylloma Three months ended, December 31, Year ended, December 31, Mine Production 2017 2016 2017 2016 Tonnes milled 134,635 135,121 529,704 514,828 Average tonnes milled per day 1,513 1,501 1,488 1,438 Silver Grade (g/t) 65 82 66 90 Recovery (%) 85 82 84 84 Production (oz) 238,414 291,988 943,038 1,255,981 Metal sold (oz) 243,051 294,425 934,710 1,274,842 Realized price ($/oz) 16.70 17.11 17.06 16.96 Lead Grade (%) 2.91 2.60 2.81 3.06 Recovery (%) 91 94 91 94 Production (000's lbs) 7,846 7,290 29,878 32,673 Metal sold (000's lbs) 8,054 7,361 29,508 33,187 Realized price ($/lb) 1.13 0.97 1.05 0.84 Zinc Grade (%) 4.36 4.06 4.21 4.25 Recovery (%) 90 91 90 90 Production (000's lbs) 11,676 11,006 44,347 43,204 Metal sold (000's lbs) 11,803 10,537 44,315 43,041 Realized price ($/lb) 1.47 1.15 1.32 0.95 Unit Costs Production cash cost (US$/oz Ag)* (44.43) (14.59) (34.56) (6.78) Production cash cost (US$/tonne) 82.02 71.15 79.11 71.89 Unit Net Smelter Return (US$/tonne) 184.09 136.92 166.18 126.91 All-in sustaining cash cost (US$/oz Ag)* (18.37) 1.72 (13.04) 4.34 * Net of by-product credits from gold, lead and zinc Quarterly Results\nThe Caylloma Mine produced 7.8 million pounds of lead and 11.7 million pounds of zinc, which were 8% and 6% higher than the comparable quarter in 2016 as a result of higher head grades of 12% and 7% respectively. Silver production was 238,414 ounces or 18% lower than the comparable period in 2016. Average silver head grade was 65 g/t or 21% below 2016 but was partially offset by a higher metallurgical recovery of 85% compared to 82%.\nCash cost per tonne of processed ore for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $82.0 which was 15% higher than the $71.2 cash cost for the comparable quarter of 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher energy, ground support, and labour costs.\nAnnual Results\nTotal zinc production for 2017 increased 3% to 44.3 million pounds over 2016 while lead production decreased 8% to 29.9 million pounds. Silver production decreased 25% to 943,038 ounces compared to 2016 production of 1,255,981 ounces. Silver production was within 96% of annual guidance. Head grades for lead, zinc, and silver were 8%, 1 %, and 27% lower than in 2016, respectively. However, this decline in head grades was partially offset by a 3% increase in processed ore. Silver, zinc, and lead annual production were 6% below, 8% above, and in line with 2017 guidance.\nCash cost per tonne of processed ore for 2017 was $79.1 or 10% higher than in 2016 and 5% above guidance. The increase in cash costs was due mainly to higher mining, energy, and labour costs.\nAll-in sustaining cash cost per payable ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, was $(13.04) per ounce for 2017, and below the annual guidance of $10.80 per ounce.\nCash cost per payable ounce of silver, and cash cost per tonne of processed ore, are non-GAAP financial measures\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income for Fourth Quarter and Year to Date Q4 2017 Adjustments Q4 2017\nadjusted YTD 2017 Adjustments YTD 2017\nadjusted Sales 75.4 75.4 268.1 268.1 Cost of sales 40.1 40.1 158.6 158.6 Mine operating income 35.2 35.2 109.6 109.6 Selling, general and administration 8.4 8.4 24.9 24.9 Exploration and evaluation 1.3 1.3 1.5 1.5 Share of loss of equity-accounted investee 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 Foreign exchange loss (gain) (1.3) (1.3) 2.1 2.1 Impairment reversal of mineral properties, plant and equipment (31.1) 31.1 - (31.1) 31.1 - Other expenses 0.1 (0.8) (0.7) 1.7 (2.6) (0.9) Operating Income 57.7 (30.3 ) 27.4 110.3 (28.5 ) 81.8 Interest income (0.5) (0.5) (2.0) (2.0) Interest expense 0.4 0.4 1.7 1.7 Accretion of provisions 0.2 0.2 0.7 0.7 Loss (gain) on financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value 0.7 0.6 1.3 5.0 (3.4) 1.6 Income before taxes 56.9 (30.9 ) 26.0 104.9 (25.1 ) 79.8 Current income tax expense 11.4 11.4 34.8 34.8 Deferred income tax expense 11.4 (9.1) 2.3 3.8 (7.4) (3.6) Net income for the year 34.1 (21.8 ) 12.3 66.3 (17.7 ) 48.6 EPS 0.21 (0.14) 0.07 0.42 (0.11) 0.31 The financial statements and MD&A are available on SEDAR and have also been posted on the company's website at https://www.fortunasilver.com/investors/financials/2017/ .\nConference call to review 2017 year-end financial and operational results\nA conference call to discuss 2017 year-end financial and operational results will be held on Tuesday, March 20, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific | 12:00 p.m. Eastern.
