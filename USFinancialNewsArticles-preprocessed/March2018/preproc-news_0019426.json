The impact on growth would be a formidable,” Lagarde said.\nOn Tuesday Trump appeared ready for a trade war.\n“When we’re behind on every single country, trade wars aren’t so bad,” he said at a news conference with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven who responded by saying: “I am convinced that increased tariffs hurt us all in the long run.”\nThe European Union has drawn up a list of U.S. products - from bourbon to Harley Davidson motorbikes - on which to apply tariffs if Trump goes ahead.\n“A trade war has no winners and if it does not happen, for the better, then we can work with our American friends and other allies on the core issue of this problem, overcapacity,” European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstrom said.\n“But if it does happen we will have to take measures to protect European jobs,” she added, after a meeting in Brussels to discuss the retaliation strategy.\nFor those who fear a trade war, the candidates to replace Cohn as Trump’s adviser do not bode well: Peter Navarro, the White House National Trade Council head who wrote a book called “Death by China: Confronting the Dragon — A Global Call to Action”, and conservative commentator Larry Kudlow.\nGerman Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said: “I hope Trump changes his mind ... It’s very important that there are advocates for this in the White House. That’s why I’m worried about the latest signals coming from the USA.”\nBritain, keen to foster global trade relations as it prepares to leave the EU, said it was “very disappointed” by Trump’s plan.\nEditing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ",
