(OTC:AITB), a clinical-stage medical device and biopharmaceutical company focused on developing inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) for the treatment of patients with respiratory conditions including serious lung infections and pulmonary hypertension, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Recent Corporate Highlights:\nExpects to submit a 510(k) application to the FDA for its NO Generator and Delivery System by year end 2018 and enter the existing >$500 million US NO market with a vastly superior offering Closed on a global, exclusive, perpetual, transferable license to the proprietary NO Generator from NitricGen Inc., including intellectual property, know-how, trade secrets and other related critical assets Announced results from the NO-NTM Pilot study in Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) targeting patients suffering from MABSC that showed no NO-related serious adverse events (SAEs) observed and positive data on relevant efficacy endpoints Expects to release top-line data in the second quarter of 2018 from the ongoing 94 patient, multi-center bronchiolitis (NO-BRO) study Appointed Ms. Yoori Lee to its Board of Directors, who brings strong operating experience from her years of working with biopharma and medical device companies Appointed Mark Rimkus as Vice President of Clinical Affairs and Dr. Abdi Ghaffari as Vice President of Research Completed a private placement with a select group of investors and insiders, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $9.8 million\n“With the recent financing, we are well funded to achieve our goal of entering the US hospital-based NO market in 2019. Our vastly superior product, the NO Generator and Delivery System, eliminates the need for high-pressure cylinders, yielding direct benefits to the hospital and allowing pricing flexibility for AIT and our future commercial partner. The next step prior to submitting the 510(k) is to repeat our commercial design and testing for use with ventilators. It is important to note that we have already essentially completed our commercial design for our system for use with a mask,” said Mr. Steven Lisi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Additionally, our system may revolutionize the treatment of certain respiratory conditions by making at-home treatment with nitric oxide a reality.”\n“We are looking forward to several events in the near term such as: unblinding our bronchiolitis study in the second quarter, participating in the American Thoracic Society meeting in May where we will present further data from our NO-NTM study, and meeting with FDA late in the second quarter to discuss a potential pivotal trial design for patients with severe, refractory lung infections such as NTM,” continued Mr. Lisi. “The AIT team is honored to have the opportunity to bring NO to patients, which we anticipate will be a safe therapy that will improve their quality of life and reduce their disease burden.”\n“During the quarter we announced that we successfully treated, under compassionate use, a CF patient with refractory MABSC at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) with our prototype NO Generator and Delivery System where improvements were seen in all relevant endpoints, but the bacteria were not eradicated,” stated Mr. Lisi. “This patient asked to be treated again and the treatment took place in February of this year with our commercial scale NO Generator and Delivery System. A total of 38 treatments were administered over 8 days, 29 of them at a concentration of 240 ppm, with no SAEs related to NO reported. The patient was unable to complete the intended 21 days of therapy, but the stoppage of treatment is not believed to be related to the NO therapy. The patient has requested again to receive further NO treatments with our NO Generator and Delivery System as soon as practicable.”\nNitric Oxide for NTM abscessus (NO-NTM abscessus ) Study Results\nThe single-arm, open-label pilot trial enrolled 9 patients with MABSC, who were refractory to standard-of-care and had underlying cystic fibrosis. Patients were treated with inhaled NO in addition to background antibiotic therapy at the physicians’ discretion. NO was delivered at a concentration of 160 ppm for 30 minutes intermittently for 21 days, after which no further NO treatments were provided.\nThe primary endpoint of safety was achieved, as there were no Nitric Oxide-related SAEs reported over the 21-day treatment period, which included more than 800 inhalations In the 6-minute walk test, there was a mean increase over baseline of 45 meters during the 21 days of treatment. At Day 51 and 81 (30 days and 60 days after the end of treatment), the mean increase in 6-minute walk was still greater than 27 meters above baseline For Forced Expiratory Volume 1 (FEV1), a measure of airway obstruction, patients improved over baseline at Day 21 and were maintained for 30 days after treatment ended (Day 51), but returned to baseline 60 days after treatment ceased (Day 81) Mycobacterium abscessus load, a secondary endpoint as measured by quantitative PCR, showed a mean reduction of 65% at Day 81 versus baseline with one patient experiencing eradication QoL questionnaire SF-36 was used in the trial and all relevant data collected to date have trended positive\nNitric Oxide for Bronchiolitis (NO-BRO) Study Design\nThe trial, expected to enroll 94 patients, is anticipated to complete enrollment in April 2018, with top-line data to be released shortly thereafter. Patients enrolled in the study receive NO 160 ppm for 30 minutes 5 times per day for up to 5 days. Patients must be 0-12 months of age with a gestation period of at least 28 weeks and a Tal score (four-part composite score) of ≥7 and ≤10. The primary endpoint is hospital length of stay.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company posted a net loss of $18.0 million, or ($3.01) per share, compared to a net loss of $3.7 million, or ($2.69) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expenses were $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in costs related to clinical trials, subcontractors and consultants, manufacturing, purchase of certain intellectual property and expenses related to the warrants.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in stock-based compensation expense, an increase in costs related to legal, accounting and issuance fees in connection with the merger, and an increase in payroll expenses due to the hiring of employees.\nFinancial expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7.0 million, compared to a financial expense of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and short-term deposits of $1.8 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company completed a private placement with a select group of investors, which generated gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $9.82 million, before deducting fees and offering expenses. This cash balance is sufficient to fund operations through the second quarter of 2019.\nConference Call & Webcast\nMonday, March 19th @ 4:30pm Eastern Time\nDomestic: 800-289-0438 International: 323-994-2083 Passcode: 1979356 Webcast: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=128779 Replays available through April 2: Domestic: 844-512-2921 International: 412-317-6671 Conference ID: 1979356 About Nitric Oxide (NO)\nNitric oxide (NO) is a powerful molecule proven to play a critical role in a broad array of biological functions. In the airways, NO is believed to play a key role in the innate immune system at concentrations of approximately 200 ppm. In vitro studies suggest that NO possesses anti-microbial activity not only against common bacteria, both gram-positive and gram-negative, but also against other diverse organisms including mycobacteria, fungi, yeast and parasites, and has the potential to eliminate their multi-drug resistant strains.\nAbout PPHN\nPersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a lethal condition and a secondary to failure of normal circulatory transition at birth. It is a syndrome characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that causes labile hypoxemia due to decreased pulmonary blood flow and right-to-left shunting of blood. Its incidence has been reported as 1.9 per 1000 live births (0.4–6.8/1000 live births) with mortality rate ranging between 4–33%. This syndrome complicates the course of about 10% of infants with respiratory failure and remains a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. NO gas is a vasodilator and is approved in dozens of countries to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMO) in term and near-term (>34 weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in conjunction with ventilator support and other appropriate agents.\nAbout Bronchiolitis\nThe majority of hospital admissions of infants with bronchiolitis are caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is a common and highly transmissible virus that infects the respiratory tract of most children before their second birthday. While most infants with RSV present with minor respiratory symptoms, a small percentage develop serious lower airway infections, termed bronchiolitis, which can become life-threatening. The absence of treatment options for bronchiolitis limits the care of these sick infants to largely supportive measures. AIT’s system is designed to effectively deliver 160 - 400 ppm NO, which has been demonstrated to eliminate bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes from the lungs.\nAbout NTM\nNontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection is a rare and serious condition causing debilitating pulmonary disease associated with increased morbidity and mortality. NTM is an emerging public health concern worldwide because of its multi-drug antibiotic resistance. Current treatment guidelines suggest a combination of multiple antibiotics delivered continually for as long as two years. These complex, expensive and invasive regimens have a poor record in the treatment of MABSC. AIT’s system is designed to effectively deliver 160 - 400 ppm NO, which has been demonstrated to eliminate bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes from the lungs and may work against antibiotic resistant bacteria.\nAbout AIT Therapeutics Inc.\nAIT Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage medical device and biopharmaceutical company using nitric oxide (NO) to treat respiratory and other diseases. The Company is currently applying its therapeutic expertise to treat lower respiratory tract infections that are not effectively addressed with current standards of care, as well as pulmonary hypertension, in various settings. AIT Therapeutics is currently advancing its revolutionary NO Generator and Delivery System in clinical trials for the treatment of bronchiolitis and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).
