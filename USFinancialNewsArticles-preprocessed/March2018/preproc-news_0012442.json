Total comparable-store sales, excluding impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, rose 5.4 percent in the second quarter, while analysts on average had estimated a 5.6 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company rose to $701 million, or $1.59 per share, in the quarter ended Feb. 18, from $515 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier. The company had a $74 million gain in the reported quarter, related to changes in the U.S. tax law. Total revenue rose to $33.00 billion from $29.77 billion.
