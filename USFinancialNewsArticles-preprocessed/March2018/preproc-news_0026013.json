U.S. dollar banknotes are seen through a printed stock graph in this illustration taken February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Even after U.S. President Donald Trump’s signing of steel and aluminium tariffs last week and the opposition from the European Union, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research note their outlook on global trade activity remains strong and they saw little risk of a trade war.
