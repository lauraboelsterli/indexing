    "text": "- Rare Disease Endocrinology Pipeline Advances, with Significant Milestones Anticipated Over the Next Twelve Months -\n- Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time -\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ascendis Pharma A/S (Nasdaq:ASND), a biopharmaceutical company that utilizes its innovative TransCon technology to address significant unmet medical needs in rare diseases, today announced financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“We are excited by the progress of our rare disease endocrinology pipeline and the potential to bring patients differentiated treatments for unmet medical needs. We anticipate data across all three of our clinical programs in the next twelve months, including full data from our ongoing phase 1 trial of TransCon PTH, top-line data from our planned TransCon CNP phase 1 trial, and top-line data from our phase 3 heiGHt Trial for TransCon Growth Hormone,” said Jan Mikkelsen, Ascendis Pharma’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “The value of our TransCon technology platform is increasing as we move into multiple clinical programs, and we continue to see the broad applicability of our technology.”\nRecent Corporate Highlights\nPresented two posters at ENDO 2018, the annual conference of the Endocrine Society, both of which were selected for inclusion in special moderated sessions:\nº A poster describing the baseline demographic characteristics of the phase 3 heiGHt Trial for TransCon Growth Hormone (GH), in development as a potential once-weekly therapy for pediatric growth hormone deficiency (GHD)\nº A poster on the phase 1 trial for TransCon PTH, in development as a treatment for hypoparathyroidism (HP). The trial is assessing single and multiple ascending doses in healthy adults. The poster summarized pharmacokinetic and pharmocodynamic findings to date, which reinforced the potential for TransCon PTH administered daily as a physiologic PTH replacement therapy\nCompleted enrollment of 161 subjects in the global, phase 3 heiGHt Trial of TransCon GH for pediatric GHD Initiated enrollment in the fliGHt Trial evaluating TransCon GH in approximately 150 subjects who have previously been treated with daily growth hormone Initiated the enliGHten Trial, the long term extension trial of TransCon GH, which is enrolling subjects from both the heiGHt Trial and fliGHt Trial Announced initiation of the regulatory process in Australia to enable its first-in-human phase 1 trial for TransCon CNP, in development for achondroplasia Subsequent to year-end 2017, the company announced the completion of its underwritten public offering of 4,539,473 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), each of which represented one ordinary share of Ascendis Pharma at a price to the public of $57.00 per ADS. Net proceeds from this offering in February 2018 were approximately $242.5 million, or approximately €196.8 million based on exchange rates on the date of the offering Ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of €195.4 million on a reported basis\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nFor the full year 2017, Ascendis Pharma reported a net loss of €123.9 million, or €3.68 per share (basic and diluted) compared to a net loss of €68.5 million, or €2.58 per share (basic and diluted) during the same period in 2016.\nResearch and development (R&D) costs for 2017 were €99.6 million compared to €66.0 million during 2016. Higher R&D costs in 2017 reflect an increase in manufacturing costs and clinical costs related to preparation for and execution of the company’s phase 3 clinical program for TransCon GH, including the heiGHt, fliGHt and enliGHten Trials, ongoing development of our proprietary auto-injector for use with TransCon GH, preparation for and execution of the company’s phase 1 clinical trial of TransCon PTH, as well as preclinical development of TransCon PTH and TransCon CNP.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the 2017 year were €13.5 million compared to €11.5 million during the 2016 year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in general and administrative personnel.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of €195.4 million compared to €180.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The company’s cash position was positively impacted by net proceeds of €123.1 million from an underwritten public offering in September 2017 and €1.6 million from warrant exercises. As of December 31, 2017, Ascendis Pharma had 36,984,292 ordinary shares outstanding. As of March 28, 2018, including the 2018 offering, Ascendis Pharma had 41,523,765 ordinary shares outstanding.\nConference Call and Webcast information\nAscendis Pharma will host a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss its full year 2017 financial results.
