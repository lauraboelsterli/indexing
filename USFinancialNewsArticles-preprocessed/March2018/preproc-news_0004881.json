    "text": "AMES, Iowa, NewLink Genetics Corporation (NASDAQ:NLNK) today reported consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended 2017, as well as progress in its clinical development programs. The Company also outlined key 2018 business priorities related to the clinical programs for indoximod, its IDO pathway inhibitor drug candidate.\n“NewLink Genetics has produced encouraging data supporting indoximod in several indications and looks forward to presenting additional data in 2018, further validating IDO pathway inhibition as a key target in immuno-oncology,” said Charles J. Link, Jr, MD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “In addition, Indigo301, our pivotal trial for patients with metastatic melanoma, and Indigo201, our randomized Phase 2 trial in collaboration with AstraZeneca for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, are our core clinical priorities for 2018.”\nAnticipated 2018 Highlights\nInitiate randomization portion of Indigo301, a pivotal Phase 3 trial for patients with advanced melanoma, in Q2-Q3 2018 Full Phase 2 results of indoximod plus checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic melanoma in 1H:2018 Initiate Indigo201, a randomized Phase 2 trial for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, in 1H:2018 Full Phase 2 results from the single-arm trial of indoximod plus gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel in metastatic pancreatic cancer in 1H:2018 Two abstract presentations at AACR Annual Meeting 2018 include data from a Phase 1 study of indoximod for pediatric patients with malignant brain tumors and data providing additional characterization of the differentiated mechanism of action of indoximod Continued evaluation of indoximod in additional oncology indications\n2017 Highlights\nPresented updated Phase 2 data of indoximod plus pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma at the Third Annual International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference with encouraging overall and complete response rates and progression-free survival Commenced dose determination portion of Indigo301 Entered into a collaboration with AstraZeneca on Indigo201 Presented Phase 2 data from a randomized, double-blind study of indoximod plus cancer vaccine for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer at ASCO Annual Meeting, indicating statistically significant improvement in median progression-free survival compared to monotherapy Presented Phase 1b data of indoximod plus chemotherapy in newly diagnosed AML suggesting the potential for indoximod in treatment regimens beyond PD-1 Successfully raised $74.3 million, net of offering costs, and ended 2017 with $158.7 million cash and equivalents\nUpdate on Current Clinical Timeline and Financial Guidance\nNewLink Genetics reported an update of its clinical timeline and now expects to initiate Indigo301 randomization in Q2 to Q3 2018 and complete enrollment in 2019. The Company expects to end this year with approximately $75 million in cash. The shift in the timeline arises from an increased number of trial sites planned for Indigo301 and additional work related to manufacturing.\nFinancial Results\nCash Position: NewLink Genetics ended the year on December 31, 2017, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $158.7 million compared to $131.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. The Company's cash position is sufficient to fund operations in the near and medium term.\nR&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $17.5 million and $69.9 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $19.5 million and $93.3 million during the comparable periods in 2016. The decrease year-over-year was due primarily to higher restructuring charges of $11.1 million incurred in 2016, including a non-cash charge of $4.0 million related to impaired assets, as compared to $600,000 of charges incurred in 2017. Remainder of the decrease was due to decreases of $6.2 million in clinical trial costs, $4.4 million in supplies, equipment and licensing, $3.6 million in personnel-related expense, and $200,000 in manufacturing expense. Decreases were offset by increases of $1.0 million in stock compensation expense and $600,000 in legal and consulting.\nG&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were $6.7 million and $31.7 million compared to $7.2 million and $33.2 million during the comparable periods in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.3 million reduction in personnel-related spend and $1.2 million reduction in legal and consulting, offset by increases of $700,000 in stock compensation expense, $700,000 in supplies and equipment, and $600,000 in restructuring charges incurred in 2017.\nNet Loss: NewLink Genetics reported a net loss of $13.7 million or $0.37 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net loss of $72.0 million or $2.30 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $13.5 million or $0.46 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016 and a net loss of $85.2 million or $2.94 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNewLink Genetics ended 2017 with 37,109,556 shares outstanding.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call and webcast for 4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss the results and to give an update on clinical and business development activities.
