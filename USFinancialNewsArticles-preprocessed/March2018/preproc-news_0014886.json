    "text": "Acquisition provides Alphatec most advanced automated neuromonitoring technology Private placement funded by senior leadership, new and existing investors Luiz Pimenta, MD, PhD, to assume role of Chief Medical Officer\nCARLSBAD, Calif., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alphatec Holdings, Inc. (“Alphatec” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:ATEC), a provider of innovative spine surgery solutions with a mission to improve patient lives through the relentless pursuit of superior outcomes, announced today that it has acquired SafeOp Surgical, Inc. (“SafeOp”). SafeOp is a privately-held provider of advanced neuromonitoring technology designed to prevent the intraoperative risk of nerve injury with automated assessment that obviates the need for a technician or other neuromonitoring professional in most surgeries. The Company also announced a $50 million capital raise, the proceeds of which were used, in part, to fund the acquisition.\nAdditionally, the Company announced several leadership updates. Pat Miles has assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer. Terry Rich has been appointed President and Chief Operating Officer. Both will retain their existing Board positions. Dr. Luiz Pimenta has been appointed Chief Medical Officer.\nSafeOp Acquisition\nSafeOp has developed patented technology that automates SSEP’s (Somatosensory Evoked Potentials), designed to provide surgeons with unprecedented, objective feedback during surgery.\n“This strategic acquisition of SafeOp marks a transformational moment for the new ATEC,” said Pat Miles. “Our answer to the need for better neuromonitoring is investing in technology that automates information to enable objective clinical decision making and eradicate non-critical operating room personnel. The integration of this key technology into our spine procedures will address unmet clinical needs and improve surgical outcomes in spine. We expect the combination to accelerate our business by increasing procedural revenue and driving pull-through across our entire portfolio.”\nIn consideration for SafeOp, Alphatec will pay $15 million in up-front cash, a $3 million convertible note, and the issuance of 3.3 million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 2.2 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.50 per share. SafeOp will be eligible to receive an additional 1.3 million shares of common stock, subject to the achievement of performance milestones. The issuance of the shares of common stock in the merger, including at closing, upon achievement of milestones, conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants is subject to limitations until required stockholder approval is obtained in accordance with the NASDAQ Global Select Market rules.\nLeadership and Board Appointments\nThe Company also announced the following leadership and board appointments.\nDr. Luiz Pimenta will advise Alphatec as Chief Medical Officer. Pimenta is a world-renowned spine surgeon with over 30 years of expertise, and is widely credited with pioneering innovative surgical techniques and developing new technologies to improve spine surgery. His broad contributions have been commercialized via numerous industry partners. Dr. Pimenta will enhance the ATEC strategy by focusing on spine innovation and medical education.\nMiles continued, “I am honored and thrilled to work again with Dr. Pimenta. His decision to assume a key role in our mission is pivotal. It speaks volumes of the surgical community’s perception of ATEC’s visceral dedication to improved outcomes through eXtreme innovation.”\nRichard O’Brien, M.D., and Robert Snow, the scientific principals of SafeOp, with over 50 years of combined neurophysiology expertise will join Alphatec as executives. Prior to serving as Vice President of Development and Chief Medical Officer of SafeOp, Dr. O’Brien, a renowned inventor and neurologist, was Medical Director of Impulse Monitoring, Inc., a neuromonitoring provider. Before joining Impulse Monitoring, O’Brien spent over two decades in the neurophysiology field, as both a physician and consultant. Mr. Snow, a neurophysiologist, was SafeOp’s Vice President, Marketing for 5 years, following an 11-year tenure as co-founder and Senior Vice President of Marketing at Impulse Monitoring.\n“I could not be more excited to join the ATEC family and to engage in the creation of automated tools that provide objective information for better clinical decision making,” said O’Brien.\nThe SafeOp development and integration effort will be led by Jim Gharib, an electrical engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the field of neurophysiology. Gharib was the technical lead of NuVasive’s neurophysiology platform from the company’s inception to its achievement of billion-dollar revenue levels. Gharib is a named inventor on more than 20 patents in the fields of neuromonitoring, spine surgery, IV infusion, and blood chemistry.\n“I am exceptionally pleased to work again with Rob, Richard, and Jim, the new leaders of our adjunctive technology team,” said Terry Rich, President and Chief Operating Officer of Alphatec. “They each have a proven history of successfully creating value in the neurophysiologic and spine marketplace. I look forward to working with each of these new leaders as we evolve into a leading spine market player.”\nThree new members have joined the Alphatec Board of Directors, in connection with the above transactions:\nJames Tullis, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tullis Health Investors, a healthcare investment firm, has over 40 years of experience in healthcare-focused investments. Prior to establishing his firm in 1986, Tullis served as an award-winning healthcare investment research analyst and Principal at Morgan Stanley, focusing on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\nJason Hochberg a partner with L-5 Healthcare Partners, and the Founder and CEO of SJS Beacon, an investment company, has over 20 years of business and legal experience. Prior to founding SJS Beacon, Hochberg held various leadership roles throughout a 15-year tenure at LS Power, an energy investment and innovation company, serving most recently as Chief Operating Officer and as a Principal in LS Power’s private equity fund advisor. He started his professional career at the law firm of Latham & Watkins in 1996.\nEvan Bakst, a partner with L-5 Healthcare Partners, and the Founder of and Portfolio Manager at Treetop Capital, a healthcare investment firm. He has over 25 years of experience in healthcare-focused investments. Prior to founding Treetop Capital, Bakst was a partner for 7 years at Tremblant Capital, an equity hedge-fund manager, where he led the global healthcare group and held various other leadership roles.\nEquity Financing Transactions\nThe Company announced that it has entered into financing transactions to raise an aggregate of $50 million, through a private placement of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants exercisable for common stock, and a warrant exchange agreement with a holder of an existing warrant for an aggregate consideration of $4.8 million. The private placement was led by L-5 Healthcare Partners, LLC, a healthcare-dedicated institutional investor, and included certain directors and executive officers of Alphatec, as well as other new and existing institutional and independent investors. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the private placement and warrant exercise to fund the $15 million cash purchase price for SafeOp, and expects to use the remainder for general corporate purposes.\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., is acting as placement agent in connection with the private placement and financing advisor in connection with the SafeOp acquisition.\nAdditional information and legal disclosures about the transaction are contained in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe securities to be sold in the private placement will not have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or state securities laws as of the time of issuance and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.
