    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, March 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vale S.A. (\"Vale\") announces the early tender results of the offer to purchase for cash (the \"Tender Offer\") outstanding 4.375% guaranteed notes due 2022 (CUSIP No. 91911TAM5 / ISIN No. US91911TAM53) (the \"2022 Notes\") up to the 2022 Maximum Amount (as defined below), issued by its wholly owned subsidiary Vale Overseas Limited (\"Vale Overseas\"), pursuant to the offer to purchase dated March 14, 2018 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the \"Offer to Purchase\").\nAs of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 27, 2018 (the \"Early Tender Date\"), the aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes validly tendered is as set forth in the table below. Vale Overseas will not extend the Early Tender Date.\nTitle of Security\nCUSIP / ISIN Nos .\nPrincipal Amount\nOutstanding Prior\nto Tender Offer\nPrincipal Amount\nValidly Tendered\nPrincipal Amount\nAccepted for Purchase\n4.375% Guaranteed\nNotes due 2022\nCUSIP: 91911TAM5\nISIN: US91911TAM53\nUS$2,250,000,000\nUS$1,144,879,000\nUS$780,951,000\nBecause the purchase of all the 2022 Notes validly tendered on or before the Early Tender Date would cause Vale Overseas to purchase an aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes in excess of US$780,951,000 (the \"2022 Maximum Amount\"), Vale Overseas has accepted for purchase the 2022 Notes validly tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date on a prorated basis such that the total principal amount of the 2022 Notes accepted for purchase is US$780,951,000. Based on these amounts, Vale Overseas has calculated that its proration factor is approximately 68.30%. The 2022 Maximum Amount is calculated as US$1,750,000,000 less US$969,049,000, which is the aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the 2021 Offer (as defined in the Offer to Purchase).\nAny tendered 2022 Notes that are not accepted for purchase will be returned or credited without expense to the holder's account. Holders who tender their 2022 Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any of their 2022 Notes accepted for purchase.\nThe early settlement date on which Vale Overseas will make payment for the 2022 Notes accepted in the Tender Offer is expected to be March 28, 2018 (the \"Early Settlement Date\"). Holders who have validly tendered, and not validly withdrawn, their 2022 Notes on or prior to the Early Tender Date and whose 2022 Notes have been accepted for purchase will be entitled to receive the total consideration of US$1,036.50 per US$1,000.00 principal amount of 2022 Notes tendered, which includes an early tender premium of US$30.00 per US$1,000.00 principal amount of 2022 Notes validly tendered, and to receive accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the last interest payment date to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date. The 2022 Notes that have been validly tendered and accepted for purchase can no longer be withdrawn, except as may be required by applicable law.\nVale Overseas has retained Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Mizuho Securities USA LLC and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. as dealer managers and D.F. King & Co., Inc. as tender and information agent for the Tender Offer.
