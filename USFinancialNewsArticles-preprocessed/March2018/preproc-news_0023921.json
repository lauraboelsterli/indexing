    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso’s leadership is needed now to ensure a thorough investigation into a suspected cronyism scandal involving a controversial land sale, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Monday.\nFILE PHOTO: Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (R) and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso attend a lower house budget committee session at the parliament in Tokyo, Japan, February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai “What is important now is to make everything clear,” Suga said at a news conference.\nHe did not directly respond to a question about media reports that the name of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s wife, Akie, had been removed from documents related to the sale, which the government admitted on Monday had been altered.\nThe finance ministry plans to submit all findings available at the moment on its investigation into the case to parliament on Monday afternoon, Suga said.\nReporting by Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim\n ",
