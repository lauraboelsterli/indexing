While still largely a non-starter in the U.S., universal basic income (UBI) -- or guaranteed money from the government -- has the backing of several tech-world luminaries, including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Richard Branson. They see work opportunities drying up as potentially tens of millions of jobs are replaced by automation .\nChris Hughes, cofounder of Facebook , is one of the tech titans devoting his time to advocate for UBI. “I think that something fundamentally in the economy has changed to create these winner take all markets, where a small number of hardworking people do very well and nine out of 10 of others who are also hardworking don’t enjoy the same opportunities,” he says.\nWatch a video about Canada’s experiment with universal basic income.

Oren Cass, a conservative anti-poverty scholar who writes for the National Review, says it could lead to people viewing work as optional. “We’re not going to build a system that is essentially equivalent to work, that essentially can just replace what it means to earn a paycheck.”\nIn the video above, Hughes and Cass weigh in on the pros and cons of a UBI in the U.S.",
