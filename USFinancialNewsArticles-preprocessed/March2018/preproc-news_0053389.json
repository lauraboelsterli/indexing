    "text": "(Adds share movement, background)\nMarch 29 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia said on Thursday it is undertaking a strategic review of its Indonesian life insurance business, PT Commonwealth Life, and that it has engaged external advisers for guidance on a possible sale of the venture.\nThe decision follows an earlier announcement of the proposed sale of the bank’s life insurance businesses in Australia and New Zealand to AIA Group, the company added in a statement.\nReuters had earlier reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that Australia’s biggest lender was considering selling its majority stake in an Indonesian insurance venture in a deal valued at up to $250 million.\nCommonwealth Bank is an 80 percent shareholder in PT Commonwealth Life.\nA possible stake sale, if completed, will be another instance of Asia Pacific banks exiting the insurance sector to free up capital and focus on their core businesses amid tougher regulatory capital buffer requirements.\nCBA shares were up 0.6 percent in early Sydney trade compared with a 0.2 percent decline in the broader benchmark index.\nReporting by Shashwat Pradhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ",
