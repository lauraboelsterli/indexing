    "text": "NEW YORK and LONDON, Akari Therapeutics, Plc (NASDAQ:AKTX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics to treat orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, today announced that the Company will report its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 on Wednesday, March 21, 2018 before the U.S. financial markets open. Following the release of the financial results, Akari Therapeutics management will conduct a conference call and webcast that morning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).\nThe call can be accessed by dialing (844) 461-9933 or (636) 812-6633 (international), and referencing conference ID 2096211. The conference call will also be webcast live over the Internet and can be accessed on the \"Events & Presentations\" page under the \"Investors & Media\" section of the Akari Therapeutics website, www.akaritx.com , prior to the event. A replay of the webcast will be available for at least 30 days following the call at www.akaritx.com .\nAbout Akari Therapeutics\nAkari is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing inhibitors of acute and chronic inflammation, specifically the complement system, the eicosanoid system and the bioamine system for the treatment of rare and orphan diseases, in particular those where the complement system or leukotrienes or both complement and leukotrienes together play a primary role in disease progression. Akari's lead drug candidate Coversin is a C5 complement inhibitor currently being evaluated in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). In addition to its C5 inhibitory activity, Coversin independently and specifically inhibits leukotriene B4 (LTB4) activity. Akari intends to evaluate Coversin in two conditions, the skin and eye diseases bullous pemphigoid and atopic keratoconjunctivitis, where the dual action of Coversin on both C5 and LTB4 may be beneficial. Akari is also developing other tick derived proteins, including long acting versions.\nFor more information\nInvestor Contact:\nPeter Vozzo\nWestwicke Partners\n(443) 213-0505\npeter.vozzo@westwicke.com\nMedia Contact:\nMary-Jane Elliott / Sukaina Virji / Nicholas Brown\nConsilium Strategic Communications\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nAkari@consilium-comms.com\nSource:Akari Therapeutics Plc",
