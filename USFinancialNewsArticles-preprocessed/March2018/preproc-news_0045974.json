(Photo: Business Wire)\n“Paul Jin joins Goodwin as we continue to see strong client demand for our antitrust capabilities, driven by robust M&A market activity coupled with heightened levels of government scrutiny and enforcement,” said Andrea Murino , Co-Chair of Goodwin’s Antitrust + Competition practice and Chair of the Washington, D.C. office. “Paul brings to Goodwin a nuanced understanding of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and extensive experience in managing clearance investigations. We look forward to collaborating with Paul on managing our clients’ transactional antitrust and counseling needs, and we welcome him to the Goodwin partnership.”\nOver the past year, Goodwin has advanced significantly in the global league tables . Mergermarket’s year-end Global & Regional M&A Report places the firm among the top legal advisors across all geographies and sectors, including in the top two for Global and U.S. private equity exits, and U.S. private equity buyouts + exits, and among the top five for U.S. M&A deals.\nJin focuses on a broad spectrum of antitrust matters, including negotiating terms of agreements, determining the applicability of merger clearance filing requirements in both U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and advocating on behalf of clients before the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice in connection with informal inquiries, Second Requests, third-party subpoenas, and conduct investigations. He also provides antitrust counseling on issues such as diligence and pre-closing conduct procedures, internal compliance programs, hiring and non-compete agreements, pricing and supply arrangements, and competitor collaboration guidelines.\nJin received his J.D. from Northwestern University School of Law and his B.A. from Duke University. He is admitted to practice in the District of Columbia and Virginia.\nJin can be reached at PJin@goodwinlaw.com and 202.346.4013.\nGoodwin’s Antitrust and Competition lawyers have advised clients – from the largest Fortune 500 companies to emerging growth companies – on more than 2,500 transactions before U.S. and international antitrust agencies.
