FILE PHOTO: Swiss drugmaker Novartis' logo is seen at the company's plant in the northern Swiss town of Stein, Switzerland October 23, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo Wyss, who was also head of Novartis in Switzerland, had been at the company since 1984. Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan said in a statement that Wyss would be available to ensure a “proper handover”.
