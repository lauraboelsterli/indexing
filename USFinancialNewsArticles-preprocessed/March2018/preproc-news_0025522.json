    "text": "March 13, 2018 / 7:27 AM / in 23 minutes China stocks snap 3-day winning streak amid biggest govt shake-up in years Reuters Staff * Shanghai stocks lower, blue-chip CSI300 index down * China’s A-shares at 24.92 pct premium over H-shares SHANGHAI, March 13 (Reuters) - China stocks broke a three-day winning streak and ended lower on Tuesday, weighed down by healthcare and consumer stocks, as investors pondered over the impact of a government reshuffle. ** At the close, the Shanghai Composite index was down 0.5 percent at 3,310.24, while the blue-chip CSI300 index was down 0.9 percent at 4,091.25. ** China is merging its banking and insurance regulators and giving new powers to policymaking bodies such as the central bank in the biggest government shake-up in years. ** The revamp is a cornerstone of President Xi Jinping’s agenda to put the leadership of the ruling Communist Party squarely at the heart of policy with Xi himself at the core of the party. ** The merger of two key financial regulators in itself should not be very significant, but it is a precursor for the establishment of a more powerful Financial Stability and Development Commission (FSDC) housed within the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), Jonas Short, analyst with Everbright Sun Hung Kai, wrote in note. ** Financial sector was down 0.8 percent on Tuesday, with banking sector basically flat, while most insurers led the decline. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Dr.Peng Telecom & Media Group Co Ltd, up 10.02 percent, followed by Yangzhou Yaxing Motor Coach Co Ltd , up 10.02 percent, and Guizhou Guihang Automotive Components Co Ltd, up 9.98 percent. ** The largest percentage losses in the Shanghai index were Shanghai Fukong Interactive Entertainment Co Ltd, down 10.01 percent, Changshu Fengfan Power Equipment Co Ltd , down 9.95 percent and Pci-Suntek Technology Co Ltd , down 9.75 percent. ** Around 17.71 billion shares were traded on the Shanghai exchange, roughly 91.3 percent of the market’s 30-day moving average of 19.40 billion shares a day. The volume in the previous trading session was 20.65 billion. ** As of 07:06 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 24.87 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day moving average and above its 200-day moving average. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 15.1 as of the last full trading day while the dividend yield was 1.9 percent. ** So far this week, the market capitalisation of the Shanghai stock index has risen by 0.51 percent to 29.66 trillion yuan.
