    "text": "DENVER, March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --­ Gates Industrial Corporation plc (NYSE:GTES), a leading global provider of application-specific fluid power and power transmission solutions, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2017.\nIvo Jurek, Gates Industrial's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are pleased to report our full-year 2017 results, our first as a public company. We delivered a solid year of performance with greater than 60% of net sales generated from high-margin replacement channels along with another year of double-digit growth in emerging markets. Core revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions completed in the last 12 months, was approximately 9% for the quarter and full year, reflecting strong global industrial end market demand along with our product development and commercial capabilities. Our results demonstrate the ability to grow revenue and expand margin while continuing to invest in the business. This led to gross margin in excess of 40% and Adjusted EBITDA Margin expansion of 50 basis points to 22.2% in 2017, excluding the impact of acquisitions. Since beginning our transformation in 2015, we have generated sustainable productivity gains as our manufacturing, procurement and pricing actions have offset inflation and expanded our gross margin, while also improving safety and quality.\"\nMr. Jurek continued, \"We are very focused on delivering profitable growth over the long-term. In 2018, we expect improved demand in many global industrial end markets fueled by urbanization, acceleration of industrial automation, infrastructure investments and the increasing importance of energy efficiency. Amid this backdrop, we are confident in our targeted 2018 outlook for mid-single-digit core revenue growth helping to drive double-digit gains in Adjusted EBITDA. We look forward to executing our plan, generating additional cash flow and driving further reduction of our leverage. Long-term, we are committed to delivering on our growth plans and focused on creating shareholder value.\"\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results\nFourth-quarter net revenues of $781.8 million grew 17.1% over the prior-year quarter, including 9.1% core growth, primarily reflecting an improved demand environment in many of the industrial end markets served and progress on growth initiatives, 4.8% growth from acquisitions and 3.2% growth from foreign currency translation. Net revenues for the full year increased $294.7 million, or 10.7%, to over $3.0 billion, compared to $2.7 billion in the prior year. Industrial end markets grew across all regions for the fourth quarter and full year.\nNet income in the fourth quarter was $118.8 million, compared to the prior-year quarter net income of $9.9 million. Full-year net income increased $93.6 million to $151.3 million, compared to $57.7 million in the prior year. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 net income included a net tax benefit of $118.2 million associated with U.S. tax reform, primarily driven by the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a repatriation tax charge. Adjusted Net Income in the fourth quarter was $56.0 million, compared to prior-year quarter Adjusted Net Income of $48.6 million. Full-year 2017 Adjusted Net Income increased to $209.5 million, compared to $185.0 million in the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $173.0 million, or 22.1% of sales, up 17% compared to $147.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased $74.2 million, or 12.5%, to $669.1 million, compared to $594.9 million in 2016. Excluding acquisitions, Adjusted EBITDA Margin expanded by approximately 50 basis points to 22.6% in the fourth quarter and approximately 50 basis points to 22.2% in the full year.\nPower Transmission Segment Results\n(USD in millions)\nQ4 2017\n% Change\n% Core\nChange\nFY 2017\n% Change\n% Core\nChange\nSales\n$513.1\n+12.8%\n+9.1%\n$2,009.4\n+7.9%\n+7.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n115.5\n+21.6%\n–\n458.1\n+12.1%\n–\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n22.5%\n+163 bps\n–\n22.8%\n+86 bps\n–\nPower Transmission sales increased for the fourth quarter and full year, reflecting strong core revenue growth driven by increased demand in industrial end markets and execution of initiatives. The segment delivered solid performance across all end markets, with particular strength in the Construction, Agriculture and General Industrial end markets.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew double-digits, resulting in Adjusted EBITDA Margin expansion throughout the year, attributable to strong volume along with manufacturing efficiencies and pricing initiatives.\nFluid Power Segment Results\n(USD in millions)\nQ4 2017\n% Change\n% Core\nChange\nFY 2017\n% Change\n% Core\nChange\nSales\n$268.7\n+26.3%\n+9.1%\n$1,032.3\n+16.7%\n+12.6%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n57.5\n+8.7%\n–\n211.0\n+13.2%\n–\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n21.4%\n(346) bps\n–\n20.4%\n(63) bps\n–\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin, excluding acquisitions\n22.9%\n(192) bps\n–\n21.0%\n(9) bps\n–\nFluid Power recorded solid core sales growth during 2017 driven by strong industrial end market demand, emerging markets and execution of growth initiatives. Core revenue growth included double-digit expansion in the Construction, Oil & Gas and General Industrial end markets. Acquisitions, including the addition of Atlas in the fourth quarter of 2017, provided additional sales growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margins were unfavorably impacted by the acquisitions completed in 2017, which decreased segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin by 154 basis points in the fourth quarter and 54 basis points for the full year 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring full-year 2017, the Company generated $313.5 million of cash flow from operating activities and invested $111.1 million in capital expenditures, a large portion of which represented investment in new manufacturing plants in its fluid power segment, resulting in Free Cash Flow of $202.4 million. Free Cash Flow declined compared to the prior year largely as a result of significant investments in new plants, a build-up of inventory to support expanding customer demand and a one-time tax refund in 2016.\nAt December 30, 2017, the Company had total cash of $564.4 million and total outstanding debt of $3.956 billion. In January 2018, the Company completed its initial public offering, raising net proceeds of $799.2 million. The net proceeds were used, along with cash on hand, to repay approximately $907.8 million of outstanding debt, plus applicable premiums and unpaid interest, resulting in significantly improved leverage metrics. Upon completion of the offering the Company had 289,749,605 basic shares outstanding and 294,765,828 diluted shares.\n2018 Outlook\nBased on continued strength in core industrial end markets, the significant potential to further penetrate highly fragmented core markets, and our broad emerging market exposure, the Company expects full-year 2018 net revenue growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 10.5%, with core revenue growth in the range of 5.0% to 6.0%. The Company anticipates higher net revenues, combined with manufacturing, procurement and pricing initiatives, to deliver Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $735 million to $755 million, representing double-digit year-over-year growth and continued margin expansion.\nConference Call and Webcast\nGates Industrial Corporation plc will host a conference call today at 5:00 pm ET to discuss the Company's financial results.

financial measures, which management believes are useful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as its key profitability measure. This is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA before certain items that impact comparison of the performance of our business either period-over-period or with other businesses. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our measure of segment profitability to assess the performance of our businesses and it is used for total Gates as well because we believe it is important to consider our profitability on a basis that is consistent with that of our operating segments. Management uses Adjusted Net Income as an additional measure of profitability. Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss) attributable to shareholders before certain items that impact comparison of the performance of our business, either period-over-period or with other businesses. Management uses Free Cash Flow to measure cash generation and liquidity. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that represents cash provided by operations less capital expenditures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as supplemental to, and not as superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis are not accessible, and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort, we have not provided reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP measures.\nGATES INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION PLC\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA\n(UNAUDITED)\nFor the\nThree Months Ended\nFor the\nYear Ended\n(USD in millions)\nDecember\n30, 2017\nDecember\n31, 2016\nDecember\n30, 2017\nDecember\n31, 2016\nNet income\n$ 130.2\n$ 15.3\n$ 182.7\n$ 84.3\nGain on disposal of discontinued operations\n(0.6)\n(8.6)\n(0.7)\n(12.4)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(105.4)\n6.0\n(72.5)\n21.1\nNet finance costs\n65.8\n48.8\n290.9\n205.9\nDepreciation and amortization\n54.0\n52.2\n212.2\n240.8\nTransaction-related costs (1)\n6.8\n0.4\n18.1\n0.4\nRestructuring expenses (2)\n9.1\n3.4\n17.4\n11.4\nSponsor fees (3)\n2.2\n1.6\n6.7\n6.1\nShare-based compensation\n2.5\n0.9\n5.4\n4.2\nAdjustments relating to post-retirement benefits (4)\n1.9\n1.6\n2.5\n6.4\nInventory impairments and adjustments (incl. in cost of sales) (5)\n2.0\n21.3\n2.0\n20.7\nOther impairments\n2.8\n1.8\n2.8\n3.2\nOther adjustments\n1.7\n3.2\n1.6\n2.8\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 173.0\n$ 147.9\n$ 669.1\n$ 594.9\n(1)\nTransaction-related costs relate primarily to advisory costs recognized in respect of the initial public offering, the acquisition of businesses and costs related to other corporate transactions such as debt refinancings.\n(2)\nRestructuring expenses represent costs incurred in relation to specifically defined restructuring projects and include costs related to decisions to close lines of business, plant closures and relocations, strategic organizational rationalizations and related non-recurring employee severance.\n(3)\nSponsor fees relate to fees paid to our private equity sponsor for monitoring, advisory and consulting services.

These changes, totaling $17.7 million were made to bring consistency to our global inventory management.\n(6)\nNon-cash financing-related FX losses (gains) relate primarily to FX on the unhedged portion of Gates' Euro-denominated debt.\n(7)\nThis normalization adjustment removes year-over-year variances arising in the Q4 effective tax rate due to differences in the methodologies required under GAAP to determine the income tax charge on an interim basis compared with the year end.\nGATES INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION PLC\nRECONCILIATION OF FREE CASH FLOW AND FREE CASH FLOW CONVERSION\n(UNAUDITED)\nFor the\nThree Months Ended\nFor the\nYear Ended\n(USD in millions)\nDecember\n30, 2017\nDecember\n31, 2016\nDecember\n30, 2017\nDecember\n31, 2016\nCash Provided by Operations\n$ 170.9\n$ 171.2\n$ 313.5\n$ 371.6\nCapex\n46.4\n25.1\n111.1\n68.1\nFree Cash Flow\n$ 124.5\n$ 146.1\n$ 202.4\n$ 303.5\nFor the\nThree Months Ended\nFor the\nYear Ended\n(USD in millions)\nDecember\n30, 2017\nDecember\n31, 2016\nDecember\n30, 2017\nDecember\n31, 2016\nAdjusted Net Income\n$ 56.0\n$ 48.6\n$ 209.5\n$ 185.0\nFree Cash Flow\n124.5\n146.1\n202.4\n303.5\nFree Cash Flow Conversion\n222.3%\n300.6%\n96.6%\n164.1%\nSource: Gates Industrial Corporation plc\nContact\nBill Waelke\n(303) 744-4887\ninvestorrelations@gates.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gates-industrial-reports-strong-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300613643.html\nSOURCE Gates Industrial Corporation plc",
