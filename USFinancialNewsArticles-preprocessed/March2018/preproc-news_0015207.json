    "text": "The U.S. isn’t the only country that has a chip on its shoulder about trade. When it comes to China, so do countless others.\nFor President Donald Trump, this could be an opportunity to lead a coalition against China’s predatory trade behavior. Instead, he is threatening trade war with the countries that would make up such a coalition, over commodities that are much less vital to the U.S.’s economy and national security than the sectors threatened by China’s expropriation of intellectual property.\n ",
