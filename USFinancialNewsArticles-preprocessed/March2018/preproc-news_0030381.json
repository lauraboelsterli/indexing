    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 5:41 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Marx shines as Lions survive Sunwolves scare Reuters Staff 3 Min Read JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Powerful hooker Malcolm Marx scored two tries as the Lions survived an almighty scare to secure a narrow 40-38 victory over a lively Sunwolves in their Super Rugby clash at Ellis Park on Saturday. The Japanese side led the game at the hour mark but after the Lions regained the lead, they just about held off a late charge from the Japanese side. Fullback Andries Coetzee, lock Marvin Orie, and wings Aphiwe Dyantyi and Rohan Janse van Rensburg, got the other tries for the home side. Fullback Kotaro Matsushima, prop Craig Millar, wing Hosea Saumaki, lock Kazuki Himeno and hooker Atsushi Sakate scored the five tries for the visitors, who will be buoyed by their performance but disappointed they could not manufacture what would have been a first ever away victory in Super Rugby. “Credit to the Sunwolves. There were small things that did not go our way, small things we need to improve on,” Lions captain Franco Mostert said at the post-match presentation. Coetzee crossed early in first half to give the Lions the lead, before Orie added a second on the 20-minute mark to give the hosts a comfortable 11-point advantage. But the Sunwolves were seeing plenty of the ball and hit back when Matsushima dived over from close range. Marx then burst straight through a ruck on the Sunwolves line to add a third score for the home side, but the visitors continued to apply pressure and Miller crossed after they effected a turnover following scrumhalf Yutaka Nagare’s kick as the Lions led 19-17 at the break. The home side extended that lead seconds after halftime as Dyantyi charged down Harumichi Tatekawa’s kick to cross for a try. Wing Saumaki then closed the gap as he beat three weak defensive tackles to score, and the Sunwolves took the lead on 59 minutes when Himeno grabbed an intercept to race clear. The powerful Lions pack had been trying to get their driving maul going all game without success, but that pressure told as Marx scored a second try to level the scores. After another driving maul proved successful, Janse van Rensburg ghosted through two challenges to dot down and extend the Lions advantage to nine points after the conversion. But in the final minute replacement hooker Sakate scored under the posts as the Sunwolves went end-to-end, but ran out of time to get the win. “We put the Lions under the pump. We just weren’t good enough,” Sunwolves captain Nagare said. “I’m very proud of the side to play well against the Lions at their home ground, but we wanted to win, so it is a disappointing result.” Reporting By Nick Said,; Editing by Neville Dalton",
