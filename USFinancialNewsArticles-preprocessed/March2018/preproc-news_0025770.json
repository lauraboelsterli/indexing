(NASDAQ:TGLS) (“Tecnoglass” or the “Company”) , a leading manufacturer of architectural glass, windows, and associated aluminum products for the global commercial and residential construction industries, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nJosé Manuel Daes, Chief Executive Officer of Tecnoglass, commented, \"We closed 2017 with our 12 th straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, representing continued expansion and market share gains in the U.S., despite approximately $3 million of invoicing pushed into 2018 due to Hurricane Irma. While Colombia’s revenues remained pressured year-over-year as a result of previously discussed macroeconomic factors, we are beginning to turn the corner with fourth quarter revenue up 36.8% in that market compared to the third quarter 2017 and a solid pace of activity to start the new year. Into 2018, we are encouraged by a record backlog of $499 million, including a range of diverse projects that position us to further expand in the U.S. and capitalize on significant pent-up demand in Colombia. Additionally, activity in other Latin American markets is improving, where we are exceptionally situated to Quote: and bid on additional projects. In single family residential, we delivered on our $10 million sales target in 2017, which we anticipate to ramp to a range of $20 to $25 million in 2018, given strong interest in our new products. Overall, we are pleased with the strength of our industry-leading margin business and look forward in 2018 to grow revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, while generating additional cash flow.”\nChristian Daes, Chief Operating Officer of Tecnoglass, added, “Our quoting and bidding activity strengthened each quarter on a sequential basis through 2017, which placed us on more firm footing at year end. During 2017, we also took a number of steps to enhance our competitive advantages and improve our ability to generate attractive returns on higher expected revenues. We implemented lean initiatives, eliminated waste and reduced fixed costs, which have already resulted in stronger operational performance in the second half 2017 compared to the first half 2017. We also completed two phases of our solar energy conversion which are now driving incremental energy savings. In residential, we introduced new high-end products which will allow us to further diversify our revenue stream going forward. We are committed to positioning our company for future success and excited to drive improved performance across our business in 2018.”\n1 ﻿Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of warrants and earn-out shares and further excludes foreign exchange gains and losses related to the effect on foreign exchange rates on monetary balance sheet accounts, and other non recurring items as reconciled in the table below.\nAdjusted net income is estimated as net income (loss) attributable to parent (+) income gain/losses on change in fair value of warrants and earnouts, Fx exchange gain/losses, non-core items and tax impact of adjustments at statutory rate, as reconciled in the table below.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter 2017 increased 5.0% to $84.3 million compared to $80.3 million in the prior year quarter. U.S. revenues grew 24.6% to $63.8 million compared to $51.2 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of GM&P and stronger organic shipments. The company estimates the impact of Hurricane Irma was unfavorable to revenues by approximately $3.0 million in the fourth quarter 2017. Colombia´s revenue, a majority of which is represented by long-term contracts priced in Colombian Pesos (COP), was $18.2 million compared to $25.4 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a continuation of delayed activity mainly related to macro factors in connection with the structural tax reform put into effect at the beginning of 2017 and a slowdown in commercial construction following several quarters of elevated interest rates and inflation starting in late 2016. Colombian interest rates and inflation have since normalized, and as of February 2018 were down approximately 320 and 520 basis points respectively, since their most recent peaks during the second half of 2016. This correction has led the way to a resurgence in quoting activity and a sequential increase in Colombia’s fourth quarter 2017 revenue of 36.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017, with good momentum continuing into the first quarter 2018. The foreign currency impact to total and reported Colombia revenues was negligible compared to the prior year quarter and prior quarter.\nGross profit was $27.2 million, representing a 32.3% gross margin, compared to $28.7 million, representing a 35.7% gross margin, in the prior year quarter. The primary differences in gross margin were associated with a higher mix of revenue from GM&P’s engineering and installation project activity, which are two lines of business that carry lower industry margins, incremental depreciation and amortization resulting from the Company's completed 2016 growth capex program and to a lesser extent, a temporary increase in installation costs on two large projects in the Latin American region. Operating expenses were $16.5 million compared to $19.6 million in the prior year quarter. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses were 19.6% compared to 24.4% in the prior year quarter, attributable mainly to a reduction in one-time expenses. Excluding one-time items, operating expenses would have been flat at 18.7% as a percentage of total revenues compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income was $10.7 million compared to $9.1 million in the prior year quarter.\nNet income was $1.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income 1 , as reconciled in the table below, was $2.9 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $5.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net (loss) income 1 excludes the impact of warrants and earn out shares liabilities, non-cash foreign exchange gains or losses, other non-core items and the tax impact of adjustments at statutory rates, to better reflect core financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 , as reconciled in the table below, was $17.2 million, compared to $19.3 million in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to lower gross profit as discussed above.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nTotal revenues for the full year 2017 increased 3.1% to $314.5 million compared to $305.0 million in the prior year. Total revenues increased 2.4% on a constant currency basis, excluding a $2.1 million impact from favorable foreign currency translation in Peso denominated sales in the full year 2017.\nOperating income was $34.4 million compared to $47.8 million in the prior year. Net income was $5.8 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to net income of $23.2 million, or $0.72 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted net income 1 was $11.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $23.4 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $62.0 million compared to $72.0 million in the prior year.\nFor the full year 2017, the Company generated higher cash flow from operations of $14.2 million, up $17.3 million compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of improved working capital management. During 2017, the Company incurred $7.0 million of cash capital expenditures, compared to $22.9 million in the prior year, with the reduction attributable to the conclusion of the Company’s plant expansion phase in 2016.\nRemoval of Material Weakness Reporting Condition\nDuring 2017, the Company continued to strengthen its financial and operational systems. As part of its SOX Section 404 processes, the company has confirmed the remediation of its sole remaining material weakness, which related to entity level controls. Furthermore, the Company concluded the design, implementation and testing of SOX controls and obtained a favorable attestation on full SOX compliance by its external auditors.\nDividend\nThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth quarter 2017, which was paid on January 26, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 29, 2017, in the form of cash or ordinary shares, based on the option of shareholders. Approximately 85% of dividends were paid in ordinary shares.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects to see growth in commercial construction markets and additional market share gains in the U.S., Colombian and other Latin American markets. In 2018, the Company anticipates revenues to grow to a range of $345.0 to $365.0 million, with higher year-over-year growth in the first half 2018 based on anticipated timing of invoicing in 2018 compared to 2017. The Company expects Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 to be in the range of $71.0 million to $81.0 million, rising approximately 22% year over year at the mid-point of the range, mainly as a result of higher revenues and greater operational efficiencies.\nBased on preliminary results during the first two months of 2018, the Company expects both revenues and adjusted EBITDA to grow within a range of 28% to 32% year-over-year in the first quarter 2018.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on Wednesday, March 14, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. eastern time (9:00 a.m. Bogota, Colombia time) to review the Company’s results.

However, these non‑GAAP performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nThree months ended Twelve months ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Total Revenues with Foreign Currency Held Neutral $ 84,110 $ 80,275 4.8 % $ 312,381 $ 305,016 2.4 % Impact of changes in foreign currency 169 - 0.2 % 2,075 - 0.7 % Total Revenues, As Reported $ 84,279 $ 80,275 5.0 % $ 314,456 $ 305,016 3.1 % Currency impacts on total revenues for the current quarter have been derived by translating current quarter revenues at the prevailing average foreign currency rates during the prior year quarter, as applicable.

Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net (loss) income, in addition to operating profit, net (loss) income and other GAAP measures, is useful to investors to evaluate the Company’s results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the Company’s core operating performance. Investors should recognize that Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net (loss) income might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release are included in the tables attached to this press release, to the extent available without unreasonable effort. Because GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis are not accessible, and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort, we have not provided reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP measures.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net (loss) income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC Regulation G follows, with amounts in thousands:\nThree months ended Twelve months ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income (loss) 1,169 2,928 5,725 23,180 Less: net income attributable to non-controlling interest (103 ) - (276 ) - Net Income (loss) attributable to parent 1,066 2,928 5,449 23,180 Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs 4,982 4,677 19,872 16,814 Income tax (benefit) provision 2,997 2,579 5,793 16,072 Depreciation & amortization 5,277 4,368 20,969 15,522 Foreign currency transactions losses (gains) 2,134 1,555 3,028 1,387 Non Recurring expenses (extinguishment of debt, bond issuance costs, provision for bad debt and other) 668 4,509 6,544 4,509 Director Stock compensation and provision for obsolete inventory 71 - 364 - Gain on change in fair value of earnout shares liabilities - (270 ) - (4,674 ) Gain on change in fair value of warrant liability - (1,063 ) - (776 ) Adjusted EBITDA 17,195 19,283 62,019 72,034\nThree months ended Twelve months ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income (loss) 1,169 2,928 5,725 23,180 Less: net income attributable to non-controlling interest (103 ) - (276 ) - Net Income (loss) attributable to parent 1,066 2,928 5,449 23,180 Foreign currency transactions losses (gains) 2,134 1,555 3,028 1,387 Gain on change in fair value of earnout shares liabilities - (270 ) - (4,674 ) Gain on change in fair value of warrant liability - (1,063 ) - (776 ) Amortization of deferred financing costs 338 - 338 - Non Recurring expenses (extinguishment of debt, bond issuance costs, provision for bad debt and other) 668 4,509 6,544 4,509 Tax impact of adjustments at statutory rate (1,256 ) (1,892 ) (3,964 ) (178 ) Adjusted net (loss) income 2,950 5,766 11,395 23,447 Basic income (loss) per share 0.03 0.09 0.16 0.75 Diluted income (loss) per share 0.03 0.09 0.16 0.72 Diluted Adjusted net (loss) income per share 0.08 0.17 0.32 0.72 Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding in thousands 35,334 34,227 35,321 32,372 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding in thousands 34,835 32,706 34,822 30,851 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding in thousands 35,334 34,227 35,321 32,372\nSource:Tecnoglass Inc.",
