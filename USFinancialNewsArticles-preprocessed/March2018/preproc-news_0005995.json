    "text": "Fourth Quarter Revenue Increased 11 Percent Driven by Strength in Smart Solutions\nLIBERTY LAKE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Itron, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITRI) announced today financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2017. Highlights for the quarter and full year include:\nQuarterly and full year revenue of $551 million and $2.0 billion; Quarterly and full year gross margin of 31.7 percent and 33.5 percent; Quarterly and full year GAAP net income of $2 million and $57 million, which include a charge of $30 million associated with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"); Quarterly and full year GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.05 and $1.45, which include the impact of $0.77 per share associated with the Tax Act; and Quarterly and full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.01 and $3.06, which exclude the charge associated with the Tax Act. The acquisition of Silver Spring Networks closed on Jan. 5, 2018 and will operate and report as a new Itron Networks segment.\n“Our fourth quarter results reflect strong execution of our strategy as we delivered year-over-year growth in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share,\" said Philip Mezey, Itron president and chief executive officer. \"The progress we made in the quarter and throughout 2017 provides a solid foundation for 2018 as we optimize our operations and integrate Silver Spring Networks. The integration is progressing as planned with active collaboration across our team, a powerful sense of our shared mission and values and positive support from customers and partners.\"\nSummary of Fourth Quarter Consolidated Financial Results\n(All comparisons made are against the prior year period unless otherwise noted)\nRevenue\nTotal revenue of $551 million increased 11 percent, or 8 percent excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by strong smart solution business and managed services.\nBy segment, Electricity revenue increased 20 percent driven by higher smart solution deliveries primarily in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions. Gas and Water revenue increased 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, primarily due to a favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nGross Margin\nConsolidated gross margin of 31.7 percent increased 10 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by higher volume and mix of smart solutions primarily in the Electricity segment, offsetting lower gross margins in the Gas and Water segments.\nOperating Income, Net Income and Earnings per Share (EPS)\nGAAP operating income increased to $47 million compared with $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP operating income increased to $55 million compared with $45 million in 2016. GAAP and non-GAAP operating income improved due to increased revenue at a higher gross margin, offsetting modest increases in operating expenses to support new solutions.\nGAAP net income attributable to Itron for the quarter was $2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net income of $12 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in 2016. The lower GAAP net income and EPS were due to a charge of $30 million, or $0.77 per share, to recognize estimated impacts on the company's deferred tax assets due to the enactment of the Tax Act.\nNon-GAAP net income of $40 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, increased compared with $26 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, in 2016. The increase reflects higher non-GAAP operating income and lower tax expense related to tax audit settlements, adjustments to valuation allowances and the timing and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction. Non-GAAP amounts exclude the charge related to the Tax Act.\nCash Flow\nIn the fourth quarter, cash provided by operating activities of $77 million and free cash flow of $61 million increased $43 million and $40 million, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Full-year 2017 cash provided by operating activities of $191 million and free cash flow of $142 million increased $76 million and $70 million, respectively, from the prior year. These cash flow increases were primarily driven by improved profitability and changes in working capital.\nOther Measures\nBookings of $811 million increased 24 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Total backlog was $1.8 billion and 12-month backlog was $931 million at the end of the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 6 percent and 22 percent, respectively.\nOperational Update\nOn Feb. 22, 2018, the board of directors approved a new restructuring plan to continue efforts to optimize our global supply chain, manufacturing operations and product development, sales and marketing Organizations. Estimated pre-tax restructuring charges are between $100 and $110 million, the majority of which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2018. The projects under this plan are anticipated to result in approximately $45 to $50 million of annualized savings upon completion. The Company expects to substantially complete projects under this plan by the end of 2020.\nMany of our employees are represented by unions or works councils, which requires consultation, and potential restructuring projects may be subject to regulatory approval, both of which could impact the timing of planned savings in certain jurisdictions.\nFinancial Guidance\nItron’s guidance for the full year 2018 is as follows:\nRevenue between $2.33 and $2.43 billion Non-GAAP diluted EPS between $2.95 and $3.35\nItron's guidance for the first quarter of 2018 is as follows:\nRevenue between $575 and $600 million Non-GAAP diluted EPS between $0.10 and $0.15\nGuidance assumes an average euro to U.S. dollar foreign currency exchange rate of $1.21 in 2018, diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 40 million for the year, a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year of approximately 28 percent and total interest expense of approximately $50 million. Operating profitability and Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year.\nThe company also confirmed its expectations that the acquisition of Silver Spring Networks will be accretive to gross margin in 2018 and will be accretive to non-GAAP EPS and adjusted EBITDA in 2019.\nThese assumptions are forward-looking and reflect the estimated impacts of purchase accounting for the acquisition of Silver Spring Networks, adoption of the new revenue accounting standard and the Tax Act on our financial results and are subject to change.\nA reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP diluted EPS to the GAAP diluted EPS has not been provided because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the potential amount or timing of restructuring and acquisition and integration related expenses and their related tax effects without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP results for the guidance period.\nEarnings Conference Call\nItron will host a conference call to discuss the financial results and guidance contained in this release at 5:00 p.m. EDT on Feb. 28, 2018.

These statements relate to our expectations about revenues, operations, financial performance, earnings, earnings per share and cash flows. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions upon which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of these estimates or assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward-looking statements based on these estimates and assumptions could be incorrect.

Itron undertakes or revise any information .\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, constant currency and free cash flow. We provide these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they provide greater transparency and represent supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We exclude certain costs in our non-GAAP financial measures as we believe the net result is a measure of our core business. The company believes these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Non-GAAP performance measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures may be different from those reported by other companies. A more detailed discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures, the limitations of using such measures, and reconciliations between non-GAAP and the nearest GAAP financial measures are included .\nITRON, INC.

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, constant currency and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define such measures differently. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures please see the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measures.”\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and/or as a means for determining executive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and ability to service debt by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. Our executive compensation plans exclude non-cash charges related to amortization of intangibles and certain discrete cash and non-cash charges such as purchase accounting adjustments, restructuring charges or goodwill impairment charges, and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and because they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to analyze the health of our business.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating income - We define non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses excluding certain expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, acquisition and integration, and goodwill impairment. We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income excluding the expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, acquisition and integration, and goodwill impairment. Acquisition and integration related expenses include costs which are incurred to affect and integrate business combinations, such as professional fees, certain employee retention and salaries related to integration, severances, contract terminations, travel costs related to knowledge transfer, system conversion costs, and asset impairment charges. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of expenses that are related to acquisitions and restructuring projects. By excluding these expenses, we believe that it is easier for management and investors to compare our financial results over multiple periods and analyze trends in our operations. For example, in certain periods expenses related to amortization of intangible assets may decrease, which would improve GAAP operating margins, yet the improvement in GAAP operating margins due to this lower expense is not necessarily reflective of an improvement in our core business. There are some limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating income versus operating expenses and operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information about the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating expense and non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating expense and non-GAAP operating income together with GAAP operating expense and GAAP operating income.\nNon-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS - We define non-GAAP net income as net income attributable to Itron, Inc. excluding the expenses associated with amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, acquisition and integration, goodwill impairment, amortization of debt placement fees, impact from the Tax Act and the tax effect of excluding these expenses. We define non-GAAP diluted EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a diluted basis, outstanding during each period. We consider these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors for the same reasons that we use non-GAAP operating income. The same limitations described above regarding our use of non-GAAP operating income apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP measures and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS together with GAAP net income attributable to Itron, Inc. and GAAP diluted EPS.\nAdjusted EBITDA - We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (a) minus interest income, (b) plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring, acquisition and integration related expense, goodwill impairment and (c) excluding income tax provision or benefit. Management uses adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for executive compensation. A limitation to using adjusted EBITDA is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period and the measure includes some non-cash items and excludes other non-cash items. Additionally, the items that we exclude in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the items that our peer companies exclude when they report their results. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this measure to GAAP net income.\nFree cash flow - We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for acquisitions of property, plant and equipment. We believe free cash flow provides investors with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing our ability to fund our operations and repay our debt. The same limitations described above regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA apply to our use of free cash flow. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts and reconciling to free cash flow.\nConstant currency - We refer to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in our discussions of financial results, which references the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We also use the term “constant currency,” which represents financial results adjusted to exclude changes in foreign currency exchange rates as compared with the rates in the comparable prior year period. We calculate the constant currency change as the difference between the current period results and the comparable prior period’s results restated using current period foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe accompanying tables have more detail on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\nITRON, INC.
