    "text": " 23 p.m. ET Share \nUp to 33,000 jobs in U.S. threatened Bloomberg News A customer enters a Toys \"R\" Us Inc. retail store advertising a closing-down sale. \nBy Paul Ziobro Lillian Rizzo \nToys ‘R’ Us Inc. told employees Wednesday the struggling big-box retailer will sell or close all its U.S. stores, a collapse that threatens up to 33,000 Americans jobs in the coming months. \nThe 70-year-old chain, which filed for bankruptcy protection in September, has more than 700 remaining U.S. locations, including Babies ‘R’ Us stores. It would be one of the biggest retail liquidations since The Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy in 2016 with 14,500 workers and closed more than 460 stores. \nChief Executive David Brandon delivered the company’s fate to workers at its Wayne, N.J., headquarters. The company plans to file liquidation papers Wednesday evening in advance of a bankruptcy court hearing on Thursday. \n“I have always believed that this brand and this business should exist in the U.S.,” Brandon said on a conference call with staff, adding that he guarantees that vendors who failed to support the retailer during the holidays and customers who shopped elsewhere will miss the retailer. They “will all live to regret what’s happening here,” Brandon said.",
