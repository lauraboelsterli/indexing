    "text": "MIAMI, March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mi9 Retail, a leading provider of omni-channel retail solutions, announced today that it plans to double the size of its Miami-based product development organization by the end of the year, and will continue to hire aggressively in its Irvine, California center as well.\nEarlier this year, Mi9 announced the acquisition of JustEnough Software which added best-of-breed demand management and planning to the Mi9 Retail suite. To support the company's continued expansion and growth, Mi9 will be actively hiring in all business areas, including software and business development, sales, customer support, and project management.\nAccording to the Kauffman Foundation's 2017 Index of Startup Activity , the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area ranked No. 1 among the 40 largest areas in the U.S. \"Miami is a vibrant city whose business-friendly environment and abundance of top caliber technical talent is particularly appealing for a fast-growing business like ours,\" said Neil Moses, CEO of Mi9 Retail. \"Furthermore, the recent changes to corporate tax rates make it very attractive for us to hire in the U.S.\" The Tampa Bay Times found that Florida's economic performance was better in 2017 than 2016 on almost all fronts, and economists expect the favorable economic climate to continue well into 2018.\nOver the past four years, Mi9 Retail has increased its employee base tenfold and aims to rapidly grow its employee headcount in the United States, which will help further strengthen the company's position as an industry leader. \"Our growing customer base knows the importance of optimizing the changing customer journey, and we're thrilled to provide them the tools they need to succeed,\" added Moses. \"Now is an exciting time to be in the technology space, and we look forward to bringing new talented people on board.\"\nAbout Mi9 Retail\nMi9 Retail is passionate about helping retailers create great experiences for their customers â€“ online, in-store, and on any device.
