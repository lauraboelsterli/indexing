    "text": "CUPERTINO, Calif., March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Workspot, the leader in cloud-based VDI services on Microsoft Azure, today announced that Mark B. Templeton, former president and CEO of Citrix, has joined the Workspot Advisory Board.\nClick to Tweet : .@Workspot is delighted to welcome @MarkBTempleton to the Workspot Advisory Board! #VDI #Azure #DesktopCloud\nMark brings a distinguished track record of success and vision to the Workspot team and will help the company build on its efforts to provide organizations with simplified, best-in-class desktop cloud services.\nDuring Mark's 20-year tenure as Citrix's CEO, the company transformed into one of the most globally recognizable brands. Since his retirement from Citrix in 2015, he's continued to demonstrate his expertise through his work on several boards of directors and as an adviser to early-stage companies.\nAmitabh Sinha, CEO and co-founder of Workspot, said: \"We are excited to have Mark join the Workspot Advisory Board at a time when Workspot's Desktop Cloud services are growing across Microsoft Azure globally. Our focus on customer success and simplified technology is the cornerstone of Workspot's operating philosophy and values that are deeply held by Mark as well. Mark's insights and advice will prove invaluable to Workspot as we continue to experience high growth.\"\nMark Templeton, Workspot advisory board member, said : \"We are at a tipping point in the migration from the data center to the public cloud. IT teams continue to be asked to do more with less and respond to business change faster. That's leading them to fast time-to-value public cloud services more than ever. Workspot is positioned in the center of this perfect storm for cloud desktops because VDI is the number one data center workload. Over the last five years, Workspot has built a simple, cloud-native solution to deliver virtual desktops from Microsoft Azure. They have also created an industry-first, no-risk engagement model focused on customer success. I am excited to work with many former Citrites on the Workspot leadership team.\"\nAbout Workspot\nWorkspot is an insanely simple, turnkey cloud service for securely delivering Windows 10 desktops, apps and workstations to any device from Microsoft Azure.
