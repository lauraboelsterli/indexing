(NYSE: TLRA), the leading video monetization software company, today announced that Adam Irlando and Peter Horn have joined the company as VP of Platform Partnerships and VP of Agency and Brand Relations, respectively. The new appointments will help further connect leading advertisers with premium video and CTV inventory on Telaria's platform. Both Mr. Irlando and Mr. Horn will report to Chief Revenue Officer Rick Song, and will be based in the company’s New York headquarters.\nWith deep experience in premium media, video and mobile, Mr. Irlando will spearhead efforts to strengthen Telaria’s DSP partner relationships in North America. He was previously at Kargo serving as Vice President of Programmatic where he implemented the strategic demand framework and led the team that successfully doubled the company’s PMP run rate. Earlier in his career, Mr. Irlando launched the direct and mobile performance revenue divisions of Xaxis for North America.\nMr. Horn joins Telaria with over two decades of industry experience and will help agencies and brands navigate the vast opportunities in programmatic video to their fullest advantage. He was formerly the Senior Director of Sales at Simulmedia, the leading advertising technology company in the linear TV space. Prior to that, Mr. Horn was the Chief Revenue Officer at Dstillery where he drove significant year-over-year revenue growth, launched an addressable TV solution and self-serve, demand-side trading platform.\n“The rapid adoption of premium video and CTV offers brands a new and differentiated way to reach highly valuable audiences. As the leading, premium video programmatic platform in the industry, it's important for us to evangelize this medium and expose buyers and brands to its advantages as they look to achieve their campaign goals. I'm delighted to welcome Adam and Peter to Telaria to help us make this happen,” said Mr. Song.\n“I’m incredibly excited to join Telaria as programmatic video continues to make huge strides, particularly in CTV,” said Mr. Irlando. “I’m looking forward to working with the talented team here as well as with our DSP partners to ensure we are producing the best results possible for all sides.”\n“Video has traditionally been and will continue to be a premium advertising channel. As viewer preferences quickly change, brands and agencies need a leader in advanced TV to help them navigate the ecosystem which is why I decided to join Telaria,” said Mr. Horn. “With quality and transparency at the top of every marketer’s wish list, Telaria’s commitments to those tenets make it well-suited for success.”\nAbout Telaria\nTelaria (NYSE: TLRA) is the leading independent data-driven software platform built to monetize and manage premium video inventory with the greatest speed, control, and transparency, wherever and however audiences are watching.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180312005266/en/\nTelaria, Inc.\nLekha Rao, 646-226-0254\nlrao@Telaria.com\nSource: Telaria Inc.",
