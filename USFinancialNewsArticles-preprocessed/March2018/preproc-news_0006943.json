    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 12:23 PM / in 9 minutes U.S. court preliminarily approves terms of Petrobras class action settlement Reuters Staff 1 Min Read SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A U.S. federal court preliminarily approved on Wednesday the terms of a $3 billion class action settlement Brazilian state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA reached with U.S. shareholders in January, the firm said in a Thursday securities filing. The company said a judge will assess potential objections to the accord at a hearing scheduled for June 1. In early January, Petrobras, as the company is known, agreed to pay $2.95 billion to U.S. shareholders due to corruption-related losses, in what was said to be the biggest such payout in the United States by a foreign entity. That number could be slightly higher due to legal and administrative fees. Reporting by Gram Slattery",
