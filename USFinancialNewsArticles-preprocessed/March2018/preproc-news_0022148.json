    "text": "LAFAYETTE, La., Home Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: \"HBCP\") (the \"Company\"), the parent company for Home Bank, N.A. (the \"Bank\") ( www.home24bank.com ), today announced an additional deferred tax asset (\"DTA\") re-measurement charge of $956,000 applicable to the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"). The Company had previously announced a charge to the DTA of $1.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the Tax Act.\nThe additional DTA charge resulted from an update of the core deposit intangible asset and loan interest rate mark valuations associated with the Company's acquisition of St. Martin Bancshares, Inc. (\"St. Martin\") on December 6, 2017. These valuations revised the goodwill recorded on the St. Martin transaction from $46.2 million to $49.3 million and increased the associated charge to the DTA from $1.8 million to $2.7 million. Due to the lower tax rates prescribed by the Tax Act, an additional write down of the DTA by $956,000, reflected as income tax expense, is reflected in our revised results. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company has a reasonable time after the acquisition (not to extend beyond one year) to obtain information necessary to measure the estimates of fair values of acquired assets and liabilities. The receipt of additional information on the core deposit intangible and loan interest rate mark valuation from St. Martin subsequent to our initial press release of January 30, 2018 but prior to the completion of our audited financial statements for 2017 requires us to recognize the additional DTA charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. While subject to further adjustments, we do not expect additional changes of a material amount to our valuations of St. Martin's assets and liabilities.\n\"We are excited about the positive economic impact likely to result from lower corporate tax rates,\" stated John W. Bordelon, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, \"even though the lower rates require us to further write down our deferred tax asset.\"\nThe following table provides selected financial data at and for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 as originally reported on January 30, 2018, and as revised after this additional charge.\nAt December 31, 2017\nCurrently Reported\nPreviously Reported\nTotal Assets\n$\n2,228,120,838\n$\n2,229,076,363\nTotal loans, net of unearned income\n1,657,794,751\n1,664,389,988\nIntangible assets\n68,033,472\n63,093,801\nRetained earnings\n117,312,630\n118,267,606\nTotal Shareholders' Equity\n277,870,726\n278,825,702\nFor the Three Months ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nCurrently\nReported\nPreviously\nReported\nIncome Tax Expense\n$\n5,508,098\n$\n4,552,573\nNet Income\n3,242,436\n4,197,961\nEarnings per share – basic\n0.43\n0.56\nEarnings per share - diluted\n0.41\n0.54\nBook value per share at period end\n29.57\n29.68\nTangible book value per share at period end\n22.33\n22.96\nReturn on average assets\n0.73\n%\n0.94\n%\nReturn on average equity\n5.92\n7.66\nReturn on average tangible common equity\n6.99\n8.95\nCommon equity ratio\n12.47\n12.51\nTangible common equity ratio\n9.71\n9.96\nFor the Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nCurrently\nReported\nPreviously\nReported\nIncome Tax Expense\n$\n12,492,891\n$\n11,537,366\nNet Income\n16,823,987\n17,779,512\nEarnings per share – basic\n2.36\n2.50\nEarnings per share - diluted\n2.28\n2.41\nBook value per share at period end\n29.57\n29.68\nTangible book value per share at period end\n22.33\n22.96\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nCurrently\nReported\nPreviously\nReported\nBook value per share\n$\n29.57\n$\n29.68\nLess: Intangible assets\n7.24\n6.72\nNon-GAAP tangible book value per share\n$\n22.33\n$\n22.96\nCommon equity ratio\n12.47\n%\n12.51\n%\nLess: Intangible assets\n2.76\n2.55\nNon-GAAP tangible common equity ratio\n9.71\n%\n9.96\n%\nReturn on average equity\n5.92\n%\n7.66\n%\nAdd: Intangible assets\n1.07\n1.29\nNon-GAAP return on tangible common equity\n6.99\n%\n8.95\n%\nThis news release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The Company's management uses this non-GAAP financial information in its analysis of the Company's performance. In this news release, information is included which excludes intangible assets. Management believes the presentation of this non-GAAP financial information provides useful information that is helpful to a full understanding of the Company's financial position and core operating results. This non-GAAP financial information should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial information presented by other companies.\nThis news release contains certain forward looking statements. Forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include the words \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate\" or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs such as \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could\" or \"may.\"\nForward looking statements, by their nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors many of which are beyond our control could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements. Home Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, describes some of these factors, including risk elements in the loan portfolio, the level of the allowance for losses on loans, risks of our growth strategy, geographic concentration of our business, dependence on our management team, risks of market rates of interest and of regulation on our business and risks of competition.
