    "text": "Published: Mar 28, 2018 3:29 p.m. ET Share \nRegular decisions from Ivy League universities and other top schools come out Wednesday; early-decision applicants had their answers late last year Getty Images Yale admissions department to early-decision applicants: “Boola boola.” \nBy Melissa Korn \nThe odds of getting into Harvard and other elite universities are worse for students who apply in the regular pool than for those who apply in early rounds. \nThis harsh reality will be driven home when Harvard, Yale, Penn and other Ivy League institutions release their regular-decision admission notices Wednesday evening: Large proportions of their incoming first-year classes were locked in months ago under early-admittance programs. \nHigh-school seniors desperate for a leg up in the brutal competition for spots at selective colleges have increasingly been applying through binding early-decision or more flexible early-action programs, rather than meeting Jan. 1 application deadlines and waiting until spring for an answer. \nThe admission rate for early-round candidates, who typically learn their fates in December, is often two or three times that of regular applicants. Harvard last year admitted 14.5% of early-action applicants and about 3.3% of regular-decision applicants. At Yale, those rates were 17.1% and 5%, respectively. Many institutions fill 40% or more of their incoming classes with early applicants. \nDartmouth College expects students admitted through its early-decision process to make up nearly half its first-year class next fall. The school received 2,270 early applications, compared with roughly 20,000 in the regular cycle. Early-decision applicants make up 53% of Northwestern University’s current freshman class, and just over half at Vanderbilt University.",
