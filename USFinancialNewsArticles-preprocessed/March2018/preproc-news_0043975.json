    "text": "Former UK Treasury Minister and Financier Named Second Independent Director\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rockefeller Capital Management today announced that Lord Paul Myners has joined its board of directors. The highly accomplished businessman and former Treasury Minister in the UK is the second independent director to join the Rockefeller board following the firm’s launch earlier this month.\n“Paul has had an extraordinary career across finance, business, and public service. The counsel and expertise he brings to Rockefeller Capital Management will be invaluable to our firm and our clients,” said Gregory J. Fleming, president and chief executive officer.\nMyners’ extensive experience in international banking and investment management will be particularly beneficial to Rockefeller as the firm broadens its wealth and asset management capabilities, builds strategic advisory and begins to expand geographically. The firm serves ultra- and high-net-worth families as well as institutional investors and companies.\n“Having spent the better portion of my career in finance, I am impressed by what Greg and his team are building at Rockefeller Capital Management,” said Lord Paul Myners. “They are client focused, have the right mix of businesses, and are led by a talented team. I am eager to help the firm as it embarks on this new chapter of growth.”\nIn addition to serving as Treasury Minister and on the Court of the Bank of England, Myners has substantial private sector experience. He ran one of the UK’s largest institutional investors for nearly 20 years, and has served on the boards of GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, Lloyd’s of London, Coutts & Co., and the Bank of New York. Myners has also chaired several public UK companies such as retailer Marks & Spencer and Land Securities, Europe’s largest REIT.\nHe became a member of the Court of the Bank of England in 2004 and was appointed Treasury Minister in the fall of 2008, with a specific brief for managing the UK’s response to the banking crisis. He was at the same time elevated to membership of The House of Lords.\nCurrently, Myners is the chairman and a partner of Cevian Capital; chairman of Edelman UK; and chancellor of the University of Exeter. He is the former chair of the London School of Economics. Myners received his degree from the University of London.\nMyners joins former Vanguard chairman and CEO John “Jack” Brennan as an independent director of Rockefeller Capital Management.\nAbout Rockefeller Capital Management\nRockefeller Capital Management is a leading independent financial services firm offering wealth management, asset management and strategic advisory, serving ultra- and high-net-worth individuals as well as institutions that include foundations, endowments and corporations. As of December 31, 2017, the firm had approximately $18.3 billion in assets under advisement, with offices in New York, Boston and Washington, DC.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180326005248/en/\nMedia:\nTeneo Strategy\nStephen Cohen, 212-886-9332\nstephen.cohen@teneostrategy.com\nSource: Rockefeller Capital Management",
