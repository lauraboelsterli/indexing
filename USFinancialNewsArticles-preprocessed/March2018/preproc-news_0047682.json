    "text": "SHANGHAI/BEIJING, March 29 (Reuters) - Bank of China Ltd (BoC) , the country’s fourth-largest lender by assets, on Thursday said net profit fell about 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, but the drop was smaller than analysts had expected.\nProfit reached 26.9 billion yuan ($4.28 billion) for the quarter ended December, from 29.8 billion yuan a year ago.\nThis was, however, better than an average estimate of 25.51 billion yuan from 18 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.\nFor 2017, net profit rose to 172.41 billion yuan from 164.578 billion yuan a year ago.\nBoC’s non-performing loan ratio was 1.45 percent as at end-December, from 1.41 percent at end-September.
