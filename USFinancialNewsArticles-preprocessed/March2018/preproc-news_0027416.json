The draft legislation now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives where majority Republicans say they want to add more provisions to ease financial regulations. The bill would ease tight restrictions on small banks and community lenders and includes a number of other provisions beneficial to all but the largest U.S. banks. (Reporting by Pete Schroeder)",
