Roddy Bailey, Pat Murphy, Jimar Sanders and Nathan Hertzog focus on middle market transactions involving private equity sponsors, venture capital investments and mezzanine financing . The team, which will work out of both Chattanooga and Nashville, also advises sponsors on the formation and structuring of private equity, venture capital and hedge funds, as well as investors in such funds.\n“Roddy, Pat, Jimar and Nathan are skilled and innovative deal lawyers who complement our existing M&A and commercial finance practices and expand the legal services we provide private equity and venture capital clients on fund work, transactional matters, and mezzanine financing,” said Waller chairman Matt Burnstein. “They are a sophisticated team that brings energy and an impressive track record delivering results to their clients.”\nRoddy Bailey is a trusted advisor in the private equity space, where he leads and advises on private equity transactions, mergers and acquisitions and growth equity financings, as well as general corporate law.
