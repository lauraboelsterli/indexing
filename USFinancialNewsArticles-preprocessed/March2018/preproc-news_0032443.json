    "text": "BALTIMORE, March 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MMA Capital Management, LLC (NASDAQ: MMAC) (\" the Company \") today reported financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, including common shareholders' equity of $137.5 million, or $24.48 per diluted common share. Today, the Company will file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the \" 2017 Annual Report \") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\" SEC \") and will host an investor call at 8:30 a.m. ET on Monday, March 19, 2018.\nCommon shareholders' equity increased $12.2 million to $137.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This change was driven by $22.7 million in comprehensive income that was allocable to common shareholders that was partially offset by $10.5 million in other reductions in common shareholders' equity that were primarily driven by the repurchase of the Company's common shares. Diluted common shareholders' equity (\" Book Value \") per share increased to $24.48 at December 31, 2017, which represents an increase of $3.73 per share of Book Value compared to what we reported at December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to net income from operations, which was primarily due to fee and other income from our asset management businesses and equity in income from unconsolidated funds and ventures.\nWe recognized comprehensive income that was allocable to common shareholders of $22.7 million during 2017, which consisted of $19.4 million of net income that was allocable to common shareholders and $3.3 million of other comprehensive income that was allocable to common shareholders. In comparison, we recognized $19.0 million of comprehensive income that was allocable to common shareholders during 2016, which consisted of $42.4 million of net income that was allocable to common shareholders and $23.4 million of other comprehensive loss that was allocable to common shareholders.\nMichael Falcone, MMA Capital's Chief Executive Officer stated, \"2017 represented another strong year of performance for the Company across most of our business lines. Contributions from both our LIHTC management platform and our solar energy lending investments delivered significant year-over-year growth for the Company. Finally, we concluded our 2017 stock buyback plan having purchased approximately 400,000 shares at an average price of $24.01 per share, a discount to our year-end Book Value per share.\n\"While we were pleased with our financial performance and operational execution in 2017, which included an 18% increase in our Book Value, our strategic success, as evidenced by the closing of the transaction with Hunt Companies, Inc. at the start of January, was certainly made possible by the hard work of our team throughout the year. By pursuing the strategic goals of simplifying our balance sheet, right-sizing our operational costs through the externalization of management and monetizing management businesses that would have taken us quite a while to properly develop, the Company is set to start 2018 with a significant financial reporting gain and a more focused business plan. The value in this approach had been validated in part by the confidence shown by Hunt Companies with the recent closing of their initial investment requirement at $33.00 per share.\n\"Lastly, the Board has authorized us to implement a 2018 stock buyback plan during the next open trading window. The plan will allow for the buyback of 125,000 shares between now and December 31, 2018, at an initial maximum purchase price of $30.00 per share.\"\nConference Call Information\nThe conference call with investors will be webcast.
