    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Applied Design Works (Applied), a New York City–based creative agency, today announced it is opening an office in Los Angeles, CA. This office will be the agency's second, and will work closely with its headquarters in New York City. Katherine Pereira joins the team as Managing Director of the LA office, working with Applied's founders to grow the agency's presence on the West Coast.\nApplied's growth into the LA market represents a big moment for the agency. Brad Scott, Founder and Managing Director, began his career in California and always envisioned working in the market again. \"LA is rich in culture, diversity of thought, and the spirit of creativity, which inspires us greatly. Coupled with the cutting-edge business community and the needs of clients already based there, our goal is for the office to establish itself as part of the fabric of LA's design, business and local community.\"\nTo lead the charge in the LA office, Applied has brought on Katherine Pereira as Managing Director. Pereira joins from sparks + honey, an Omnicom agency, where she was a client partner, responsible for leading the agency's beauty, packaged goods and government businesses. In that role, she worked with clients to identify future trends and understand how they may impact clients' businesses. Prior to sparks + honey, Pereira spent time at McGarry Bowen, Landor and Y&R.\nScott pointed to Pereira's vast experience across industries like telecommunications, hospitality, retail, banking and fast food as key reasons for her joining the team. \"As we look to grow our client roster on the West Coast, having someone with such vast experience as Katherine's is key. She can work comfortably with all kinds of clients, helping them elevate to the next level both creatively and strategically.\"\n\"I'm really excited to join the Applied team,\" said Pereira. \"My passion lies in working closely with clients to identify their challenges, and then partnering together to find creative solutions that impact their brands and the world around them. I can't wait to help grow our presence on the West Coast by working with both existing and new clients.\"\nFounded in 2015 by Brad Scott and Craig Dobie, two seasoned professionals who held senior positions at leading design studios, Applied brings a laser focus to helping solve client problems in ways that are creative, purposeful and beautiful. Together, the team has worked with clients like the Central Park Conservancy, NYU Langone, Pfizer, Westfield and the World Trade Center, and has won awards from AIGA, Cannes Lions and D&AD, among others.\nAbout Applied Design Works\nIn the real world, things aren't always easy. In order to grow, advance and succeed, there are problems you'll need to solve, obstacles you'll need to overcome, risks you'll have to take.
