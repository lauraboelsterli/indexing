On the bottom line, improved margins drove higher net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB409.5 million, up almost 100% year-over-year compared with 2016.\"\n\"In 2017, we further enhanced our long-term competitive advantages. Leveraging our strength in the real estate industry, our high quality real-estate-related wealth management products remained popular among investors amid more conservative market sentiment. The aggregate value of products distributed by Jupai for the full-year 2017 grew to RMB54.3 billion, a 20% increase year-over-year, as total assets under management rose to RMB57.5 billion as of December 31, 2017, a 59% increase year-over-year. In line with Jupai's commitment to delivering value to our shareholders, our board has declared a cash dividend of US$0.1 per ordinary share, equal to US$0.6 per ADS. \"\n\"Moving ahead, Jupai will continue to broaden our product selection and promote our real estate-related equity products, building upon our rigorous risk management system and rich real estate resources. We are confident that with our mature business lines, Jupai is well-positioned to achieve healthy profit growth in 2018. In addition, we believe that performance fees and new business lines such as our overseas business and insurance offerings will generate incremental profit growth in the coming year. Management will continue to strive to fulfill our customers' ever-changing investment needs, enhance Jupai's capability to achieve stable long-term growth, and build Jupai into the leading wealth and asset management brand in China.\"\nMs. Min Liu, Jupai's chief financial officer, said, \"Jupai concluded the year with a strong performance across our business lines. As management continued to grow our business scale, we further optimized our product mix and enhanced operating efficiency, leading to a significant expansion of our net profit margin from 18% in 2016 to 24% in 2017. We remain optimistic about our bottom line growth outlook for 2018.\"\nFOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB460.0 million (US$70.7 million), a 35.9% increase from RMB338.5 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to increases in one-time commissions. Net revenues were RMB1,706.2 million (US$262.2 million) for the full year of 2017, an increase of 51.3% from RMB1,127.7 million in 2016.\nNet revenues from one-time commissions for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB308.9 million (US$47.5 million), a 66.7% increase from RMB185.3 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in fee rate compared to corresponding period in 2016. For the full year of 2017, net revenues from one-time commissions were RMB1,038.7 million (US$159.6 million), an increase of 64.0% from RMB633.2 million in 2016. Net revenues from recurring management fees for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB111.4 million (US$17.1 million), a 52.5% increase from RMB73.1 million for the corresponding period in 2016.

Net revenues from recurring service fees for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB23.7 million (US$3.6 million), an 8.2% decrease from RMB25.8 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily because the Company provided ongoing services to fewer product suppliers. We expect the net revenues from recurring service fees will continue to decline going forward. The Company recognized RMB63.7 thousand (US$9.8 thousand) and RMB1.2 million variable performance fees in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Net revenues from other service fees for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB15.9 million (US$2.4 million), a 70.7% decrease from RMB54.3 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to decreases in sub-advisory fees collected from third-party asset management companies. For the full year of 2017, net revenues from other service fees were RMB198.8 million (US$30.6 million), an increase of 79.5% from RMB110.7 million in 2016, as the related sub-advisory fees started from the third quarter of 2016.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nOperating costs and expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB396.2 million (US$60.9 million), an increase of 62.1% from RMB244.4 million for the corresponding period in 2016.

For the full year of 2017, cost of revenues was RMB737.5 million (US$113.4 million), an increase of 54.6% from RMB477.0 million in 2016. Selling expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB82.4 million (US$12.7 million), a 27.3% increase from RMB64.7 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to increases in marketing expenses.

The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest GAAP measures as set forth in the table captioned \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" below.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company may be prepared differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWhen evaluating the Company's operating performance in the periods presented, management reviewed non-GAAP net income results reflecting adjustments to exclude the impacts of share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition to supplement U.S. GAAP financial data. As such, the Company believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shares per diluted ADS and non-GAAP net margin attributable to ordinary shareholders provides important supplemental information to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations in a manner consistent with that used by management. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, the Company recognized significant amounts of expenses for the restricted shares and share options, and amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition in the periods presented. The Company utilized the non-GAAP financial results to make financial results comparable period to period and to better understand its historical business operations.\nABOUT JUPAI HOLDINGS LIMITED\nJupai Holdings Limited (\"Jupai\") (NYSE: JP) is a leading third-party wealth management service provider focusing on distributing wealth management products and providing quality product advisory services to high-net-worth individuals in China.

For assets denominated in currencies other than Renminbi, the AUM are translated into Renminbi upon their contribution, without interim value adjustments solely due to changes in foreign exchange rates. As a result, Jupai's management fees for almost all its AUM are calculated based on the historical cost balance of the AUM.\n-- FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL TABLES FOLLOW --\nJupai Holdings Limited\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAs of\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2017\n2017\nRMB\nRMB\nUSD\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,123,166,156\n1,527,777,270\n234,815,067\nShort-term investments\n25,210,000\n8,403,612\n1,291,612\nAccounts receivable\n52,111,944\n53,512,590\n8,224,734\nOther receivables\n71,064,287\n22,989,264\n3,533,385\nAmounts due from related parties\n133,560,483\n268,760,059\n41,307,665\nDeferred tax assets -
