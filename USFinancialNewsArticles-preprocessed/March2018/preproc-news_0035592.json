Achieved consolidated traffic growth in every quarter of 2017.\nMONTEVIDEO, Uruguay--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arcos Dorados Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ARCO) (“Arcos Dorados” or the “Company”), Latin America’s largest restaurant chain and the world’s largest independent McDonald’s franchisee, today reported unaudited results for the fourth quarter and audited results for the full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Key Results – Excluding Venezuela\nAs reported consolidated revenues increased 7.6% to $850.9 million versus the fourth quarter of 2016. On a constant currency basis 1 , consolidated revenues grew 9.0%. Systemwide comparable sales 1 rose 9.1% year-over-year. As reported Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 6.3% to $89.1 million compared with the prior-year quarter. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 10 basis points to 10.5%. As reported General and Administrative (G&A) expenses remained flat as a percentage of revenues. As reported net income increased to $62.7 million, from $17.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Key Results – Excluding Venezuela\nAs reported consolidated revenues increased 11.9% to $3.22 billion in 2017. On a constant currency basis, consolidated revenues grew 10.2%. Systemwide comparable sales rose 10.6% year-over-year. As reported Adjusted EBITDA increased 18.6% to $282.2 million year-over-year. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points to 8.8% in 2017. As reported G&A expenses decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of revenues. As reported net income was $131.3 million, up 44.2% from $91.1 million last year.\n“We had a very solid end to a strong year with high single digit comparable sales in the fourth quarter and volume increases in every quarter throughout the year. Our success in driving topline growth along with our efforts to reduce costs translated into our highest Adjusted EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter and full year since 2011. We also delivered on our main goals of G&A optimization, Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and leverage reduction as outlined in our three-year strategic plan. As of the end of 2017, we had rolled-out Experience of the Future (EOTF) to more than 120 restaurants. We also opened 50 new restaurants, which was the top end of our guidance for 2017. We maintained our clear market share leadership position in our main markets by giving our customers more reasons to visit us more often and we will continue to leverage our size and scale to capture the significant opportunity in front of us”, said Sergio Alonso, Chief Executive Officer of Arcos Dorados.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nConsolidated\nFigure 1. AD Holdings Inc Consolidated: Key Financial Results\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as noted)\n4Q16\n(a)\nCurrency\nTranslation\n(b)\nConstant\nCurrency\nGrowth\n(c)\n4Q17\n(a+b+c)\n% As\nReported\n% Constant\nCurrency\nTotal Restaurants (Units) 2,156 2,188 1.5% Sales by Company-operated Restaurants 770.5 (176.1) 256.9 851.3 10.5% 33.3% Revenues from franchised restaurants 36.7 (19.4) 28.4 45.6 24.3% 77.3% Total Revenues 807.2 (195.5) 285.2 896.9 11.1% 35.3% Systemwide Comparable Sales 42.6% Adjusted EBITDA 86.3 (93.6) 118.8 111.4 29.1% 137.7% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 10.7% 12.4% Net income (loss) attributable to AD 21.2 (76.8) 124.9 69.3 227.5% 590.7% No. of shares outstanding (thousands) 210,711 211,073 EPS (US$/Share) 0.10 0.33 (4Q17 = 4Q16 + Currency Translation + Constant Currency Growth). Refer to “Definitions” section for further detail.\nArcos Dorados’ fourth quarter as reported revenues increased 11.1%, driven by constant currency revenue growth of 35.3%, which was partially offset by the negative impact of currency translation. The currency translation impact primarily reflected the significant year-over-year average depreciation of the Venezuelan bolivar and, to a lesser extent, the Argentine peso. Constant currency revenue growth reflected a 42.6% expansion in systemwide comparable sales, largely explained by inflation-driven average check growth in Venezuela, combined with positive traffic in all, but the Caribbean division, where volumes were negatively impacted by the ongoing difficult environment in Venezuela as well as the hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nFourth quarter consolidated as reported Adjusted EBITDA increased 29.1%, supported by revenue growth and margin expansion. The Caribbean and Brazil divisions were the key contributors to Adjusted EBITDA growth during the quarter, whereas NOLAD and SLAD remained relatively flat. Venezuela’s high year-over-year inflation rate meaningfully outpaced the country’s currency devaluation, which generated a significant positive impact on the Adjusted EBITDA growth both in the Caribbean division as well as on a consolidated basis. Please refer to the Recent Developments section on page 14 for a further discussion of this topic.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 170 basis points to 12.4%, with margin improvements in Brazil and the Caribbean division, partially offset by margin declines in NOLAD and SLAD. Leverage in Food and Paper (F&P) and Payroll primarily drove the consolidated margin expansion. Adjusted EBITDA margin also benefited from the recognition of higher refranchising proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the prior-year quarter.\nAs reported, consolidated G&A increased by 8.6% year-over-year, and declined almost 20 basis points as a percentage of revenues.\nConsolidated – excluding Venezuela\nFigure 2. AD Holdings Inc Consolidated - Excluding Venezuela: Key Financial Results\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as noted)\n4Q16\n(a)\nCurrency\nTranslation\n(b)\nConstant\nCurrency\nGrowth\n(c)\n4Q17\n(a+b+c)\n% As\nReported\n% Constant\nCurrency\nTotal Restaurants (Units) 2,023 2,058 1.7% Sales by Company-operated Restaurants 755.5 (10.5) 65.1 810.1 7.2% 8.6% Revenues from franchised restaurants 34.9 (0.0) 5.9 40.8 16.8% 16.9% Total Revenues 790.4 (10.6) 71.0 850.9 7.6% 9.0% Systemwide Comparable Sales 9.1% Adjusted EBITDA 83.8 0.7 4.6 89.1 6.3% 5.5% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 10.6% 10.5% Net income (loss) attributable to AD 17.2 2.6 42.9 62.7 264.3% 249.3% No. of shares outstanding (thousands) 210,711 211,073 EPS (US$/Share) 0.08 0.30 Excluding the Company’s Venezuelan operation, as reported revenues increased 7.6% year-over-year. The result primarily reflects constant currency revenue growth of 9.0%, partially offset by a negative impact from currency translation. The 14% year-over-year average depreciation of the Argentine peso more than offset the appreciation of the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, and other currencies in the Company’s territories. Constant currency revenue growth was supported by a 9.1% increase in systemwide comparable sales, driven by a favorable shift in mix and positive traffic in all divisions except the Caribbean.\nAs reported Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.3%, or 5.5% in constant currency terms. The Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 10 basis points to 10.5%, mainly due to higher Royalty Fees and franchised restaurant occupancy fees, which were mostly offset by efficiencies achieved in F&P costs as a percentage of revenues.\nNon-operating Results\nNon-operating results for the fourth quarter reflected a non-cash $4.2 million foreign currency exchange gain, versus a non-cash gain of $3.5 million last year. Net interest expense remained relatively flat year-over-year, at $13.9 million.\nThe Company reported an income tax expense of $21.4 million in the quarter, compared to an income tax expense of $18.9 million in the prior year period.\nFourth quarter net income attributable to the Company totaled $69.3 million, compared to net income of $21.2 million in the same period of 2016. The result largely reflects higher year-over-year operating results, which included $35.6 million from the Company’s re-development initiative compared with $4.6 million in the prior-year quarter.\nThe Company reported earnings per share of $0.33 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to earnings per share of $0.10 in the previous corresponding period. Total weighted average shares for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 211,072,508, as compared to 210,711,212 in the prior year quarter.\nAnalysis by Division :\nBrazil Division\nFigure 3. Brazil Division: Key Financial Results\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as noted)\n4Q16\n(a)\nCurrency\nTranslation\n(b)\nConstant\nCurrency\nGrowth\n(c)\n4Q17\n(a+b+c)\n% As\nReported\n% Constant\nCurrency\nTotal Restaurants (Units) 902 929 3.0% Total Revenues 378.2 5.7 19.3 403.2 6.6% 5.1% Systemwide Comparable Sales 6.7% Adjusted EBITDA 63.1 1.2 13.9 78.3 24.0% 22.1% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 16.7% 19.4% Brazil’s as reported revenues increased by 6.6%, supported by constant currency growth and a 1.4% year-over-year average appreciation of the Brazilian real. Excluding currency translation, constant currency revenues grew 5.1% year-over-year, which reflected the impact of the refranchising of certain company-operated restaurants during the last twelve months. An increased number of franchised restaurants reduces the Company’s total revenue comparisons, as company-operated restaurant sales are replaced by rental income received from the Company’s franchisees. In the quarter, total systemwide sales grew 9.2% in constant currency, while systemwide comparable sales rose 6.7%. A favorable shift in mix and the fourth consecutive quarter of positive restaurant traffic drove these results.\nMarketing activities in the quarter, which were designed to stimulate top-line growth without sacrificing gross margins, included the launch of the Quattro Formaggi premium burger in the Signature Line and the introduction of co-branded products with Nutella, among others. Also in the quarter, the Company launched the McFlurry “KitKat White & Milk” in the Dessert category and included “Super Mario” and “Pokémon” in the Happy Meal.\nAs reported Adjusted EBITDA increased 24.0% year-over-year and 22.1% on a constant currency basis. The Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 270 basis points to 19.4%, mainly by capturing efficiencies in F&P costs and G&A expenses. The division also received Growth Support from McDonald’s Corporation and recorded a positive variance in Other Operating Income from higher re-franchising proceeds and net tax credits in the quarter. These results were partially offset by higher Royalty Fees, Payroll costs and Occupancy and Other expenses as a percentage of revenues.\nNOLAD\nFigure 4. NOLAD Division: Key Financial Results\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as noted)\n4Q16\n(a)\nCurrency\nTranslation\n(b)\nConstant\nCurrency\nGrowth\n(c)\n4Q17\n(a+b+c)\n% As\nReported\n% Constant\nCurrency\nTotal Restaurants (Units) 517 519 0.4% Total Revenues 95.8 1.1 7.3 104.1 8.7% 7.6% Systemwide Comparable Sales 7.2% Adjusted EBITDA 10.3 (0.2) 0.1 10.3 -0.4% 1.1% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 10.8% 9.9% NOLAD’s as reported revenues increased 8.7% year-over-year, supported by constant currency growth of 7.6% and a 4% year-over-year average appreciation of the Mexican peso. Systemwide comparable sales increased 7.2%, mainly driven by an increase in traffic across all of the division’s markets, combined with a favorable shift in mix. Notably, Mexico volumes were strong in the quarter, with the Company’s new affordability platform, its innovative marketing and digital initiatives as well as its focus on delivering a better guest experience driving the improved performance.\nMarketing activities in the quarter included a new phase of the affordability platform “McTrío 3x3” in Mexico and the launch of the “Para los Polleros” and “Quesolocura” with the double and triple cheeseburger. The dessert category performed well with the continuation of the McFlurry Hershey’s Mini Kisses. Also in the quarter, the Company included “Pokémon” in the Happy Meal.\nAs reported Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 0.4%, but increased by 1.1% on a constant currency basis. The Adjusted EBITDA margin contraction of 90 basis points to 9.9% in the fourth quarter was primarily the result of higher Royalty Fees.\nSLAD\nFigure 5.

Systemwide comparable sales increased 20.5%, driven by the combination of a favorable shift in mix and an increase in traffic.\nMarketing activities in the quarter included a refresh of the McCombo del Día campaign and the continuation of the Guacamole Burger in the Signature Line. Also in the quarter, the Company launched the “Papas para el Camino” campaign and the McFlurry KitKat in the dessert category. The Happy Meal performed well with “Furby” and “Super Mario” during the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 3.9% on an as reported basis and rose 12.1% in constant currency terms. The Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 70 basis points to 9.0%, mainly due to higher Royalty Fees, which were partially offset by the Growth Support received from McDonald’s Corporation.\nCaribbean Division\nFigure 6.

Systemwide comparable sales increased 261.4%, with inflation-driven average check growth more than offsetting a decrease in total traffic in the division.\nFourth quarter reported results in the division were significantly impacted by a much higher year-over-year inflation than devaluation rate in Venezuela. During the quarter, Venezuela accounted for nearly all the division’s negative currency translation and constant currency revenue growth.\nTraffic was impacted by the effect of the hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Importantly, the Company had sufficient insurance to cover the property damage and business interruption losses suffered from these natural disasters.\nMarketing activities in the quarter included the launch of the Pico de Gallo Guacamole premium burger in the Signature Line. Also in the quarter, the Company re-launched the “Lunes Pompiao” campaign, which surprises guests by including some of McDonald’s iconic offerings. The Company also introduced the McFlurry Galak and McFlurry Mama-ía in the dessert category, and included “Pokémon” in the Happy Meal.\nAs reported Adjusted EBITDA totaled $27.5 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $8.0 million in the prior year quarter. The Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from 7.2% to 19.2% year-over-year, mainly impacted by Venezuela’s reported results.\nCaribbean Division – excluding Venezuela\nFigure 7.

Constant currency revenue declined slightly versus the prior year quarter. Comparable sales decreased by 3.5% as growth in average check was more than offset by a decline in traffic, primarily in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands due to the effects of hurricanes Irma and Maria. Importantly, the Company had sufficient insurance to cover the property damage and business interruption losses suffered from these natural disasters.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $5.2 million, compared to $5.5 million in the same period of 2016. The Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 40 basis points to 5.4%, mainly driven by an increase in F&P costs and Royalty Fees, partially offset by lower Payroll costs, G&A and Occupancy and Other Operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues.\nNew Unit Development\nFigure 8.

Also during the period, the Company added 223 Dessert Centers, bringing the total to 2,877. McCafés totaled 316 as of December 31, 2017.\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow Highlights\nCash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments, were $328.1 million at December 31, 2017. The Company’s total financial debt (including derivative instruments) was $621.5 million. Net debt (Total Financial Debt minus Cash and cash equivalents) was $293.4 million and the Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.0x at December 31, 2017.\nFigure 9. Consolidated Financial Ratios\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except ratios)\nDecember 31 December 31 2017 2016 Cash & cash equivalents (i) 328,079 194,803 Total Financial Debt (ii) 621,460 610,170 Net Financial Debt (iii) 293,381 415,367 Total Financial Debt / LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio 2.0 2.6 Net Financial Debt / LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio 1.0 1.7 (i) Includes short-term investment. (ii)Total financial debt includes short-term debt, long-term debt and derivative instruments (including\nthe asset portion of derivatives amounting to $35.1 million and $nil million as a reduction of financial\ndebt as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively).\n(iii) Total financial debt less cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $107.7 million for the quarter, and cash used in financing activities amounted to $2.1 million. Cash used in net investing activities totaled $64.6 million, which included $21.8 million from asset monetization proceeds, less short-term investments of $19.6 million and total capital expenditures of $66.2 million.\nFull Year 2017\nFor the year 2017, the Company’s as reported revenues increased by 13.3% to $3,319.5 million. Constant currency growth of 22.5% was partially offset by negative foreign currency translation mainly from the significant year-over-year average devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and, to a lesser extent, depreciation of the Argentine peso.\nAs reported Adjusted EBITDA was $304.9 million, a 27.9% increase compared to 2016. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 79.3%. The reported Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 110 basis points to 9.2%, which is its highest level since 2011.\nNet interest expenses and losses from derivative instruments were $1.5 million and $4.0 million higher versus the prior year. The full year result also included a non-cash foreign exchange loss of $14.3 million as compared to a $32.4 million non-cash gain in 2016.\nThe Company reported an income tax expense of $53.3 million in 2017, down from $59.6 million in 2016.\nConsolidated net income amounted to $129.2 million, compared with net income of $78.8 million in 2016. The result reflects higher year-over-year operating results, which included $91.7 million from the Company’s re-development initiative in 2017 versus $52.9 million in 2016. This was partially offset by the mostly non-cash negative variances in its non-operating results.\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $255.2 million in 2017, and cash used in financing activities amounted to $3.4 million. Cash used in net investing activities totaled $124.5 million, which included $72.4 million from asset monetization proceeds, less short-term investments of $19.6 million and total capital expenditures of $174.8 million.\nExcluding Venezuela\nExcluding the Venezuelan operation, the Company’s as reported revenues increased by 11.9%, and 10.2% on a constant currency basis. As reported Adjusted EBITDA rose by 18.6%, and by 13.5%, on a constant currency basis. The reported Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 50 basis points to 8.8%, mainly driven by efficiencies captured in F&P costs.\nConsolidated as reported net income was $131.3 million, up 44.2% from $91.1 million last year.\nQuarter Highlights & Recent Developments\nRe-Development Initiative\nSince the Company announced its re-development initiative in March 2015 and through December 31, 2017, it has received cumulative cash proceeds of $167.2 million, from the re-development of certain properties primarily in Mexico.\nVenezuela Devaluation\nDuring February 2018, the Venezuelan government announced the unification of the former exchange rate systems, DIPRO and DICOM II, into a sole foreign exchange mechanism called DICOM. The unified system operates through an auction mechanism similar to the former DICOM II. The first auction was published on February 5, 2018, with an exchange rate of approximately 25,000 VEF per US dollar from 3,345 VEF per US dollar previously.\nAs of the date of this release, with the most recent auction (on March 19, 2018), the exchange rate was approximately 45,000 VEF per US dollar. These recent devaluations generated a significant non-cash negative accounting impact, which will be reflected in the Company’s first quarter of 2018 consolidated results. For more details on the devaluation of the VEF, please refer to the Company’s Financial Statements (6-K) filed today with the S.E.C.\nGiven the volatile nature of the situation in Venezuela, the Company’s reported results will likely continue to reflect significant non-cash accounting impacts from operations in that market. Thus, the discussion of the Company’s performance will also continue to focus on consolidated results excluding Venezuela.\nInvestor Day\nThe Company will host its Investor Day on Friday, March 23, 2018 in New York, NY. This event, held for analysts and institutional investors, will feature presentations by Woods Staton (Executive Chairman), Sergio Alonso (Chief Executive Officer), Marcelo Rabach (Chief Operating Officer), Mariano Tannenbaum (Chief Financial Officer), Dan Gertsacov (Chief Marketing and Digital Officer), and Sebastian Magnasco (VP of Development). Also in attendance will be Paulo Camargo (President of the Brazil Division) and Francisco Staton (Managing Director in Colombia). The team will provide an overview of the Company’s strategic positioning, and will discuss trends, growth opportunities and its long-term market outlook.\n2018 Annual Guidance\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects to open between 65 and 70 new restaurants. The Company expects total capital expenditures to be between $200 and $230 million.\n2017 to 2019 Cumulative Guidance\nAt the beginning of 2017, the Company committed for the cumulative three-year period from 2017 to 2019, to open at least 180 new restaurants, reinvest at least $292 million in its existing restaurants and invest at least $500 million in total capital expenditures.\nFor the same three-year period, the Company now expects to open at least 200 new restaurants, reinvest at least $390 million in its existing restaurants and invest at least $660 million in total capital expenditures.\n2018 Dividend\nThe Company’s Management recommended and, on March 20, 2018, the Board of Directors of Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. approved the resumption of dividend payments. For 2018, the Company will pay a dividend of $0.10 per share to all Class A and Class B shareholders of the Company in two equal installments of $0.05 per share on April 5, 2018 and October 5, 2018. The dividend will be paid to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2018 and October 2, 2018, respectively.\nDefinitions :\nSystemwide comparable sales growth: refers to the change, measured in constant currency, in our Company-operated and franchised restaurant sales in one period from a comparable period for restaurants that have been open for thirteen months or longer. While sales by our franchisees are not recorded as revenues by us, we believe the information is important in understanding our financial performance because these sales are the basis on which we calculate and record franchised revenues, and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base.\nConstant currency basis: refers to amounts calculated using the same exchange rate over the periods under comparison to remove the effects of currency fluctuations from this trend analysis. To better discern underlying business trends, this release uses non-GAAP financial measures that segregate year-over-year growth into two categories: (i) currency translation, (ii) constant currency growth. (i) Currency translation reflects the impact on growth of the appreciation or depreciation of the local currencies in which we conduct our business against the US dollar (the currency in which our financial statements are prepared). (ii) Constant currency growth reflects the underlying growth of the business excluding the effect from currency translation.\nAdjusted EBITDA: In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with the general accepted accounting principles (GAAP), within this press release and the accompanying tables, we use a non-GAAP financial measure titled ‘Adjusted EBITDA’. We use Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as our operating income plus depreciation and amortization plus/minus the following losses/gains included within other operating income (expenses), net, and within general and administrative expenses in our statement of income: gains from sale or insurance recovery of property and equipment; write-offs and related contingencies of property and equipment; impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill; reorganization and optimization plan expenses; and incremental compensation related to the modification of our 2008 long-term incentive plan, and stock-based compensation in connection with the Company’s initial public listing.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations such as capital structures (affecting net interest expense and other financial charges), taxation (affecting income tax expense) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense), which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Figure 10 of this earnings release include a reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA. For more information, please see Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in Note 9 of our quarterly financial statements (6-K Form) filed today with the S.E.C.\nAbout Arcos Dorados\nArcos Dorados is the world’s largest independent McDonald’s franchisee in terms of systemwide sales and number of restaurants, operating the largest quick service restaurant chain in Latin America and the Caribbean.
