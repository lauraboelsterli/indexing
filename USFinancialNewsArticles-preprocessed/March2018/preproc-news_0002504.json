A cold snap and widespread snow has led to a sharp increase in gas demand which is used to heat as much as 80 percent of Britain’s homes. “A Gas deficit warning is not triggered because the country is short of gas, but is one of the short-term measures that the National Grid can take to make sure supply meets demand,” a spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said in an email.
