It recently announced it expects to open 1,000 new locations and distribution hubs, adding new positions that will grow its staff by about 9%.\nMore from USA Today: \nU.S. retail sector's hurting? Dollar General plans expansion with 400 new jobs\nAttention, working moms: These are the 100 best companies to work for\nWalmart heiress Alice Walton retakes top 'Forbes' spot as world's richest woman \nEmployers have begun increasing employee benefits as the nation's unemployment rate has continued to decline. Earlier this year, Walmart announced its own improved benefits, which took effect last month, giving full-time hourly U.S. employees 10 weeks of paid maternity leave and six weeks of paid parental leave. Salaried employees will also receive six weeks of paid parental leave.\nHurricanes Harvey and Irma drove more customers to its stores, helping boost quarterly sales past expectations. Fred Katayama reports. Video provided by Reuters Newslook\nThe nation's largest private employer also began giving adoption benefits with full-time hourly and salaried workers eligible for up to $5,000 per adoption.\nStill, millions of American workers do not get time off following the birth or adoption of a child, according to a group called PL+US, which stands for Paid Leave for the United States, a non-profit group advocating for paid family leave. One in four new moms must go back to work 10 days after giving birth, the group says.\nDollar General's move reflects its willingness to \"invest in its people as a competitive advantage,\" said CEO Todd Vasos in a statement issued with the benefits announcement. \"The paid parental leave and adoption assistance benefits will support our employees and their families with financial assistance during the exciting time of welcoming a child.\"\nWhile much of the retail industry has been in a quagmire, Dollar General has been in the process of expanding over the last two years, growing to more than 14,300 stores in 44 states. The retailer has also improved salaries and training for store managers.\n\nDollar General shares have fallen about 7% over the last 30 days to $89.39, but have risen 22% over the past year.",
