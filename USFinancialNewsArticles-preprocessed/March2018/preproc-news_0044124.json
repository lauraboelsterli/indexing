Mitchell had two hoops, including his 3-pointer, as the Jazz used the 18-3 burst to build a commanding 71-50 advantage in the fourth minute of the period.\nMitchell finished with a game-high 21 points for Utah, which was drubbed 126-101 in its previous trip to Oakland in December. The rookie hit four of the Jazz’s 12 3-pointers.\nRudy Gobert had a 17-point, 15-rebound double-double for the Jazz, while Jae Crowder and Ingles added 14 points apiece, Dante Exum 13, Rubio 11 and Derrick Favors 10.\nQuinn Cook had 17 points and eight assists to lead the Warriors, who were playing without their four All-Stars for the first time this season. Andre Iguodala added 12 points off the bench, hitting four of his five 3-point attempts.\nThe Jazz outshot the Warriors 48.3 percent to 41.8 percent and outscored the defending champs 36-18 on 3-pointers.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
