    "text": "PARSIPPANY, N.J., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acrow Bridge , a leading international bridge engineering and supply company, today announced the promotion of Eugene Sobecki, currently National Sales Manager, to the newly created position of Director – National Sales and Military Business Development. In this role, Sobecki will continue to manage all domestic sales through Acrow’s six regional locations in the U.S. while adding overall responsibility for the expansion of Acrow’s military business. He is based in Acrow’s Parsippany, New Jersey headquarters and reports to Acrow President Mark E. Joosten.\nAcrow will continue to service the needs of its non-U.S. military customers outside of North America through its Acrow International operations under the leadership of Paul Sullivan, Senior Vice President – International, with support from the military business development team.\nAcrow Bridge has had a long-standing partnership with the U.S. Army, providing bridges used during deployment to bridge gaps for supply runs and other permanent route access needs. In addition to ongoing deployment needs, the U.S. Army has partnered with Acrow as part of its emergency response programs around the world. Recent collaborations have included Acrow’s supply of a 240-meter Wet Gap Bridge as well as 80 and 90 meter clear span bridges to support the CJTF Inherent Resolve military action in Iraq.\n“Eugene has done a wonderful job for Acrow in expanding our U.S. business over the past 17 years,” said Bill Killeen, Acrow CEO. “I have abundant confidence that he will bring his talents to bear in developing and expanding Acrow’s military business and taking the best of care of our customers.”\nAdded Mark Joosten, President, Acrow Corporation of America, “The unique features of our 700XS bridge system have made it a standard Line of Communication Bridge for logistical support by the U.S. military and military organizations around the world. Eugene’s extensive experience with Acrow products as well as civilian and military customers makes him a great fit for our further expansion in this important market sector.”\n“It is a distinct honor to lead the expansion of Acrow’s work with our U.S. military customers,” said Sobecki. “In addition to ongoing deployment needs, Acrow’s modular steel structures are ideal for use in responding quickly to emergencies, including natural disasters such as landslides, avalanches, earthquakes and floods. Our modular steel bridges are designed in accordance with military standards, are capable of supporting incredibly heavy military trucks and tanks under a variety of conditions, and provide an ideal solution to time-sensitive infrastructure needs as the components can be easily transported, assembled, and reused wherever they are needed.”\nSobecki received a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Science in Education from Syracuse University. He began his career in the piling industry working for the North American marketing arm of ARBED SA of Luxembourg. Subsequent positions were with Syro Steel and Cassteel USA. He joined Acrow Bridge in 2001 as National Sales Manager.\nAbout Acrow Bridge\nAcrow Bridge has been serving the transportation and construction industries for more than 60 years with a full line of modular steel bridging solutions for vehicle, rail, military and pedestrian use. Acrow’s extensive international presence includes its leadership in the development and implementation of bridge infrastructure projects in over 80 countries, covering Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and the Middle East.
