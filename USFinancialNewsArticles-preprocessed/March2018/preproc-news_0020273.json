    "text": "  4:15 p.m. ET Share \nBump stocks banned in legislation Reuters Florida Gov. Rick Scott addresses President Donald Trump during a Feb. 26 discussion about school shootings with governors from around the country. \nBy Arian Campo-Flores \nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott on Friday signed into law a bill that includes the first significant gun restrictions in the firearm-friendly state in decades, nearly a month after the deadly school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. \nJoined in Tallahassee by family members of the 17 people killed in the Feb. 14 massacre, Scott said he weighed three factors in analyzing the legislation: whether it would improve school safety, provide more funding for mental-health treatment and keep guns away from people who shouldn’t have them. \n“The answer to all three is yes,” he said. “That is why I’m signing the legislation today.” \nDon’t miss: Trump at White House meeting: ‘I like taking the guns early’ and ‘go through due process later \nThe measure contains a mix of provisions that pleased no constituency entirely, and liberals and conservatives criticized different elements. Still, the families of those killed had pleaded with lawmakers and the governor to approve the bill as a way to take steps toward improving school security. \nEarlier this week, both chambers of the legislature passed the measure with bipartisan backing, though support came mostly from Republicans. \nSee: Citing gun industry, BlackRock pledges to offer products aligned with investor values \nThe bill increases the minimum age to buy a firearm to 21, from 18, with some exceptions, and imposes a three-day waiting period before a buyer can get a gun. It bans the sale of bump stocks — devices that enable semiautomatic rifles to operate like fully automatic ones. And it creates a new system for law-enforcement officers to ask a court to temporarily bar people deemed a risk from having firearms.",
