U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire talk as they gather for the official photo at the G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers in Buenos Aires, Argentina, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci In a statement issued at the end of a G20 meeting fraught with worries about U.S.   steel   and potential trade sanctions on China, Lagarde said she emphasized that it was an opportune time for countries to implement economic reforms “to make growth more solid, sustainable, balanced and inclusive.” “I joined others in reiterating that we should avoid the temptation of inward-looking policies and, rather, work together to reduce trade barriers and resolve trade disagreements without resorting to exceptional measures,” Lagarde added.
