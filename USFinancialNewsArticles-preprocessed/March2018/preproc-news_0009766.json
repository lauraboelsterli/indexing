    "text": "PARIS, March 5 (Reuters) - Airbus has set a divisional target of tripling the services revenues generated by its main commercial aircraft business to $10 billion a year by 2025, industry sources said.\nThe goal is part of a set of objectives which also focus on 80 percent on-time deliveries and limiting the number of aircraft quality problems, they said, citing internal postings.\nLike rival Boeing, Airbus aims to increase the amount of revenue it gains from services rather than manufacturing, in a bid to emulate the wider margins of third parties who traditionally control the market for repairs and services.\nHowever it has so far given little detailed guidance on the targets by business activity.\nAn Airbus spokesman confirmed the $10 billion target.
