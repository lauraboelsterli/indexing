    "text": "Fourth Quarter Highlights\nVolume of 127.7 million pounds a 6% year-over-year increase; A $7.3 million charge related to tax reform; Net income decreased 30% to $5.4 million and diluted earnings per common share decreased 31% to $0.24; Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $29.2 million year-over-year; Adjusted diluted earnings per common share of $0.29 versus $0.46 in the prior year period; and On November 1, 2017, acquired the Unimet Metal Supply, Inc. (“Alumet”) business.\nFull Year Highlights\nVolume of 507.3 million pounds, a decrease of 3% year-over-year; A $7.3 million charge related to tax reform; A $7.4 million recovery of insurance proceeds related to the prior year’s production outage; Net income increased 58% to $50.9 million and diluted earnings per common share increased by 54% to $2.30; Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $130.3 million; Adjusted diluted earnings per common share of $2.45 versus $2.36 in the prior year; and The Company is providing 2018 full-year guidance.\nSCHAUMBURG, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BRSS) (“GBC” or the “Company”) today announced the results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Operating Results\nGBC volumes for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 5.8% to 127.7 million pounds as compared to 120.7 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in volumes includes 8.3 million pounds of incremental volume from the Alumet acquisition. Chase Brass grew volumes in the electronics / electrical components and the industrial machinery and equipment markets, and experienced a slight decrease in demand in the building and housing market. Olin Brass volumes decreased as strong coinage volumes were more than offset by the continued de-stocking in the munitions segment.\n“We were in a challenging volume environment in 2017, and we finished the year stronger than anticipated. Chase Brass and Olin Brass improved profitability in the fourth quarter, and we are pleased with the progress on A.J. Oster’s integration of its Alumet acquisition. Overall, we are encouraged by the improvements in our businesses and will continue to drive profitable growth while achieving an appropriate return on our assets,” said John Wasz, GBC’s President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Wasz concluded, “In 2018, we will grow profitably, integrate Alumet, reduce costs, and price our products with full consideration for the cost and complexity required to produce them. We continue to strengthen our financial position and will capitalize on additional acquisition opportunities when appropriate.”\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $411.5 million from $322.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the metal cost recovery component stemming from increased metal prices. Adjusted sales, our non-GAAP financial measure that reflects the value added premium over metal replacement cost recovery, increased by 7.4% to $136.6 million from $127.2 million in 2016, primarily due to increased selling prices. A reconciliation of net sales to adjusted sales is provided later in this press release.\nNet income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $7.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the same period of 2016. The decrease was due to an increase in tax expense as a result of tax reform enacted in December 2017, partially offset by favorable changes in gross profit and interest expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA, our non-GAAP measure of profitability, was $29.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 20.2% compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to favorable selling prices, increased profitability at Olin Brass, and reduced compensation costs, mostly related to incentive compensation. A reconciliation of net income attributable to GBC to adjusted EBITDA is provided later in this press release.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share, another non-GAAP measure, was $0.29 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.46 in the prior year. A reconciliation of diluted net income attributable to GBC per common share to adjusted diluted earnings per common share is provided later in this press release.\nFull Year Operating Results\nFull-year volumes decreased by 2.6% to 507.3 million pounds compared to 520.8 million pounds in 2016, and include 8.3 million pounds related to Alumet. Volumes decreased as a result of lower demand in the munitions market, partially offset by higher demand in the reroll market.\nNet sales for the full year increased to $1.6 billion from $1.3 billion in 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the metal cost recovery component stemming from increased metal prices and greater sales of unprocessed metals. On the other hand, adjusted sales decreased by 1.2% to $535.5 million from $542.2 million in 2016, due to the aforementioned lower munitions market volume. A reconciliation of net sales to adjusted sales is provided later in this press release.\nNet income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. for the full year was $50.9 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared to $32.2 million, or $1.49 per diluted share, for 2016. The increase was mainly due to the combination of the following: a decrease in refinancing costs and interest expense, $7.4 million of income resulting from the recovery of insurance proceeds, the impact of the Olin Brass production outage on the prior year results, and an increase in the effective tax rate as a result of tax reform.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $130.3 million for the full year, an increase of 10.0% as compared to 2016. The increase was the result of $7.4 million of income resulting from an insurance recovery and the absence of costs related to the Olin Brass 2016 production outage. Partially offsetting these increases in 2017 were unusual costs related to our transition to an HSA medical plan and decreased performance within A.J. Oster stemming from its ERP implementation. The negative effect of reduced volumes was partially offset by favorable customer pricing and reduced employee and related compensation costs, mostly related to incentive compensation. A reconciliation of net income attributable to GBC to adjusted EBITDA is provided later in this press release.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share was $2.45 for the full year as compared to $2.36 in 2016, and increased for similar reasons as net income. A reconciliation of diluted net income attributable to GBC per common share to adjusted diluted earnings per common share is provided later in this press release.\nCash Flow and Leverage\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we used $29.9 million of cash from the combination of operating and investing activities largely due to increased investments in working capital, the $40.0 million expended to acquire Alumet, and increased cash earnings. During the full year of 2017, we used $15.4 million of cash for the combination of operating and investing activities, driven by the Alumet acquisition and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash earnings.\nWe ended the year with cash of $59.0 million, $316.0 million outstanding under our term loan facility and $195.4 million available under our asset based revolving loan facility.\n2018 Guidance\nFor the full-year 2018, GBC expects:\nShipment volumes to range from 570 million pounds to 610 million pounds; and Adjusted EBITDA to range from $127 million to $137 million.\nDue to the forward looking nature of adjusted EBITDA guidance, GBC is unable to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management is unable to project certain reconciling items, in particular unrealized gains / losses on derivative contracts, LIFO liquidation gains / losses and lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory, for future periods due to market volatility.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a teleconference and webcast at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) on Friday, March 2, 2018 to review the results.

Our US GAAP-based measures can be found in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this press release.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nNet income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. is the most directly comparable US GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc., plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) adjusted to exclude the following:\nunrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in support of our balanced book approach; unrealized gains and losses associated with derivative contracts related to energy and utility costs; impact associated with lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory; gains and losses due to the depletion of a LIFO layer of metal inventory; share-based compensation expense; refinancing costs; restructuring and other business transformation charges; inventory step-up costs related to acquisition accounting; specified legal and professional expenses; and certain other items.\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA represents a meaningful presentation of the financial performance of our core operations, because it provides period-to-period comparisons that are more consistent and more easily understood. We also believe it is an important supplemental measure that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA is the key metric used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the segment performance in a way that we believe reflects our core operating performance, and in turn, incentivizes members of management and certain employees. For example, we use adjusted EBITDA per pound in order to measure the effectiveness of the balanced book approach in reducing the financial impact of metal price volatility on earnings and operating margins, and to measure the effectiveness of our business transformation initiatives in improving earnings and operating margins.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by using adjusted EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with US GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such US GAAP measurements include operating income and net income.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share\nDiluted net income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. per common share is the most directly comparable US GAAP measure to adjusted diluted earnings per common share. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share is defined as diluted net income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. per common share adjusted to remove the per share impact of the add backs to EBITDA in calculating adjusted EBITDA.\nWe believe adjusted diluted earnings per common share represents a meaningful presentation of the financial performance of our consolidated results because it provides period-to-period comparisons that are more consistent, and more easily understood, and thus is more useful to and is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is a key metric used to evaluate our performance, and in turn, incentivize members of management and certain employees.\nAdjusted sales\nNet sales is the most directly comparable US GAAP measure to adjusted sales, which represents the value-added premium we earn over our conversion and fabrication costs. Adjusted sales is defined as net sales less the metal cost recovery component of products sold. We use adjusted sales on a consolidated basis to monitor the revenues that are generated from our value-added conversion and fabrication processes excluding the effects of fluctuations in metal costs. We believe that adjusted sales supplements our US GAAP results because it provides a more complete understanding of the results of our business, and we believe it is useful to our investors and other parties for these same reasons.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” that involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “projects,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or similar expressions that relate to our strategy, plans or intentions. All statements the Company makes relating to its estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or to its expectations regarding future industry trends are forward-looking statements. In addition, the Company, through its senior management, from time to time makes or may make forward-looking public statements concerning its expected future operations and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may change at any time, and, therefore, the Company’s actual results may differ materially from those that it expected. The Company derives many of its forward-looking statements from its operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect the Company’s actual results. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to various risks and uncertainties, including: the impact of our indebtedness; the effect of our ability to borrow money; our ability to implement our business strategies, including acquisition activities; our ability to continue implementing our balanced book approach to substantially reduce the impact of fluctuations in metal prices on our earnings and operating margins; shrinkage from processing operations and metal price fluctuations, particularly copper; the condition of various markets in which our customers operate, including the housing and commercial construction industries; our ability to maintain business relationships with our customers on favorable terms; the impact of a loss in customer volume or demand or a shift by customers of their manufacturing or sourcing offshore; our ability to compete effectively with existing and new competitors; the effects of industry consolidation or competition in our business lines; operational factors affecting the ongoing commercial operations of our facilities, including technology failures, regulatory approvals, permit issues, unscheduled blackouts, outages or repairs or unanticipated changes in energy costs; supply, demand, prices and other market conditions for our products; our ability to accommodate increases in production to meet demand for our products; government regulations relating to our products and services, including proposed EPA regulations regarding the registration and marketing of bactericidal copper products; our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; our ability to realize the planned cost savings and efficiency gains as part of our various initiatives; workplace safety issues; our ability to retain key employees; adverse developments in our relationship with our employees or the future terms of our collective bargaining agreements; rising employee medical costs; our ability to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, to protect the validity, enforceability or scope of our intellectual property rights and manage litigation regarding our intellectual property rights; fluctuations in interest rates; and restrictive covenants in our indebtedness that may adversely affect our operational flexibility.\nMore detailed information about these and other risks and uncertainties are contained in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time, including Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, copies of which may be obtained by visiting the Company’s Investor Relations website at http://ir.gbcholdings.com or the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . All forward-looking information in this press release is expressly qualified in its entirety by these cautionary statements. All forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based upon information available to the Company on the date of this press release.\nIn addition, the matters referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release may not in fact occur. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on those statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301006550/en/\nGlobal Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc.\nChristopher J.
