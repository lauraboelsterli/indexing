Raum joined eMoney in 2016 and has since developed its employee success strategy, talent management practices and all human resource functions. Both Liberi and Raum were named heads of their respective departments earlier this year.\nMcKenna brings 30 years of experience in SaaS marketing for both global market leaders and smaller, rapid growth businesses to her new role at eMoney. She also has an extensive background in leading teams and helping companies grow and scale. Most recently, she held senior marketing positions at Billtrust, Revitas (sold to Model N), Princeton Softech (sold to IBM) and Deloitte Consulting.\nOver the past three years, eMoney has nearly doubled in size and continues to accomplish various milestones that reflect its rapid growth. McKenna is one of 40 new hires in 2018, bringing the eMoney team to more than 600 employees in three locations. Additionally, in January, the eMoney platform surpassed 50,000 users, which encompass the RIA, firm and enterprise markets.\n“eMoney’s mission has always been to provide technology that transforms the wealth management experience. We remain committed to this mission by offering our clients the industry’s best technology solutions and services, along with hiring and developing the talent behind them,” O’Brien said.\nIn conjunction with the additions of Liberi, Raum and McKenna, Frank Tropiano, a member of eMoney’s leadership team and head of product management since 2002, assumed a new role as head of client services. He now leads 150 employees responsible for providing customer service, training and implementation support to eMoney’s diverse user base.\n“Frank’s extensive background leading our product organization combined with our award-winning client services team will help maximize our clients’ experience and understanding of the eMoney platform to drive business growth,” said O’Brien.\neMoney’s full leadership team is listed below.
