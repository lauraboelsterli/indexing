His 82 points lead Pittsburgh’s Evgeni Malkin by six. Kucherov has led the league in scoring continuously since Dec. 12.\nNewly acquired forward J.T. Miller played in his first game for the Lightning, while defenseman Ryan McDonagh, who is injured but skated in practice, did not. McDonagh has an upper-body injury and has missed the past 10 games. Both were dealt from the New York Rangers to Tampa Bay on Monday before the league’s trade deadline.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
