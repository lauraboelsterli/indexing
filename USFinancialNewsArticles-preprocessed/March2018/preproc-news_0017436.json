He most recently served as COO and has more than 20 years of operations management experience. Prior to Xtera, Keith held senior positions at BAE systems, ASN and STC.\n“With the increasing growth in demand, new entrants to the market, and an overall desire for commercial and technical change, the industry is shifting and Xtera’s evolution serves to meet the future needs of its customers,” says Keith. “I am delighted to take up the position of CEO and to be joined by Leigh at such an important time for the business. Xtera has always been a company that embraces change and we look forward to working together with all our partners to ensure that we continue to offer the most advanced solutions.”\nLeigh joins Xtera after an extensive career with Alcatel Submarine Networks where more recently he served as the COO and has been a leader in the subsea market for more than 25 years.
