The Raptors outscored the Nets 32-21 over the final 12 minutes.\nLowry was 5 of 6 from 3-point range to raise his season total to 215, breaking his own franchise record (212 in 2015-16). The triple-double was his third of the season and the 12th of his career.\nBrooklyn opened up a 78-67 lead in the third quarter after scoring eight straight points. Crabbe knocked down two 3-pointers during the surge.\nThe Nets led by as many as 14 later in the quarter and were up 89-76 before Toronto closed the gap with eight straight points. Caris LeVert hit a jumper with 1.3 seconds left to give Brooklyn a 91-84 advantage entering the final period.\nThe Raptors trailed by nine early in the fourth quarter before DeRozan scored nine points in less than three minutes to move Toronto within 95-94 with 8:29 to play.\nThe Raptors eventually moved ahead at 100-99 on two free throws by Lowry with 4:50 to play. The lead reached 110-103 on Lowry’s 3-pointer with 1:36 left.\nCrabbe and Carroll knocked down 3-pointers over the ensuing 62 seconds to bring Brooklyn within 112-109.\nDeRozan drained two free throws to make it a five-point game with 30 seconds left as Toronto closed it out.\nThe Nets used a 9-2 run late in the first half to open up a seven-point lead and held a 64-59 lead at the break.\nValanciunas scored 15 first-half points for the Raptors.\nPlay was briefly halted with 8:13 remaining in the third quarter to make sure a rim was level.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
