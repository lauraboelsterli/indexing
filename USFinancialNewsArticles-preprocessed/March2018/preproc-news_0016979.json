    "text": "Daniel Leal-Olivas | AFP | Getty Images A customer walks past a Toys 'R' Us store with 'closing down sale' signs. \nToys R Us may soon liquidate its U.S. operations, sources told CNBC. \nThe source cautioned, however, that the situation remains fluid. \nIn February, CNBC reported that the retailer was at risk of breaching the covenant on a $3.1 billion loan after a disappointing holiday season. \nWhile a terrible holiday season hurt their chances of recovery, some of the lenders have been aggressive in pushing for liquidation. \nToys R Us had already begun liquidation sales ahead of planned store closures . \nThe toy retailer filed for bankruptcy in September as it struggled with its $4.9 billion in debt. Toys R Us thought that bankruptcy protection would provide the financial flexibility to reduce that debt. \nBloomberg first reported the news. \nThis story is developing. Please check back for updates.",
