    "text": "Burbank, Calif., March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Imaging3, Inc. (OTCQB:IGNG), a development stage company targeting disruptive technologies in the medical imaging industry, is pleased to announce that its board of directors has approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its current outstanding shares of common stock. The pre-split total shares of common stock outstanding was 319,093,077 and post-split total shares of common stock outstanding will be 15,954,907 (subject to adjustment for settlement of fractional shares, which will be rounded up to the nearest whole share).\nOn March 14, 2018, Imaging3, Inc. received notice from FINRA/OTC Corporate Actions that the reverse stock split will take effect at the open of business on March 16, 2018. A \"D\" will be placed on the Imaging3, Inc. ticker symbol, IGNG, for 20 business days to alert the public of the split.\nAbout Imaging3 Inc.\nImaging3, Inc., founded in 1993, has developed a patented medical imaging technology, called the Dominion SmartScan™, which can produce real-time 3D x-ray images. The SmartScan technology has the potential to allow healthcare professionals to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures more quickly and accurately, resulting in higher throughput for the clinicians and fewer safety risks for the patient. In addition, Imaging3’s technology exposes patients to significantly less harmful radiation than current imaging technologies such as CT scans, which the company believes will allow scans to be used in many settings where there are concerns about radiation exposure. The technology also allows for greater portability, easier installation, and a significantly reduced cost burden for the healthcare system overall. Imaging3 is planning to submit a 510K application to the FDA during 2018 in order to gain marketing authorization for the SmartScan technology.\nVisit the company’s website at http://www.imaging3.com for detailed information about the company’s technology.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nImaging3 cautions you that any statement included in this press release that is not a description of historical facts is a forward-looking statement.

In addition, there are risks and uncertainties related to economic recession or terrorist actions, competition from much larger imaging companies, technological obsolescence, unexpected costs and delays, potential product liability claims, and many other factors. More detailed information about Imaging3 and the risk factors that may affect the realization of forward-looking statements is set forth in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
