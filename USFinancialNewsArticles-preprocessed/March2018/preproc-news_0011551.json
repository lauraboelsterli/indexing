    "text": "New Chief Commercial Officer brings broad experience in regenerative medicine\nMIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TissueTech Inc. announced today it has named Adrian Roji Chief Commercial Officer to lead the company’s aggressive commercial expansion in the rapidly growing amniotic membrane market. Mr. Roji has built a reputation managing multifaceted businesses, and as an expert on strategic marketing, sales, health economics and driving innovation through the partnership of research and development, operations and business development.\n“Adrian’s alignment on strong execution, global perspective, and focus on accountability and responsibility will accelerate our leadership in developing innovative clinical applications of umbilical cord and amniotic membrane in regenerative medicine,” said Amy Tseng, Chief Executive Officer of TissueTech. “He joins TissueTech as we enter a new stage of our growth, further focusing on the strengths of our organization and the scope of our business.”\nMr. Roji’s career includes responsibility for the international strategic marketing of Allergan Corporation’s regenerative medicine, plastics surgery and body contouring business - a continuation of his leadership of that endeavor at LifeCell Corporation before acquisition by Allergan. Prior to that he was at Johnson & Johnson for 20 years with both global and US commercial responsibilities within its family of companies, including US Women’s Health and Urology, Vistakon, Ethicon, Ethicon-Endosurgery and Cordis among others.\n“TissueTech has pioneered the clinical application of human umbilical cord and amniotic membrane in the emerging regenerative medicine market,” Roji said. “This team not only has the deepest understanding of the science, but has led in partnership with physicians that have driven the application of this technology across numerous specialties. I am eager to see us continue to develop that potential through a powerful single organization that provides the physician-led, evidence-based solutions that best serve our patients.”\nAbout TissueTech, Inc.\nTissueTech, Inc., the parent company of Amniox Medical, Inc. and Bio-Tissue, Inc., pioneered the development and clinical application of amniotic tissue-based products.
