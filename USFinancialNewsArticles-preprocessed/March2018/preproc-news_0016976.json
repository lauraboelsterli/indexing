The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important to help investors understand the Company's operating and financial performance, compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and assess the Company's core operating results, as they exclude certain expenses that are not expected to result in cash payments. The use of the above non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. Share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, non-cash gain or loss and income tax effects resulting from GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items have been and will continue to be incurred in the future and are not reflected in the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures, but should be considered in the overall evaluation of the Company's results. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of its share-based compensation expenses of the Company (net of the amount allocated to noncontrolling interests), amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, share-based compensation expenses included in share of results of equity investees, loss on conversion of Guazi Convertible Note, gain on deconsolidation and disposal of business and income tax effects of GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is set forth at the end of this release.\nConference Call\n58.com's management will host an earnings conference call on Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (9:00 p.m. Beijing / Hong Kong time on the same day).\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nInternational:\n+1-412-317-5225\nU.S. Toll Free:\n+1-866-235-9918\nHong Kong:\n800-905945\nMainland China:\n4001-201203\nPasscode:\nWUBA\nPlease dial in 15 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin and provide the passcode to join the call.\nA telephone replay of the call will be available after the conclusion of the conference call through 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time, March 15, 2018.

Unless otherwise specified, all translations of Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars amounts in this press release are made at RMB6.5342 to US$1.00, which was the U.S. dollars middle rate announced by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on December 29, 2017. On March 6, 2018, such exchange rate was RMB6.3386 to US$1.00. The percentages stated in this press release are calculated based on the Renminbi amounts.\n[2] Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations is defined as income/(loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions. See \"Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" at the end of this press release.\n[3] Non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to 58.com Inc. is defined as net income/(loss) attributable to 58.com Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses of the Company (net of the amount allocated to noncontrolling interests), amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, share-based compensation expenses included in share of results of equity investees, loss on conversion of Guazi Convertible Note, gain on deconsolidation and disposal of business and income tax effects of GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items. See \"Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" at the end of this press release.\n[4] Non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per ADS is defined as non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to 58.com Inc. divided by weighted average number of basic and diluted ADS.\n[5] In 2017, certain share-based awards with redemption features granted to our employees were expected to be settled in cash and were classified as liabilities. The share-based compensation expenses recognized for this type of awards amounted to RMB5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and RMB10.7 million in fiscal year 2017 were excluded from the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation accordingly.\n[6] This is to exclude the income tax benefits related to amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions calculated at PRC statutory income tax rate of 25% and income tax expense related to dispose of business. Other GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items have no income tax effect.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/58com-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2017-unaudited-financial-results-300610179.html\nSOURCE 58.com",
