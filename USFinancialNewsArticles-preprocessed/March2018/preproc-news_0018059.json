    "text": "The Trump administration is pressuring New York and New Jersey to boost their share of funding for a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River, furthering a standoff over the fate of a $12.7 billion project that Democratic and Republican officials say is critical to the region’s economy.\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao told a House committee on Tuesday that the states would need to put more “skin in the game” to pay for the Gateway program, which includes the tunnel.\n ",
