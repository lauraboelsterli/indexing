Ms. Parker joins the Company after serving as the head of creative strategy for Verizon’s Oath Studios.\nThe Madison Square Garden Company Names Victoria Parker Executive Vice President of MSG Productions\nAs executive vice president, Ms. Parker will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of MSG’s productions business. She will focus on strengthening and enhancing the beloved Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes, including building on last year’s successful integration of more immersive elements, which merged immersive technology and the Rockettes more than 90-year legacy. Ms. Parker will prioritize the strategic expansion of the legendary Rockettes brand, including driving the development of a streamlined Rockettes show, to not only showcase the dancers’ unparalleled talent, but also allow for a flexible production schedule and year-round promotion. Ms. Parker will also be responsible for the creation and implementation of new proprietary productions and events for MSG venues, including as part of the company’s venue expansion plans notably including the “MSG Sphere.”\nShe will manage all financial and operational matters; identify and build key strategic relationships and collaborate with MSG’s marketing and sales executives to ensure the successful execution of the company’s theatrical productions.\n“We are pleased that Victoria will be joining our management team, and bringing her considerable talent and leadership skills to help drive the growth of MSG Productions,” said Mr. Lustgarten. “Victoria brings an impressive career in live entertainment, as well as valuable experience with our brands, including the Rockettes. We are confident she will have an immediate impact on our operations, as well as our ambitious plans for growth.”\n“MSG is home to some of the most powerful and beloved brands in all of entertainment, and I’m deeply honored to be given this unique opportunity to build and grow such a valuable entity,” said Ms. Parker. “I have had the opportunity to work with many of the exceptional people at MSG Productions, and look forward to being a part of such a talented team at such an exciting and creative time.”\nMs. Parker joins MSG after serving as head of creative strategy for Verizon’s innovative Oath Studios, where she developed the go-to-market strategy for a ground-breaking mobile-only entertainment service. At Verizon, Ms. Parker utilized her deep relationships within the entertainment industry to drive content creation and programming for the new platform. Prior to Verizon, Ms. Parker spent 10 years at The Weinstein Company (TWC), where she served as vice president of corporate affairs and senior vice president of theatrical productions. In her role at TWC, Ms. Parker first worked with MSG as an executive producer on “12-12-12,” the highly successful Madison Square Garden benefit concert that raised more than $50 million for the victims of Hurricane Sandy.\nDuring her tenure, Ms. Parker also led the formation of Weinstein Live Entertainment, a brand focused on the creation of family-focused, live entertainment, which launched productions such as Finding Neverland ; the New York Spring Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes and various music videos, concept albums and documentaries.
