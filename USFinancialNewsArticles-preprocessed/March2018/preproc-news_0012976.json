European stocks as a whole recovered some of their early losses to trade down 0.1 percent.\n“The implication is that without the restraining influence of Cohn on Trump, the president will now have a free hand to press ahead with further tariffs and generally up the ante on trade,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital.\n“This in itself does not bode well for risk despite that small boost we saw on news that North Korea could consider de-nuking.”\nRISK AVERSION Cohn’s departure rippled through foreign exchange and commodity markets.\nThe U.S. dollar fell 0.4 percent against the Japanese yen — seen a safe-haven in times of uncertainty.\nThe dollar is just off a 14-month low against the yen hit on Friday.\n“The worst outcome for financial markets, in terms of potential to create volatility, would be a confirmation of rising trade friction and benign neglect of the dollar in the short term,” said analysts at ANZ.\nThe Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso both retreated by more than 0.5 percent against the dollar as Cohn’s departure was seen as raising risks that Washington could walk away from NAFTA negotiations.\nCommodities fell on worries that trade friction could slow global growth, with Brent crude futures giving up the previous day’s gains to drop 0.5 percent.\nCopper on the London Metal Exchange lost 1.2 percent, paring a 1.4 percent gain from the previous session.\nCurrencies of commodity producers South Africa and Russia were both down more than 0.5 percent against the dollar, with the rand under particular pressure on falling reserves and business confidence.\nEuropean government bonds rallied, with yields across the euro zone falling by 1-3 basis points, following similar strengthening in U.S. Treasuries overnight.
