Niki Lauda addresses a news conference presenting his new airline Laudamotion in Vienna, Austria March 16, 2018. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader After investing 50 million euros ($62 million) to buy Niki and spending more to relaunch operations from this month under the name Laudamotion, the former motor racing champion said: “You cannot expect to make money in the first year.” “But if you make it right, you should start earning money from the second year on,” Lauda told a news conference. Slideshow (3 Images) He said he planned to cooperate closely with Lufthansa’s ( LHAG.DE ) low cost unit Eurowings, but regulatory requirements were still discussed. He hopes for a solution within 10 days. ($1 = 0.8110 euros) (This version of the story corrects investment to 50 million euros, not 150 million euros, in paragraph 2) Reporting by Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Mark Potter",
