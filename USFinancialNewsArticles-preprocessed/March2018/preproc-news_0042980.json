    "text": "HAIFA, Israel, March 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:PSTI) (TASE:PSTI), a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products, announced today that Dr. Roger Jeffs has joined Pluristem’s strategic advisory board. Dr. Jeffs, a highly accomplished biopharma executive, will advise Pluristem on clinical and commercial strategies for the Company’s cell therapy programs.\nDr. Jeffs joined United Therapeutics Corporation during its start-up phase in 1998 as director of research, development, and medical and led the company as its President and CEO from 2001 to 2014 and President & co-CEO from 2015 to 2016. During his successful 18-year tenure at United Therapeutics, Dr. Jeffs helped lead the company’s initial public offering, oversaw the clinical development and regulatory approval of six products, and managed the commercial effort that lead to a significant increase in revenues. Prior to his time at United Therapeutics, Dr. Jeffs was previously at Amgen Inc. where he helped lead the clinical program for Neupogen. Dr. Jeffs holds an undergraduate degree in chemistry from Duke University and a Ph.D. in pharmacology from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. He served on the Board of Directors for United Therapeutics from 2001 to 2016, and currently serves on the Boards of five public companies. Dr. Jeffs is also the co-founder and co-owner of Bull City Select Investments.\nDr. Jeffs commented, “Pluristem’s placental cell therapies, currently being evaluated in multiple advanced clinical trials, could significantly advance regenerative medicine and make a change in the way patients are treated today, by delivering a safe and effective off-the-shelf cell therapy. The Company’s manufacturing assets are a key to its commercialization capabilities. I look forward to working with Pluristem’s management team to move the clinical programs forward towards marketing.”\n“Dr. Jeffs brings tremendous expertise and vision to Pluristem, from business aspects, to clinical development, marketing approval and commercialization. His work in developing Neupogen is directly relevant to our PLX-R18 clinical program in the treatment of bone marrow deficiencies,” stated Pluristem Chairman and Co-CEO Zami Aberman. “Pluristem is now forming a senior strategic advisory board in t preparing the Company toward expansion and commercialization. We are honored and pleased that Dr. Jeffs is joining us at this important time.”\nAbout Pluristem Therapeutics\nPluristem Therapeutics Inc. is a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products.

For example, Pluristem is using forward-looking statements when it discusses Pluristem’s clinical trials, that its placental cell therapies could significantly advance regenerative medicine and make a change in the way patients are treated, and when it discusses the potential safety and effectiveness of Pluristem’s cell therapy and potential expansion and commercialization. These forward-looking statements and their implications are based on the current expectations of the management of Pluristem only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: changes in technology and market requirements; Pluristem may encounter delays or obstacles in launching and/or successfully completing its clinical trials; Pluristem’s products may not be approved by regulatory agencies, Pluristem’s technology may not be validated as it progresses further and its methods may not be accepted by the scientific community; Pluristem may be unable to retain or attract key employees whose knowledge is essential to the development of its products; unforeseen scientific difficulties may develop with Pluristem’s process; Pluristem’s products may wind up being more expensive than it anticipates; results in the laboratory may not translate to equally good results in real clinical settings; results of preclinical studies may not correlate with the results of human clinical trials; Pluristem’s patents may not be sufficient; Pluristem’s products may harm recipients; changes in legislation may adversely impact Pluristem; inability to timely develop and introduce new technologies, products and applications; loss of market share and pressure on pricing resulting from competition, which could cause the actual results or performance of Pluristem to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise required by law, Pluristem undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
