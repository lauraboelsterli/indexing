Dallas shot 45 percent from the field and 35 percent from beyond the arc.\nWillie Cauley-Stein added 13 points, six rebounds and four steals, and Buddy Hield added 14 points off the bench for the Kings, who outrebounded the Mavericks 45-43.\nDallas stretched its lead to as much as 18 points in the fourth quarter, using a 9-0 run to create a huge cushion, before the Kings fought back late in the game.\nHield had seven points in a late 93-second spurt as Sacramento cut the deficit to five with 41.1 seconds left on a Hield layup. Harrison made a pair of free throws with 29 seconds left, Frank Mason III hit two from the line for the Kings, and Kyle Collinsworth added one more free throw for Dallas before Hield missed a 3-pointer with 10 seconds left and the Mavericks ran out the clock.\nDallas went ahead by five after the first period and went into halftime up 53-45 behind 16 first-half points from Barnes on 5-of-8 shooting. Smith had 15 points in the first half.\nKosta Koufos had 15 points and seven rebounds in 14 first-half minutes to lead the Kings, but he didn’t play after the break.\nSacramento remains home for two more games, Thursday against the Indiana Pacers and Saturday against the Golden State Warriors, before heading on the road for four games.\nDallas stays in California with a visit to Staples Center to meet the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday before returning home to face the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
