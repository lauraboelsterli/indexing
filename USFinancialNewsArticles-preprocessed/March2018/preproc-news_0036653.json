    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 8:37 AM / Updated 15 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Shares in Hammerson jump on takeover approach from Klepierre Reuters Staff (Adds context) By Alan Charlish March 19 (Reuters) - French shopping centre operator Klepierre proposed buying rival Hammerson in a deal valued at 4.88 billion pounds ($6.80 billion), sending the British company’s shares up 27 percent on Monday. The French company said it offered 615 pence per share, a premium of about 40.7 percent to Hammerson’s closing price on March 16. Hammerson shares traded 26.5 percent higher at 553 pence by 0827 GMT. Klepierre said the proposal was made on March 8 and that it was rejected by the Hammerson board in less than 24 hours. Shopping centres face fierce competition from online shopping giants such as Amazon, driving consolidation in the sector. In December Europe’s biggest property firm Unibail-Rodamco agreed to buy U.S. and UK mall operator Westfield Corp for $16 billion, while Hammerson agreed to buy smaller rival Intu Properties for about 3.4 billion pounds. Shares in Hammerson, which owns Birmingham’s Bullring shopping centre, had fallen 20 percent year to date before the offer as investors worried that the deal watered down its higher quality portfolio and raises its exposure to a difficult UK retail market. A successful bid for Hammerson from Klepierre would make the Intu Properties deal less likely to go through. “The share price move is indicating that there is a chance that some of the shareholders are very interested in that Klepierre potential merger,” said Peel Hunt analyst James Carswell. Shares in Klepierre were down 3.2 percent. The statement from Klepierre came after British newspaper The Times reported on Monday that Klepierre had made a 5 billion pound ($6.97 billion) takeover approach for Hammerson. When contacted by Reuters Hammerson did not immediately offer any comment but said they would make an announcement shortly.
