The move comes at a tipping point in the U.S. healthcare market as cost, complexity and consumer engagement come to the forefront—inspiring the changing landscape of industry players. AXA’s acquisition of Maestro Health and its all-in benefits platform, maestroEDGE™, supports AXA’s payer to partner strategy in line with its “Ambition 2020” corporate initiative.\nMaestro Health provides an all-in, technology-meets-service platform that is built to simplify, personalize and optimize how people shop, enroll and live with their benefits.
