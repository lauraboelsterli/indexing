Across all Canadian issues there were seven new 52-week highs and 14 new lows. * The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Enerplus Corp , which rose 5.7 percent. Westshore Terminals Investment was the biggest loser, with a 4.3 percent fall. * First Quantum was down 1.6 percent after Zambia’s tax agency on Tuesday slapped the company with $8.04 billion in unpaid import duties. * Among the most active Canadian stocks by volumes were First Quantum and Trican Well Services, up 4.1 percent to $3.33. * Volume on the TSX index was 41.56 million shares, while total volume on Wednesday was 61.21 million shares.
