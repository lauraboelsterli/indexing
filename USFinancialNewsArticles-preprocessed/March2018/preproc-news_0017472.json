    "text": "Anticipates Continued Sales and Earnings Growth in 2018\nFull Year:\n2017 Revenues increased $136 million to $1.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year Adjusted EPS was $3.23, up 7% compared to the prior year’s $3.01 GAAP EPS was $2.30, unfavorably impacted by the new U.S. Tax Act, compared to the prior year's $2.58 2018 EPS guidance of $3.55 to $3.75, reflecting 10% to 16% adjusted earnings growth\nFourth Quarter:\nRevenues increased $59 million to $366 million, up 19% year-over-year Adjusted EPS was $0.86, up 30% year-over-year GAAP EPS was $0.46, unfavorably impacted by the new U.S. Tax Act, compared to the prior year's $0.53\nCLEVELAND, OHIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ParkOhio (NASDAQ: PKOH) today announced results for its fourth quarter of 2017.\nEdward F. Crawford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “ParkOhio has a great future behind it.”\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales were $366.0 million, up 19% compared to $306.8 million in 2016. Net income attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.8 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $6.5 million, or $0.53 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders was $0.86 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 30% compared to $0.66 per diluted share in the 2016 period. Please refer to the table that follows for a reconciliation of net income to adjusted earnings.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales grew to 16.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 15.2% a year ago, an increase of 160 basis points. Operating cash flows were $19.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $82.8 million on hand at December 31, 2017. EBITDA, as defined was $33.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 28% compared to $26.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Please refer to the table that follows for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, as defined.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Act”) enacted in the fourth quarter resulted in a one-time net tax expense of $4.2 million, or $0.34 per share, in the quarter. The expense primarily related to transition tax expense of $14.2 million on the Company’s unremitted foreign earnings and profits, partially offset by a tax benefit of $10.0 million for adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower statutory rate. The fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate was 59.0%. Excluding the effect of the U.S. Tax Act, the fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate would have been 30.6% as compared to 31.5% in the 2016 period.\nFULL YEAR 2017 RESULTS\nFor the full year 2017, net sales were $1,413 million, up 11% compared to $1,277 million in 2016. Net income attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders in 2017 was $28.6 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders in 2016 of $31.7 million, or $2.58 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders was $3.23 per diluted share in 2017, up 7% compared to $3.01 per diluted share in 2016. Please refer to the table that follows for a reconciliation of net income to adjusted earnings.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales grew to 16.6% in 2017 compared to 15.9% a year ago, an increase of 70 basis points. EBITDA, as defined was $130.6 million in 2017, up 15% compared to $113.9 million in 2016. Please refer to the table that follows for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, as defined.\nThe full year 2017 effective tax rate was 38.0%. Excluding the effect of the U.S. Tax Act, the effective tax rate would have been 29.2% as compared to 21.5% in 2016. The lower rate in 2016 is due primarily to higher reversals of various income tax accruals relating to previous uncertain tax provisions for which the statutes of limitations expired. Excluding the effect of the U.S. Tax Act and the tax accrual reversals, the effective tax rates in 2017 and 2016 would have been 32.5% and 31.3%, respectively.\n2018 EARNINGS GUIDANCE\nWe currently forecast net income attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 per diluted share, which reflects year-over-year adjusted earnings growth of 10% to 16%. The Company estimates the effective tax rate for the full year 2018 to be in the 30% to 33% range. We expect revenues to increase 8-10% year-over-year.\nA conference call reviewing ParkOhio’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 results will be broadcast live over the Internet on Tuesday, March 6, commencing at 10:00 am Eastern Time.

Adjusted earnings is net income calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), adjusted for special items. The Company presents this non-GAAP financial measure because management uses adjusted earnings to compare its operating performance on a consistent basis over multiple periods because they remove the impact of certain significant non-cash credits or charges and certain infrequent items impacting net income. Adjusted earnings is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted earnings herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

EBITDA, as defined reflects net income attributable to Park-Ohio Holdings Corp. common shareholders before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain non-cash charges and corporate-level expenses as defined in the Company's current revolving credit facility. The Company presents this non-GAAP financial measure because management uses EBITDA, as defined to assess the Company's performance and believes that EBITDA is useful to investors as an indication of the Company's satisfaction of its Debt Service Ratio covenant in its current revolving credit facility. Additionally, EBITDA, as defined is a measure used under the Company's current revolving credit facility to determine whether the Company may incur additional debt under such facility. EBITDA, as defined is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net income or cash flow information calculated in accordance with GAAP.
