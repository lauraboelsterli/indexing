    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cenveo, Inc. (OTCPK: CVOVQ) (the \"Company\"), a diversified manufacturer of print-related products including envelopes, custom labels, commercial print, and publisher solutions, today announced that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, White Plains has given final approval of the Company's $290 million debtor-in-possession (\"DIP\") financing to support and grow its business.\nThe financing ensures that suppliers and other business partners are paid in a timely manner for goods and services provided during the reorganization process, in accordance with customary terms.\n\"This is a critical milestone for Cenveo in these Chapter 11 cases and a step forward in achieving the plan we outlined when we filed in early February. Today's decision assures that it remains business as usual at Cenveo,\" said Robert G. Burton, Sr. \"We look forward to filing our plan of reorganization by the end of March. Pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement, which was entered into before filing for Chapter 11, this plan already has the critical support of over 61% of the required 66.7% of our first lien noteholders prior to the commencement of the solicitation of the plan of reorganization. The transaction embodied in the Restructuring Support Agreement will, once approved, reduce our leverage by approximately $700 million, and allow us to quickly emerge from this process with a stronger balance sheet to support the Company's long-term success, benefiting our valued customers, business partners, and employees in the years ahead.\"\nAdditional information on the Company's restructuring can be found at www.cenveo.com/restructuring or by calling the Company's toll-free Restructuring Information Line at (844) 219-2678 (or, if you are calling from outside the U.S. or Canada, at +1 (646) 813-2946).

It is possible the Company's outstanding securities may be cancelled and extinguished upon confirmation of a restructuring plan by the Bankruptcy Court. In such an event, the Company's stockholders and other security holders would not be entitled to receive or retain any cash, securities or other property on account of their cancelled securities. Trading prices for the Company's common stock and other securities may bear little or no relation to actual recovery, if any, by holders thereof in the Company's Chapter 11 cases. Accordingly, the Company urges extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in its securities.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements.
