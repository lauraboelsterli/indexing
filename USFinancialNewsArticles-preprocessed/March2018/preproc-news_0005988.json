Voorhees, CEO of Rust-Oleum Group (Photo: Business Wire)\nVoorhees has served as president of Rust-Oleum North America for more than 12 years, driving long-term strategy and building business foundations. In this new role, he will look to provide the company strategic and tactical direction on a global scale. Voorhees has been a part of the Rust-Oleum team for more than 35 years, starting as a sales rep on the East Coast. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in business management from Adelphi University and completed the executive development program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business.\n“It is tremendously satisfying to hand the reins over to Ed,” said Reed. “As a person who has been by my side, as a partner, every step of the way, he is truly and uniquely qualified to continue to lead the sustained growth that Rust-Oleum has enjoyed over the last decade.”\nReed has served in many key positions since he joined Rust-Oleum in 1983. He became CEO and president in August 2006.

Reed is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin – La Crosse.\n“At RPM, we place great emphasis on succession planning for our group and operating company leaders, and anticipate a smooth and seamless transition over the coming weeks,” stated Frank C.
