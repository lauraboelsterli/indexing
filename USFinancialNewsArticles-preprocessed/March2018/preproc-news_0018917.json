    "text": "Published: Mar 9, 2018 8:21 a.m. ET Share \nBeijing gives ‘special treatment’ to companies considered strategically important, analyst says Reuters \nBy Stella Yifan Xie \nSHANGHAI—A fledgling unit of Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn Technology 2354, +0.89% jumped to the front of the queue of Chinese companies waiting to go public, showing how China is moving quickly to allow select technology stalwarts to list at home. \nFoxconn Industrial Internet Co., a Shenzhen-based company that makes parts for smartphones and wireless equipment, on Thursday received approval from China’s securities regulator to launch an initial public offering that will raise at least 27.3 billion yuan (US$4.3 billion) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. \nThe regulator’s approval came a little over a month after Foxconn Industrial filed its listing application, an unusually swift turnaround relative to the one- to two-year wait that most companies have to endure. It also stands in contrast with dozens of firms whose applications to go public were rejected in recent months after regulatory scrutiny of their reported profits and disclosures. \nFoxconn Industrial was set up in March 2015 and is a subsidiary of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. 2317, +2.80% , one of the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturers, better known as Foxconn. The parent company in December said it was planning to list its unit in Shanghai, and Foxconn Industrial obtained clearance from China’s State Council before submitting its listing application to the China Securities Regulatory Commission. \nThe securities regulator typically requires companies to have a three-year profit record before they can list on the main boards of the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges. That has deterred some startup companies and led them to launch IPOs in Hong Kong or New York.",
