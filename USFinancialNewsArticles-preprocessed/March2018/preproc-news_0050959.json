    "text": "5 COMMENTS Playboy Enterprises Inc., the publisher of Playboy magazine, is signing off of Facebook . FB 3.92%\n“The recent news about Facebook’s alleged mismanagement of users’ data has solidified our decision to suspend our activity on the platform at this time,” the lifestyle company founded by Hugh Hefner said Wednesday.\nPlayboy said it would deactivate the various Facebook pages it manages. More than 25 million Facebook users have engaged with these accounts, the company said.\nA Playboy spokesman said the privately held company has no plans to return to the platform. Facebook Inc. didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFacebook has been under fire after it disclosed that information about tens of millions of its users was sold to data-analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign in 2016 and other Republican candidates. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify before Congress on the social network’s handling of data.\nFacebook's data privacy scandal has driven many to contemplate ditching the social network for good. WSJ's Katherine Bindley explains how, and suggests some non-permanent alternatives. Photo illustration: iStock The issues have caused some individual Facebook users to leave the platform and advertisers to cut back.\nElon Musk, the head of Tesla and SpaceX, had his companies’ official Facebook pages taken down last week after being asked about it on Twitter, though he said it wouldn’t change much. “I don’t use FB & never have, so don’t think I’m some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don’t advertise or pay for endorsements, so…don’t care,” he said on Twitter Friday.\nFacebook on Wednesday said it would make it simpler for users to edit some of the personal data Facebook tracks. The company also said it would redesign its settings menu for mobile devices and consolidate privacy and security options in a single place\nPlayboy, in its sharing of racy photos and celebration of sex, said it has had to censor itself over the years to stay within Facebook’s strict content guidelines.\nThe company, whose controlling shareholder is private-equity firm Rizvi Traverse, has been focusing more on brand partnerships and licensing deals built around the Playboy name and bunny logo and less on its editorial roots.\nFacebook shares, which have been battered by the Cambridge issue and are down more than 10% over the past week, are down less than 1% premarket Wednesday.\nWrite to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com",
