    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 7:31 AM / Updated 43 minutes ago Recruiting firm Robert Walters reports 44 pct annual profit jump Reuters Staff 1 Min Read March 1 (Reuters) - British recruiting company Robert Walters reported an about 44 percent jump in full-year pretax profit, as overseas growth and its outsourcing business protected the firm against Brexit uncertainty, which has challenged the UKâ€™s recruiting market. The company, which places people in finance, engineering, legal and marketing jobs, said pretax profit grew to 40.6 million pounds ($55.9 million) in the year ended Dec. 31, from 28.1 million pounds a year earlier. Robert Walters, which generates 71 percent of its fee income from outside the UK, had raised its profit forecast three times last year. ($1 = 0.7265 pounds) (Reporting by Esha Vaish in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri)",
