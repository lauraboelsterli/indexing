    "text": "NEW YORK, March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, \"Starboard\"), a significant shareholder of Newell Brands Inc. (\"Newell\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: NWL), which together with the other participants in its solicitation beneficially owns approximately 4.5% of the Company's outstanding shares, today announced that certain of its director nominees, Ian G.H. Ashken, Martin E. Franklin and James E. Lillie, have committed to purchase an aggregate of $25 million worth of Newell stock with their personal capital in the open market if Starboard successfully replaces Newell's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") at the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nMr. Franklin stated, \"Newell is a great company, with great people and fantastic brands. Over the past two years, we, along with many shareholders, have suffered significant value destruction under the current leadership team. We are committed to helping put the Company back on the path to success. Ian, Jim and my commitment to purchase stock, along with our current substantial holdings, is an indication of how strongly we believe in the value creation opportunity at Newell and how important it is for the Board to have interests that are strongly aligned with shareholders through meaningful equity ownership.\"\nIf elected, Messrs. Ashken, Franklin and Lillie further commit to not sell any of the shares they purchase for so long as they continue to serve as directors of the Company unless Newell's share price exceeds the Company's share price on April 15, 2016 â€“ the day on which Newell closed its acquisition of Jarden Corporation.\nAbout Starboard Value LP\nStarboard Value LP is a New York-based investment adviser with a focused and differentiated fundamental approach to investing primarily in publicly traded U.S. companies.
