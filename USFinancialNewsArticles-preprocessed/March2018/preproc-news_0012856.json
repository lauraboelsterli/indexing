Forward-looking statements normally contain words like 'believe', 'expect', 'anticipate', 'plan', 'intend', 'continue', 'estimate', 'may', 'will', 'should', 'ongoing' and similar expressions, and within this news release include, without limitation, statements (express or implied) respecting the closing of the Motorola Solutions acquisition and expected actions to follow therefrom.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, actions, or developments and are based on expectations, assumptions, and other factors that Avigilon's management currently believes are relevant, reasonable, and appropriate in the circumstances, including, without limitation, assumptions that: the acquisition will complete under the terms, structure, and timeline currently contemplated; the Avigilon shareholders meeting will occur and on the timeline currently contemplated; the Avigilon shareholders will provide the requisite approval for the acquisition; all other requisite third party approvals (including, without limitation, from applicable stock exchanges, and courts) in connection with the acquisition will be obtained in a timely manner and on satisfactory terms; Motorola Solutions will have sufficient capital resources to complete the acquisition; the parties will be able to satisfy the other conditions to the closing of the acquisition and on the timeline(s) currently contemplated; Motorola Solutions' vision and strategy will remain aligned with those of Avigilon; no significant events will occur outside of Avigilon's normal course of business; and the continuation of the business and operations of Avigilon, and the integration thereof with Motorola Solutions, following completion of the transaction will occur as currently contemplated.\nAlthough Avigilon's management believes that the forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could be substantially different due to the risks and uncertainties associated with and inherent to Avigilon's business, as more particularly described in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Avigilon's Annual Information Form dated March 6, 2018, and in the Management Information Circular for the Special Meeting dated February 21, 2018, each of which is available under Avigilon's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Material risks and uncertainties applicable to the forward-looking statements set out herein include, but are not limited to: the acquisition is not completed in a timely fashion or at all; the Avigilon shareholders meeting to approve the acquisition is delayed; the Avigilon shareholders do not approve the acquisition on the current terms or at all; any requisite third party approval is not obtained in a timely fashion (or at all) or on satisfactory terms; Motorola Solutions does not have or obtain sufficient capital resources to complete the transaction; the announcement of the transaction and the dedication of substantial resources of Avigilon to the completion of transaction has a negative impact on Avigilon's ongoing business operations and future financial condition and prospects; a third party makes a bid to acquire Avigilon prior to the completion of this acquisition; the respective strategies and vision of Avigilon and Motorola Solutions become incongruous leading to, for instance, delays in product development and availability; unforeseen challenges in integrating Avigilon's business and operations with Motorola Solutions; a loss of key Avigilon personnel, customers, and/or suppliers; and other unforeseen events, developments, or factors causing any of the aforesaid expectations, assumptions, and other factors ultimately being inaccurate or irrelevant. Although Avigilon has attempted to identify factors that may cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those disclosed in the forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, predicted, estimated or intended. Also, many of the factors are beyond the control of Avigilon. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nAvigilon undertakes no obligation to reissue or update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or events after the date hereof except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements contained in this news release are qualified by this cautionary statement.\nSOURCE Avigilon Corporation",
