Customers are letting us know that they see, feel and appreciate our efforts to redefine the customer experience – and they are rewarding us with growing loyalty. This is the cycle that creates long-term value for shareholders.\n\"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a catalyst that is enabling us to accelerate investments in Restock Kroger. We are taking a balanced approach to ensure tax reform benefits our associates, customers and shareholders. What we've previously said is that sharing the benefits with our associates and customers will create a more sustainable and stronger business model for the future. This balanced approach is also consistent with our values and Kroger's purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit.\n\"As we embark on our first full year of Restock Kroger, we are encouraged at the start of 2018 and confident in our ability to deliver on both our plan for the year and our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift.\"\nDetails of Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $854 million, or $0.96 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $562 million, or $0.63 per diluted share (see Table 6, the 2017 Fourth Quarter Adjustment Items). Net earnings in the same period last year were $506 million, or $0.53 per diluted share.\nTotal sales increased 12.4% to $31.0 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $27.6 billion for the same period last year. Total sales, excluding fuel and the 53 rd week, increased 2.7% in the fourth quarter over the same period last year.\nGross margin was 21.9% of sales for the fourth quarter. Excluding fuel, the 53 rd week and the LIFO credit and charge, gross margin decreased 31 basis points from the same period last year.\nKroger recorded a LIFO credit of $54 million in the fourth quarter, compared to a $0.2 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year.\nOperating, General & Administrative costs as a rate of sales – excluding fuel, the 53 rd week and the 2017 Fourth Quarter Adjustment Items – increased by 22 basis points; rent and depreciation with the same exclusions declined by 9 basis points.\nFiscal 2017 Results\nNet earnings for 2017 totaled $1.9 billion, or $2.09 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings totaled $1.9 billion, or $2.04 per diluted share (see Table 6, the 2017 Adjustment Items). Net earnings in 2016 were $2.0 billion, or $2.05 per diluted share. Excluding the 2016 restructuring of certain multi-employer pension obligations, adjusted net earnings in 2016 were $2.0 billion, or $2.12 per diluted share.\nTotal sales increased 6.4% to $122.7 billion in 2017 compared to $115.3 billion in 2016. Excluding fuel, the 53 rd week and the Modern Health merger, total sales increased 2.2% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nGross margin was 22.0% of sales in 2017.

The company continually balances the use of its cash flow to achieve these goals.\nOver the last four quarters, Kroger has used cash to:\nContribute an incremental $1.2 billion pre-tax to company-sponsored pension plans and $467 million pre-tax to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund, Repurchase 61 million common shares for $1.6 billion, Pay $444 million in dividends, and Invest $3.0 billion in capital.\nKroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.65 (see Table 5), on a 52-week basis, due primarily to funding various pension obligations. The company updated its net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range to 2.30 to 2.50 to reflect its decision to fund these existing obligations, which resulted in them being reflected as debt on Kroger's balance sheet.\nKroger expects to use proceeds from the sale of convenience stores to reduce debt and repurchase shares. Kroger's 2018 guidance assumes a first quarter close of the transaction.\nReturn on invested capital for 2017, on a 52-week basis, was 12.03% (see Table 7).\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $3.0 billion for the year, compared to $3.6 billion in 2016.\n2018 Guidance\nKroger is targeting identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 1.5% to 2.0% in 2018.\nThe company expects net earnings to range from $1.95 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018.\nThe company expects capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions, and purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3.0 billion in 2018.\nKroger expects its 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Restock Kroger Highlights\nRedefine the Grocery Customer Experience\nAchieved $16.7 billion in annual natural and organic sales, including $2 billion in Simple Truth® sales.

Return on Invested Capital\n(in millions, except percentages)\n(unaudited)\nReturn on invested capital should not be considered an alternative to any GAAP measure of performance. Return on invested capital is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital and our effectiveness in deploying our assets. Return on invested capital should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate return on invested capital differently than Kroger, limiting the comparability of the measure.\nThe following table provides a calculation of return on invested capital for 2017 and 2016 on a 52 week basis.\nYEAR-TO-DATE\nFebruary 3,\nJanuary 28,\n2018\n2017\nReturn on Invested Capital\nNumerator (a)\nOperating profit on a 53 week basis in fiscal year 2017\n$ 2,085\n$ 3,436\n53rd week operating profit adjustment\n(131)\n-\nLIFO (credit) charge\n(8)\n19\nDepreciation and amortization\n2,436\n2,340\nRent on 53 week basis in fiscal year 2017\n911\n881\n53rd week rent adjustment\n(17)\n-\nAdjustment for Kroger Specialty Pharmacy goodwill impairment\n110\n-\nAdjustments for pension plan agreements\n550\n111\nAdjustment for Company-sponsored pension plan termination\n502\n-\nAdjustment for depreciation related to held for sale assets\n(19)\n-\nAdjustment for voluntary retirement offering\n184\n-\nAdjusted operating profit on a 52 week basis\n$ 6,603\n$ 6,787\nDenominator (b)\nAverage total assets\n$ 36,867\n$ 35,201\nAverage taxes receivable (c)\n(181)\n(262)\nAverage LIFO reserve (d)\n1,270\n1,283\nAverage accumulated depreciation and amortization\n20,287\n18,940\nAverage trade accounts payable\n(5,838)\n(5,773)\nAverage accrued salaries and wages\n(1,167)\n(1,330)\nAverage other current liabilities (e)\n(3,363)\n(3,265)\nAverage liabilities held for sale\n(146)\n-\nRent * 8 (f)\n7,152\n7,048\nAverage invested capital\n$ 54,881\n$ 51,842\nReturn on Invested Capital\n12.03%\n13.09%\na)\nRepresents year-to-date results for the periods noted.\nb)\nRepresents the average of amounts at the beginning and end of the year.\nc)\nTaxes receivable is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in receivables.\nd)\nLIFO reserve is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in inventories.\ne)\nThe calculation of average other current liabilities excludes accrued income taxes.\nf)\nThe factor of eight estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kroger-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300610649.html\nSOURCE The Kroger Co.",
