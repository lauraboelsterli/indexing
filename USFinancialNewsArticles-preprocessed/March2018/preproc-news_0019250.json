    "text": "1 COMMENTS Pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp. wants to get ahead of rising interest rates with its massive $40 billion bond issue , but other companies are holding back despite the threat of higher finance costs.\nThat is in part due to a U.S. tax overhaul potentially bringing money back to America, but also reflects executives’ views that financing costs aren’t about to rise dramatically.\nFor years, companies have taken advantage of ultralow rates and stocked up on debt, with some European firms even borrowing at negative rates. But the central bank stimulus that helped lower rates is now being withdrawn. Yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds have jumped to 2.9% from 2.1% a year ago, nearing levels last seen in early 2014. The 10-year German bund trades at 0.668%, up from 0.43% at the end of 2017.\nCVS is selling bonds to help pay for its acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc., months before it needs the money and issued the debt this week to avoid the risk that interest rates continue to rise, people familiar with the deal said.\nYet despite the prospect of more expensive debt, U.S. and European companies have raised less money at the start of 2018 than for many years.\nSome analysts, however, say they should take advantage of continued ultralow costs of capital, and some companies say they are watching the market closely. That could see a burst of corporate issuance later in the year.\n“There is always the risk of a quick increase in rates which might make you feel sorry that you did not raise more debt making use of these abnormal conditions,” Philippe Gaston H. Capron, Chief Financial Officer at Veolia Environnement SA, a French environmental services firm, said in an interview. Still, Mr. Capron does not believe there will be a jump in rates.\nThe company has bonds maturing this year. In November, it issued a €500 million ($618.8 million) three-year bond with negative yield of -0.03% and as far back as September 2016 it sold bonds at coupons just above zero.\nThe yield-to-maturity rate for U.S. corporate bonds on Feb. 27 increased to 3.72% from 3.3% at the start of the year, according to ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. In the eurozone, the yield-to-maturity rate was 0.96% on Feb. 27, up from 0.88%.\nAs of March 5, U.S. companies have raised $108.24 billion through bond sales, which is 35.06% below the same period last year, according to data provider Dealogic. They have raised $189.90 billion in syndicated loans from banks, which is lower than the same period in the last two years. In Europe, companies have raised $80.61 billion in bonds, the lowest amount since 2011.\nThere are a number of reasons, including companies being put off coming to market amid February’s markets correction.\nThere also may be just less debt to refinance, with fewer bonds reaching maturity this year. Companies didn’t issue much debt in 2008, during the financial crisis, and in 2011—Europe’s sovereign debt crisis—so there aren’t many upcoming maturities for seven-year and 10-bonds, two popular terms, said Matthew Bailey, an associate in JP Morgan Chase & Co.’s European credit strategy unit.\nMany companies have held off from issuing new debt as they consider the effects of President Donald Trump’s tax changes, said Frazer Ross, a bond syndicate manager at Deutsche Bank AG. The changes encourage companies to repatriate overseas cash, which could replace money raised in public markets.\nBut finance chiefs need to consider their options, as yields could move up faster than what people expected, said Jeroen van den Broek, credit strategist at ING Groep NV.\nMost analysts believe yields will continue to rise as higher inflation puts pressure on central banks to unwind stimulus.\nIn the U.S., higher financing costs have already started to weigh on earnings. Dominion Energy Inc. said the issue is a “negative factor,” according to the energy company’s CFO Mark F. McGettrick. Edison International, another U.S. utility, had its net financing costs increase by a penny a share in 2017, said its CFO Maria Rigatti, according to a transcript.\nEngie SA, a French utility, is looking to buy back short term debt and to replace it with long-term bonds, its deputy finance chief Sergio Val said in an interview.\n“Depending on the pace of the interest rate rise, there will likely be an increasing upwards pressure on (European) companies’ costs going forward,” Mr. Val said. Engie’s average cost of debt was 2.6% at the end of 2017, compared with 2.8% in 2016.\nTo be sure, yields are rising as the global economy prospers, which is good for companies. And debt costs remain low by historic standards.\nAmid robust global economic growth, rising financing rates are a sign of normalization, said David Nazar, chief investment officer at Ironshield Capital Management LLP.\nHowever, it could be “somewhat painful for some players—holders of leveraged credit and corporates lower in the credit spectrum,” Mr. Nazar said.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nCVS Health Corp. raised $40 billion in a bond sale Tuesday. An earlier version of this story said that they had raised $44 billion.
