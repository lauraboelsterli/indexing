    "text": "By Polina Marinova 9:01 AM EDT SO LONG, VC\nGood morning, Term Sheet readers.\nBird , the Santa Monica-based electric scooter company, raised $100 million in Series B funding at a ~$300 million valuation. But what’s perhaps more interesting is that Arena Ventures founder and general partner Paige Craig joined the startup as its head of U.S. city operations.\nIf you remember in January, Term Sheet reported that Arena Ventures, the Los Angeles-based early-stage venture capital firm, would pause seed investing “until the seed market corrects.” Craig had sent a private letter to limited partners laying out concerns about the seed market — high valuations, excessive capital supply, and imbalanced market forces.\nIt appears those concerns did not go away.\nWhen asked whether he would be working on something else during Arena’s hiatus, Craig said “No, we’re full time on Arena.” Fortune contacted him on Friday to ask what will happen to his VC firm, and he said, “We stopped seed investing last year, and Jeff [Lo, Arena co-founder] and I decided to oversee the portfolio, but will not make any new investments. I’m full time at Bird.”\nWhile Craig said the seed market has become increasingly crowded and expensive, he joined a company that raised $15 million in Series A funding last month and $100 million in Series B this month at a $300 million valuation. So, there’s that.\nRead the full story here.\nNEW FUND ALERT: GV partner Lo Toney is looking to raise up to $50 million for a new fund-of-funds, called Plexo Capital. Plexo, which is backed by Alphabet, plans to invest as a limited partner in seed funds led by people of color and/or female general partners.\nDROPBOX IPO UPDATE: Online file storage company Dropbox hopes to raise as much as $648 million in its initial public offering. It is marketing 36 million shares of Class A common stock for $16 to $18 apiece. At the high end of that range, Dropbox would have a market value of about $7.1 billion. If you add in restricted stock units, the valuation could push as high as $7.6 billion.\nWhile these are large numbers, don’t forget that Dropbox was last valued at $10 billion in its 2014 funding round. At the high end of its offering size, it’d be the third-biggest IPO from an enterprise technology IPO in the past three years.
