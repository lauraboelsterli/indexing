    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel , March 06, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Highlights for 2017\nIncrease of 30% in net earnings to NIS 678 million Return on equity: 9.1% Increase of 6.1% in net interest income Decrease of 2.8% in operating and other expenses Improvement to 69.5% in the efficiency ratio Ratio of Tier I capital to risk weighted assets: 10.38% at year-end 2017, compared with 10.09% at year-end 2016 Ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of 13.94% Distributed dividends of NIS 310 in 2017, representing an annual dividend yield of 4.9% Board of Directors declared dividend distribution of NIS 95 million for the fourth quarter of 2017\nProfitability\nFirst International Bank Group's net earnings in the year 2017 increased by 30% in comparison to 2016, amounting to NIS 678 million. The return on equity was 9.1%.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, net earnings increased by 41% in comparison to the corresponding period in 2016, amounting to NIS 158 million. The return on equity was 8.4%.\nGrowth\nNet interest income increased in 2017 by 6.1% in comparison to the previous year, amounting to NIS 2,302 million, the growth was due to the increase in volume of operations, mostly from the growth in the credit portfolio.\nThe growth of the Group was also apparent in the balance sheet data, both on the credit side and on the deposit side. The Bank's customer assets portfolio grew by 12.8% (by approximately NIS 50 billion) and reached NIS 442 billion. Deposits by the public grew by 7.3% and credit to the public grew by 3.9%.\nThe growth in the credit portfolio was marked by the continued spread of credit. It was primarily noted in the private customer segment which grew by 8.5%. It was also noted in mortgages segment which grew by 5.1% and in credit granted to the small and middle business market segment, which grew by 6.0%.\nThe growth in the credit portfolio was achieved while maintaining an appropriate risk level: the ratio of credit loss expenses to total credit to the public in 2017 amounted to 0.15%.\nEfficiency\nThe First International Bank continued to improve efficiencies in line with its strategic goals, and a decrease of 2.8% was noted in total operating and other expenses , which amounted to NIS 2,607 million. The reduction in expenses was reflected across all expense items.\nPayroll and related expenses amounted in 2017 to NIS 1,627 million, representing a reduction of 1.8%. The efficiency trend can be noted in the decrease in the number of positions, which declined in 2017 by 3.7%, as well as a reduction in the office space in use by the Bank, which decreased in 2017 by 9%.\nThis decrease in expenses supports the gradual and consistent improvement in the efficiency ratio, which improved to 69.5% in 2017 as compared with 73.5% in 2016.\nIn 2017, the Bank sold its operations in Switzerland. The sale process led to a temporary increase in expenses relating to the closing down process and due to the reduction in income from the Swiss operations. The results of the sale are expected to positively contribute to improvements in the efficiency ratio in 2018.\nFinancial Stability\nThe upward trend relating to the capital attributed to the shareholders of the Bank continued, and grew by 5.9% (NIS 435 million) to NIS 7,756 million. The Tier I equity capital ratio increased to 10.38% in comparison to 10.09% as of December 31, 2016, and the total capital ratio increased to 13.94%.\nIn 2017, the Bank distributed dividends in the amount of NIS 310 million, representing a dividend yield of 4.9%. Furthermore, the Board of Directors of the Bank resolved on an additional dividend distribution of NIS 95 million for the fourth quarter.\nManagement Comment\nMrs. Smadar Berber-Tsadik, CEO of the First International Bank Group: \"The financial results of the First International Bank for 2017 reflect the ongoing growth of the Group, as apparent in the consistent growth of the credit portfolio, in the deposits of the public and in the customer assets portfolio. Our growth trend has continued for a number of years, and we have demonstrated an average growth rate of over 5% per annum in the credit portfolio. I emphasize that we are achieving this growth while maintaining the quality of the Bank assets, an appropriate risk level, a healthy mix in the credit portfolio, and an increase in our loan book diversity. The strong capital ratios of the First International Bank enable this ongoing growth, while allowing us to continue to share dividends with our shareholders.\nContinued Mrs. Berber-Tsadik, \"Another positive trend reflected in our financial results, is the consistent and significant improvement in our efficiency ratios. This has been made possible by a combination of growing income with declining expenses. We continue to implement efficiency measures in accordance with our strategy of improvements in work procedures, merger of branches and Head Office units, and reduction in the number of positions. Looking ahead to 2018, we will continue to implement efficiency measures with the aim of ongoing gradual and consistent improvement in our efficiency ratios.\n\"The First International Bank maintains its leadership position in the capital market, both in the professional field and in the digital field. In 2017, we focused on unique and innovative digital developments, such as the cellular consulting system 'ADVISE ME', an upgraded capital market website and more. 2017 was also characterized by a significant improvement in the digital field as well as in our innovation, both in regards to the capital market as well as in the range of banking operations we provide. Our goal is the upgrade of the customer experience by providing our customers with advanced and efficient service channels, which complement the personal and professional services that we provide at our branches.\"\nCONDENSED PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND PRINCIPAL EXECUTION INDICES\nPrincipal financial ratios\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\npercent\nExecution indices\nReturn on equity\n9.1%\n7.2%\n6.5%\n6.8%\n8.4%\nReturn on assets\n0.5%\n0.4%\n0.4%\n0.4%\n0.5%\nRatio of equity capital tier 1\n10.38%\n10.09%\n9.81%\n9.69%\n9.98%\nLeverage ratio(1)\n5.50%\n5.52%\n5.43%\nLiquidity coverage ratio(1)\n123%\n123%\n104%\nEfficiency ratio\n69.5%\n73.5%\n77.6%\n77.3%\n74.3%\nCredit quality indices\nRatio of provision for credit losses to credit to the public\n1.03%\n1.08%\n1.12%\n1.25%\n1.19%\nRatio of impaired debts or in arrears of 90 days or more to credit to the public\n0.95%\n1.02%\n1.36%\n1.50%\n1.79%\nRatio of provision for credit losses to total impaired credit to the public\n155%\n147%\n108%\n110%\n83%\nRatio of net write-offs to average total credit to the public\n0.18%\n0.09%\n0.15%\n0.05%\n0.14%\nPrincipal data from the statement of income\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\nNIS million\nNet profit attributed to shareholders of the Bank\n678\n521\n446\n455\n538\nInterest Income, net\n2,302\n2,169\n1,953\n2,101\n2,187\nExpenses from credit losses\n121\n80\n18\n89\n97\nTotal non Interest income\n1,450\n1,480\n1,541\n1,667\n1,664\nOf which: Fees\n1,305\n1,300\n1,378\n1,375\n1,418\nTotal operating and other expenses\n2,607\n2,683\n2,710\n2,912\n2,860\nOf which: Salaries and related expenses\n1,627\n1,656\n1,629\n1,780\n1,746\nPrimary net profit per share of NIS 0.05 par value (NIS)\n6.76\n5.19\n4.45\n4.54\n5.36\nPrincipal data from the balance sheet\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\nNIS million\nTotal assets\n135,717\n127,907\n125,476\n117,807\n111,025\nof which: Cash and deposits with banks\n39,186\n29,150\n30,727\n29,182\n26,100\nSecurities\n10,238\n15,776\n16,439\n12,554\n10,799\nCredit to the public, net\n80,378\n77,328\n72,555\n68,931\n68,680\nTotal liabilities\n127,333\n119,973\n117,813\n110,764\n104,124\nof which: Deposits from banks\n1,133\n755\n1,565\n1,469\n1,335\nDeposits from the public\n113,511\n105,817\n103,262\n95,155\n89,122\nBonds and subordinated capital notes\n5,249\n5,801\n5,862\n4,903\n5,702\nCapital attributed to the shareholders of the Bank\n7,756\n7,321\n7,073\n6,797\n6,673\nAdditional data\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\nShare price (0.01 NIS)\n7,202\n5,650\n4,594\n4,990\n4,766\nDividend per share (0.01 NIS)\n309\n199\n130\n284\n199\nNumber of positions(2)\n4,451\n4,623\n4,858\n5,114\n5,214\nRatio of fees to assets\n1.0%\n1.0%\n1.1%\n1.2%\n1.3%\n(1) According to instructions of the Bank of Israel the Leverage ratio and the Liquidity coverage ratio were calculated since 2015.
