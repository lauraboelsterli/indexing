    "text": "Montrouge, France, March 21, 2018 DBV Technologies Announces Pricing of $150.0 million ( € 122.5 million) Global Offering of Ordinary Shares, Including in the Form of American Depositary Shares\nDBV Technologies (the \"Company\") (Euronext: DBV - ISIN: FR0010417345 - Nasdaq Stock Market: DBVT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced the pricing of an underwritten global offering of an aggregate of 3,527,752 ordinary shares in (i) a public offering of 1,392,015 ordinary shares in the form of 2,784,030 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) in the United States, Canada and certain other countries outside Europe at a public offering price of $21.26 per ADS (on the basis of an exchange rate of $1.2246=€1.00) and (ii) a concurrent private placement of 2,135,737 ordinary shares in Europe (including France) at a public offering price of €34.71 per ordinary share. The price of the global offering is equal to the volume weighted-average of the trading prices of the Company's ordinary shares on Euronext Paris over the three (3) trading days prior to the launch of the global offering less a discount of 4.99%. Each ADS represents the right to receive one-half of one ordinary share. The gross proceeds to the Company from the global offering are expected to be approximately $150.0 million (approximately €122.5 million), before deducting underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses. In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase, on the same terms and conditions, up to 529,162 additional ordinary shares, which may be in the form of ADSs (the \"Option\"). The closing of the global offering is expected to occur on March 23, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. The ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"DBVT\", and the Company's ordinary shares are listed on Euronext Paris under the symbol \"DBV\".\nMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are acting as joint lead book-running managers for the global offering. Barclays and Deutsche Bank Securities are also serving as book-running managers. Bryan, Garnier & Co. is acting as a co-manager for the global offering.\nThe Company plans to use the net proceeds from the global offering to fund the development and commercialization of Viaskin Peanut, to advance development of its other product candidates and for working capital and general corporate purposes. In connection with the global offering, the Company and each of its directors and executive officers entered into a lock-up agreement with the underwriters for the global offering, which agreements restrict the sale of securities of the Company for a period of 90 days following the completion of the global offering, subject to customary exceptions. On an illustrative basis, a holder of 1% of the Company's share capital outstanding before the completion of the global offering would hold 0.88% of the Company's share capital outstanding after the completion of the global offering, assuming no exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional ordinary shares and that such holder did not participate in the global offering.\nThe Option may be exercised at any time in whole or in part upon notice by the underwriters to the Company, which notice may be given at any time on or prior to April 19, 2018. In connection with the global offering, the underwriters may over-allot the securities or effect transactions with a view to supporting, stabilizing or maintaining the market price of the securities at a level higher than the one which might otherwise prevail in the open market. However, there is no assurance that the stabilizing manager will take any stabilization action and any stabilization action, if begun, may be ended at any time without prior notice. Any stabilization action or over-allotment shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and may be undertaken on the regulated market of Euronext Paris and/or the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nA registration statement on Form F-3 relating to the securities to be issued in the global offering was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became automatically effective on July 27, 2016. The public offering will be made only by means of a written prospectus and prospectus supplement that form a part of the registration statement. A final prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to and describing the terms of the offering will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and will be available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov .
