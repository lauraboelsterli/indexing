    "text": "FORT STOCKTON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MMEX Resources Corp. (OTCQB: MMEX), a development-stage company focusing on the acquisition, development and financing of oil, gas, refining and infrastructure projects in Texas and South America, announced that U.S. Rep. Will Hurd (TX-23) will visit its Pecos County Refinery Project 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton on Monday, March 26.\nJack W. Hanks, President and CEO of MMEX Resources Corp., commented, “We’ve made significant progress in a short amount of time and are looking forward to sharing our accomplishments with Congressman Hurd during his visit to the Pecos County refinery project site. With the refinery being built in Congressman Hurd’s district, we’re eager to discuss the economic impact of the refinery and the job creation moving forward.”\nMMEX broke ground on Phase 1 of the MMEX Refinery Project in Pecos County Texas, a 10,000 barrel-per-day (BPD) crude distillation unit, in mid-November. Recently, MMEX announced that it had commenced and completed road construction on its easement acquired from the University of Texas Lands, entered into a diesel product sales agreement with Pilot Thomas Logistics and entered into a trucking transportation agreement with Penta Operating LLC.\nThe visit will begin at the Pecos County Refinery site at 4:00 p.m., with Congressman Hurd touring the site and receiving a briefing about the progress from Hanks. Following the visit, Congressman Hurd and Hanks will ride the Texas Pacifico South Orient Railroad that transverses the Refinery Site location by Hy-Rail to the Fort Stockton Visitor’s Center, touring a path the Pecos County Refinery site proposes to use to transport product, and arrive at approximately 5:00 p.m. for photos. Media are welcome to attend the site visit and the arrival of Congressman Hurd by rail at the Fort Stockton Visitor Center and can contact Morgan Moritz (512-448-4950 / mmoritz@piercom.com ) if interested.\nAbout MMEX Resources Corp.\nMMEX Resources Corporation (MMEX) is a development stage company formed to engage in the exploration, extraction, refining and distribution of oil, gas, petroleum products and electric power.
