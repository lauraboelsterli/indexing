    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Otonomy, Inc. (NASDAQ:OTIC), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for otology, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved OTIPRIO (ciprofloxacin otic suspension) 6% for the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE) in patients 6 months of age and older due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. OTIPRIO is the first single-dose antibacterial approved by the FDA for treating AOE.\n\"This approval is an important milestone for the OTIPRIO program because it significantly expands the product's commercial potential to include approximately 4 million episodes of AOE per year in the United States, and broadens the target physician population beyond otolaryngologists to pediatricians and primary care physicians who treat the vast majority of AOE cases,\" said David A. Weber, Ph.D., president and CEO of Otonomy. “This indication also provides an entry point for OTIPRIO use in the office setting where the single-dose treatment can be administered by a physician or healthcare professional and then billed using an existing J Code. We look forward to incorporating AOE into our ongoing commercial partnering and divestiture discussions.\"\nAbout Acute Otitis Externa\nAcute otitis externa (AOE), also known as swimmer’s ear, is a common condition involving infection and inflammation of the external ear canal typically caused by bacterial infection. According to market data, there are approximately 4 million episodes of AOE each year in the United States. Symptoms include itchiness, redness, swelling, pain and pus draining from the infected ear. Topical antibiotics are considered the standard of care treatment for AOE with the typical regimen of ear drops requiring several administrations to the affected ear each day for up to 10 days.\nAbout OTIPRIO\nOTIPRIO is a sterile, preservative-free, otic suspension of 6% ciprofloxacin administered as a single-dose by a healthcare professional. The thermosensitive suspension exists as a liquid at or below room temperature and gels when warmed.\nFor bilateral otitis media with effusion, OTIPRIO is administered during ear tube surgery as a single 0.1 mL (6 mg) intratympanic administration into each affected ear, following suctioning of the middle ear effusion. In two Phase 3 trials, a single intraoperative administration of OTIPRIO demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the cumulative proportion of study treatment failures compared to tubes alone (p-value < 0.001).\nFor AOE, OTIPRIO is administered as a single 0.2 mL (12 mg) administration to the external ear canal of each affected ear. In a single Phase 3 trial, OTIPRIO demonstrated statistically significant clinical response defined as the complete absence of signs and symptoms of AOE (i.e., tenderness, erythema, edema, and otorrhea) compared to sham (p-value < 0.001).\nApproved Indications for OTIPRIO\nOTIPRIO (ciprofloxacin otic suspension) is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial indicated for\nThe treatment of pediatric patients 6 months of age and older with bilateral otitis media with effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement and The treatment of acute otitis externa in patients 6 months of age and older due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus .\nImportant Safety Information for OTIPRIO\nContraindications: OTIPRIO is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, to other quinolones, or to any of the components of OTIPRIO.\nWarnings and Precautions - Potential for Microbial Overgrowth: OTIPRIO may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria and fungi. If such infections occur, institute alternative therapy.\nAdverse Reactions - Bilateral otitis media with effusion clinical trials: Adverse reactions (incidence at least 3%) with OTIPRIO vs sham were: nasopharyngitis (5% vs 4%), irritability (5% vs 3%), and rhinorrhea (3% vs 2%). Acute otitis externa clinical trial: Adverse reactions (incidence at least 2%) with OTIPRIO vs sham were: ear pruritus (2% vs 2%), headache (2% vs 1%), otitis media (2% vs 1%), and ear discomfort (2% vs 0%).\nUse in Specific Populations - Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of OTIPRIO in infants below six months of age have not been established for the treatment of pediatric patients with bilateral otitis media with effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement and acute otitis externa.\nFull prescribing information can be found at www.OTIPRIO.com .\nAbout Otonomy\nOtonomy is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for otology.
