    "text": "HONG KONG, March 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bonso Electronics International, Inc. (NASDAQ:BNSO) today announced its unaudited results for the six-month period ended September 30, 2017.\nBonso reported net income for the six-month period ended September 30, 2017 of $0.69 million, or $0.14 basic earnings per share, as compared to net income of $1.10 million, or $0.21 basic earnings per share, posted during the six-month period ended September 30, 2016. Net sales for the six-month period ended September 30, 2017 decreased 38.8% to $6.2 million from $10.2 million for the six-month period ended September 30, 2016. The decreased net income resulted from the decline in revenue and the corresponding decline in income from the operations for the six-month period ended September 30, 2017.\nMr. Anthony So, Chairman and CEO stated: “Although our revenue decreased as compared with the same period in the previous year, we are pleased that our operations remained profitable.”\nMr. So said further: \"To cope with the decrease in demand for our products and the loss of significant customers, we will continue to invest in and develop new or upgraded products for our customers and target customers. Also, we will be advertising our services and products through different platforms and trade exhibitions, which we hope will result in additional sales revenue for the Company. In addition, the Company will build more production facilities to generate additional rental income by leasing those facilities to third parties.”\nAbout Bonso Electronics\nBonso Electronics designs, develops, manufactures, assembles and markets a comprehensive line of electronic scales, weighing instruments, health care products and pet electronics products.
