(Nasdaq:JASO) (“JA Solar” or the “Company”), one of the world’s largest manufacturers of high-performance solar power products, today announced that at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held today, the Company’s shareholders voted in favor of the proposal to authorize and approve the previously announced agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of November 17, 2017 (the \"Merger Agreement\"), among the Company, JASO Holdings Limited (the \"Holdco\"), JASO Parent Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the \"Parent\"), and JASO Acquisition Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the \"Merger Sub\", together with Holdco and Parent, the \"Parent Parties\" ), pursuant to which the Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the \"Merger\"), with the Company continuing as the surviving company and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent.\nApproximately 56.5% of the Company’s total outstanding ordinary shares presented in person or by proxy at today’s extraordinary general meeting.

Pursuant to Section 7.02(d) and Section 8.02(d) of the Merger Agreement, if at the time when the shareholders' approval is obtained, the holders of more than 10% of ordinary shares have validly served notices of objection, and within 10 business days the Parent Parties have not granted an irrevocable waiver of this condition, either the Company or the Parent Parties may terminate the Merger Agreement. The Company intends to update its shareholders if and when it receives from the Parent Parties their decision with respect to their granting of the waiver in due course.\nAbout JA Solar Holdings Co., Ltd.\nJA Solar Holdings Co., Ltd. is a leading manufacturer of high-performance solar power products that convert sunlight into electricity for residential, commercial, and utility-scale power generation.
