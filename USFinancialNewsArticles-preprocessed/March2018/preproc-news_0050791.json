    "text": "March 27, 2018 / 1:33 PM / Updated an hour ago Deals of the day-Mergers and acquisitions Reuters Staff 4 Min Read (Updates Melrose, Akzo; Adds Murray & Roberts and others) March 27 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1330 GMT on Tuesday: ** GlaxoSmithKline is buying Novartis out of their consumer healthcare joint venture for $13 billion, taking full control of products including Sensodyne toothpaste, Panadol headache tablets, muscle gel Voltaren, and Nicotinell patches. ** Akzo Nobel will sell its chemicals business in a 10.1 billion euro ($12.6 billion) deal to buyers led by Carlyle Group, the maker of Dulux paints said, making good on a promise made as it fought off a takeover last year. ** Melrose committed to a five-year ownership of GKN’s Aerospace division if it succeeds in its hostile bid for the engineering company after the British government made a rare intervention in the high-profile takeover battle. ** Britain’s business minister Greg Clark said he would follow expert advice from the defence ministry and others on whether to formally intervene in Melrose’s bid for GKN on national security grounds. ** The Ukrainian central bank said it had refused a request from Belarussian state-owned lender Paritetbank to buy the Ukrainian unit of Russia’s Sberbank, citing legal issues. ** Murray & Roberts will recommend that its shareholders reject German’s ATON GmbH’s buyout offer as it is “opportunistic” and undervalues the South African engineering and construction company, it said. ** Indonesian ride-hailing and online payment company Go-Jek is set to announce its first expansion to another country in Southeast Asia in the “next few weeks”, according to an internal company email seen by Reuters. ** Property developer China Vanke Co Ltd said talks to buy a stake in Russia’s O1 are still ongoing and that no decision has yet been reached. ** Toshiba Corp looks set to have more options for its chip unit after China said it was still reviewing a proposed $18 billion acquisition by a Bain Capital-led consortium, making it highly unlikely that an imminent deadline for the deal will be met. ** Britain’s Green Investment Group (GIG), a Macquarie Group unit, said it acquired a 25-percent interest in the Westermost Rough offshore wind farm from Marubeni Corporation . ** Chinese conglomerate CEFC China Energy plans to sell its entire global property portfolio with a book value of over 20 billion yuan ($3.18 billion), Bloomberg reported citing sources familiar with the matter. ** Austrian property group CA Immo needs to see a concrete offer from Starwood before it can say whether it makes sense and if the price is fair, its finance chief said. ** FIT Hon Teng Ltd, the cable and connector division of Taiwan’s Foxconn, said it planned to buy Belkin International, a maker of smartphone accessories and home networking products, for $866 million. ** Hospital chain Fortis Healthcare Ltd said it was evaluating an unsolicited offer received from rival Manipal Health Enterprises Pvt Ltd on March 23. ** Holding company Discount Investment Corp said it has offered to buy the 54.7 percent stake in Space Communications held by Eurocom for 160 million shekels ($45.89 million). ** Commercial real estate company Brookfield Property Partners LP said on Monday it would acquire the 66 percent of GGP Inc that it does not already own in a cash-and-stock deal that values GGP at about $15.3 billion. ** A top executive of DISH Network Corp argued on Monday that AT&T Inc’s planned purchase of Time Warner Inc would give AT&T too much power to block competitors’ access to crucial content. ** Brazil’s power company Furnas Centrais Elétricas SA, a subsidiary of state-controlled Eletrobras, signed a $175-mln contract with the construction unit of Odebrecht for the expansion of a power plant in Rio, according to a document and a statement from Furnas.
