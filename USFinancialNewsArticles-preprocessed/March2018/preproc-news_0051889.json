    "text": "HOUSTON, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Willbros Group, Inc. (OTC:WGRP) (“Company”) announced today that the Company has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Primoris Services Corporation (NASDAQ:PRIM) (“Primoris”). Primoris is one of the largest publicly traded specialty construction and infrastructure companies in the United States.\nUnder the terms of the all-cash agreement, Primoris will pay $0.60 per share for all of the outstanding common stock of the Company, settle the existing debt obligations of the Company, and provide up to $20 million in bridge financing to support the Company’s working capital liquidity needs through the closing date. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, is not subject to a financing condition, and is anticipated to close during the second quarter of 2018, subject to Company stockholder approval and certain other closing conditions.\nMichael Fournier, President and CEO, commented, “Primoris has a strong North American presence, and its diversified offerings complement our existing businesses. Many of our existing customers are familiar with Primoris and its various operating companies. We believe the broad, national presence of Primoris will allow us additional opportunities for growth. We anticipate that our businesses will benefit from the stability provided by Primoris’ solid balance sheet and access to capital.\nIn the near term, our focus is on meeting our clients’ expectations, working safely, and providing the quality of service they have come to depend on from the Company. We see significant synergies and opportunities when the Company joins Primoris after the anticipated closing of this transaction.”\nIn connection with the execution of the definitive agreement, certain of the Company’s directors and stockholders, representing approximately 17% of the Company’s outstanding shares, entered into voting agreements with Primoris in which they have agreed, among other things, to vote in favor of the transaction.\nWillbros common stock is now traded in the over-the-counter market under the symbol WGRP.\nGreenhill & Co., LLC acted as financial advisor to Willbros, and Conner & Winters, LLP acted as legal advisor.\nAbout Willbros\nWillbros is a specialty energy infrastructure contractor serving the oil and gas and power industries with offerings that primarily include construction, maintenance and facilities development services.
