    "text": "(Reuters) - Magic Leap, a secretive startup working in the augmented reality space, said on Wednesday it raised $461 million in its latest funding round, led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign investment arm.\nThe company said it raised $963 million in the series D round, taking the total funding to over $2.3 billion to date.\nSaudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund joins a clutch of global names such as Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) Google, Alibaba Group ( BABA.N ), Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ), Time Warner’s ( TWX.N ) Warner Bros and J.P. Morgan Investment Management which have invested in Magic Leap.\nMagic Leap in October raised $502 million in a capital funding round, led by Singapore government-owned investment firm Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL].\nThe latest financing round comes as Magic Leap readies to ship in 2018 its long-awaited debut product, “Magic Leap One, Creator Edition”, an AR headset built for developers.\nMagic Leap said Allen & Co LLC served as its financial advisers.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ",
