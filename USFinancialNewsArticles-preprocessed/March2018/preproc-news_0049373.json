    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 3:15 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Japan's Aso rules out chance of yen spike, points to yield differentials Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Thursday the dollar has historically “always” risen against the yen when U.S.-Japanese interest rate differentials widened to 3 percent. Japan's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso speaks to reporters in Tokyo, Japan March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY \n“U.S. interest rates will undoubtedly rise ahead” as tax cuts and higher spending by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration will lead to a bigger fiscal deficit, Aso told parliament. \n“I therefore don’t think there would be one-sided moves in the market,” Aso said, when asked by a lawmaker on what measures Japan could take to counter any abrupt spike in the yen that hurts the country’s economy.
