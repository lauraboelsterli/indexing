    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Thursday that a U.S. military strike in Yemen killed four al Qaeda militants, the seventh such strike in the country this month.\nIn a statement, the Pentagon said the strike against Yemen’s al Qaeda branch, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), was carried out near al-Bayda.\n“No civilians were present and therefore none were injured or killed as a result of the strike,” the statement said.\nReporting by Idrees Ali; editing by Grant McCool\n ",
