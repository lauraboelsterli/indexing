    "text": "On a GAAP 14 week basis, total sales rose 15%, net income increased 92%, and EPS increased 96% On a non-GAAP 13 week basis, Comparable store sales increased 5.9% Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% to $290 million, up 50 basis points Adjusted EPS, excluding the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Reform, rose 22% to $2.17 Introducing outlook for FY18 Adjusted EPS of $5.73-$5.83\nBURLINGTON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Burlington Stores, Inc. (NYSE:BURL), a nationally recognized off-price retailer of high-quality, branded apparel at everyday low prices, today announced its results for the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018.\nTom Kingsbury, CEO, stated, “We are extremely pleased to report strong fourth quarter results, driven by a 5.9% comparable store sales increase, which was on top of last year’s 4.6% increase. On a 13 week basis, we achieved a 22% increase in Adjusted EPS excluding the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Reform. This result was driven by overall sales growth of 10.0% and an improvement of 50 basis points in both Adjusted EBITDA and EBIT margin. We also passed several significant milestones in Fiscal 2017, as we surpassed $6 billion in total sales, expanded our Adjusted EBIT margin by 90 basis points to 8.6%, and achieved record low aged inventory and record high comparable store inventory turnover levels. I would like to thank our store, supply chain and corporate teams for contributing to these strong results.”\nFiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Operating Results\nTotal sales on a 14 week basis increased 14.9% over the prior year period to $1,937 million, while sales increased 10.0% on a 13 week basis to $1,855 million. This growth on a 13 week basis was driven by an incremental $79 million from new and non-comparable stores, as well as a 5.9% increase in comparable store sales. The contribution from new and non-comparable stores was reduced by approximately $25 million due to previously disclosed weather related store closings. Gross margin on a 14 week basis was $814 million. On a 13 week basis, gross margin expanded by 20 basis points over last year’s levels to 42.0%, driven primarily by increased merchandise margin. The gross margin increase was achieved while reducing 91 day and older inventory by 26% vs. the prior year. Product sourcing costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), were flat as a percentage of sales to the Fiscal 2016 fourth quarter. SG&A , less product sourcing costs, on a 14 week basis was $446 million. On a 13 week basis, SG&A, less product sourcing costs, as a percentage of sales was 22.8%, representing a 40 basis point improvement compared with the Fiscal 2016 fourth quarter. This leverage was attained despite the negative impact of 10 basis points each from stock based compensation and incentive compensation. The effective tax rate on a GAAP basis was a benefit of 8.0% vs. last year’s rate of 34.1%, driven lower by the accounting change for stock based compensation and the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017 (“2017 Tax Reform”). The Adjusted Effective Tax Rate was a benefit of 5.9% vs. last year’s rate of 37.2%, due to the same factors. Our Adjusted Effective Tax Rate was 36.6%, excluding the change in accounting for stock based compensation and the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Reform. Please see the table following the financial statements below for a reconciliation of our effective tax rates. Net income on a 14 week basis increased 92% over the prior year period to $241 million, or $3.47 per share vs. $1.77 last year; this result included $0.04 in EPS from the 14 th week. Adjusted Net Income on a 13 week basis, excluding the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Reform, was $2.17 per share vs. $1.78 last year. This improvement in Adjusted Net Income, excluding the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Reform, was driven primarily by top line growth, gross margin expansion, tight expense control, share repurchases and a $0.03 per share benefit from the accounting change for stock based compensation. Fully diluted shares outstanding amounted to 69.3 million for the fourth quarter compared with 70.9 million for last year’s fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of share repurchases under the Company’s share repurchase program, discussed in more detail below. Adjusted EBITDA on a 14 week basis increased 17%, or $43 million above the prior year period, to $298 million. On a 13 week basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased 14%, or $35 million above the prior year period, to $290 million, representing a 50 basis point expansion. This improvement was primarily driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, slightly offset by a reduction in Other Income/Revenue.\nFull Year Fiscal 2017 Operating Results\nOn a 53 week GAAP basis, total sales increased 9.3% to $6,085 million, net income increased 78% to $385 million, and EPS increased 82% to $5.48 vs. the 52 week Fiscal 2016 period. On a 52 week basis, total sales increased 7.8% to $6,003 million. This growth was driven by a comparable store sales increase of 3.4% and $274 million in new and non-comparable sales. The impact of previously disclosed weather related store closings reduced the sales from new and non-comparable sales by approximately $42 million. Adjusted EBITDA on a 53 week basis increased 19%, or $112 million above last year, to $696 million. On a 52 week basis, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 18%, or $104 million above last year, to $688 million, representing a 95 basis point increase in rate vs. Fiscal 2016. Excluding the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Reform, Adjusted Net Income was $4.37 per share vs. $3.24 last year.\nInventory\nMerchandise inventories at Fiscal 2017 year-end were $753 million vs. $702 million last year. The increase was primarily due to inventory related to the 37 net new stores opened during Fiscal 2017, and an increase in pack and hold inventory, which was 25% of total inventory at the end of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017 compared to 23% at the end of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016. Comparable store inventory turnover for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017 improved 10%, and comparable store inventory was down 7% vs. the comparable period a year ago. Inventory aged 91 days and older decreased 26%.\nShare Repurchase Activity\nDuring the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, the Company invested $52 million of cash to repurchase 457,528 shares of its common stock, bringing the total investment in share repurchases to $282 million (representing approximately 3 million shares) during Fiscal 2017. As of the end of the fourth quarter, the Company had $217 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 and First Quarter 2018 Outlook\nFor the full Fiscal Year 2018, the Company expects:\nTotal sales growth in the range of 9% to 10% compared to Fiscal 2017, excluding the 53 rd week; Comparable store sales to increase in the range of 2% to 3% on top of last year’s 3.4% increase; Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 30 to 40 basis points; Depreciation and amortization, exclusive of favorable lease amortization, to be approximately $200 million; Adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points; Interest expense of approximately $60 million; An effective tax rate of 23% to 24%; To open 35 to 40 net new stores, and invest Net Capital Expenditures of approximately $250 million; and Adjusted EPS in the range of $5.73 to $5.83. The Company expects Adjusted EPS excluding the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Reform and the accounting for stock based compensation to be in the range of $4.71 to $4.81, representing an increase of 14% to 16% over the comparable 52 week 2017 Adjusted EPS of $4.14.\nFor the first quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company expects:\nTotal sales to increase in the range of 9.5% to 10.5%; Comparable store sales to increase in the range of 2% to 3%; and Adjusted EPS in the range of $1.05 to $1.09, as compared to $0.79 last year. Excluding the estimated benefit of the 2017 Tax Reform and the accounting change for stock based compensation, the Company expects Adjusted EPS growth to be in the range of 16% to 21%.\nThe Company has not presented a quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures set out above to their most comparable GAAP financial measures because it would require the Company to create estimated ranges on a GAAP basis, which would entail unreasonable effort. Adjustments required to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP measures cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty but may include, among others, costs related to debt amendments, loss on extinguishment of debt, and impairment charges, as well as the tax effect of such items. Some or all those adjustments could be significant.\nNote regarding non-GAAP financial measures\nThe foregoing discussion of the Company’s operating results includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share (or Adjusted EPS), Adjusted EBIT, and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate. The Company believes these measures are useful in evaluating the operating performance of the business and for comparing its historical results to that of other retailers. These non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure later in this document.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter results.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as net income for the period plus (i) net favorable lease amortization, (ii) costs related to debt amendments, (iii) stock option modification expense, (iv) loss on extinguishment of debt, (v) impairment charges, (vi) amounts related to certain litigation and (vii) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains, all of which are tax effected to arrive at Adjusted Net Income.\nAdjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by the fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as defined in the table below.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income for the period before (i) net interest expense, (ii) loss on the extinguishment of debt, (iii) costs related to debt amendments, (iv) stock option modification expense, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) impairment charges, (vii) amounts related to certain litigation, (viii) income tax expense (benefit) and (ix) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains.\nAdjusted EBIT is defined as net income for the period plus (i) net interest expense, (ii) net favorable lease amortization, (iii) loss on the extinguishment of debt, (iv) costs related to debt amendments, (v) stock option modification expense, (vi) impairment charges, (vii) amounts related to certain litigation, (viii) income tax expense (benefit) and (ix) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains.\nAdjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as GAAP effective tax rate less the tax effect of the reconciling items to arrive at Adjusted Net Income (footnote (f) in the table below).\nThe Company presents Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, and certain of those measures as further adjusted for the accounting change for stock based compensation and the estimated effect of the 2017 Tax Reform, because it believes they are useful supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of the Company’s business and provide greater transparency into the results of operations. In particular, the Company believes that excluding certain items that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from what the Company considers to be its core operating results are useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the Company’s ability to generate earnings and leverage sales, and to more readily compare core operating results between past and future periods.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide investors helpful information with respect to the Company’s operations and financial condition. Other companies in the retail industry may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently such that the Company’s calculation may not be directly comparable.\nThe following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the periods indicated:\n(unaudited) (in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended February 3, January 28, February 3, January 28, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (14 Weeks) (53 Weeks) Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income: Net income $ 240,703 $ 125,561 $ 384,852 $ 215,873 Net favorable lease amortization (a) 5,574 5,902 23,325 23,828 Costs related to debt amendments (b) 2,262 — 2,262 1,346 Stock option modification expense (c) 10 81 142 601 Loss on extinguishment of debt (b) 2,881 — 2,881 3,805 Impairment charges (d) 1,140 2,340 2,127 2,450 Litigation accrual (e) — 2,057 — 3,457 Tax effect (f) (3,561 ) (9,807 ) (9,836 ) (19,092 ) Adjusted Net Income $ 249,009 $ 126,134 $ 405,753 $ 232,268 Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding (g) 69,305 70,878 70,288 71,721 Adjusted Earnings per Share $ 3.59 $ 1.78 $ 5.77 $ 3.24 The following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:\n(unaudited) (in thousands) Three Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended February 3, January 28, February 3, January 28, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (14 Weeks) (53 Weeks) Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA:\nNet income $ 240,703 $ 125,561 $ 384,852 $ 215,873 Interest expense 15,368 12,966 58,777 56,161 Interest income (73 ) (14 ) (206 ) (56 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (b) 2,881 — 2,881 3,805 Costs related to debt amendments (b) 2,262 — 2,262 1,346 Stock option modification expense (c) 10 81 142 601 Depreciation and amortization 53,555 46,956 201,103 183,586 Impairment charges (d) 1,140 2,340 2,127 2,450 Litigation accrual (e) — 2,057 — 3,457 Income tax (benefit) expense (17,870 ) 64,971 44,128 117,339 Adjusted EBITDA $ 297,976 $ 254,918 $ 696,066 $ 584,562 The following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBIT for the periods indicated:\n(unaudited) (in thousands) Three Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended February 3, January 28, February 3, January 28, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (14 Weeks) (53 Weeks) Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBIT: Net income $ 240,703 $ 125,561 $ 384,852 $ 215,873 Interest expense 15,368 12,966 58,777 56,161 Interest income (73 ) (14 ) (206 ) (56 ) Net favorable lease amortization (a) 5,574 5,902 23,325 23,828 Loss on extinguishment of debt (b) 2,881 — 2,881 3,805 Costs related to debt amendments (b) 2,262 — 2,262 1,346 Stock option modification expense (c) 10 81 142 601 Impairment charges (d) 1,140 2,340 2,127 2,450 Litigation accrual (e) — 2,057 — 3,457 Income tax (benefit) expense (17,870 ) 64,971 44,128 117,339 Adjusted EBIT $ 249,995 $ 213,864 $ 518,288 $ 424,804 (a) Net favorable lease amortization represents the non-cash amortization expense associated with favorable and unfavorable leases that were recorded as a result of purchase accounting related to the April 13, 2006 Bain Capital acquisition of Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation, and are recorded in the line item “Depreciation and amortization” in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
