    "text": "Investment entities controlled by billionaire Carl Icahn shed one-third of their stakes in crane maker Manitowoc from Feb. 12 through Feb. 22, according to an SEC filing last week. \nThe entities sold nearly 940,000 Manitowoc shares at prices ranging from roughly $32 per share to $34 per share, the SEC filing said . The sales totaled about $31 million. \nAfter the trades, Icahn owned 4.85 percent of the company, down from his previous stake of 7.5 percent.\nManitowoc shares dropped 4.8 percent on Feb. 16 after Commerce Sec. Wilbur Ross released \"Steel and Aluminum 232\" reports at noon that day, which recommended a global tariff of at least 24 percent on all steel imports.\nThe company's stock dropped another 6 percent on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced his plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum as early as next week.\nConstruction equipment makers like Manitowoc use steel in their manufacturing.\nThe investor also reduced his positions in Freeport-McMoRan and Xerox last month, according to filings. Icahn did not return a call from CNBC for comment.\nWATCH: Carl Icahn's biggest market concern show chapters Carl Icahn: My biggest stock market worry is 'creeping inflation'      2:42 PM ET Thu, 1 March 2018 | 02:20",
