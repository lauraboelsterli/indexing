    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- J.P. Harlow is joining Lincoln as Senior Vice President for the company’s LPC West unit, which spans Seattle, Portland, the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego. Based in Seattle, J.P. will head up Lincoln’s activities in Washington State, including acquisitions, development, asset and property management, and repositioning of existing commercial, retail, and mixed-use properties.\nMr. Harlow joins LPC West from PNC Realty Investors, where he oversaw the firm’s west coast acquisitions and development across all major product types including office, multifamily, industrial, and retail. At Lincoln, he will work alongside Patrick Gilligan, who leads all aspects of Lincoln’s activities in the Pacific Northwest as Executive Vice President.\nMost recently, Mr. Gilligan was involved in Starwood Capital Group’s successful repositioning of 300 Pine Street with the addition of a new creative office complex above Westlake Station in downtown Seattle. The creative office space sits on the upper floors of an iconic Seattle building and boasts nearly 500,000 square feet of office space, 15-foot ceiling heights, and renovations including a new office lobby entrance, a jaw-dropping roof deck, and express office elevators.\n“J.P.’s energy and drive make him an incredibly valuable addition to our West Coast team,” said Gilligan. “Having him on board, we are well-positioned to continue Lincoln’s growth and expansion in Washington state.”\nAt PNC, Mr. Harlow spearheaded several high-profile acquisitions up and down the West Coast, including 400 S Hope in Los Angeles, California; Alameda Landing retail center in Alameda, California; and several multifamily development deals in Seattle and San Francisco.
