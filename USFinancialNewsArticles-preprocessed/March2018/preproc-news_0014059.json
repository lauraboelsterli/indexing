    "text": "Student loan borrowers could get some wiggle room when it comes to repaying private loans, thanks to two new proposals in the Senate banking bill.\nThe provisions in the bill would adjust how private student loan lenders treat the death or bankruptcy of co-signers, as well as how defaults are reported on a borrower's credit report.\nThe changes would have positive results for borrowers, student loan experts said. \n\"It's bipartisan, so this legislation is probably going to move,\" said Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert and publisher at the website Private Student Loans Guru .\nThe first proposal makes it so that a lender cannot declare default or accelerate a private education loan when a co-signer of the loan dies or declares bankruptcy.\nIn addition, when the student dies, the private loan lender will be obligated to release the co-signer from the debt, if any remained.\nThose new rules would only apply to private loan agreements made at least 180 days after the bill is passed.\n\"From a fairness perspective, it makes sense to make this no longer an option for future private student loans,\" said Betsy Mayotte, founder and president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors.\nMayotte said she has seen cases where a lender has accelerated a loan in order to make a co-signer's estate liable.\nLenders do have choices in terms of how they enforce these rules, Mayotte said. Anyone who takes out a private student loan, particularly those who need a co-signer, should read the promissory notes carefully, she said.\nshow chapters Student debt could hold back economic growth, Fed chief says      1:59 PM ET Thu, 1 March 2018 | 01:23 The bill also proposes that lenders make it easier for borrowers to get a one-time removal of a default on their loan from their credit report.\nThat is if the financial institution offers a loan rehabilitation program whereby a borrower demonstrates the ability to make timely monthly payments and the ability to repay the loan.\nUnder the terms of the proposal, the lender would have to meet certain requirements in order for the loan rehabilitation program to be considered valid. A borrower would only be able to use this option once per loan.\nWhile there is currently no requirement for lenders to provide rehabilitation programs, it is often possible to negotiate with them to clean up your record in exchange for resuming payments on the loan, Kantrowitz said.\n\"There's no formal requirement that lenders provide rehabilitation, but it is one of the informal things that happens in practice,\" Kantrowitz said.\nTalk to your lender Many borrowers make the mistake of not trying to work with lenders to alleviate issues when they arise, according to Kantrowitz.\n\"Too often borrowers don't talk to the lender,\" Kantrowitz said. \"They don't explore options for avoiding default.\"\nIf you are struggling you repay your student loans, call your lender and evaluate your options, Kantrowitz suggested.\nYou may be able to obtain a forbearance, which can suspend your obligation to make loan payments in the short term, though interest will continue to accrue.\nYou may also want to consider switching to a different payment plan, which can lower your monthly payments, though it will extend the length of the loan and consequently increase the interest you pay.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nSenate banking bill would make credit freezes free \nDear parents, your kid doesn't really care how much college costs \nThe top 10 private colleges with generous financial aid packages",
