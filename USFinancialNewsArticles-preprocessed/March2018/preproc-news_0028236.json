    "text": "Published: Mar 14, 2018 1:47 p.m. ET Share \nAdds announcement could be made as soon as Thursday \nBy Getty Images Larry Kudlow \n  has offered Lawrence Kudlow the job as director of the National Economic Council and he accepted, making the economic commentator one of the president’s top economic advisers, Kudlow said in an interview. \nThe appointment could be announced Thursday, Kudlow said. He would replace Gary Cohn, the investment banker who quit the White House last week after losing out in a battle over tariffs on U.S. steel imports. A White House spokesman declined to comment. \nKudllow, an economist—who worked as a White House budget aide and Wall Street analyst in the 1980s and early 1990s and built a career as a television and radio commentator in the 1990s and 2000s—would bring a mix of views to the White House post. He supported Trump on tax cuts and deregulation, but has argued against the tariffs championed by the president and warned against rising budget deficits.",
