Such a return of capital is not immediately taxable, but reduces your tax basis in our shares, which may result in higher taxes for you even if your shares are sold at a price below your original investment.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the future performance of Priority Income Fund, Inc. Words such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"projects,\" and \"future\" or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
