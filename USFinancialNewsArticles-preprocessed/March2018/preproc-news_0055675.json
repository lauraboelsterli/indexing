    "text": "CHICAGO, March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Continental Materials Corporation (NYSE American:CUO) today reported net income of $1,818,000, or $1.08 per share, for the 2017 fiscal year on sales of $152,810,000. For the 2016 fiscal year, the Company reported net income of $3,686,000, or $2.21 per share, on sales of $151,592,000.\nConsolidated sales in 2017 increased $1,218,000, less than 1.0% compared to 2016. Sales in the Door segment improved moderately, 9.8%, in part due to a strong fourth quarter. Sales in the Heating and Cooling segment increased to a lesser extent, 1.6%. The Concrete, Aggregates and Construction Supplies (CACS) and the Evaporative Cooling segments reported slight decreases in sales, down 1.0% and 1.7%, respectively.\nOperating income decreased $2,825,000 or 48.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. Increased material costs in the CACS, Heating and Cooling and Evaporative Cooling segments were the main contributor to the lower operating profit in the current year.\nDepreciation and amortization charges in 2016 were $118,000 or 4.8% higher in 2017 compared to 2016. Increased capital spending, particularly in the CACS segment, contributed to the rise.\nInterest income in 2017 was $79,000 compared to $306,000 in 2016. The prior year included $252,000 of non-recurring interest income recorded on the redemption of a preferred investment in the CACS segment. Interest expense in 2017 and 2016 was virtually the same, $366,000 and $367,000, respectively. Interest expense on higher average borrowings in 2017 was moderated by lower interest rates negotiated in the second quarter on the Company’s revolving debt. Average outstanding funded debt in 2017 was $5,909,000 compared to $3,712,000 in 2016. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding funded debt, including the availability fee on the unused line of credit and other recurring bank charges but excluding finance charges on letters of credit was approximately 5.3% for 2017 compared to 5.7% for 2016.\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate reflects federal and state statutory income tax rates adjusted for non-deductible expenses, tax credits and other tax items. The current year rate includes the estimated impact of the recently enacted Tax Cut and Jobs Act, effective beginning in 2018. The effective income tax rate for 2017 was 36.0% compared to 36.8% for 2016.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT-- Statements in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.
