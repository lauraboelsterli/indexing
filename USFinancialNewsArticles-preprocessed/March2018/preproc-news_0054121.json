    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Russia will expel four members of the French embassy in Russia, the French foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday.\nEarlier on Friday, the Russian foreign ministry expelled 59 diplomats from 23 countries in a standoff with the West over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, Britain .\nOn Monday, France had expelled four Russian diplomats from France in a show of solidarity with Britain over the poisoning.\n“Russia’s decision to expel four French embassy staff from Russia does not surprise us. We regret this and want to point out that to this day Russia has refused to give any explanation about the attack in Salisbury,” the ministry said.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq, editing by Larry King\n ",
