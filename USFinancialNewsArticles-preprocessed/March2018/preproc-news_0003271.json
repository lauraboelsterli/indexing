(including) private assets, which is 30-40 percent of the asset management fee pie and we’ve barely started on that yet.”\nIn response, shares in Schroders were up 4 percent at 3,585 pence a share at 0826 GMT, leading gainers in a weaker FTSE 100 .\n“Schroders posted better than expected results across most operating metrics,” KBW analyst Jonathan Richards said in a note to clients flagging an‘outperform’ rating and 3,900 pence price target.\n“With 74 percent of assets under management ahead of benchmark over the important 3-year period, we believe Schroders is well positioned to win new business going forward,” he said.\nThe performance of Schroders mirrors a rise in assets at rival managers including Man Group and Jupiter Fund Management this week.\nInvestment gains over the year were 31.6 billion pounds while net inflows were 9.6 billion pounds, it said. A further 8.5 billion pounds was brought in through acquisitions, including that of Swiss private equity firm Adveq.\nHowever, a stronger pound in the second half of the year reduced assets by 12 billion pounds, it added.\nAmong deals completed in 2017 were the acquisition of Swiss private equity company Adveq and UK wealth management firm C.Hoare & Co.\n$1 = 0.7263 pounds Reporting by Simon Jessop, editing by Sinead Cruise and David Evans\n ",
