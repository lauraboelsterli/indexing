    "text": "FENTON, Mich., March 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fentura Financial, Inc. announces another strong quarter with net income of $2,162 and $8,676 for the three and 12 month periods ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The results for the year represent the highest level of earnings reported by Fentura Financial, Inc. with the quarterly results being the second-best quarter on record.\n18.00% increase in stock trading price over December 31, 2016 95.36% increase in net income over 2016 40.59% increase in earnings per share over 2016 30.39% increase in gross loans since December 31, 2016 11.62% increase in total deposits since December 31, 2016 Efficiency ratio improved to 66.20% as compared to 74.56% in 2016 Net interest income increased by 65.86% over 2016 35.00% increase in noninterest income Net interest margin to earning assets improved to 4.01% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017\nThe Corporation’s ability to generate consistent, high quality, loan growth continues to be one of its most significant strengths. This loan growth has been the result of actively pursuing opportunities in existing market areas without sacrificing underwriting standards as credit quality indicators remain at historically low levels. The ability to grow loans at this pace was a direct result of the acquisition of The Community State Bank of St. Charles on December 31, 2016 and its strong deposit base.\nWhile capital ratios have declined during the year, the Corporation’s capital ratios remain in excess of levels considered adequately capitalized by regulatory agencies. The decline in the capital ratios during the year have been a direct result of the robust loan growth.\nRonald L. Justice, President and CEO said, “Our consistent strong operating results reflect our team’s commitment to organically expand our franchise by attracting new and expanding existing client relationships in all business lines. By expanding client relationships we have enhanced net interest income while improving our efficiency, thus strengthening our bottom line.”\nAll historical information prior to December 31, 2016 excludes any impact of the Community State Bank acquisition.\nBalance Sheet Breakdown and Analysis\n12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 12/31/16 ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ 15,928 $ 16,450 $ 29,487 $ 68,202 $ 78,313 Total securities 55,323 67,155 70,699 72,472 72,458 Loans held for sale 2,067 4,835 4,664 514 3,869 Gross loans 672,530 628,552 591,753 554,415 515,775 Less allowance for loan losses 3,603 3,262 3,092 2,877 2,851 Net loans 668,927 625,290 588,661 551,538 512,924 All other assets 39,198 43,237 37,000 37,910 35,786 Total assets $ 781,443 $ 756,967 $ 730,511 $ 730,636 $ 703,350 LIABILITIES AND\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Total deposits $ 673,505 $ 625,588 $ 614,167 $ 630,055 $ 603,367 Total borrowed funds 46,000 68,000 59,000 45,000 45,000 Accrued interest and other liabilties 2,491 6,218 3,089 3,765 4,323 Total liabilities 721,996 699,806 676,256 678,820 652,690 Total shareholders' equity 59,447 57,161 54,255 51,816 50,660 Total liabilities and\nshareholders' equity $ 781,443 $ 756,967 $ 730,511 $ 730,636 $ 703,350 Selected Ratios Net loans to total deposits 99.32 % 99.95 % 95.85 % 87.54 % 85.01 % ALLL to gross loans 0.54 % 0.52 % 0.52 % 0.52 % 0.55 % Book value per share $ 16.37 $ 15.75 $ 14.96 $ 14.31 $ 14.00 Tangible book value per share $ 14.96 $ 14.25 $ 13.42 $ 12.72 $ 13.11 Total capital to risk weighted assets* 10.46 % 10.21 % 10.36 % 10.89 % 11.24 % Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets* 9.91 % 9.70 % 9.84 % 10.36 % 10.72 % CET1 captial ro risk weighted assets* 9.91 % 9.70 % 9.84 % 10.36 % 10.72 % Tier 1 capital to average assets* 8.57 % 8.62 % 8.30 % 7.96 % 11.69 % *The State Bank 12/31/2017 vs 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 vs 12/31/2016 $ Variance % Variance $ Variance % Variance ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ (522 ) -3.17 % $ (62,385 ) -79.66 % Total securities (11,832 ) -17.62 % (17,135 ) -23.65 % Loans held for sale (2,768 ) -57.25 % (1,802 ) -46.58 % Gross loans 43,978 7.00 % 156,755 30.39 % Less allowance for loan losses 341 10.45 % 752 26.38 % Net loans 43,637 6.98 % 156,003 30.41 % All other assets (4,039 ) -9.34 % 3,412 9.53 % Total assets $ 24,476 3.23 % $ 78,093 11.10 % LIABILITIES AND\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Total deposits $ 47,917 7.66 % $ 70,138 11.62 % Total borrowed funds (22,000 ) -32.35 % 1,000 2.22 % Accrued interest and other liabilties (3,727 ) -59.94 % (1,832 ) -42.38 % Total liabilities 22,190 3.17 % 69,306 10.62 % Total shareholders' equity 2,286 4.00 % 8,787 17.35 % Total liabilities and\nshareholders' equity $ 24,476 3.23 % $ 78,093 11.10 % Selected Ratios Net loans to total deposits -0.63 % 14.31 % ALLL to gross loans 0.02 % -0.02 % Book value per share $ 0.62 3.94 % $ 2.37 4.43 % Tangible book value per share $ 0.71 4.98 % $ 1.85 5.42 % Total capital to risk weighted assets* 0.25 % -0.78 % Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets* 0.21 % -0.81 % CET1 captial ro risk weighted assets* 0.21 % -0.81 % Tier 1 capital to average assets* -0.05 % -3.12 %\nThe following tables outline the composition and changes in the loan portfolio as of:\n12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 12/31/16 Commercial real estate $ 298,920 $ 272,292 $ 240,627 $ 226,530 $ 232,543 Residential real estate 234,032 230,994 220,000 204,461 178,706 Commercial 82,667 73,553 79,063 75,916 66,912 Home equity 44,602 39,951 38,434 31,135 30,629 Installment 12,309 11,754 13,628 16,213 6,985 Total loans $ 672,530 $ 628,544 $ 591,752 $ 554,255 $ 515,775 12/31/2017 vs 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 vs 12/31/2016 $ Variance % Variance $ Variance % Variance Commercial real estate $ 26,628 9.78 % $ 66,377 28.54 % Residential real estate 3,038 1.32 % 55,326 30.96 % Commercial 9,114 12.39 % 15,755 23.55 % Home equity 4,651 11.64 % 13,973 45.62 % Installment 555 4.72 % 5,324 76.22 % Total loans $ 43,986 7.00 % $ 156,755 30.39 %\nWe have been successful in growing our loan portfolio in all segments over the past 12 months.

Most of the growth has come in the form of demand deposits and time deposits. The increase in demand deposits has been the direct result of our treasury management team working with municipalities and small business customers to ensure that we have the appropriate mix of products and services at a competitive price. The increase in time deposits has been the result of targeted CD specials and an increase in brokered and internet deposits to fund the remaining growth in the loan portfolio.\nIncome Statement Breakdown and Analysis\nQuarter to Date 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 12/31/16 Interest and dividend income Loans, including fees $ 8,524 $ 7,226 $ 6,931 $ 6,084 $ 4,836 Investments 341 339 323 343 116 Total interest and dividend income 8,865 7,565 7,254 6,427 4,952 Total interest expense 939 792 702 687 614 Net interest income 7,926 6,773 6,552 5,740 4,338 Provision for loan losses 348 136 125 - (900 ) Net interest income, after provision for loan losses 7,578 6,637 6,427 5,740 5,238 Total noninterest income 2,220 3,396 2,138 1,234 1,792 Total noninterest expenses 7,400 5,581 5,742 5,095 5,191 Income before federal income taxes 2,398 4,452 2,823 1,879 1,839 Federal income taxes 236 1,164 884 592 636 Net income $ 2,162 $ 3,288 $ 1,939 $ 1,287 $ 1,203 Quarter to Date 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 12/31/16 Based on GAAP net income Return on Average Assets 1.11 % 1.76 % 1.09 % 0.75 % 0.92 % Efficiency Ratio 72.94 % 54.88 % 66.08 % 73.06 % 84.68 % Earnings Per Share $ 0.60 $ 0.91 $ 0.53 $ 0.35 $ 0.41 Yield on Earning Assets 5.13 % 4.40 % 4.45 % 4.19 % 4.41 % Rate on Int.

The decline in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily the result of increases in compensation expenses. Compensation expenses are expected to normalize in future periods. Included in the one-time items for the fourth quarter of 2017 was the impact of re-valuing the Corporation’s net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the re-valuing of the net deferred tax liability is a one-time item, the Corporation anticipates an increase in net income in 2018 because of lower corporate tax rates resulting from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nThe Corporation has also been successful at consistently increasing adjusted net interest income. This increase continues to be driven primarily through increases in loans. Despite the strong growth in the loan portfolio during 2017, the Corporation maintain relatively strong interest margins. As the Corporation expects to grow its loan portfolio in 2018 at modest levels, net interest income is expected to continue to increase.\nAbout Fentura Financial, Inc. and The State Bank\nFentura Financial, Inc., which had total assets of $781,443 as of 12/31/2017, is the holding company for The State Bank.
