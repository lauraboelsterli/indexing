    "text": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Suspected Boko Haram militants killed at least 11 people including three aid workers in an attack on a military barracks in Nigeria’s northeastern Borno state late on Thursday, according to two security reports seen by Reuters.\nAmbulances carrying the bodies of three killed UN staff are seen leaving the tarmac at Maiduguri Airport, Nigeria March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde The raid in the town of Rann marks the latest high-profile assault by the jihadists in the northeast, coming less than two weeks after militants abducted 110 girls from a school in the town of Dapchi in neighboring Yobe state.\nThe United Nations confirmed three aid workers, all Nigerian nationals, were killed in the attack in Rann, near the Cameroon border, and said a female nurse was missing, feared abducted. It was concerned other civilians may have been killed or injured.\nThe whereabouts of two midwives are also unknown, according to an International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman, who said no Red Cross staff were injured or missing.\nFour soldiers and four police officers were killed, according to the Nigerian security reports.\nThe militants, armed with rocket-propelled grenades and truck-mounted guns, initially overpowered soldiers in a firefight at the military barracks but the armed forces later regained control, according to the two reports.\nThe attack was a further setback for President Muhammadu Buhari, who took office in May 2015 vowing to improve security and who has repeatedly asserted that the Boko Haram insurgency has been defeated.\nSEARCH FOR ABDUCTED GIRLS The government said on Friday that it was extending to neighboring countries the search for the girls taken in Dapchi, which is some 400 km (250 miles) west of Rann. [nL0N1P300A]\nAmbulances carrying the bodies of three killed UN staff are seen at Maiduguri Airport, Nigeria March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde Borno state, where Rann is situated, is the epicenter of the nine-year-old insurgency, which aims to impose a strict interpretation of Islam in the northeast of Africa’s most populous country. More than 20,000 people have been killed and some two million forced to leave their homes since 2009.\nTwo of the aid workers who died were contractors with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), working as coordinators at a camp for 55,000 displaced people in Rann, the United Nations said.\nThe third was a doctor employed as a consultant for UNICEF.\nA Save the Children NGO vehicle drive passes on the street in Maiduguri, Nigeria March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde “We call on authorities to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice and account,” Edward Kallon, the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, said in a statement.\nIOM official Mohammed Abdiker said staff were“outraged and saddened” by the death of their colleagues.\nAttacks on aid workers are rare, but not unheard of, in Nigeria. In December, four people were killed when a World Food Programme (WFP) convoy was ambushed in Borno state.\nBoko Haram held a swathe of territory in northeast Nigeria around the size of Belgium in late 2014. It was pushed out of most of that land by Nigeria’s army, backed by troops from neighboring countries, in early 2015.\nAlthough it has failed to control large areas of land since then, the group continues to carry out suicide bombings and gun raids in northeast Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad.\nThe camp for displaced people in Rann was bombed in a Nigerian Air Force strike last year, killing up to 170 people.\nAdditional reporting by Tom Miles in Geneva; writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ",
