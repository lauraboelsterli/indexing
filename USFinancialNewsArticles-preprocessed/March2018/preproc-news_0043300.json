LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 9,992.00, little changed from its previous close. The Indian rupee is likely to edge higher against the U.S. currency after trade policy uncertainty pulled the dollar index to its lowest level in a month. Indian government bonds are likely to fall in early trade tracking higher crude oil prices, even as traders await the release of the government’s borrowing calendar for the first half of next financial year. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.53 percent-7.60 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street tumbled on Friday with more than 1,000 points knocked off the Dow in two days as investors, increasingly nervous about a potential U.S. trade war with China, shied away from risk ahead of the weekend and sought shelter from further losses. • Fears of a full-blown trade war between the United States and China battered Asian shares again on Monday, keeping the safe haven yen near a 16-month peak as investors fretted over the fate of global growth. • The dollar slipped to a 16-month low against the Japanese yen on Monday, pressured by lingering fears of a global trade war and caution towards political developments in Tokyo. • U.S. Treasury yields rose from six-week lows on Friday in choppy trading as concerns about a global trade war after President Donald Trump announced tariffs on Chinese goods kept investors on edge. • Oil prices reversed earlier gains as concerns of a looming trade dispute between the United States and China weighed on global markets. • Gold prices rose to a five-week high as the threat of a trade war between the United States and China drove investors to seek refuge in safe assets.
