    "text": "QUINCY, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- J.Jill, Inc. (NYSE:JILL) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2018.\nPaula Bennett, President and CEO of J.Jill, Inc. stated, “2017 was a year of growth and learnings. While we finished the year with positive trends, there are also challenges that are being addressed. For the fourth quarter, we delivered positive comp performance of almost 9% driven by strong retail performance, and by the actions we took to clear inventory. Within our Direct channel, we completed the rollout of our new e-commerce platform, however results have not met expectations. As we turn to 2018, the teams are taking important learnings from 2017 and incorporating them throughout the business. Reigniting momentum in the Direct business and using this channel to capture market share is our top priority.”\nFor the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018:\nTotal net sales for the fourteen weeks ended February 3, 2018 were $188.7 million versus $166.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended January 28, 2017. Total company comparable sales increased by 8.9%. This includes comparable store and direct to consumer sales on a thirteen week basis. Direct to consumer net sales represented 46.6% of total net sales, compared to 48.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Gross profit increased to $117.3 million from $105.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Gross margin was 62.2% compared to fourth quarter gross margin of 63.2% in fiscal 2016. SG&A was $105.6 million compared to $94.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 SG&A included approximately $2.3 million of non-recurring expenses. Fourth quarter 2016 SG&A included $2.9 million of non-recurring expenses. Excluding the nonrecurring expenses from both this year’s and last year’s figures, fourth quarter SG&A as a percentage of total net sales was 54.8% versus 55.0% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Income from operations, inclusive of non-recurring SG&A expenses, increased to $11.7 million from $10.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA * for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by 7.6% to $24.2 million from $22.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. As a percentage of total net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 12.8% compared to 13.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Interest expense decreased to $4.7 million from $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, including the impact of a $5.0 million open market repurchase of the Company’s term loan. Income tax benefit was $22.4 million compared to income tax expense of $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and the effective tax rate was (320.3%) compared to 64.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, significantly reduced the federal corporate income tax rate, and required the Company to revalue its deferred income tax liabilities based on the lower enacted federal corporate income tax rate, resulting in a one-time benefit of $24.0 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.67, including the impact of one-time expenses and tax reform compared to $0.05 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share * for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, which excludes non-recurring expenses and other one-time items, including tax reform, affecting diluted earnings per share, was $0.13 compared to $0.08 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nFor the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018:\nTotal net sales for the fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2018 were $698.1 million versus $639.1 million for the fifty-two weeks ended January 28, 2017. Total company comparable sales increased by 6.4%. This includes comparable store and direct to consumer sales on a fifty-two week basis. Direct to consumer net sales represented 43.1% of total net sales compared to 43.2% in fiscal 2016. Gross profit increased to $464.1 million from $427.9 million in fiscal 2016. Gross margin was 66.5% compared to 67.0% in fiscal 2016. SG&A was $394.9 million compared to $368.5 million in fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2017, SG&A included $7.2 million of non-recurring expenses. For fiscal 2016, SG&A included $9.7 million of non-recurring expenses. Excluding these non-recurring expenses in both years, SG&A as a percentage of total net sales was 55.5% compared to 56.1% for fiscal 2016. Income from operations, inclusive of non-recurring SG&A expenses, increased to $69.2 million from $59.4 million for fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA * for fiscal 2017 increased by 6.8% to $113.5 million from $106.2 million in fiscal 2016. As a percentage of total net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 16.3% compared to 16.6% for fiscal 2016. Interest expense was $19.3 million, including $0.7 million of accelerated deferred financing amortization due to the voluntary pre-payment of $20.0 million in the second quarter and a $5.0 million open market repurchase of the Company’s term loan in the fourth quarter, compared to $18.7 million for fiscal 2016. Income tax benefit was $5.4 million compared to income tax expense of $16.7 million in fiscal 2016, and the effective tax rate was (10.9%) compared to 40.9% in fiscal 2016. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, significantly reduced the federal corporate income tax rate, and required the Company to revalue its deferred income tax liabilities based on the lower enacted federal corporate income tax rate, resulting in a one-time benefit of $24.0 million. Diluted earnings per share was $1.27, including the impact of one-time expenses and tax reform compared to $0.55 in fiscal 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share * for the full fiscal year 2017, which excludes net non-recurring expenses and other one-time items, including tax reform, affecting diluted earnings per share, was $0.79 compared to $0.68 in fiscal 2016.\nJ.Jill follows the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (the fifty-third week). The fifty-third week contributed approximately $9.2 million in sales and approximately $0.02 in adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nThe Company ended the fourth quarter fiscal 2017 with $26.0 million in cash. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter fiscal 2017 increased to $80.6 million, and includes approximately $8.4 million from March deliveries captured in the fifty-third week of fiscal 2017, compared to $66.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter fiscal 2016. The Company opened two stores and closed one store in the fourth quarter and ended the quarter with 276 stores.\n* Non-GAAP financial measures. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income” for more information.\nOutlook\nIn light of current business trends and the challenges in our Direct business, the Company expects for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 total comparable sales to decrease in the mid-single digit range. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.20, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.22 and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share of $0.24 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 assumes a $0.04 benefit versus the prior year from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (primarily the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate), which is expected to reduce the company’s effective income tax expense rate to approximately 26%.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results is scheduled for today, March 15, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

The information included on our website is not incorporated by reference herein.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we use the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance:\nAdjusted EBITDA, which represents net income (loss) plus interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation expense, write-off of property and equipment, and other non-recurring expenses, primarily consisting of outside legal and professional fees associated with the initial public offering and subsequent transition to a public company. We present Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis because management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance of our business and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations. Further, we recognize Adjusted EBITDA as a commonly used measure in determining business value and as such, use it internally to report results. Adjusted Net Income, which represents net income (loss) plus other non-recurring expenses and one-time items, primarily consisting of outside legal and professional fees associated with the initial public offering and subsequent transition to a public company. We present Adjusted Net Income on a consolidated basis because management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. Adjusted Earnings per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Adjusted EPS is presented as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period.\nWhile we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS are useful in evaluating our business, they are non-GAAP financial measures that have limitations as analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered alternatives to, or substitutes for, net income (loss) or EPS, which are calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of such non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. We recommend that you review the reconciliation and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS to net income (loss) and EPS, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, under “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income” and not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains, and oral statements made from time to time by our representatives may contain, “ .” Forward-looking statements include statements under “Outlook” and other statements identified by words such as “could,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “continues,” “projects” and similar references to future periods, or by the inclusion of forecasts or projections.
