    "text": "Douglas Russell joins LHS as Senior Vice President & General Manager\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LaVoieHealthScience (LHS), an integrated investor and public relations agency focused on advancing health and science innovations, today announced the continued growth of its strategic communications team with the hiring of Douglas Russell, who is joining LHS as Senior Vice President and General Manager, effective today. LHS is also pleased to announce the addition of two new immuno-oncology clients. One is a publicly-traded Nasdaq listed company and the other is privately-held, Triumvira Immunologics .\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301006207/en/\nDoug Russell, SVP & General Manager at LHS (Photo: Business Wire)\nDouglas Russell has a 25-year background in healthcare and technology integrated communications, and most recently served as Senior Vice President in charge of the Health IT portfolio at MSL in Boston. In this newly-created role at LHS, he reports to CEO Donna L. LaVoie. Doug will work closely with clients, providing client and account leadership for foundational accounts, lead business development and thought leadership, develop and mentor talent, and provide infrastructure development. Doug's experience includes leading teams and launching strategic communications programs for healthcare innovators in areas including telehealth, clinical decision support, analytics, population health management and medical image exchange.\n“The opportunity to join forces with LaVoieHealthScience was one I could not pass up,” said Doug. “The agency’s leadership across communications disciplines, as well as life and health science sectors, is testimony to the team’s accomplishments to date. I look forward to continuing to extend our growth, while offering best-in-class services across our existing client base.”\n“As a strategic communications leader in health and science innovation through all stages of company growth and working with some of the most innovative people and companies in the field, it is a natural fit to extend our leadership at the intersection of technology and health and science,” said Donna L. LaVoie, President & CEO of LaVoieHealthScience. “As we continue to build our client base with companies that are bringing innovation to the market that solve problems through integrating health and technology, this is a natural extension of our expertise that also aligns with Doug’s long history in leadership roles at renowned PR agencies.”\nNew client, Triumvira is a biotechnology company developing a novel platform for engineering T-cells to attack cancers. It’s innovative and proprietary technology, called the T-cell-Antigen Coupler (or TAC), directs T-cells to recognize a protein found on the surface of certain cancer cells. These reprogrammed cells are then expanded and administered back to the patient where they will find and kill cancer cells. Triumvira joins a prestigious group of innovative health and science companies that are represented by LHS for strategic communications, followed by investor and/or public relations solutions.\n“We are excited to add Triumvira to the LHS experience,” added LaVoie. “Companies that are advancing important new immuno-oncology treatment options for solid and blood cancers, either used alone or in combination with other treatments, have critical communication needs. Our team of specialized thinkers and executers are well adept at helping our clients tell their stories to appropriate audiences at the right time.”\nAbout LaVoieHealthScience\nLaVoieHealthScience partners with leading health and science brands to build value for their companies, attract capital and reach key stakeholders through integrated communications and marketing.
