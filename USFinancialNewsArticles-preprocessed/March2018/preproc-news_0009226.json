The words \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"forecast,\" \"initiative,\" \"objective,\" \"plan,\" \"goal,\" \"project,\" \"outlook,\" \"priorities,\" \"target,\" \"intend,\" \"evaluate,\" \"pursue,\" \"commence,\" \"seek,\" \"may,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions is intended to identify forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, including without limitation, statements about our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding future events and our financial performance, are forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. While these statements represent our current judgment on what the future may hold, and we believe these judgments are reasonable, these statements are not guarantees of any events or financial results, and our actual results may differ materially. Important factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our expectations include, among others, the risk that (i) CIT is unsuccessful in implementing its strategy and business plan, (ii) CIT is unable to react to and address key business and regulatory issues, (iii) CIT is unable to achieve the projected revenue growth from its new business initiatives or the projected expense reductions from efficiency improvements, (iv) CIT becomes subject to liquidity constraints and higher funding costs, or (v) the parties to a transaction do not receive or satisfy regulatory or other approvals or conditions on a timely basis or approvals are subject to conditions that are not anticipated. We describe these and other risks that could affect our results in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which the statements were made. CIT undertakes no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, except where expressly required by law.\nContacts\nCIT MEDIA RELATIONS:\nGina Proia\n(212) 771-6008\nGina.Proia@cit.com\nCIT INVESTOR RELATIONS:\nBarbara Callahan\n(973) 740-5058\nBarbara.Callahan@cit.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cit-announces-public-offerings-of-senior-unsecured-notes-and-subordinated-notes-300608972.html\nSOURCE CIT Group Inc.",
