    "text": "St. Petersburg, Florida, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verified Vendor Virtual Driver Interactive Inc. (DUNS #006164627) received a sizable purchase order from the United States Postal Service (USPS). The agency bought twenty of Virtual Driver Interactive’s Virtual Hazard Detection (VHD) Systems. The goal of the acquisition is to continue the reduction of traffic accidents in their vehicle fleet through training in a customizable driving simulation. This $196,000 acquisition marks the company’s biggest sale to a federal buyer. Virtual Driver Interactive (VDI) currently receives assistance from US Federal Contractor Registration maintaining their System for Award Management (SAM) Registration . Find Virtual Driver Interactive’s products on the GSA Advantage Catalog using their GSA contract number (GS-02F-0122W).\nBuilding a Relationship with a Federal Buyer\n“For government, it’s more about a sustained, credible presence and track record than a flashy brochure,” President & CEO Bob Davis explained. Virtual Driver Interactive’s relationship with USPS has grown since 2014. The federal buyer began ordering the Virtual Hazard Detection Systems in small quantities and testing the program with their workforce. While this was happening, VDI continued to tinker with the program to make it more customizable to USPS needs. As they continued ordering the product, the Postal Service was noting reductions in accidents in multiple areas around the country. Eventually, a decision was made which led to this most recent acquisition of twenty of the driving simulator systems.\n“Our products are designed for a customer’s specific customization,”– Bob Davis, President/CEO of Virtual Driver Interactive Inc.\nCustomers looking to purchase company’s simulator are able to select a wide range of fleet vehicles within the program. Whether it is the common passenger vehicle or something more specific like a postal truck, this flexibility makes their product useful to many types of clients. They also offer training for teen drivers and education about safe driving practices.\nStaying Efficient\nThe company has been able to accomplish so much with an efficient team because of their focused approach of developing quality software that runs on specifically designed computers for optimal performance.\nFurthermore, to take advantage federal contracting opportunities they have a valuable resource in US Federal Contractor Registration (USFCR). USFCR manages the company’s SAM registration and is able to develop marketing opportunities.\nPresident/CEO Bob Davis put it this way:\n“Clearly federal government business is a great segment for us. With USFCR we are able to get the word out and find the right people to communicate to.”\nAbout US Federal Contractor Registration\nUS Federal Contractor Registration (USFCR), the world’s largest third-party government registration firm, helps businesses with their federal contracting needs. From registration and training in the government’s systems to marketing a business’s unique capabilities to government agents, USFCR covers the whole spectrum.
