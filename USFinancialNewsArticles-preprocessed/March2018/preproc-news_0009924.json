    "text": "March 3, 2018 / 3:23 PM / Updated 2 hours ago U.N. halts aid work in northeast Nigeria town after humanitarian workers killed Reuters Staff 2 Min Read GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations has suspended aid work helping tens of thousands of people in northeastern Nigeria after an attack by suspected Boko Haram militants left three humanitarian workers dead and at least three others missing, possibly kidnapped. Ambulances carrying the bodies of three killed UN staff are seen leaving the tarmac at Maiduguri Airport, Nigeria March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde The suspension of aid work in the town of Rann, which hosts a camp for 55,000 people displaced by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency, was announced late on Friday in a statement from the spokesman for the UN Secretary-General. UN staff are seen gathering around the ambulances carrying the bodies of the three killed UN staff at Maiduguri Airport, Nigeria March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde The suspected militants killed at least 11 people, including the three aid workers, in an attack on a military barracks in Rann in Borno state late on Thursday, according to two security reports seen by Reuters. “At the time of the attack, over 40 humanitarian workers were in Rann,” said the UN statement.“All humanitarian personnel have been evacuated from Rann, and all humanitarian deliveries in the area have been temporarily suspended.” Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres on Friday said it had suspended its work in Rann following the attack and evacuated both national and international staff.
