Roman, 3M (Photo: 3M)\n“After a thorough and thoughtful succession planning process, Mike is the clear choice to lead 3M into the future as CEO,” said Thulin. “He is an accomplished, results-oriented and high-integrity leader, with an excellent track record of growing sales, improving operational efficiency and increasing value across a wide range of global businesses.”\nRoman, 58, has served as chief operating officer and executive vice president since July 2017, with direct responsibility for 3M’s five business groups, along with the company’s international operations.\nHe has held several other key leadership roles throughout his 30-year career at 3M. Roman led the company’s largest business group, Industrial, which accounts for one-third of 3M’s worldwide sales. Prior to that, he served as 3M’s chief strategist, where he worked closely with Thulin to develop 3M’s strategic roadmap. He has also lived in and led 3M businesses around the world, including the United States, Europe and Asia.\nRoman holds a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Minnesota.\n“It is an honor to lead 3M into the future,” said Roman. “Inge’s leadership has taken 3M to new heights, and I look forward to building on our momentum and delivering value for customers and shareholders.”\nIn his new role as executive chairman of the board, Thulin will continue to chair 3M’s Board of Directors while also working closely with Roman on longer-term strategic initiatives for the company. Thulin has served as 3M’s chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer since 2012.\nMike Eskew, independent lead director for the 3M Board, expressed confidence in these changes. “3M will benefit greatly from having two strong leaders involved going forward,” said Eskew. “We are excited to appoint a highly capable leader like Mike as CEO, while also leveraging Inge’s tremendous experience in his new role as executive chairman of the board.”\nAbout 3M\nAt 3M, we apply science in collaborative ways to improve lives daily.
