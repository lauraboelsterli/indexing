Prior to that, he held a global leadership role with Zimmer; directed U.S. healthcare economics and reimbursement for St. Jude Medical; and held multiple positions in major health systems. Mr. Graver received his MPH in healthcare administration and pharmaceutical economics and a BA in communication and health policy from the University of Arizona.\nSeasoned marketing executive Kathleen Malaspina has over 25 years of international business experience, primarily in the consumer healthcare, medical device and technology sectors.
