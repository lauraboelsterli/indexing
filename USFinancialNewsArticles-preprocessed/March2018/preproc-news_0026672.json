    "text": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ï»¿(TSX:NWC): The North West Company Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"North West\") today reported its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2018. It also announced that the Board of Directors have declared a dividend of $0.32 per share to shareholders of record on March 29, 2018, to be paid on April 16, 2018.\n\"Results were strong in priority areas where we had the most control, notably in Health, Convenience, Financial Services and the post-hurricane recovery of our British Virgin Island stores. We were hurt by hurricane carryover disruptions to supply chains in the Caribbean and severe northern winter conditions over our key December selling period,\" commented President & CEO Edward Kennedy. \"Looking forward, we are focused on improving our Giant Tiger store results and we are positioned to capture growth and returns from the record investment we made in other businesses last year. This includes the build out of our air cargo service and superior performance from spending on new systems and Top Stores.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nSales increased 1.9% to $489.8 million compared to $480.6 million in the fourth quarter last year due to the acquisition of Roadtown Wholesale Trading Ltd. (\"RTW\") in the British Virgin Islands and the acquisition of North Star Air Ltd. (\"NSA\") in Canada. Same store sales gains in International Operations were also a factor. These gains were partially offset by store closures related to hurricanes in the Caribbean and the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of International Operations sales. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, consolidated sales increased 4.2% and were up 0.3% 1 on a same store basis. Food sales 1 increased 1.2% but were flat on a same store basis. General merchandise sales 1 increased 1.8% and were up 1.3% on a same store basis.\nEarnings from operations increased 21.6% to $32.2 million compared to $26.5 million in the fourth quarter last year. Gross profit dollars were up 3.8% driven by the acquisition related sales growth and a 56 basis point increase in gross profit rate compared to last year. The increase in the gross profit rate is mainly due to sales blend changes across the various jurisdictions. Selling, operating and administrative expenses decreased 0.2% and were down 51 basis points as a percentage to sales as expenses related to the RTW and NSA acquisitions and new stores in Canadian Operations were more than offset by the impact of lower share-based compensation costs and hurricane-related store closures. Further information on the RTW and NSA acquisitions is provided in Note 17 to the 2017 fourth quarter unaudited interim period condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe decrease in share-based compensation costs of $9.2 million was largely due to an option expense recovery of $2.8 million this year compared to an option expense of $4.6 million last year. A substantial portion of the options granted are accounted for as a liability and are re-measured based on the share price at each quarterly reporting date. The lower option expense this quarter was due to a decrease in the share price in the quarter this year compared to an increase in the share price in the fourth quarter last year.\nEarnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA 2 ) increased 19.9% to $46.6 million due to the RTW and NSA acquisitions and lower share-based compensation noted above. These gains were partially offset by the impact of the hurricane-related store closures. Excluding the impact of share option expense, adjusted EBITDA 2 was up 0.7% compared to last year and as a percentage to sales was 8.9% compared to 9.0% last year.\nIn December 2017 new corporate tax legislation was enacted in the United States which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. There was also a one-time transition tax introduced on undistributed accumulated earnings in foreign owned subsidiaries. These changes resulted in an income tax expense of $3,896, comprised of $1,827 for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and $2,069 for transition tax related to certain of the Company's subsidiaries.\nNet earnings increased $3.3 million or 21.8% to $18.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.35 per share compared to $0.30 per share last year due to the factors noted above. Excluding the impact of share-based compensation option expense and the one-time tax expense related to U.S. tax reform, adjusted net earnings 2 decreased 1.3%.\nFurther information on the financial results is available in the Company's 2017 fourth quarter Report to Shareholders, Management's Discussion and Analysis and unaudited interim period condensed consolidated financial statements which can be found in the investor section of the Company's website at www.northwest.ca . Hurricane Irma and Maria Impact Hurricane related store closures negatively impacted sales and EBITDA 2 in the quarter by approximately US$23.6 million and US$2.5 million respectively. On an annualized basis, these stores represent approximately US$92.0 million in sales and US$6.6 million in EBITDA 2 . A CUL store in St. Maarten was partially re-opened on November 17, 2017. A CUL Store in St. Thomas and three stores in the BVI require complete reconstruction and are expected to re-open in 2019. Insurance proceeds are expected to be sufficient to cover repair and reconstruction costs. The Company also has business interruption insurance that will help mitigate the earnings impact of the store closures however, the settlement is expected to take approximately 12 to 15 months to complete. The settlement of these claims and the receipt of payments are expected to result in insurance-related gains in the consolidated statements of earnings in subsequent periods.",
