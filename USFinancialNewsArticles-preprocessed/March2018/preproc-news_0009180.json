    "text": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) â€” Berkshire Hathaway's real estate brokerage is expanding overseas with an acquisition in Germany.\nBerkshire Hathaway Home Services said Monday it is adding Berlin-based Rubina Real Estate to its network.\nFinancial terms weren't disclosed.\nThe deal gives Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate another operation in Germany and helps raise the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's profile in Europe.\nGino Blefari is CEO of the real estate network. He says more international franchises are likely.\nBuffett is searching for sizeable acquisitions to invest Berkshire's more than $116 billion cash into.\nBerkshire Hathaway Home Services is based in Irvine, California. It includes over 45,000 agents and 1,400 offices in America.\nRubina Real Estate focuses on helping international investors buy German property. It will become Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Rubina Real Estate next month.",
