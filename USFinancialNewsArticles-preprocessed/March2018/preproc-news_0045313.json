    "text": "CLEARWATER, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bovie Medical Corporation (NYSEMKT:BVX) (the \"Company\"), a maker of medical devices and supplies and the developer of J-Plasma ® , a patented surgical product, today announced the appointment of Scott R. Sanders as Director of Clinical Education and Market Development.\n“I am pleased to announce the addition of Scott Sanders to our team, and look forward to leveraging his 37 years of clinical and sales and marketing experience in the healthcare industry, including over 29 years spent working with energy-based surgical devices.” said Charlie Goodwin, Chief Executive Officer. “Mr. Sanders will be instrumental in both establishing and implementing our strategic plans to develop Bovie Medical’s clinical expertise in the cosmetic surgery market and to enhance our physician and practice support and training.”\nPrior to joining Bovie Medical, Mr. Sanders was employed for more than 16 years at Olympus Corporation and Gyrus ACMI. He joined Gyrus (later Gyrus ACMI) in 2001 as a Business Unit Director, where he was responsible for directing all activities in the company’s laparoscopic business, including the introduction of new electrosurgical products. He was promoted to Director and then Vice President of Procedure and Product Development, where he directed and managed the Company’s product marketing efforts and conducted salesforce and surgeon clinical training across multiple surgical disciplines and procedure categories.\nIn 2007, Mr. Sanders became Group Vice President of Procedure and Product Development for Gyrus ACMI and continued to serve in this role following the company’s acquisition by Olympus in 2008. In this role, he assisted in the creation and implementation of Olympus’s product development, clinical and reimbursement strategies, overseeing departments including R&D, Clinical, Reimbursement, Program Management and Product and Procedure Development. Beginning in 2011, he served as Executive Director of Clinical Marketing of Olympus’s global surgical energy group, coordinating the company’s product development plans and providing clinical training and support for its global salesforce and physician customer base.\nBefore joining Olympus / Gyrus ACMI, Mr. Sanders worked for 13 years at Pfizer Valleylab in a variety of sales and marketing positions of increasing responsibility, culminating in his promotion to Director of Corporate Sales. Mr. Sanders holds a Bachelor’s degree in Biology with minors in Chemistry, Physics and Math from the University of Denver.\nAbout Bovie Medical Corporation :\nBovie Medical Corporation is a leading maker of medical devices and supplies as well as the developer of J-Plasma®, a patented plasma-based surgical product for cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. J-Plasma® utilizes a helium ionization process to produce a stable, focused beam of plasma that provides surgeons with greater precision, minimal invasiveness and an absence of conductive currents through the patient during surgery. The new J-Plasma® handpieces with Cool-Coag™ technology deliver the precision of helium plasma energy, the power of traditional monopolar coagulation and the efficiency of plasma beam coagulation - enabling thin-layer ablation and dissection and fast coagulation with a single instrument, minimizing instrument exchange and allowing a surgeon to focus on their patient and their procedures. With Cool-Coag technology, the new J-Plasma handpieces can deliver three distinctly different energy modalities - further increasing the utility and versatility of the J-Plasma system. Bovie Medical Corporation is also a leader in the manufacture of a range of electrosurgical products and technologies, marketed through both private labels and the Company’s own well-respected brands (Bovie®, IDS™ and DERM™) to distributors worldwide. The Company also leverages its expertise through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements with other medical device manufacturers.
