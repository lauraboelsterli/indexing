    "text": "0 COMMENTS Otherworldly cities modeled on real ones have been a standby of fantasy, from Superman’s Metropolis through China Miéville’s Un Lun Dun to Michael Swanwick’s Babel, with its haints and kobolds, ethnic politics and human ward-heelers. In “The Sky Is Yours” (Hogarth, 457 pages, $27) , Chandler Klang Smith gives us another one with Empire Island, which looks very like the chief city of our Empire State. It even has a Metropolitan Library with stone griffins, instead of lions, flanking the steps.\nEmpire Island hasn’t been the same since the dragons appeared in the sky. They torched the towers, and remain a constant threat. Some say the city isn’t fit for human occupancy any more. But where could the inhabitants go? To them, the rest of the world consists of Upstate, the Sprawl and the Inhospitable West, none of them viable choices.\nNot that this matters to the families at the top, like the Ripples and the Dahlbergs. Duncan, the Ripple scion, has his own show on the Toob and a marriage contract with the Baroness Swan Lenore Dahlberg. But then his HowFly malfunctions and ejects him on to the garbage island out in the bay, where he meets Abby, a waif. She is everything Baroness Swanny isn’t: trusting, thin and sexually dynamic.\nBaroness Swanny also has too many teeth, growing in rows like a shark’s. Some of them are not where you expect teeth to be, which makes Dunk and Swanny’s wedding night a memorable disaster. Soon all three of them are on the run, exploring Empire Island’s many underworlds, like the criminal realm of Eisenhower Sharkey, who controls the market in “chaw,” the cheap drug of choice. Do they have a future? Does the city?\nIf they do, it depends on the dragons. Can anyone figure out the patterns in their behavior, and work out what they want? That requires someone who can talk to magic animals, like Dunk’s loyal apehound Hooligan, the intelligent “lab rats” who infest the city, and the vultures out on Abby’s Hoover Island.\nIt’s a mesmeric world, comic in the way teenage voyages of self-discovery inevitably are, but with an undertone of menace, horror, even hints of allegory. Satire, too. Dunk’s mother, Katya, a former stripper now a trophy wife, is a product of the National Modeling Bureau on a far continent. Swanny’s mother, Pippi, teaches courses for affluent daughters in Reproductive Health, Gemstones of the World and, of course, Prenups and Divorce.\nFantasy, sure, but recognitions flare. Ms. Smith’s imagination is inexhaustible. “The Sky Is Yours” is a great and disturbing debut, which colonizes a new realm of the magic city.",
