(NYSE:PBH) (the “Company”) announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Prestige Brands, Inc. (“Prestige Brands”), has successfully priced the offering of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.375% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “New Notes”). The size of the offering reflects an increase of $50 million from the previously announced offering size of $200 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of its existing term loan facility and to pay related fees and expenses.\nSeparately, the Company closed a repricing of its term loan facility. Following the closing, the margin will be reduced by 50 basis points on the loan. The Company expects the repricing and add-on bond offering in aggregate to have an immaterial EPS impact to its fiscal 2019.\nRon Lombardi, CEO of Prestige Brands, stated, “Our successful refinancing is a testament to our leading and diversified brand portfolio that drives our strong cash flow profile. We continue to execute our three pillar strategy and today’s announcement provides even greater financial flexibility to enhance long-term shareholder value.”\nSenior Notes Issuance Details\nThe New Notes being offered will be issued as additional notes under the Indenture dated February 19, 2016, pursuant to which Prestige Brands previously issued $350 million in aggregate principal amount of existing 6.375% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “Existing Notes”). The New Notes will be treated as a single series with the Existing Notes and will have substantially the same terms as those of the Existing Notes. The New Notes will have a maturity date of March 1, 2024. The closing of the New Notes is expected to be completed on or about March 21, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe New Notes were priced at 101.0% of their face value. The New Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Prestige Brands and will be guaranteed by the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries.\nThe New Notes and related guarantees are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or, outside the United States, to persons other than “U.S. persons” in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the New Notes and related guarantees. Any offers of the New Notes and related guarantees will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The New Notes and related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.\nAbout Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc.\nThe Company markets and distributes brand name over-the-counter healthcare and household cleaning products throughout the U.S. and Canada, Australia, and in certain other international markets.
