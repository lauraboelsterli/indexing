    "text": "2017 Highlights\n2017 revenue on par with 2016; lower HIFU capital equipment sales offset by double-digit HIFU treatment revenue growth CMS issued C-Code allocation for reimbursement of HIFU for prostate tissue ablation in July CIGNA to reimburse HIFU as salvage therapy for prostate cancer patients, at the start of 2018 Meeting scheduled for April 4 with FDA to advance on Focal One clearance final steps 20% growth in our USD division, including lithotripsy, keeps EDAP among world urology leaders Solid liquidity position with cash balance of EUR 20.0 million as of December 31, 2017\nLYON, France, March 27, 2018 -- EDAP TMS SA (Nasdaq:EDAP) (\"the Company\"), the global leader in therapeutic ultrasound, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, and provided an update on strategic and operational developments.\nMarc Oczachowski, EDAP's Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"While 2017 revenue did not meet our expectations due to weak HIFU device sales, we achieved several notable milestones and are encouraged by our commercial and clinical progress as we begin 2018. The decline in our HIFU sales was driven primarily by the decision by U.S. hospital customers to delay purchases of a HIFU system while waiting for Focal One clearance. However, adoption of HIFU continues to grow as more physicians gain comfort and experience with this minimally invasive treatment option. CMS's issuance of a C-Code to reimburse HIFU for prostate tissue ablation and Cigna's decision to reimburse HIFU as a salvage therapy also provide important validation for our technology.\"\nMr. Oczachowkski continued, \"We were also pleased to secure FDA clearance of our Ablatherm Fusion device and look forward to further discussion with the FDA regarding our 510(k) submission for Focal One. A meeting is scheduled with the FDA on April 4 th , 2018 to clarify and reach a common understanding on the new clinical data submitted in our last application\".\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 was EUR 10.6 million (USD 12.6 million), stable as compared to EUR 10.7 million (USD 11.4 million) for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal revenue in the HIFU business for the fourth quarter was EUR 2.5 million (USD 2.9 million), a 46.5% decrease compared to EUR 4.6 million (USD 4.9 million) for the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease was caused in part by the decision of some hospital customers to delay purchasing a HIFU device until the FDA issues a verdict on the Company's 510(k) submission for its Focal One device.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, total revenue for the Lithotripsy division was EUR 8.2 (USD 9.7 million), a 33.9% increase compared to EUR 6.1 million (USD 6.5 million) during the year-ago period.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter 2017 was EUR 4.4 million (USD 5.3 million), compared to EUR 5.2 million (USD 5.6 million) for the year-ago period.
