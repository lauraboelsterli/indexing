    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 7:52 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago Driver plows into people in San Francisco, critically wounding four Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - A driver plowed a vehicle into several people in San Francisco on Wednesday, critically wounding four, before fleeing the scene and triggering a manhunt, police said. \n“Driver of vehicle in a physical altercation with five subjects and struck five subjects with his vehicle,” San Francisco police said in a statement. \nPolice were searching for the driver and the five victims were transported to the hospital, police said, adding that four had life-threatening injuries. \nThe incident took place in San Francisco’s Central Waterfront neighbourhood, police said. \nThey declined to release further details, including whether the driver was a man or a woman or what vehicle the person was driving. \nPaul Lim, who works at a business in the area, told the San Francisco Chronicle he saw the aftermath of the incident. \n“I saw two lifeless people from across the street,” Lim told the newspaper. “Another one was being consoled by a friend screaming for help. And another one was moving very slowly.” Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles and Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Tom Brown",
