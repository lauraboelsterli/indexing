Anthology allows members to privately and anonymously review jobs and companies, and provides insights to what is out there in a discreet, confidential, and intelligent way, which is what randrr is also solving with our platform,” says randrr Founder and CEO Terry Terhark. “We couldn’t be more excited to have such a great company become a part of randrr.”\n“We’ve had the privilege to get to know Terry and his vision for randrr since early 2016. Late last year, it became clear to that combining Anthology’s award-winning anonymous talent marketplace with randrr’s team, users, and career platform could be a game changer. We can’t wait to see how Terry and his team expand Anthology and take it to the next level,” said Anthology Co-founders Tom Leung and Ian Shafer.\n###\nAbout randrr\nGreat careers require drive and good decisions. randrr is the career insights platform everyone can use to make smart career choices.
