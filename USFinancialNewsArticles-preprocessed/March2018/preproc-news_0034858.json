    "text": "STAINES-UPON-THAMES, United Kingdom, March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE: MNK), a leading specialty pharmaceutical company, announced today it has closed the sale of RECOTHROM 速 Thrombin topical (Recombinant) and PREVELEAK 速 Surgical Sealant to Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX).\n\"This action further illustrates the strategic evolution of our portfolio, and will free resources for investing in treatments for seriously ill infants and adults,\" said Mark Trudeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mallinckrodt . \"We believe these products are an excellent fit for Baxter, and this transaction is the best solution to meet patient needs.\"\nThe approximately $185 million transaction consists of a base payment of $153 million, inclusive of existing inventory and subject to a closing inventory adjustment, and the remainder in potential future milestones. Baxter will assume other expenses, including contingent liabilities associated with PREVELEAK.\nRECOTHROM Thrombin topical (Recombinant) and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant, both products for use in the control of bleeding in the surgical suite, are included in the transaction, as well as the manufacturing operation for PREVELEAK.\nAbout Mallinckrodt\nMallinckrodt is a global business that develops, manufactures, markets and distributes specialty pharmaceutical products and therapies.

Do not use for the treatment of massive or brisk arterial bleeding. Do not administer to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to RECOTHROM, any components of RECOTHROM or hamster proteins.\nWarnings and precautions: RECOTHROM may cause thrombosis if it enters the circulatory system. Apply topically. DO NOT INJECT. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur.\nThe most common adverse reaction (incidence 6%) was thromboembolic events. Antibody formation to RECOTHROM occurred in < 1% of patients. None of the antibodies detected neutralized native human thrombin.\nFull prescribing information is available here .\nABOUT PREVELEAK\nPREVELEAK Surgical Sealant is indicated for use in vascular reconstructions to achieve adjunctive hemostasis by mechanically sealing areas of leakage.\nImportant Risk Information\nContraindications: PREVELEAK is not for use in patients with known allergies to materials of bovine or shellfish origin. PREVELEAK is not for intravascular use. PREVELEAK is not for cerebrovascular repair or cerebrospinal leak repair.\nWarnings: Do not use PREVELEAK as a substitute for sutures or staples. Avoid exposure of PREVELEAK to nerves. Do not use PREVELEAK in the presence of obvious infection and use it with caution in contaminated areas of the body. Do not allow either the uncured or polymerized form of PREVELEAK to contact circulating blood. PREVELEAK contains a material of animal origin that may be capable of transmitting infectious agents. Repeated use of PREVELEAK in subsequent surgeries has not been studied. Hypersensitivity reactions were not seen using PREVELEAK, but hypersensitivity of bovine serum albumin has been reported.\nFull instructions for use are available here .\nCautionary Statements Related to Forward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this document that are not strictly historical, including statements regarding the future financial condition and operating results, economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting Mallinckrodt's businesses and any other statements regarding events or developments that the company believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, may be \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.\nThere are a number of important factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those suggested or indicated by such forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.
