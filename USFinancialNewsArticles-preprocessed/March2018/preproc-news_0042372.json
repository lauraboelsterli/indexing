Morgan Stanley upped its price target on the tech giant’s stock, saying its market value could hit $1 trillion on improved margins and growth in cloud computing.\nIntel rose 5.6 percent after brokerage Raymond James upgraded the technology to “market perform”.\nFacebook was a laggard, however, down 1.7 percent as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating how the social network allowed data of 50 million users to get into the hands of Cambridge Analytica.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.04-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nReporting by Stephen Culp Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ",
