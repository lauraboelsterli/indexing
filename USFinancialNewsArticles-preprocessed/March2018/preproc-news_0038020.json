That's within what CheapAir.com calls the \"prime booking window,\" which stretches from 21 to 121 days early to lock in the best prices. \"Fares bounce around but frequently are available for within 5 percent of the lowest price,\" the study says.\nThe time of year you're aiming for matters as well. Here's how far out is ideal for each season:\nSummer Range: 14 to 160 days in advance\nBest fare: 47 days in advance\nFall Range: 21 to 100 days in advance\nBest fare: 69 days in advance\nWinter Range: 21 to 110 days in advance\nBest fare: 62 days in advance\nSpring Range: 46 to 122 days in advance\nBest fare: 90 days in advance\nFor travelers wary of cutting it too close to their vacation, CheapAir.com says booking slightly earlier, 122 to 168 days in advance, will still offer plenty of good deals, but it will you cost an average of $20 more.\nAnd while it's cheaper to fly out on a certain day, it makes no difference when you book your tickets, the study found.\nIt's also worth noting, though, that fares for individual trips are volatile, so it's best to keep an eye on the prices and jump on deals whenever you see them.\nDon't miss:\n8 international destinations you can get to for under $500 The best budget-friendly spring break travel, from Las Vegas to the Caribbean to Disney Now is one of the best times to book a cruise â€” here's how to get a great deal Like this story?
