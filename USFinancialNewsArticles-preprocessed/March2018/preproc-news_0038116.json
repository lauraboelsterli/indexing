    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MEDNAX, Inc. (NYSE:MD), today announced the acquisition of Children’s Eye Care, LLC, a private pediatric ophthalmology practice based in Kirkland, Wash.\nChildren’s Eye Care was established in 2008 and employs two ophthalmologists, one optometrist and eight full-time non-clinical associates. The practice provides pediatric eye care, full surgical services and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) evaluation and treatment, including laser ablation and Avastin® therapy. It also offers an on-site optical shop. Children’s Eye Care has one patient office and provides services to four regional hospitals, including Swedish Medical Center’s First Hill and Issaquah Campuses, Valley Medical Center and EvergreenHealth.\n“Given the changing medical environment, partnering with the MEDNAX national network will allow us to expand while focusing more on caring for patients and less on administrative functions,” said Krista Heidar, M.D., who will serve as medical director for the practice.\nThis acquisition adds to the services MEDNAX provides in Washington through its affiliated network of physicians across multiple specialties, which include maternal-fetal medicine, neonatology, newborn hearing screens, obstetric hospitalist, pediatric cardiology, pediatric intensive care and radiology.\nThis was a cash transaction and it is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings. No additional terms of the transaction were disclosed.\nWith this acquisition, three physician group practices have become part of MEDNAX in 2018.\nABOUT MEDNAX\nMEDNAX, Inc. is a national health solutions partner based in Sunrise, Fla. comprised of the nation's leading providers of physician services.
