    "text": "NEW YORK, March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Greenhill & Co., Inc. (NYSE: GHL), a leading independent investment bank, announced today that Neil A. Augustine will join the Firm in New York as Vice Chairman and Co-Head of North American Financing Advisory & Restructuring.\nMr. Augustine has more than 28 years of experience advising companies and creditors in restructuring and M&A transactions. He was most recently Executive Vice Chairman and Co-Head of North American Debt Advisory and Restructuring at Rothschild Inc., where he spent the last 17 years. His restructuring experience ranges from out-of-court restructurings to in-court insolvencies in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. His M&A experience includes a wide variety of transaction types, as well as buyside and sellside roles for financially distressed companies. His financing advisory experience runs the gamut from traditional refinancings to rescue financings alongside chapter 11 debtor-in-possession and exit financings. Mr. Augustine has testified in bankruptcy court as an expert witness on numerous occasions on a variety of subjects. He was previously one of the founding members of The Blackstone Group's Restructuring and Reorganization Group. He began his career at Chemical Bank, where he was actively involved in advising both debtors and creditors as well as providing debtor-in-possession financing.\nScott L. Bok, Chief Executive Officer of Greenhill, said, \"The recruitment of Neil Augustine, one of the top names in the restructuring advisory business for many years, is a huge step in the expansion of our Financing Advisory & Restructuring team. The expansion of that business has been a core strategic objective of our Firm as we seek to grow and diversify our sources of revenue. As interest rates start to move up, we expect that a major wave of restructuring will come in the not too distant future. In order to maximize our ability to capitalize on that opportunity, we expect to add more resources at all levels as we look to build out further our already strong Financing Advisory & Restructuring team.\"\nEric Mendelsohn and George Mack, Co-Heads of Greenhill's North American Financing Advisory & Restructuring business, said, \"We are pleased to welcome Neil, long one of the leading bankers in the restructuring space, to our team. We all share the objective of building a top-tier restructuring advisory business, which means substantially expanding the strong team we already had in place. Neil's expertise and reputation will be a great strength in expanding our market presence and attracting new talent.\"\nGreenhill & Co., Inc. is a leading independent investment bank entirely focused on providing financial advice on significant mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, financings and capital raising to corporations, partnerships, institutions and governments globally.
