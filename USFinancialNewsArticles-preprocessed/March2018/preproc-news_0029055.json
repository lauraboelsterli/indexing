These benefits are expected to continue in 2018.\nThe Company has approved the procurement and installation of a more efficient site power generating system subsequent to the year-end. Phase I of the project will entail the installation of two 2.5MW Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) generators for a total estimated budget, including contingency, of $9.2 million. The project has an anticipated cost savings of approximately $7 per tonne milled. As the Company integrates the assets, further synergies are expected in supply and procurement, operational and technical support efficiencies.\n2018 CONSOLIDATED PRODUCTION AND COST GUIDANCE (1,2,3)\nConsolidated production guidance for 2018 remains unchanged and is estimated between 400 and 427 million pounds of payable zinc, 43.8 and 46.0 million pounds of payable lead and 1.4 and 1.47 million ounces of payable silver. Consolidated operating costs will range from $60-$66 per tonne.\n2018 Consolidated Production and Cost Guidance (1,2,3)\nMine 2018 Zinc Production\n(million pounds payable) 2018 Lead Production\n(million pounds payable) 2018 Silver Production\n(000 ounces payable) Operating Costs\n(per tonne) Caribou 86-90 27.1-28.4 627-658 $55-$61 Perkoa (100%) (3) 155-165 N/A N/A $103-$113 Rosh Pinah (100%) (3) 105-115 5.7-6.0 123-129 $49-$54 Santander 54-57 11.0-11.6 654-687 $38-$42 Total 400-427 43.8-46.0 1,400-1,474 $60-$66 (1) Constitutes forward-looking information; see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.\n(2) Operating and cash costs are based on various assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to: production volumes, commodity prices (Zn: $1.25/lb Pb: $1.00/lb Ag: $19/lb) and foreign currency exchange rates (N$/USD: 13.00; XOF/USD: 609; PEN/USD 3.25; C$/USD $1.25) and is a non-IFRS measure.

Statements containing forward-looking information express, as at the date of this news release, the Company’s plans, estimates, forecasts, projections, expectations, or beliefs as to future events or results and the Company does not intend, and does not assume any obligation to, update such statements containing the forward-looking information. Such forward-looking statements and information include, but are not limited to statements as to: consolidated production guidance for 2018, expected consolidated operating costs, cash costs (net of by-product credits), timing and costs of the proposed site power generating system, including expected cost savings, synergies in supply and procurement, operational and technical support efficiencies, expectations regarding the updated resource-reserve statement scheduled for completion by late first quarter-2018, timing and results from mill maintenance, including expected lower throughput with mined ore stockpiled for processing in subsequent quarters, the expected benefits from the zinc regrind mill, including improved zinc and lead recoveries and higher-grade concentrates, business improvement programs and improvement of site operational efficiencies, increased production gains and efficiencies, the accuracy of estimated Mineral Resources, anticipated results of future exploration, and forecast future metal prices, expectations that environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, political, marketing or other issues will not materially affect estimates of Mineral Resources. These statements reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and are necessarily based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by the Company, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies.\nMany factors, both known and unknown, could cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the results, performance or achievements that are or may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this news release and the Company has made assumptions and estimates based on or related to many of these factors. Such factors include, without limitation: mine scheduling, fluctuations in spot and forward markets for silver, zinc, base metals and certain other commodities (such as natural gas, fuel oil and electricity); fluctuations in currency markets; risks related to the technological and operational nature of the Company’s business; changes in national and local government, legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and political or economic developments in Canada, the United States, Peru, Namibia, Burkina Faso, or other countries where the Company may carry on business in the future; risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining (including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected geological or structural formations, pressures, cave-ins and flooding); risks relating to the credit worthiness or financial condition of suppliers, refiners and other parties with whom the Company does business; inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks and hazards; employee relations; relationships with and claims by local communities and indigenous populations; availability and increasing costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development, including the risks of obtaining necessary licenses and permits and the presence of laws and regulations that may impose restrictions on mining; diminishing quantities or grades of mineral resources as properties are mined; global financial conditions; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, the Company; the Company’s ability to complete and successfully integrate acquisitions and to mitigate other business combination risks; challenges to, or difficulty in maintaining, the Company’s title to properties and continued ownership thereof; the actual results of current exploration activities, conclusions of economic evaluations, and changes in project parameters to deal with unanticipated economic or other factors; increased competition in the mining industry for properties, equipment, qualified personnel, and their costs. Investors are cautioned against attributing undue certainty or reliance on forward-looking statements. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated, described or intended. The Company does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements or information to reflect changes in assumptions or changes in circumstances or any other events affecting such statements or information, other than as required by applicable law.\nThis press release contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information (collectively, “ FOFI “) about prospective results of operations, including consolidated production guidance for 2018 and expected consolidated operating costs, and cash costs (net of by-product credits), all of which are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations, and qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs.
