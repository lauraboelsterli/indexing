    "text": "NASHUA, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Southern New Hampshire Health announced the appointment of Timothy Scherer, MD, as Chief Medical Officer of Southern New Hampshire Medical Center. Dr. Scherer, a board-certified gastroenterologist, joins the Medical Center from Dartmouth Hitchcock-Nashua, where he most recently served as Medical Director. He will assume his new role effective April 4.\n“Dr. Scherer is an extremely accomplished and talented leader, highly regarded among his peers in southern New Hampshire and nationally, particularly with regard to his ground-breaking work in the area of population health,” says Tate Curti, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of SNHMC. “His extensive clinical experience and leadership skills make him an asset to both the Medical Center and Southern New Hampshire Health.”\nDr. Scherer brings more than 15 years of patient care and medical leadership in the greater Nashua community. In addition to his clinical practice in general gastroenterology, hepatology and advanced endoscopy and administrative leadership role at Dartmouth Hitchcock-Nashua, Dr. Scherer also served on Dartmouth-Hitchcock’s Board of Trustees and the Board of Directors of The Surgery Center of Greater Nashua among many other roles in areas of clinical practice, organizational management and peer leadership.\nDr. Scherer succeeds Kenneth Howe, MD, as Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Howe retired from his role as CMO but continues to maintain a busy practice as a general surgeon at the Medical Center. He endorses Dr. Scherer as an “exceptional choice” based on his experience as a former colleague at Dartmouth-Hitchcock and more recent clinical collaborations with Dr. Scherer, including the Surgery Center of Greater Nashua.\n“Dr. Scherer is distinguished and respected as a physician-leader and clinical expert,” says Dr. Howe. “He brings leadership and change-management that is vital to our continued growth and success as a Medical Center.”\nDr. Scherer looks forward to his new role, providing an unparalleled opportunity to help support the Medical Center’s evolution as an innovative, financially stable organization and integral part of a community-based health system. “Southern New Hampshire Medical Center has shown to be nimble, proactive and committed to becoming both a hospital of the future and a value-based model for ambulatory patient care,” says Dr. Scherer. “This is a fantastic organization with an incredible future and I am excited to be a part of it.”\nDr. Scherer received his B.S. from the State University of New York, Binghamton, and his M.D. from The State University of New York Health Science Center, Brooklyn. He completed his Internship and Residency in Internal Medicine at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon NH, and his Fellowship in Gastroenterology at Lahey Clinic, Burlington Mass.\nHe is a resident of Hollis, New Hampshire.\nAbout Southern New Hampshire Medical Center\nSouthern New Hampshire Medical Center is a 188-bed regional medical facility that serves an estimated 100,000 patients annually. As a clinical affiliate of Massachusetts General Hospital, residents of southern New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts have easy access to advanced clinical expertise in areas including stroke, cancer, trauma and pediatric specialties.
