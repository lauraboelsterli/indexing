This was driven by solid performances from our containerboard division and European subsidiary Reno de Medici, where more favourable pricing and mix outweighed the impact of higher average raw material costs. In the case of containerboard, results also benefited from the consolidation of the Greenpac Mill results beginning in the second quarter of 2017. The specialty products segment delivered results that were below prior year levels due to a lower contribution from recovery and recycling activities. Our tissue division continued to face challenging market conditions in the fourth quarter, which resulted in production downtime to manage inventory. These factors, combined with a less favourable sales price and product mix, higher raw material prices and costs related to the ramp up of the new Oregon converting facility, impacted sales and profitability levels in this segment.\nSequentially, consolidated fourth quarter results reflected a less pronounced seasonal contraction than in prior years. This was primarily driven by results in our containerboard division, which generated increases in sales and operating income compared to the previous quarter, reflecting lower raw material prices and healthy demand. European boxboard operations also performed well, highlighting stronger business conditions, while results in our specialty products division remained relatively stable. Finally, our tissue segment performance was negatively impacted by lower volumes related to both seasonal demand variations and difficult market conditions, and a less favourable sales price and product mix.\nWe continued to make progress on strategic initiatives in 2017. At the corporate level, our internal business process transformation and ERP system initiatives progressed well, with implementations now largely completed. In the containerboard group, we finalized the sale of the Maspeth, NY, converting facility in January 2018 for US$72 million, increased our ownership position in the Greenpac Mill to 66.1%, began the construction of a new state-of-the-art containerboard converting facility in New Jersey, and strengthened our position in Canada with the acquisition of three converting plants and purchase of an interest in Tencorr Holdings Corporation. The European boxboard segment also acquired the Italian boxboard processing company Pac Service S.p.A, by purchasing the 66.67% of shares that it did not already own. Finally, we continued to deliver on our commitment to lower our debt. To this end, our leverage ratio 1 stood at 3.6x as of the end of 2017, down from 3.8x in 2016, and we successfully redeemed US$200 million of our US-denominated debt, which reduces our interest expense and exposure to currency fluctuations.\"\n1\nPro-forma basis to include 2017 business combinations on a LTM basis.\nFinancial Summary\nSelected consolidated information\n(in millions of Canadian dollars, except amounts per common share) (unaudited)\n2017\n2016\nQ4 2017\nQ3 2017\nQ4 2016\nSales\n4,321\n4,001\n1,082\n1,103\n979\nAs Reported\nOperating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD) 1\n390\n413\n104\n104\n83\nOperating income\n175\n221\n45\n51\n33\nNet earnings\n507\n135\n57\n33\n4\nper common share\n$\n5.35\n$\n1.42\n$\n0.60\n$\n0.35\n$\n0.04\nAdjusted 1\nOperating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD)\n393\n403\n105\n106\n82\nOperating income\n178\n211\n46\n53\n32\nNet earnings\n68\n114\n13\n19\n15\nper common share\n$\n0.72\n$\n1.21\n$\n0.14\n$\n0.20\n$\n0.16\nMargin (OIBD)\n9.1\n%\n10.1\n%\n9.7\n%\n9.6\n%\n8.4\n%\n1 - Refer to the \"Supplemental Information on Non-IFRS Measures\" section.\nSegmented Operating Income (loss) as reported\n(in millions of Canadian dollars) (unaudited)\n2017\n2016\nQ4 2017\nQ3 2017\nQ4 2016\nPackaging Products\nContainerboard\n164\n158\n51\n50\n28\nBoxboard Europe\n34\n19\n11\n5\n3\nSpecialty Products\n46\n51\n9\n10\n14\nTissue Papers\n28\n75\n(6)\n9\n12\nCorporate Activities\n(97)\n(82)\n(20)\n(23)\n(24)\nOperating income as reported\n175\n221\n45\n51\n33\nSegmented adjusted OIBD 1\n(in millions of Canadian dollars) (unaudited)\n2017\n2016\nQ4 2017\nQ3 2017\nQ4 2016\nPackaging Products\nContainerboard\n247\n216\n74\n72\n43\nBoxboard Europe\n68\n53\n19\n14\n11\nSpecialty Products\n67\n65\n14\n15\n17\nTissue Papers\n94\n150\n12\n24\n30\nCorporate Activities\n(83)\n(81)\n(14)\n(19)\n(19)\nAdjusted OIBD\n393\n403\n105\n106\n82\n1 - Refer to the \"Supplemental Information on Non-IFRS Measures\" section.\nAnalysis of results for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 (compared to the same period last year)\nSales of $1,082 million increased by $103 million or 11% compared to the same period last year. This was driven by the consolidation of results from the Greenpac Mill beginning in the second quarter, improvements realized in pricing and sales mix in all of the Corporation's business segments with the exception of tissue, and improved volumes in the European boxboard and tissue segments. These benefits were partially offset by a less favourable sales and pricing mix in the tissue segment, and less advantageous foreign exchange rates.\nFourth quarter operating income stood at $45 million, a notable improvement from the $33 million generated last year. This increase is largely attributable to the consolidation of Greenpac and a more favourable pricing and sales mix in the containerboard segment. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher raw material costs in all business segments, and higher amortization and depreciation expense as a result of business combinations. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating income stood at $46 million, versus $32 million in the prior year.\nThe main specific items, before income taxes, that impacted our fourth quarter 2017 operating income and/or net earnings were:\n$2 million reversal of impairment (operating income and net earnings). $1 million restructuring costs associated with the closure of a sales unit (operating income and net earnings). $2 million unrealized loss on financial instruments (operating income and net earnings). $4 million foreign exchange loss on long-term debt and financial instruments (net earnings). $14 million loss related to the early repurchase of long-term debt (net earnings). $59 million income tax gain resulting mainly from the U.S. tax reform announced at the end of 2017 (net earnings).\nThe Corporation generated net earnings of $57 million, or $0.60 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017, versus net earnings of $4 million, or $0.04 per common share in the comparable period of 2016. On an adjusted basis, the Corporation generated net earnings of $13 million, or $0.14 per common share, during the last three months of 2017. This compares to net earnings of $15 million or $0.16 per common share in the same period of 2016. Please see the \"Supplemental Information on Non-IFRS Measures\" section for reconciliation of the amounts detailed above.\nNear-Term and Strategic Outlook\nDiscussing the outlook for Cascades, Mr. Plourde commented: \"We expect several external factors to support results in the near term. The first of these is the combined beneficial impact on our operational performance of the current lower average price for OCC, which accounts for a large portion of the raw materials we use across our operations, and the price increases in linerboard, medium and corrugated products announced for March 5, 2018 in our containerboard segment. The second is the recent corporate tax reform in the US, which will reduce our US corporate tax rate to approximately 25% for 2018, from 38% previously. In addition, underlying industry fundamentals remain positive for both the containerboard business in North America and boxboard operations in Europe. Our tissue division, however, continues to face difficult market conditions, new industry capacity additions, and a slower than anticipated ramp-up of the new Oregon converting facility. On this last point, we are pleased to report that our increased sales and marketing efforts on the West Coast are making inroads in this new end market, and we are confident that this facility will evolve into a solid contributor to our tissue division performance.\nAs we move forward, we will continue to focus on optimizing our new business platform, and harvesting the gains in productivity, efficiency and cost savings generated through our more customer-centric and efficient processes. On a broader scale, we will continue to advance our strategic plan to position Cascades for the long-term. To this end, in the coming year we intend to invest $250 to $300 million, which will include strategic projects focused on increasing integration, improving operational performance through investments in modern equipment, and optimizing our geographic footprint. Furthermore, we are planning additional investments in tissue over the next several years that will modernize the retail and away-from-home business platforms, and equip this segment with an asset base that is competitively positioned for long-term growth. Each and every investment decision will be made with the goal of delivering quality, innovative and competitive products to our customers within a framework focused on optimal capital allocation, long-term market leadership and return while remaining fully committed to our objective of reducing leverage.\"\nDividend on common shares and normal course issuer bid\nThe Board of Directors of Cascades declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share to be paid on March 28, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2018. This dividend is an \"eligible dividend\" as per the Income Tax Act (R.C.S. (1985), Canada). Cascades did not purchase any common shares for cancellation during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n2017 Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call Details\nManagement will discuss the 2017 fourth quarter and annual financial results during a conference call today at 9:00 a.m. EST.

measure of performance under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"); however, the chief operating decision-maker (\"CODM\") uses this performance measure to assess the operating performance of each reportable segment. Earnings for each segment are prepared on the same basis as those of the Corporation. Intersegment operations are recorded on the same basis as sales to third parties, which are at fair market value. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Corporation's accounting policies described in its most recent audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Corporation's operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. The Chief Executive Officer has authority for resource allocation and management of the Corporation's performance, and is therefore the CODM.\nThe Corporation's operations are managed in four segments: Containerboard, Boxboard Europe, Specialty Products (which constitutes the Corporation's Packaging Products) and Tissue Papers.\nSALES\nFor the 3-month periods ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions of Canadian dollars) (unaudited)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nPackaging Products\nContainerboard\n440\n336\n1,652\n1,370\nBoxboard Europe\n212\n191\n838\n796\nSpecialty Products\n161\n156\n703\n620\nIntersegment sales\n(24)\n(16)\n(105)\n(61)\n789\n667\n3,088\n2,725\nTissue Papers\n301\n319\n1,268\n1,305\nIntersegment sales and Corporate activities\n(8)\n(7)\n(35)\n(29)\n1,082\n979\n4,321\n4,001\nOPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nFor the 3-month periods ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions of Canadian dollars) (unaudited)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nPackaging Products\nContainerboard\n73\n42\n238\n214\nBoxboard Europe\n19\n11\n67\n51\nSpecialty Products\n14\n19\n67\n71\n106\n72\n372\n336\nTissue Papers\n12\n30\n90\n139\nCorporate\n(14)\n(19)\n(72)\n(62)\nOperating income before depreciation and amortization\n104\n83\n390\n413\nDepreciation and amortization\n(59)\n(50)\n(215)\n(192)\nFinancing expense and interest expense on employee future benefits\n(24)\n(22)\n(97)\n(93)\nLoss on repurchase of long-term debt\n(14)\n—\n(14)\n—\nForeign exchange gain (loss) on long-term debt and financial instruments\n(4)\n(13)\n23\n22\nFair value revaluation gain on investments\n—\n—\n315\n—\nShare of results of associates and joint ventures\n3\n7\n39\n32\nEarnings before income taxes\n6\n5\n441\n182\nPAYMENTS FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nFor the 3-month periods ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions of Canadian dollars) (unaudited)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nPackaging Products\nContainerboard\n37\n25\n65\n51\nBoxboard Europe\n7\n6\n27\n26\nSpecialty Products\n15\n7\n32\n26\n59\n38\n124\n103\nTissue Papers\n11\n30\n64\n77\nCorporate\n8\n5\n19\n26\nTotal acquisitions\n78\n73\n207\n206\nProceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment\n(1)\n(2)\n(15)\n(5)\nCapital-lease acquisitions\n(4)\n(1)\n(11)\n(18)\n73\n70\n181\n183\nAcquisitions for property, plant and equipment included in \"Trade and other payables\"\nBeginning of period\n11\n10\n25\n19\nEnd of period\n(28)\n(25)\n(28)\n(25)\nPayments for property, plant and equipment net of proceeds from disposals\n56\n55\n178\n177\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON NON-IFRS MEASURES\nSPECIFIC ITEMS\nThe Corporation incurs some specific items that adversely or positively affect its operating results. We believe it is useful for readers to be aware of these items, as they provide additional information to measure performance, compare the Corporation's results between periods and assess operating results and liquidity, notwithstanding these specific items. Management believes these specific items are not necessarily reflective of the Corporation's underlying business operations in measuring and comparing its performance and analyzing future trends. Our definition of specific items may differ from those of other corporations, and some of them may arise in the future and may reduce the Corporation's available cash.\nThey include, but are not limited to, charges for (reversals of) impairment of assets, restructuring gains or costs, loss on refinancing and repurchase of long-term debt, some deferred tax asset provisions or reversals, premiums paid on long-term debt refinancing, gains or losses on the acquisition or sale of a business unit, gains or losses on the share of results of associates and joint ventures, unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps, foreign exchange gains or losses on long-term debt, specific items of discontinued operations and other significant items of an unusual, non-cash or non-recurring nature.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-IFRS MEASURES\nTo provide more information for evaluating the Corporation's performance, the financial information included in this analysis contains certain data that are not performance measures under IFRS (\"non-IFRS measures\") which are also calculated on an adjusted basis to exclude specific items. We believe that providing certain key performance measures and non-IFRS measures is useful to both management and investors as they provide additional information to measure the performance and financial position of the Corporation. It also increases the transparency and clarity of the financial information. The following non-IFRS measures are used in our financial disclosures:\nOperating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBD): Used to assess operating performance and contribution of each segment when excluding depreciation & amortization. OIBD is widely used by investors as a measure of a corporation's ability to incur and service debt and as an evaluation metric. Adjusted OIBD: Used to assess operating performance and contribution of each segment on a comparable basis. Adjusted operating income: Used to assess operating performance of each segment on a comparable basis. Adjusted net earnings: Used to assess the Corporation's consolidated financial performance on a comparable basis. Adjusted free cash flow: Used to assess the Corporation's capacity to generate cash flows to meet financial obligation and/or discretionary items such as share repurchase, dividend increase and strategic investments. Net debt to adjusted OIBD ratio: Used to measure the Corporation's credit performance and evaluate the financial leverage. Net debt to adjusted OIBD ratio on a pro forma basis: Used to measure the Corporation's credit performance and evaluate the financial leverage on a comparable basis including significant business acquisitions and excluding significant business disposals, if any.\nNon-IFRS measures are mainly derived from the consolidated financial statements but do not have meanings prescribed by IFRS. These measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered on their own or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. In addition, our definitions of non-IFRS measures may differ from those of other corporations. Any such modification or reformulation may be significant.\nThe reconciliation of operating income (loss) to OIBD, to adjusted operating income (loss) and to adjusted OIBD by business segment is as
