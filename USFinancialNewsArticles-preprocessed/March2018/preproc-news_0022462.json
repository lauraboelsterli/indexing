That’s why understanding how it will impact you is so important, these advisors said. Planning now can help you sidestep some pitfalls while maximizing your returns next year, they explained. \n“It’s an individual thing on how it impacts people,” said Ron Carson, founder and CEO of Carson Wealth Management Group.
