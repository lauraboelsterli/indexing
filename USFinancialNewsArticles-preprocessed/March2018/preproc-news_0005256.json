    "text": "Published: Mar 1, 2018 1:04 a.m. ET Share \nExecutives from the two industries invited to White House meeting AFP/Getty Images A Chinese worker polishes steel at an offshore oil engineering platform in Qingdao, east China's Shandong province \nBy Jacob M. Schlesinger \nWASHINGTON —The Trump administration has summoned steel and aluminum executives on short notice for a White House meeting on Thursday, telling them that an announcement could be made then on long-awaited curbs on steel and aluminum imports in the name of protecting national security, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThese people said that executives from companies in the two industries had been invited to the White House for a midday meeting with President Donald Trump, and that Mr. Trump and some of his advisers were hoping to use that event to announce broad tariffs or quotas. \nOther people involved in the discussions, however, said that the new policies hadn’t been completed as of Wednesday night, and that the session could just turn into a meeting to discuss possible alternatives. The official White House schedule released shortly after 9 p.m. made no mention of a meeting or an announcement. \nThursday’s meeting between the president and the manufacturing executives comes two weeks after the Commerce Department released the results of a study launched last April looking at whether steel and aluminum imports pose a threat to American defense, by reducing U.S. capacity to make key materials for military equipment, and whether that threat could justify new import curbs under a little-used 1962 trade law.",
