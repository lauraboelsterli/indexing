    "text": "Read 7 Fortune Stories That Won 'Best in Business' Awards from SABEW Bora Tosun Stone—Getty Images/EyeEm By Andrew Nusca 1:29 PM EST \nA leading organization of financial journalists unveiled its picks for the year’s best business writing, and we’re delighted to announce that Fortune brought home seven honors. \nThe “Best in Business” awards, announced Thursday by the Society of American Business Editors and Writers , recognized us for the following work: \n“ The Billion-Dollar Loophole ,” by Peter Elkind and in collaboration with ProPublica, won the Banking/Finance category for medium-sized publications. An incredible investigation into the Republican tax plan revealing that many of the biggest tax-avoidance schemes were left untouched—and a cottage industry has sprung up to cash in on one of them. \n“ Welcome to Tomorrow Land ,” by Vivienne Walt, won the International Reporting category for small- and medium-sized publications. A dispatch from Estonia, the surprisingly cutting-edge European country that’s leading the world in technology. \n“ Whatever It Takes to Win ,” by Jen Wieczner, won the Markets category for small- and medium-sized publications. A report on the sophisticated and sometimes controversial tactics used by Paul Singer’s wildly successful hedge fund Elliott Management. \n“ Can AT&T Retrain 100,000 People? ” by Aaron Pressman, won the Small Business/Management/Career category for medium-sized publications. A look at how the enormous telecommunications company is chasing the future without leaving its employees behind. \n“ The Last Railroad Tycoon ” by Shawn Tully, won the Travel/Transportation category for medium-sized publications. A profile on the late CSX CEO Hunter Harrison, a septuagenarian with a mysterious ailment whose plan for the railroad company ignited investor interest. \n“ Blockchain Mania! ” by Robert Hackett and Jeff John Roberts, received an honorable mention in the Technology category for medium-sized publications. An explanation for why big business is so captivated by the capabilities of blockchain technology. \n“ A Boom with a View ,” Erin Griffith’s long-running column on the impact of technology on society, received an honorable mention in the Commentary/Opinion category for medium-sized publications. \nThe honorees will be celebrated at a ceremony on April 27 in Washington, D.C., but don’t worry—our toasts begin today at Fortune headquarters in New York City.
