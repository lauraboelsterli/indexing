(“Spectra7” or the “Company”), a leading provider of high-performance analog semiconductor products for broadband connectivity markets, today announced its audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The new facility provides upgraded engineering facilities and reduced operating costs.\nQ4 2017 Financial Summary\nRevenue for Q4 2017 was approximately $2.9 million, representing a 45% increase over the prior quarter and 16% over the same period in the prior year.\nGross margin in Q4 2017 was 55%, approximately flat sequentially and down from 60% over the same period in the prior year.\nSupply constraints experienced in Q3 2017 were resolved in the fourth quarter.\nA $1.6M non-cash impairment charge was taken for goodwill accrued in connection with the acquisition of RedMere Technology Limited in February 2013. The Company continues to see strong adoption of its active copper cable products within its core markets.\nUpdate on Data Center Market Traction\nThe Company continues to experience strong traction with its data center solutions and announced six new customer design-ins in Q4 2017.\nThe Company showcased 100/200/400 Gbps data center interconnects at DesignCon 2018.\nThe Company announced key partnerships with three major data center interconnect suppliers including Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd., Luxshare-ICT Inc., and Amphenol ICC.\nWith increased prototype revenue in the Q4 2017, the Company remains on track for production revenue ramp in the second half of 2018.\nHighlights Subsequent to Year End\nClosed a CAD $15.3 million bought deal convertible debenture public offering in January 2018.\nPaid off $6.5M senior secured term loan.\nAnnounced new AR/VR/MR products and reference designs for mobile tethered head mounted displays at CES 2018.\nCEO Commentary\n“I am pleased with Spectra7’s performance in 2017 and the strong Q4 results to end the year,” said Spectra7 CEO Raouf Halim. “This year, we proved our technology leadership in the active copper cable market, announcing several tier one customers in our core VR, AR and MR markets. Moving forward, we are very well positioned in the data center market with the early acceptance and market traction of our innovative GaugeChanger Plus™ technology”.\nOutlook\nBased upon the meetings and sampling requests the Company had for its data center solutions at the DesignCon 2018 industry show, management continues to believe that its data center revenue will begin to ramp up in 2018.\nGiven revenue today is largely derived from consumer-focused markets, investors should expect some weakness in the first quarter of 2018 following the strong holiday season. The Company anticipates stronger sales of MR and VR solutions in the second half of the year. In addition, third-party estimates iii for the Company’s core markets suggest growth will continue over the long-term regardless of seasonality.\nABOUT SPECTRA7 MICROSYSTEMS INC.\nSpectra7 Microsystems Inc. is a high-performance analog semiconductor company delivering unprecedented bandwidth, speed and resolution to enable disruptive industrial design for leading electronics manufacturers in virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, data centers and other connectivity markets.
