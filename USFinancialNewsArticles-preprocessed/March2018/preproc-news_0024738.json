    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass., March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Great Elm Capital Corp. (“we”, “us”, “our” or “GECC”), (NASDAQ:GECC), today announced its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and filed its annual report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nNet investment income (“NII”) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $6.4 million, or $0.60 (1) per share, which was in excess of our declared monthly base distribution of $0.083 per share (or approximately $0.25 per share for the quarter) for the same period, which equated to a 2.4x base distribution coverage or 1.3x coverage when including the special distribution. Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $17.6 million, or $1.52 per share, which equated to a 1.5x base distribution coverage or 1.2x coverage when including the special distribution. In March, the Board of Directors declared monthly distributions of $0.083 per share for the second quarter of 2018, representing a yield of approximately 8.02% of December 31, 2017 NAV. Net assets on December 31, 2017 were approximately $132.3 million. Net asset value (“NAV”) per share on December 31, 2017 was $12.42, as compared to $12.38 per share on September 30, 2017. We had approximately $213 thousand of net realized gains on portfolio investments that were monetized during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, or approximately $0.02 per share, and net unrealized depreciation of investments of approximately ($1.6) million, or approximately ($0.16) per share. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we purchased an aggregate of 77,430 shares through our stock buy-back program at an average price of $10.24, utilizing approximately $792.5 thousand of our $15.0 million 10b5-1 program and our overall $50 million stock repurchase program. From the commencement of the stock buyback program through March 8, 2018, including the tender offer, we have purchased an aggregate of 2,236,651 shares at a weighted average price of $11.18 per share, resulting in approximately $25 million of cumulative cash paid to purchase shares and $0.43 per share in accretion to our NAV. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we invested approximately $46.1 million across 11 portfolio companies (2) , including four new portfolio investments. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we monetized approximately $39.7 million across 16 portfolio companies (in part or in full). (3)\n“As we reflect on our first full year in managing GECC, we are proud to highlight some significant accomplishments: the successful monetization of a number of legacy Full Circle investments; out-earning our regular monthly distribution each quarter of 2017, which we supplemented with a special distribution in Q4 to bring our annual distribution yield to 9.63% of our December 31st NAV; and the on-going thoughtful deployment of capital into a number of attractive risk-adjusted opportunities,” said Peter A. Reed, GECC’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Through these actions, we continue to demonstrate our intense focus on creating long-term shareholder value.”\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nAs of December 31, 2017, we held 24 debt investments across 19 companies, totaling approximately $164.5 million and representing 99.8% of invested capital. First lien and / or senior secured debt investments comprised 99.8% of invested capital as of the same date.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the weighted average current yield on our debt portfolio was approximately 15.3% with approximately 48.1% of invested debt capital in floating rate instruments.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we deployed approximately $46.1 million (2) into new and existing investments across 11 companies (four new investments, seven additional investments). The weighted average price of the new debt investments was 97% of par, carrying a weighted average current yield of 11.4%. All of these investments are first lien and / or senior secured investments.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we monetized 16 investments, in part or in full, for approximately $39.7 million (3) , at a weighted average current yield of 10.4%. Our weighted average realization price was par.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $9.7 million, or $0.92 per share. Net expenses for the period ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $3.3 million, or $0.32 per share.\nNet realized gains for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $213 thousand, or $0.02 per share. Net unrealized depreciation from investments for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was approximately ($1.6) million, or ($0.16) per share.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2017, available liquidity from cash and money market investments was approximately $18.9 million, exclusive of our holdings of United States Treasury Bills.\nTotal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was $32.6 million. Pro forma for the issuance of the GECCM notes in January and February 2018, total debt outstanding as of March 2018 was approximately $79.0 million, comprised of the 6.50% notes due September 2022 (NASDAQ:GECCL) and the 6.75% notes due January 2025 (NASDAQ:GECCM).\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nDistributions:\nOur board of directors declared the monthly distributions for the second fiscal quarter of 2018 at $0.083 per share. The schedule of distribution payments is as follows:\nMonth Rate Record Date Payable Date April $0.083 April 30, 2018 May 15, 2018 May $0.083 May 31, 2018 June 15, 2018 June $0.083 June 29, 2018 July 16, 2018 Our distribution policy has been designed to set a base distribution rate that is well-covered by NII. From time to time, as catalyst-driven investments are realized or when we out-earn our declared distributions, we intend to supplement monthly distributions with special distributions from NII generated in excess of the declared distributions, such as the $0.20 per share special distribution that was declared in December 2017 and paid in January 2018. (4)\nPortfolio Investments:\nIn January 2018, we sold our position in Almonde, Inc. at a price of approximately 101% of par value. In January 2018, we sold $2.0 million of our position in NANA Development Corp. at a price of approximately 101% of par value. In January 2018, we purchased $5.0 million of par value of Sungard Availability Services, Inc. first lien term loan at a price of approximately 93% of par value. Such debt security bears interest at a rate of 3-Month LIBOR plus 7.00% and matures September 30, 2021. In February 2018, we purchased $10.0 million of par value of Full House Resorts, Inc. senior secured first lien notes at an issuance price of approximately 98% of par value. Such debt security bears interest at a rate of 3-Month LIBOR plus 7.00% and matures February 2, 2024. In February 2018, we purchased an additional $4.4 million of par value of Michael Baker International, LLC second lien bonds at a price of approximately 98% of par value. In February 2018, PE Facility Solutions, LLC prepaid approximately $1.0 million of its term loan B at par plus accrued interest. In February and March 2018, we purchased an additional $2.6 million of par value of SESAC Holdco II, LLC second lien loan at a price of approximately par. In March 2018, the court in Caldwell County, Texas ruled in our favor in FCCC v. Pumphrey and awarded us damages of $3.85 million. This amount is in addition to amounts previously collected on our investment in Luling Lodging LLC. While these damages have been awarded to us, there are no guarantees as to their timing or collectability.\nCapitalization:\nIn January and February 2018, we sold approximately $44.9 million of 6.75% notes of 2025 (NASDAQ:GECCM), plus $1.5 million of the over-allotment option for a total issue size of approximately $46.4 million. The seven-year notes mature on January 31, 2025 and are callable after January 31, 2021.
