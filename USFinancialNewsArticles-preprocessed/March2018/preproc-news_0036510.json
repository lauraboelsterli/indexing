He is a true gentleman and we will certainly be sorry to see him go, but wish him all the very best in the future.\"\nShassian joined the Company in November 2013 and was a major contributor to its successful IPO, split-off from CBS, REIT conversion, rebrand to OUTFRONT Media, information technology enhancements, numerous acquisitions and divestitures, and the successful renewal of the New York MTA transit contract.\n\"I am very proud of what we have accomplished in the past four plus years and I feel very confident in the capabilities of the teams we have developed to support the organization for the future,\" said Shassian. \"We have instilled internal discipline and accountability throughout the company focused on driving shareholder value, maintaining a solid balance sheet and maximizing operational and financial flexibility. With the successful outcome of the New York MTA transit contract renewal, OUTFRONT is in a great position for growth, and now is the right time for me to direct my passion and drive toward new endeavors.\"\nThe Company has initiated a search to fill the position and Shassian will assist with the selection process and the transition to his successor.\nAbout OUTFRONT Media Inc.\nOUTFRONT Media connects brands with consumers outside of their homes through one of the largest and most diverse sets of billboard, transit, and mobile assets in North America.
