Adjusted EBITDA improved to $(1.0) million versus $(4.9) million.\nManagement Commentary\n\"AgJunction closed 2017 on a strong note, reporting its third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in a year that was ahead of our operating plan,\" said Dave Vaughn, president and CEO of AgJunction. \"This was driven by continued strong OEM demand in the U.S., Germany and France, as customers continue to adopt precision agriculture products like ours to drive yield and profit improvements.\n\"We believe there is also untapped demand for alternative products from a large segment of the market that has been mostly neglected. This forms the basis of our Hands-Free Farm mission. Introduced in January 2018, Hands-Free Farm makes autosteering more affordable, easier to use, and more accessible for every farmer.\n\"The first step in the trajectory of the Hands-Free Farm movement is REBEL™ from Outback Guidance—the only low-cost, hassle-free autosteering solution that is made to fit any farm and any farmer. This solution is grounded in our innovative, patented technology portfolio, and is supported by a distribution model that is efficient and transparent. We began shipping orders earlier this month and early customer feedback has been strong.\n\"The remainder of 2018 will be focused not only on driving adoption across our suite of products, but also furthering the Hands-Free Farm mission by addressing the needs of the small farmer—an attractive segment of the market that has been largely neglected.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 20% to $9.9 million compared to $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was driven by strong OEM business growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Americas regions.\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 33% to $3.9 million compared to $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin increased 380 basis points to 38.9% compared to 35.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to a favorable mix of higher margin products and the absorption of fixed costs over the higher revenue volume.\nTotal operating expenses increased to $6.8 million compared to $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher R&D costs associated with new corporate initiatives. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses declined to 69.2% compared to 69.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet loss in the fourth quarter improved to $2.7 million or $(0.02) per share, compared to a net loss of $2.9 million or $(0.02) per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $(2.5) million compared to $(2.4) million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $13.9 million compared to $12.9 million at the end of 2016. Working capital was $20.3 million at the end of 2017 compared to $22.4 million at the end of 2016. The Company continues to carry no debt and has access to its full $3.0 million line of credit.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in 2017 increased 11% to $46.8 million compared to $42.3 million in 2016. The increase was driven by 36% revenue growth in the EMEA region and 8% growth in the Americas.\nGross profit increased 18% to $19.4 million compared to $16.5 million in 2016. Gross margin increased 240 basis points to 41.5% compared to 39.1% in 2016. The increase in margin was primarily driven by a favorable product mix.\nTotal operating expenses in 2017 increased to $25.4 million compared to $23.4 million in 2016 due to heightened demand for the company's products and new corporate initiatives. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses in 2017 were 54.2% compared to 55.4% in 2016.\nNet loss in 2017 was $2.7 million or $(0.02) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $18.2 million or ($0.15) per diluted share in 2016, which included an $11.3 million goodwill impairment charge.\nAdjusted EBITDA in 2017 improved to $(1.0) million compared to $(4.9) million in 2016.\nConference Call\nAgJunction will hold a conference call tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss its fourth quarter and full year results, followed by a question-and-answer session.\nDate: Thursday, March 22, 2018\nTime: 11:00 a.m. Eastern time (8:00 a.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-888-231-8191\nInternational dial-in number: 1-647-427-7450\nConference ID: 2987808\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization and goodwill write off. The Company believes that this non-IFRS measure provides useful information to both management and investors in measuring financial performance. As this measure, does not have a standard meaning prescribed by IFRS, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies, and should not be construed as an alternative to other financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS. This non-IFRS measure is provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, non-IFRS measures should never be considered in isolation nor as a substitute to using net income as a measure of profitability or as an alternative to the IFRS consolidated statements of income or other IFRS statements. See \"Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) Reconciliation\" herein for additional information.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking information and forward-looking statements (collectively, \"forward-looking information\") within the meaning of applicable securities laws and is based on the expectations, estimates and projections of management of AgJunction as of the date of this news release, unless otherwise stated.
