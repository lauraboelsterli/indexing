    "text": "Former Microsoft Tax Counsel Named New CTO as Peggi Rockefeller Announces Retirement\nKING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vertex, Inc. , a leading provider of tax technology solutions, today announced the retirement of Chief Tax Officer Peggi Rockefeller who will be succeeded by Mike Bernard, an executive level tax attorney and former senior director - Tax Counsel at Microsoft Corporation.\nUnique in the tax technology industry, Vertex's Chief Tax Office (CTO) provides insight regarding the impact of tax regulations, policy, enforcement and emerging technology trends on global tax department operations. The Vertex CTO group consists of former tax executives from various Fortune 500 multinationals, who bring their in-house tax and industry expertise to Vertex's solution development, services and customer interactions.\n“We welcome Mike who will be working along-side Peggi over the next three months and we look forward to having him bring his corporate experience in tax and technology, and his expertise in tax law to benefit Vertex, as well as its clients and partners,” stated President and CEO David DeStefano.\nBernard joins Vertex from Microsoft Corporation. In his role there he evaluated and managed tax risks and opportunities on behalf of Microsoft business groups, senior executives, attest auditors and the audit committee. He brings 35 years of experience in corporate tax, administration and finance, including a substantive knowledge of U.S. and international tax laws. In addition, Bernard is a widely sought-after expert in the corporate tax industry and possesses an extensive network of relationships with government policy groups and tax administrations. Bernard earned both a J.D. and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Creighton University.\n“I am honored to succeed Peggi and look forward to working with the Vertex team to drive long-term value for clients,” said Bernard. “I believe that the company is well-positioned to continue to deliver unparalleled technology solutions and lead customers through the complexities of indirect tax management and the implications of regulatory reform on multinational enterprises.”\n“I know Mike will be a great addition to the Chief Tax Office and his unique background will enable him to champion the critical tax needs for our customers and partners,” said Rockefeller. “My goal since joining Vertex from ABB Group was to continue to strengthen client relationships through collaboration to create better products and services for them, as well as to benefit the tax technology industry. I feel I have been able to achieve this goal and after 30 years in tax, I have decided to relocate to North Carolina, pursue my passion in real estate, and take more time to spend with my family,” added Rockefeller.\n“Peggi is a true leader and has been a driving force at Vertex, establishing a Client Advisory Board and User Groups that have become an integral part of our development process. We have relied on her not only for enhancing our relationships with clients, but also her leadership, mentorship and strength of character, which has helped our corporate culture evolve — she will truly be missed,” DeStefano added.\nAbout Vertex\nVertex, Inc. is a leading provider of tax technology and services, enabling companies of all sizes to realize the full strategic potential of the tax function by automating and integrating tax processes, while leveraging advanced and predictive analytics of tax data.
