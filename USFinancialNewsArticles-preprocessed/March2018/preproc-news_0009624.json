    "text": "1 COMMENTS Insys Therapeutics INSY 3.73% has lost its former CEO and co-founder , John Kapoor, and several top executives , all charged with conspiracy to illegally distribute an addictive prescription painkiller.\nThe company has lost more than 80% of its market cap since its peak price in 2015 amid declining sales and multiple lawsuits from states over how it marketed Subsys, a mouth-spray version of the potent opioid painkiller fentanyl that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat cancer-related pain. \nBut Insys hasn’t lost all of its following on Wall Street. \nFour of the six analysts who cover Insys still recommend buying the stock. Despite the threat of looming litigation, they note the possibilities in the company’s pipeline and the potential stabilization of Subsys sales, among other things. \nSome short sellers say analysts aren’t doing their homework. To critics, the company’s drug pipeline isn’t that attractive, and the company could end up owing more than what it’s set aside for litigation costs. As of March 2, 16.9% of shares outstanding were being sold short, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.\n“These people are complete imbeciles,” Marc Cohodes, a former Insys short seller, said of the analysts.\nKen Trbovich, a managing director for Janney Montgomery Scott who rates Insys as a “buy,” said his rating is “entirely predicated” on the company’s drug pipeline. Insys is developing two different cannabinoid drugs that patients can take orally or inhale, along with different spray treatments, which aim to treat problems including children’s epilepsy and opioid dependence.\n“The shorts have been right on the stock,” Mr. Trbovich said. “I still think I’m right on the pipeline.”\nThe other firms whose analysts have a buy rating on Insys—RBC Capital Markets, Jefferies and JMP Securities—didn’t respond to requests for comment. \n“What we believe sets Insys apart, and remains underappreciated, is the depth and diversity of our product pipeline,” Insys said in a statement. “Our new management team is firmly committed to fostering an organizational culture of high ethical standards.”\nAnalysts who still recommend buying Insys stock cite the potential stabilization of Subsys sales and the possibilities in the company’s pipeline, among other things. Photo: handout/Reuters A long-running investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts into allegations that Insys officials bribed doctors to prescribe large amounts of the drug led to the arrests of Dr. Kapoor and six former Insys executives and managers. Dr. Kapoor has pleaded not guilty.\nThe office has also subpoenaed the company for documents tied to marketing and sales practices for Subsys , and is also looking into Insys’ patient-services hub.\nSeveral states have sued Insys for deceptive marketing of Subsys, and health insurer Anthem Inc. sued the company over money it paid to cover Subsys prescriptions . The Department of Health and Human Services, meanwhile, is looking into whether Insys violated its programs and has subpoenaed the company for documents, Insys said in a recent filing. \nChief Executive Saeed Motahari, who joined the company last April, said on a November earnings call that the company continues to “work closely and cooperate with all legal authorities.” \nTo pay for a possible settlement with the Justice Department, Insys set aside $150 million last year. It has acknowledged it might have to set aside more. Revenue for Insys peaked in 2015 at $330.3 million. For the first nine months of the 2017 fiscal year, net revenue was down 42% from the same period a year earlier, to $109.2 million. The company cited a drop in Subsys prescriptions. \nRelated Drugmakers Funded Groups Promoting Opioid Use, Senator’s Report Finds (Feb. 12) Epidemic May Be Keeping Americans Out of the Workforce (Sept. 7, 2017) Opioid Maker Bent Rules to Get Drug to Patients, Senate Report Says (Sept. 6, 2017) Opioid-Addiction Diagnoses Up Nearly 500% in Past Seven Years, Study Shows (June 29, 2017) “It’s about as radioactive a product as you’re going to get in the pharmaceutical space,” said David Amsellem, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. Mr. Amsellem, who has a hold rating on the stock, said the company needed to move away from Subsys.\nInsys has said its goal is to file one new drug application every year through 2021. Of the five treatments in Insys’ pipeline, the furthest along is a buprenorphine painkiller spray for which the FDA accepted a new drug application late last year.\nInsys has launched one cannabinoid, called Syndros, that helps AIDS patients who experience appetite loss or people experiencing sickness from chemotherapy. Its sales numbers so far fall short of making up for the losses from Subsys. In the company’s third quarter, Syndros brought in $684,000.\nWrite to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com",
