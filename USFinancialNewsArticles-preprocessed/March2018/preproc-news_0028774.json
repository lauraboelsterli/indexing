    "text": "0 COMMENTS Investors taking a flight on Ctrip.com International CTRP -1.95% are set for a bout of altitude sickness.\nChina’s largest online travel agency, now worth about $25 billion, said its revenue growth will likely slow sharply this quarter, down to 9% to 11% from 39% growth for all of 2017. Ctrip’s Nasdaq-listed stock fell 6% in after-hours trading.\nThe slowdown is coming partly because Ctrip will this year no longer get a bump from its £1.4 billion ($2 billion) acquisition of Skyscanner in 2016. The company started including earnings from the British travel website last year.\nA regulatory change from last summer is set to keep hurting Ctrip as well. China’s aviation regulator asked travel websites in August to stop bundling services like insurance or hotel vouchers when they sell air tickets. Ctrip’s transport ticketing revenue fell 15% sequentially last quarter, despite China’s so-called “Golden Week” in October, when many Chinese take vacations.\nAnd Ctrip is no longer the only game in town. Chinese people have been traveling more as they get richer—they made more than 5 billion trips domestically and 131 million abroad last year—but now Ctrip faces serious competition from deep-pocketed rivals. Meituan Dianping , a $30 billion unicorn backed by Tencent , China’s most valuable company, is ramping up its hotel-booking business. Alibaba’s travel service platform, which goes under the name of Fliggy, is taking advantage of the e-commerce giant’s reach and has entered into partnerships with global hotels and airlines like Marriott and SkyTeam. Direct selling from airlines and hotels also threatens Ctrip’s growth.\nDespite all these risks, Ctrip still trades at 41 times this year’s earnings—higher than most Chinese internet firms and foreign peers. Alibaba, for example, trades at 31 times while Booking Holdings , formerly known as Priceline, trades at 25 times. Ctrip’s valuation is based on consensus estimates that haven’t yet taken into account its weak revenue guidance. Analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence still expect Ctrip’s revenue to grow by 24% on average in 2018.\nCtrip investors need to ready themselves for a swifter-than-expected landing.\nWrite to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com",
