    "text": "HOUSTON, March 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The company has issued a corrected press release to correct two incorrect dates in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows – 2016 and 2015 should be 2017 and 2016.\nHouston Wire & Cable Company (NASDAQ:HWCC) (the “Company”) announced operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelected quarterly results were:\nSales of $82.1 million up 18.6% over 2016 Gross margin of 25.4% up 360 basis points Operating income of $3.0 million compared to a loss of $(1.6) million in 2016 Net income of $2.0 million compared to a net loss of $(1.8) million in 2016 Diluted EPS of $0.12\nSelected annual results were:\nSales of $317.7 million, up 21.4% Gross margin of 22.9% up 270 basis points Operating income of $4.6 million compared to a loss of $(6.5) million in 2016, of which $2.4 million was attributable to an impairment charge, Net loss of $(0.2) million compared to a net loss of $(6.0) million in 2016 Diluted EPS of $(0.01)\nFourth Quarter Summary\nJim Pokluda, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “We are pleased that the upward momentum we experienced in the third quarter continued in the fourth quarter. Although not unexpected, demand in the latter part of the quarter fell in line with the normal lackluster historical trend for this time of year. We estimate that higher metals prices in 2017 represented approximately 7% of the increase in sales. We estimate sales for our project business, which targets end markets for Utility Power Generation, Environmental Compliance, Engineering & Construction, Industrials, and Mechanical Wire Rope, increased 33%, while Maintenance, Repair, and Operations (MRO) sales increased 16%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross margin at 25.4% increased 360 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to incrementally higher product margins driven by continued pricing discipline, prudent purchasing, and metals inflation. Sequentially, gross margin increased 250 basis points, which is indicative that our margin improvement plan is working. Operating expenses at $17.9 million were up $1.2 million or 7.0% from the prior year period, primarily due to higher variable compensation, as sales and profitability improved, and to higher distribution labor costs to handle the volume increase. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 230 basis points from 24.1% in Q4 2016 to 21.8% in Q4 2017.\nInterest expense of $0.6 million was up 48.2% from $0.4 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the additional debt incurred to fund the 2016 Vertex acquisition and additional funds for working capital to service the higher activity levels. Average debt levels for the quarter increased 19.8% from $62.8 million in 2016 to $75.3 in 2017, while the effective interest rate increased from 2.4% in 2016 to 3.0% in 2017.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4%, which included a credit for a valuation allowance of 43.7% and additional deferred tax expense of 13.7%, both due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”).\nMr. Pokluda further commented, “We are encouraged that we have now experienced two quarters of increased sales and improved operating performance. A full year of Vertex activities, coupled with increasing contributions from our commercial products lines and generally higher demand for our products and services, all contributed to these improved results.”\nTwelve Month Summary\nSales for the twelve month period were $317.7 million, up 21.4% from the $261.6 million level in 2016. We estimate that higher metals prices in 2017 represented approximately 3% of the revenue increase. We estimate sales for our project business, increased 3%, while MRO sales increased 15%, as compared to 2016.\nGross margin at 22.9% was up 270 basis points from the 2016 period. “Improved pricing discipline, higher product margins from Vertex for a full year in 2017, and greater customer product demand, contributed to the margin increase” said Mr. Pokluda.\nOperating expenses at $68.1 million increased 14.4% from the prior year amount of $59.5 million. The majority of the increase was due to a full year of Vertex’s operating expenses in 2017, as compared to only three months in 2016, partially offset by the absence in 2017 of the $2.4 million impairment charge recorded in 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 130 basis points from 22.7% in 2016 to 21.4% in 2017.\nInterest expense of $2.1 million increased 145% from $0.8 million in 2016 due primarily to higher debt levels and an increase in average interest rates which moved from 2.0% in 2016 to 2.8% in 2017.\nThe full year effective tax rate of 108.8% included a 41% charge for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets not currently expected to be realized, 15.2% for stock compensation expense and 12.9% for deferred tax assets in respect of the Act rate change.\nThe results of operations generated a net loss of $0.2 million, compared to a net loss of $6.0 million in 2016.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter results today, Friday, March 16, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., C.D.T.
