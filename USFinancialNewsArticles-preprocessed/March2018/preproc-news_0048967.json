Flags with the Opel logo are seen at the Opel headquarters in Ruesselsheim, Germany November 9, 2017. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski “Step by step, we are building a sustainable future for our company in Germany through enhanced competitiveness like we are doing currently across Europe,” Opel Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller said in a statement. Opel’s works council last week demanded “constructive proposals” from parent PSA ( PEUP.PA ) after German sites were excluded from a sweeping investment plan, pending the outcome of further talks with labour representatives. Opel said it wanted to avoid compulsory redundancies and factory closures. Reporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Arno Schuetze",
