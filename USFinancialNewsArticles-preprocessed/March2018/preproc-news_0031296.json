    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: INFI) today announced its fourth quarter 2017 financial results and provided an update on the company, including its progress with IPI-549, a first-in-class oral immuno-oncology product candidate that selectively inhibits phosphoinositide-3-kinase-gamma (PI3K-gamma) and targets immune-suppressive tumor microphages. Infinity is evaluating IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination with Opdivo ® (nivolumab), a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in a Phase 1/1b study in approximately 200 patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\"We made significant progress with IPI-549 over the past year, and 2018 will be an important year for us as we report data from the monotherapy expansion and combination dose escalation components of our study and from seven combination expansion cohorts, which will help define our development and regulatory strategy for this first-in-class product candidate. Based on our initial clinical data, IPI-549 has a favorable tolerability profile and has demonstrated clinical and biological activity, both as a monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. We believe that IPI-549 has the potential to increase the number of patients who respond to immunotherapies as well as to increase the duration of those responses,\" said Adelene Perkins, Chief Executive Officer and Chair of Infinity Pharmaceuticals. \"In addition, we've continued to position Infinity for success by expanding our board and clinical leadership team and establishing a scientific advisory board with thought leaders in the field of immuno-oncology.\"\nRecent developments include the following:\nIPI-549\nAdvanced and expanded clinical development of IPI-549: The Phase 1/1b monotherapy and combination dose escalation components of the study have been completed, and the monotherapy expansion component has been fully enrolled. In addition, six disease-specific combination expansion cohorts are enrolling at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 40 mg once daily of IPI-549 plus Opdivo® (nivolumab) at 240 mg every two weeks in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, mesothelioma, and adrenocortical carcinoma. An additional combination expansion cohort of patients pre-selected for having high baseline blood levels of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is expected to open for enrollment in the next few weeks. Studies have shown that poor response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy is correlated with the presence of high baseline blood levels of MDSCs in cancer patients. 1,2,3 Preliminary translational data from the study demonstrated an association between high baseline blood levels of MDSCs and clinical responses. Preselecting patients with high blood MDSCs could lead to improved clinical activity for patients treated with the combination of IPI-549 and anti-PD1. Presented Phase 1/1b clinical and translational data at SITC: In November, Infinity announced updated data from the monotherapy dose-escalation component of the Phase 1/1b study of IPI-549 in a late-breaking presentation at the SITC Annual Meeting 2017. These data demonstrated that IPI-549 dosed once daily was well tolerated and clinically active. Among 18 patients evaluable for activity, there was a 44 percent clinical benefit rate, defined as patients who had remained on treatment for at least 16 weeks, including one partial response in a patient with advanced peritoneal mesothelioma. Initial translational data from patient blood samples demonstrated that IPI-549 treatment results in a reduction in immune suppression and increased immune stimulation, with upregulation of interferon-gamma responsive factors and reinvigoration/proliferation of exhausted T cells across multiple tumor types and dose levels. Additionally, those patients who showed a clinical benefit had increased numbers of activated monocytes, suggesting a biologic correlate can be identified in patients who remain on treatment longer.\nCorporate\nDavid Beier appointed to Board of Directors: David Beier, J.D., is a Managing Director of Bay City Capital and brings a wealth of experience to the Infinity Board.

Revenue during 2017 was $6.0 million, all of which related to the amount received from Verastem for the DUO study meeting the pre-specified criteria at completion. Revenue during 2016 was $18.7 million related to Infinity's previous collaboration agreement with AbbVie Inc. R&D expense for 2017 was $20.8 million, compared to $119.6 million for 2016. The decrease in R&D expense was primarily related to the company's 2016 restructuring activities and out-licensing of duvelisib to Verastem. General and administrative expense was $21.6 million for 2017, compared to $42.2 million for 2016. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily due to the company's 2016 restructuring activities. Net loss for 2017 was $41.8 million, or a basic and diluted loss per common share of $0.83, compared to a net loss of $30.1 million, or a basic and diluted loss per common share of $0.61 for 2016.\nFinancial Outlook\nInfinity's updated 2018 financial guidance is as follows:\nNet Loss: Infinity expects net loss for 2018 to range from $35 million to $45 million. Cash and Investments: Infinity expects to end 2018 with a year-end cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities balance ranging from $15 million to $25 million. Cash Runway: Based on its current operational plans, Infinity expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities will be adequate to satisfy the company's capital needs into the third quarter of 2019. Infinity's financial guidance excludes additional funding or business development activities and does not include the potential $22 million payment from Verastem upon the first regulatory approval of duvelisib, or a potential $2 million milestone payment from PellePharm, a private company, upon initiation of a Phase 3 study for the hedgehog inhibitor program, which Infinity licensed to PellePharm in 2013. Verastem announced that it submitted a New Drug Application for duvelisib to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on February 7, 2018. With the potential Verastem milestone payment, Infinity expects to extend its cash runway into 2020.\nConference Call Information\nInfinity will host a conference call today, March 15, 2018, at 4:30pm EDT to discuss these financial results and company updates. A live webcast of the conference call can be accessed in the \"Investors/Media\" section of Infinity's website at www.infi.com .

An archived version of the webcast will be available on Infinity's website for 30 days.\nAbout IPI-549 and the Ongoing Phase 1b Study\nIPI-549 is an investigational first-in-class, oral, immuno-oncology product candidate targeting tumor-associated myeloid cells through selective phosphoinositide-3-kinase-gamma (PI3K-gamma) inhibition, thereby reducing pro-tumor macrophage function and increasing anti-tumor macrophage function. In preclinical studies, IPI-549 reprograms macrophages from a pro-tumor (M2), immune suppressive function, to an anti-tumor (M1) immune activating function and can enhance the activity of, and overcome resistance to, checkpoint inhibitors. 4,5 As such, IPI-549 may have the potential to treat a broad range of solid tumors and represents a potentially additive or synergistic approach to restoring anti-tumor immunity in combination with other immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors.\nThe ongoing Phase 1b study being conducted by Infinity is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, activity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination with Opdivo in approximately 200 patients with advanced solid tumors. 6 The study includes monotherapy and combination dose-escalation components, in addition to monotherapy expansion and combination expansion components. The monotherapy dose-escalation component is complete, and the monotherapy expansion component has been fully enrolled. The combination dose-escalation component is also complete, and combination expansion cohorts are enrolling.\nThe combination expansion component of the study includes multiple cohorts designed to evaluate IPI-549 in patients with specific types of cancer, including patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) whose tumors show initial resistance or initially respond to but subsequently develop resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The combination expansion component also includes a cohort of patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have not been previously treated with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, a cohort of patients with mesothelioma, a cohort of patients with adrenocortical carcinoma and a cohort of patients with high baseline blood levels of MDSCs.\nIPI-549 is an investigational compound and its safety and efficacy has not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other health authority.\nAbout Infinity\nInfinity is an innovative biopharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing novel cancer treatments. Infinity is advancing IPI-549, a potentially transformative immuno-oncology approach that aims to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages by selectively inhibiting PI3K-gamma. A Phase 1/1b study in approximately 200 patients with advanced solid tumors is ongoing.
