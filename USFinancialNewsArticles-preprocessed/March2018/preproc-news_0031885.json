(NASDAQ:ULTA) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2017 ended February 3, 2018, both of which contain one additional week (“53 rd week”) versus the comparable prior periods.\n“The Ulta Beauty team delivered excellent results in 2017, achieving 11 percent comparable sales growth and 25 percent adjusted earnings growth,” said Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer. “We also achieved strong sales and earnings growth in Q4 while continuing to gain market share and make significant progress on our strategic imperatives, despite continued moderation in the growth rate of makeup, our largest category.”\nTax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted into law. This new legislation reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018. In accordance with Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company utilized a blended rate of 33.7% for its fiscal 2017 tax year by applying a prorated percentage of the number of days prior to and subsequent to the January 1, 2018 effective date. The Company recorded a provisional estimated after-tax benefit of $38.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 based on the re-measurement of its net deferred tax liabilities and $9.8 million due to the lower tax rate in January 2018. Given the significant complexity of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company will continue to evaluate and analyze the impact of this legislation. The $38.3 million estimate is provisional and based on the Company’s initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and may be adjusted in future periods due to, among other things, additional analysis performed by the Company and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and/or the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These benefits, in part offset by a $12.3 million expense for one-time bonuses for hourly associates, impacted fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.65.\nFor the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017\nNet sales increased 22.6% to $1,937.6 million compared to $1,580.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017, net sales increased 15.7%; Net sales in the 53 rd week were $108.8 million and represented approximately $0.14 of diluted earnings per share; Comparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) increased 8.8% compared to an increase of 16.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The 8.8% comparable sales increase was driven by 6.2% transaction growth and 2.6% growth in average ticket; Retail comparable sales increased 4.2%, including salon comparable sales growth of 3.2%; Salon sales increased 17.2% to $73.7 million compared to $62.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

SG&A increased 50 basis points due to deleverage of investments in store labor to support our growth initiatives and 40 basis points due to the one-time bonus payment related to tax reform, partially offset by leverage of 30 basis points in corporate overhead; Pre-opening expenses decreased to $4.3 million compared to $4.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Real estate activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 included 16 new stores, two relocations and one remodel compared to 25 new stores and one remodel in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016; Operating income increased 13.5% to $254.4 million, or 13.1% of net sales, compared to $224.2 million, or 14.2% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted operating income of $266.7 million, or 13.8% of net sales, increased 19.0%, compared to $224.2 million, or 14.2% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted operating income excludes $12.3 million for one-time bonus payments related to tax reform; Tax rate decreased to 18.3% compared to 37.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease was due to a reduction of net deferred income tax liabilities and a lower effective tax rate in January 2018 as a result of tax reform; Net income increased 48.5% to $208.2 million compared to $140.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016; and Earnings per diluted share increased 51.8% to $3.40, compared to $2.24 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.75, which excludes a $0.65 net benefit due to tax reform related items, increased 22.8%, compared to $2.24 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Results\nFourth Quarter 2017 2016 Diluted EPS (GAAP) $ 3.40 $ 2.24 Adjustments related to tax reform: Re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities (0.62 ) - Impact of lower tax rate in January 2018 (0.16 ) - One-time bonus for hourly associates 0.13 - Adjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP) $ 2.75 $ 2.24 For the Full Year of Fiscal Year 2017\nNet sales, including the benefit of the 53 rd week, increased 21.2% to $5,884.5 million from $4,854.7 million in fiscal 2016.

Excluding the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017, salon sales increased 12.8%; E-commerce sales increased 64.7% to $568.7 million, including the benefit of the 53 rd week, compared to $345.3 million in fiscal 2016. E-commerce comparable sales increased 59.9%, representing 390 basis points of the total company comparable sales increase of 11.0%; Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 35.6% compared to 36.0% in fiscal 2016. Gross profit decreased 30 basis points due to deleverage in merchandise margins and 10 basis points due to the impact of a one-time bonus payment related to tax reform; SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 21.9% compared to 22.1% in fiscal 2016. SG&A decreased 50 basis points due to leverage in corporate overhead and 20 basis points due to leverage in variable store expenses attributed to cost efficiencies and higher sales volume, partially offset by 30 basis points of deleverage in store labor and 20 basis points due to the impact of a one-time bonus payment related to tax reform; Pre-opening expenses increased to $24.3 million, compared to $18.6 million in fiscal 2016. Real estate activity in fiscal 2017 included 102 new stores, seven relocations and 11 remodels compared to 104 new stores, two relocations and 12 remodels in fiscal 2016; Operating income increased 19.9% to $785.3 million, or 13.3% of net sales, compared to $654.8 million, or 13.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2016. Adjusted operating income of $797.6 million or 13.6% of net sales, increased 21.8%, compared to $654.8 million, or 13.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2016. Adjusted operating income excludes $12.3 million for one-time bonus payments related to tax reform; Tax rate decreased to 29.4% compared to 37.5% in fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of net deferred income tax liabilities and a lower effective tax rate in January 2018 as a result of tax reform and the adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal 2017 for employee share-based payments; Net income increased 35.5% to $555.2 million compared to $409.8 million in fiscal 2016; and Earnings per diluted share increased 37.4% to $8.96 compared to $6.52 in fiscal 2016. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $8.16, which excludes a $0.65 net benefit due to tax reform related items and a $0.15 benefit due to accounting for share-based payments, increased 25.2%, compared to $6.52 in fiscal 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Results\nFiscal Year 2017 2016 Diluted EPS (GAAP) $ 8.96 $ 6.52 Adjustments related to tax reform: Re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities (0.62 ) - Impact of lower tax rate in January 2018 (0.16 ) - One-time bonus for hourly associates 0.13 - Other tax rate impacts: Share-based accounting change (0.15 ) - Adjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP) $ 8.16 $ 6.52 Balance Sheet\nMerchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2017 totaled $1,096.4 million compared to $944.0 fiscal 2016, representing an increase of $152.4 million. Average inventory per store increased 5.3% compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in inventory was driven by 100 net new stores, the ramp up of the Dallas, Texas distribution center, investments in inventory to ensure high in-stock levels to support sales growth, and the expansion of certain prestige brands.\nThe Company ended fiscal 2017 with $397.4 million in cash and short-term investments.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased 1,503,545 shares of its stock at a cost of $367.6 million. As of February 3, 2018, $78.6 million remained available under the $425.0 million share repurchase program announced in March 2017.\nOn March 13, 2018, the Company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $625.0 million, which replaces the prior authorization implemented in March 2017. Since 2014, Ulta Beauty has returned nearly $1.0 billion to shareholders through its share repurchase program, while continuing to make strategic growth investments.\nStore Expansion\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company opened 16 stores located in Bixby, OK; Boston, MA; Covington, WA; Fall River, MA; Greenvale, NY; Lafayette, IN; Lake Jackson, TX; Los Angeles, CA; Memphis, TN; Midlothian, TX; Montvale, NJ; North Miami Beach, FL; San Antonio, TX; St. Peters, MO; Turnersville, NJ; and White Lake, MI. The Company ended fiscal 2017 with 1,074 stores and square footage of 11,300,920, representing a 10.0% increase in square footage compared to fiscal 2016.\nOutlook\n“Looking ahead to 2018, we are deploying a portion of the tax reform benefits to invest in our people and accelerate investments to drive growth and innovation,” said Mary Dillon. “We also recognize operating margin headwinds from various cost pressures facing all retailers, our higher than expected mix of e-commerce, and the new revenue recognition accounting standard. To help offset these pressures, we are implementing a cost optimization program to deliver benefits in the areas of indirect procurement, end-to-end operational efficiency, real estate costs, and merchandise margin improvement. We plan to increase operating profit margin rate over the long term, but this measure is expected to decline modestly in 2018. Going forward, rather than guiding to a precise operating margin target or timeline, we will instead ask our stakeholders to focus on how we create value through our very healthy earnings per share and margin dollar growth. We are confident that our plan allows us to continue delivering industry leading results, while making us a more competitive employer, enhancing the guest experience, and allowing us to invest in growth platforms to drive sustainable differentiation and the long-term success of the business.”\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company plans to:\nincrease total sales in the low teens percentage range; achieve comparable sales growth of approximately 6% to 8%, including the impact of e-commerce; grow e-commerce sales in the 40% range; open approximately 100 new stores and execute 17 remodel or relocation projects; adopt Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will increase sales by approximately $50 million and decrease operating profit margin rate by approximately 20 basis points; deleverage operating profit margin rate in the range of 50 to 70 basis points; deliver GAAP earnings per share growth in the 20 percentage range, including the impact of approximately $500 million in share repurchases and assuming a 24% effective tax rate; and incur capital expenditures of $375 million in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017 capital expenditures of $441 million.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company expects net sales in the range of $1,506 million to $1,519 million, compared to actual net sales of $1,314.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, including e-commerce sales, are expected to increase 6% to 7%. The Company reported a comparable sales increase of 14.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nEarnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is estimated to be in the range of $2.43 to $2.48. This compares to earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 of $2.05.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company has used non-GAAP financial measures in this press release.
