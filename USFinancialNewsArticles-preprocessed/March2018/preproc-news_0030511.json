People sit in a truck with their belongings in the north east of Afrin, Syria March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi Turkish forces and allied Syrian militias are targeting Afrin in an offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia in northwestern Syria. The Observatory said families left the town in buses and cars towards Nubl and al-Zahra, Shiâ€™ite Muslim villages that are loyal to the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian government has sided with the YPG against Turkey in Afrin. Writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Andrew Heavens",
