    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif., March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corium International, Inc. (Nasdaq:CORI), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of specialty transdermal products, today announced the pricing of its offering of $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Corium also granted the initial purchaser of the notes a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $20,000,000 aggregate principal amount of notes. The sale of the notes is expected to close on March 5, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co. is acting as the sole manager for the offering.\nThe notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Corium, and interest of 5% per year will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes will mature on March 15, 2025 and be convertible, at the option of the holders, into shares of Corium’s common stock. The initial conversion rate will be 58.0552 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $17.22 per share).\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture relating to the notes), holders of the notes will have the right to require Corium to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant fundamental change repurchase date. In certain circumstances, Corium will also be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with certain fundamental changes occurring prior to the maturity date.\nCorium intends to use approximately $56 million to repay in full its outstanding borrowings under its term loan agreement with CRG, and the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nThis announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities (including the shares of Corium’s common stock, if any, into which the notes are convertible) and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. Any offers of the notes will be made only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.\nThe notes and any shares of Corium’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\nAbout Corium\nCorium International, Inc. is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of specialty pharmaceutical products that leverage the company's broad experience with advanced transdermal and transmucosal delivery systems.
