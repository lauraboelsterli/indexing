    "text": "BOISE, Idaho, March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Micron Technology, Inc., (NASDAQ:MU) today announced results of operations for its second quarter of fiscal 2018, which ended March 1, 2018.\nFiscal Q2 2018 Highlights\nRevenues of $7.35 billion, up 58 percent compared with the same period last year GAAP net income of $3.31 billion, or $2.67 per diluted share Non-GAAP net income of $3.50 billion, or $2.82 per diluted share Operating cash flow of $4.35 billion, compared with $1.77 billion for the same period last year (adjusted for the Inotera acquisition)\n\"Micron executed exceptionally well in the second quarter, delivering record results and strong free cash flow driven by broad-based demand for our memory and storage solutions. Our performance was accentuated by an ongoing shift to high-value solutions as we grew sales to our cloud, mobile and automotive customers and set new records for SSDs and graphics memory,\" said Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. \"Secular technology trends are driving robust demand for memory and storage, and Micron is well-positioned to address these growing opportunities.\"\nQuarterly Financial Results (in millions except per share amounts) GAAP (1) Non-GAAP (2) FQ2-18 FQ1-18 FQ2-17 FQ2-18 FQ1-18 FQ2-17 Net sales $ 7,351 $ 6,803 $ 4,648 $ 7,351 $ 6,803 $ 4,648 Gross margin $ 4,270 $ 3,747 $ 1,704 $ 4,296 $ 3,769 $ 1,789 percent of net sales 58.1 % 55.1 % 36.7 % 58.4 % 55.4 % 38.5 % Operating income $ 3,567 $ 3,097 $ 1,044 $ 3,630 $ 3,157 $ 1,177 percent of net sales 48.5 % 45.5 % 22.5 % 49.4 % 46.4 % 25.3 % Net income attributable to Micron $ 3,309 $ 2,678 $ 894 $ 3,495 $ 2,994 $ 1,031 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.67 $ 2.19 $ 0.77 $ 2.82 $ 2.45 $ 0.90 Revenues for the second quarter of 2018 were 8 percent higher compared to the first quarter of 2018, reflecting increased demand broadly across our products and end markets. Our overall consolidated gross margin of 58.1 percent for the second quarter of 2018 was higher compared to 55.1 percent for the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to execution across our product portfolio.\nInvestments in capital expenditures, net of amounts funded by partners, were $2.11 billion, which resulted in adjusted free cash flows of $2.2 billion for the second quarter of 2018. We ended the second quarter with cash, marketable investments, and restricted cash of $8.68 billion.\nWe will host a conference call on Thursday, March 22, 2018 at 2:30 p.m. MT to discuss our financial results.

(1) In the first and second quarters of 2018, Intel Corporation provided non-interest bearing convertible debt financing of $150 million and $500 million, respectively, to IM Flash Technologies, LLC (\"IMFT\") pursuant to the terms of the IMFT joint venture agreement.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we settled convertible notes with aggregate principal amount of $65 million for cash of $295 million. Additionally, holders converted $71 million of aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes in the second quarter of 2018, which resulted in an increase to the carrying value of $238 million. As a result of the conversions, we recognized non-operating losses of $23 million in the second quarter of 2018. We will settle the conversions entirely in cash in the third quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we redeemed notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.25 billion for cash of $2.42 billion and recognized non-operating losses of $190 million.\n(2) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") that lowers the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and significantly affects how income from foreign operations is taxed in the United States. As a result of our fiscal year-end, our U.S. statutory federal rate will be 25.7% for 2018 (based on the 35% corporate rate through December 31, 2017 and 21% from that date through the end of fiscal year 2018) and 21% for subsequent years. The Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax in 2018 on the higher of our accumulated foreign income, as determined as of November 2, 2017 or December 31, 2017 (the \"Repatriation Tax\"); provides a U.S. federal tax exemption on foreign earnings distributed to the United States; and, beginning in 2019, creates a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets (the \"Foreign Minimum Tax\"). The Tax Act allows us to elect to pay any Repatriation Tax due in eight annual interest-free payments in increasing amounts beginning in December 2018. In connection with the provisions of the Tax Act, we are continuing to evaluate whether to account for the Foreign Minimum Tax provisions that begin for us in 2019 as a period cost or in our measurement of deferred taxes.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 allows the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if our analyses of the impacts of the Tax Act has not been completed when our financial statements for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 are issued. Provisional amounts may be adjusted during a one-year measurement period as accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act are completed or as estimates are revised. Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:\nSecond Quarter First\nQuarter Six Months 2018 2017 2018 2018 2017 Provisional estimate for the Repatriation Tax, on substantially all of our accumulated foreign earnings, net of adjustments related to uncertain tax positions $ (1,335 ) $ — $ — $ (1,335 ) $ — Remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflecting the lower U.S. corporate tax rates (133 ) — — (133 ) — Provisional estimate for the release of the valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our U.S. operations 1,337 — — 1,337 — Utilization of and other changes in net deferred tax assets of MMJ, MMT, and MTTW (17 ) (8 ) (26 ) (43 ) (21 ) Other income tax (provision) benefit 5 (30 ) (88 ) (83 ) (48 ) $ (143 ) $ (38 ) $ (114 ) $ (257 ) $ (69 ) (3) In October 2017, we issued 34 million shares of our common stock for $41.00 per share in a public offering, for proceeds of $1.36 billion, net of underwriting fees and other offering costs.\nMICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP RESULTS\n(in millions except per share amounts) 2nd Qtr. 1st Qtr. 2nd Qtr.

The non-GAAP adjustments above may or may not be infrequent or nonrecurring in nature but are a result of periodic or non-core operating activities. We believe this non-GAAP information is helpful to understanding trends and in analyzing our operating results and earnings. We are providing this information to investors to assist in performing analysis of our operating results. When evaluating performance and making decisions on how to allocate our resources, management uses this non-GAAP information and believes investors should have access to similar data when making their investment decisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures increase transparency by providing investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enabling enhanced comparison of our operating results between periods and with peer companies. The presentation of these adjusted amounts vary from numbers presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies.\nOur management excludes the following items in analyzing our operating results and understanding trends in our earnings:\nStock-based compensation; Flow-through of business acquisition-related inventory adjustments; Restructure and asset impairments; Amortization of debt discount and other costs, including the accretion of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt and MMJ installment debt; Losses from debt repurchases and conversions; Gains and losses from changes in currency exchange rates; Gains and losses from business acquisition activities; Impact of the U.S. income tax reform for provisional estimate of Repatriation Tax, release of U.S. valuation allowance, and remeasurement of net deferred taxes reflecting the lower U.S. corporate tax rates; and The estimated tax effects of above, including tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and non-cash changes in net deferred taxes.\nOur outstanding capped call transactions are anti-dilutive in GAAP earnings per share but are expected to mitigate the dilutive effect of our convertible notes. In periods with non-GAAP income attributable to Micron, non-GAAP diluted shares include the impact of the capped calls, based on the average share price for the period the capped calls are outstanding. Non-GAAP diluted shares are also adjusted for the impact of additional shares resulting from the exclusion of stock-based compensation from non-GAAP income.\nContacts: Shanye Hudson Investor Relations shudson@micron.com (208) 492-1205 David Oro Media Relations davidoro@micron.com (707) 558-8585\nSource:Micron Technology, Inc.",
