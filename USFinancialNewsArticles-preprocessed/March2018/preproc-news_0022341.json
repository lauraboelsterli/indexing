    "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates NBD plans to raise its share capital by up to 7.35 billion dirhams ($2 billion) through the issuance of new shares, as Dubai’s largest lender prepares to bid for Turkey’s Denizbank.\nA man rides a bicycle past Emirates NBD head office in Dubai, UAE January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Satish Kumar The bank said in January it had started initial strategic talks with Sberbank about a possible purchase of the Russian lender’s stake in Turkey’s Denizbank.\nThe share hike, announced on Sunday, was expected to ensure the lender’s common equity tier 1 ratio did not drop below the regulated 11 percent threshold with the acquisition, said Chiradeep Ghosh, banking analyst at SICO Bahrain.\nPlans for the move helped send Emirates NBD’s stock surging 12.5 percent in early trading on Sunday.\nEmirates NBD currently has 5.56 billion authorized shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. The bank said it planned to issue new shares with a nominal value of 1 dirhams for a subscription price per share at no less than 10 percent discount to the prevailing market price.\nIt is the latest Gulf bank seeking to raise its capital in recent weeks. National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia’s largest lender, and Dubai Islamic Bank have both announced similar moves.\nEmirates NBD’s capital increase will be discussed at a general meeting of shareholders on March 27.\nThe bank said is was also seeking shareholder approval for a $12.5 billion medium term note program, a $1 billion structured note program and a 1.5 billion Australian dollars debt issuance program.\n(This version of the story has been corrected to remove word ‘euro’ in the last paragraph and to show that the debt issuance program is in Australian dollars not U.S dollars)\nReporting By Tom Arnold;Editing by Michael Perry\n ",
