    "text": "ORRVILLE, Ohio, March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The J.M. Smucker Company today announced a limited, voluntary recall of specific lots of two varieties of Milo's Kitchen® dog treats, distributed nationally, because the products potentially contain elevated levels of beef thyroid hormone.\nThe impacted production includes the following items and lots:\nProduct Description\nUPC Code\nProduct Size\nBest If Used By Date\nMilo's Kitchen Steak Grillers /\nSteak Grillers Recipe with\nAngus Steak\n0 7910051822 7\n0 7910051822 7\n0 7910051823 4\n0 7910052776 2\n18 oz. bag\n18 oz. bag\n22 oz. bag\n10 oz. bag\n11/15/2018\n4/26/2019\n4/26/2019\n4/26/2019\nMilo's Kitchen Grilled Burger\nBites with Sweet Potato and\nBacon\n0 7910052126 5\n15 oz. bag\n11/19/2018\nDogs consuming high levels of beef thyroid hormone may exhibit symptoms such as increased thirst and urination, weight loss, increased heart rate and restlessness. These symptoms may resolve when the consumption of these levels is discontinued. However, with prolonged consumption these symptoms may increase in severity and may include vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid or labored breathing. Should these symptoms occur, we recommend pet owners contact their veterinarian immediately.\nThe FDA informed Smucker of three illness reports and we immediately initiated a voluntary recall of the limited, impacted production.\nConsumers who have purchased the specific lots of product listed above should stop feeding it to their dogs. If consumers have questions or would like to receive a refund or coupon for replacement product, they should call us at 1-888-569-6767, Monday through Friday, between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM EDT or email us by completing this form .\nNo other Milo's Kitchen® dog treats, or any other product manufactured by The J.M. Smucker Company, are impacted.\nThe voluntary recall is being conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nCONTACT: CONSUMERS: 888-569-6767\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/limited-production-of-two-varieties-of-milos-kitchen-dog-treats-voluntarily-recalled-due-to-potentially-elevated-levels-of-thyroid-hormone-300618516.html\nSOURCE The J.M.
