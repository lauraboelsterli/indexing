    "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - TomTom NV ( TOM2.AS ), the Dutch supplier of digital maps and navigation technology, is considering a possible sale of the whole firm or a minority stake, sources said, but the company denied it had hired an adviser to seek potential buyers.\nTomTom, listed in Amsterdam with a market capitalization of about 1.74 billion euros ($2.2 billion), was tapping a range of possible buyers, including Asian investors, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nThey said the firm had enlisted Deutsche Bank as it considers several strategic options.\nHowever, after initially declining comment, TomTom issued a one line statement later saying it “denies it has engaged a financial advisor to look for potential buyers”.\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment.\nThe company, one of the world’s leading providers of navigation and mapping products used in mobiles and other devices, has struggled in recent quarters as demand falls for personal navigation devices, once its core business.\nAny buyer, however, could face regulatory hurdles as mapping technology and global position system (GPS) technology is seen as sensitive for national security in most countries, particularly by the United States and China.\nGroup revenues at TomTom - whose partners and clients include Apple ( AAPL.O ), Microsoft ( MSFT.O ), Uber, Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and Baidu Inc ( BIDU.O ) - fell 9 percent to 903 million euros in 2017 and are forecast to drop to 800 million euros in 2018.\nThe company reported a 204 million euro loss in 2017, as it was forced to write down the value of its consumer products business, which also sells watches and cameras.\nTomTom’s shares were trading at 7.37 euros on Wednesday shortly before Reuters reported its enlistment of Deutsche Bank, after peaking at more than 12 euros a share in December 2015.\nShares surged 10 percent in the final minutes of trade, after the report, closing at 8.15 euros.\nChief Executive Harold Goddijn, one of TomTom’s four founders who each have an 11.1 percent stake, has said the company’s future is in supplying technology for automated driving and self driving cars. TomTom won a number of contracts to supply digital maps to major carmakers in 2015 and 2016.\nGoddijn has promised more will follow in 2018.\nWhen Dutch tycoon John De Mol bought a 5 percent stake in the firm in 2015, Dutch daily Het Financieele Dagblad reported that he had urged TomTom to consider tie-ups with Chinese firms Baidu or Tencent.\nDe Mol’s spokeswoman declined to comment at the time.\nThe Dutch shareholders’ union VEB has said TomTom should consider options such as selling off some units, a management buyout, acquisitions or finding a buyer. It has questioned whether the founders and board are sufficiently protecting the interests of minority shareholders.\nReporting by Toby Sterling in Amsterdam, Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt and Kane Wu in Hong Kong; Editing by Edmund Blair and David Stamp\n ",
