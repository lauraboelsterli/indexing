This circular will be available at www.serabigold.com .\nThe Appendix sets out further information relating to the Bookbuild and the terms and conditions of the Placing.\nBackground to and reasons for the Placing\nFollowing positive feedback from the Greenstone Subscription, the Company decided to pursue a placing to give access to further capital and to widen its shareholder base through the introduction of a broad range of investors who are also supportive of the Company's plans and ambitions. The further funds raised pursuant to the Placing will allow the Company to accelerate further exploration and evaluation work at Palito, Sao Chico and Coringa and develop additional growth opportunities as the Company moves towards its targeted production of 100,000 ounces of gold per annum.\nAs announced on 23 March 2018, as well as providing working capital for the Company's recently acquired Coringa Gold Project (\" Coringa \"), the Greenstone Subscription will allow the Company to expand its current 8,000 metre drill programme. This current programme is focusing on step out drilling on the current Palito mineral resources, and the Greenstone Subscription allows the Company to continue this programme at Palito beyond the current 8,000 metres, as well as commence drilling at Sao Chico, where drilling will focus on step out drilling within the mining tenement as well as drilling the geophysical anomalies identified in 2016. The Company intends to use part of the Placing proceeds to complete a Phase 2 drilling programme, which comprises drilling the 2011 discoveries at Palito which do not currently form part of the Group's mineral resources, whilst at Sao Chico step out drilling will be undertaken along strike and beyond the limits of the current mining tenement.\nThe Placing proceeds will also enable Serabi to accelerate its regional exploration programme and enable the early repayment of US$3 million of the Company's total US$8 million loan with Sprott Resources Lending Partnership.\nUse of proceeds\nThe directors intend to use the proceeds from the Placing (exclusive of costs and commissions which will be met from existing resources) as follows:\nUse of the Placing procceds Coringa Drilling US$2m Regional Exploration (Airborne Geophysics) US$1m Drilling programme Palito and Sao Chico - Phase 2 US$2m Retirement of Sprott Loan US$3m Minimum gross proceeds US$8m As announced on 23 March 2018, the proceeds for the Greenstone Subscription will be used as follows:\nUse of Greenstone Subscription proceeds Second Installment of acquisition payment for Coringa project which following agreement with the Vendors is now due on 16 April 2018 US$5m 2018 Working Capital for Coringa US$4m Expansion of Drilling programme Palito and Sao Chico - Phase 1 US$4m Corporate Working Capital US$2m Use of Greenstone subscription US$15m Qualified Persons Statement\nThe scientific and technical information contained within this announcement has been reviewed and approved by Michael Hodgson, a Director of the Company.

The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.\n\" Inferred Mineral Resource\" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.\n\" Measured Mineral Resource\" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.

This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined.\n\" Probable Mineral Reserve \" is the economically mineable part of an Indicated and, in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.\n\" Proven Mineral Reserve \" is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A Proven Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors.\n\" t \" means tonnes\n\" Vein \" is a generic term to describe an occurrence of mineralised rock within an area of non-mineralised rock.\nAPPENDIX 1\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PLACING\nTHE ANNOUNCEMENT INCLUDING THIS APPENDIX (TOGETHER THE \"ANNOUNCEMENT\") AND THE INFORMATION IN IT IS RESTRICTED AND IS NOT FOR PUBLICATION, RELEASE OR DISTRIBUTION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN, INTO OR FROM THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND OR THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH PUBLICATION, RELEASE OR DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION ON THE PLACING FOR INVITED PLACEES ONLY.\nMEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO TAKE PART IN THE PLACING.

To the extent Peel Hunt does not procure subscribers for Placing Shares as required, including those Placees procured by the Company, Peel Hunt will not itself subscribe for such shares.\nThe Placing Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing issued ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\" Ordinary Shares \"), including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions (if any) declared, made or paid on or in respect of the Ordinary Shares after the date of issue of the Placing Shares.\nParticipation in, and principal terms of, the Placing\nParticipation in the Placing is only available to persons who may lawfully be, and are, invited to participate in it by Peel Hunt.\nPeel Hunt is arranging the Placing as bookrunner and agent of the Company. Participation in the Placing will only be available to persons who may lawfully be, and are, invited to participate by Peel Hunt. Peel Hunt and its respective affiliates are entitled to enter orders in the Bookbuild as principal. The completion of the Bookbuild will be determined by Peel Hunt in its absolute discretion and shall then be announced on a Regulatory Information Service as soon as is practicable following the completion of the Bookbuild. To make an order in the Bookbuild, prospective Placees should communicate their order by telephone to their usual sales contact at Peel Hunt. Each order should state the number of Placing Shares which the prospective Placee wishes to subscribe for at the Placing Price. Orders may be scaled down by Peel Hunt on the basis referred to paragraph 8 below. The Bookbuild is expected to close no later than 4.30 pm on 29 March 2018 but may be closed earlier or later at the discretion of Peel Hunt. Peel Hunt may, in agreement with the Company accept orders that are received after the Bookbuild has closed. The Company reserves the right to reduce or seek to increase the amount to be raised pursuant to the Placing, in its absolute discretion. The final allocations of the Placing Shares (including as to the identity of the Placees and the number of shares allocated to each Placee at the Placing Price) shall be determined by Peel Hunt in its absolute discretion. Each Placee's allocation will be confirmed to Placees orally, or by email, by Peel Hunt following the close of the Bookbuild and a trade confirmation or contract note will be dispatched as soon as possible thereafter (the \" Contract Note \"). The terms of this Appendix will be deemed incorporated into the Contract Note. Peel Hunt's oral or emailed confirmation to such Placee will constitute an irrevocable legally binding commitment upon such person (who will at that point become a Placee) in favour of Peel Hunt and the Company, under which it agrees to subscribe for the number of Placing Shares allocated to it at the Placing Price on the terms and conditions set out in this Appendix (which are deemed to be incorporated in such Contract Note) and in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association. The Company will make a further announcement following the close of the Bookbuild detailing the number of Placing Shares to be issued. Subject to paragraphs 4 and 5 above, Peel Hunt may choose to accept orders, either in whole or in part, on the basis of allocations determined at their discretion (in agreement with the Company) and may scale down any orders for this purpose on such basis as it may determine. Peel Hunt may also, notwithstanding paragraphs 4 and 5 above, but subject to the prior consent of the Company (i) allocate Placing Shares after the time of any initial allocation to any person submitting an order after that time; and (ii) allocate Placing Shares after the Bookbuild has closed to any person submitting an order after that time. The Company and Peel Hunt acting together reserve the right not to accept orders or to accept orders in part rather than in whole. An order in the Bookbuild will be made on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Appendix and will be legally binding on the Placee on behalf of which it is made and, except with Peel Hunt's consent, will not be capable of variation or revocation after the time at which it is submitted. Each Placee will also have an immediate, separate, irrevocable and binding obligation, to pay Peel Hunt (or as Peel Hunt may direct) in cleared funds an amount equal to the product of the Placing Price and the number of Placing Shares for which such Placee has agreed to subscribe. Each Placee's obligations will be owed to Peel Hunt. Irrespective of the time at which a Placee's allocation pursuant to the Placing is confirmed, settlement for all Placing Shares to be acquired pursuant to the Placing will be required to be made at the same time, on the basis explained below under \"Settlement\". All obligations under the Bookbuild and Placing will be subject to fulfilment of the conditions referred to below under \"Conditions of the Placing\" and to the Placing not being terminated on the basis referred to below under \"Conditions to the Placing\". By participating in the Bookbuild, each Placee agrees that its rights and obligations in respect of the Placing will terminate only in the circumstances described below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by the Placee. To the fullest extent permissible by law and the applicable rules of AIM, neither Peel Hunt nor any of their respective affiliates shall have any liability to Placees (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise whether or not a recipient of these terms and conditions) in respect of the Placing. Each Placee acknowledges and agrees that the Company is responsible for the allotment of the Placing Shares to the Placees and Peel Hunt shall have no liability to the Placees for the failure of the Company to fulfil those obligations. In particular, neither Peel Hunt nor any of its affiliates shall have any liability (including to the extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) in respect of Peel Hunt's conduct of the Bookbuild or of such alternative method of effecting the Placing as Peel Hunt and the Company may agree. In making an investment decision, Placees must rely on their own examination of the Company and its prospects and the terms of the Placing, including the merit and risks involved in investing in the Placing Shares. Settlement will occur on a date to be advised but expected to be on or around 14 May 2018 (\" Closing Date \").\nAll such times and dates will be subject to amendment at Peel Hunt's discretion, except that in no circumstances will the date scheduled for Admission be later than the Long Stop Date.\nNo Prospectus\nThe Placing Shares are being offered to a limited number of specifically invited persons only and will not be offered in such a way as to require a prospectus in the United Kingdom or in any other jurisdiction. No offering document or prospectus has been or will be submitted to be approved by the Financial Conduct Authority, the LSE or any other regulatory body in relation to the Placing and Placees' commitments in respect of Placing Shares will be made solely on the basis of the information contained in this Announcement and the terms and conditions contained in this appendix.\nApplication for Admission to Trading on AIM\nApplication will be made to London Stock Exchange plc (\" LSE \") for the Placing Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM, the market owned and operated by the LSE (\" AIM \"), (\" Admission \"). Admission will occur on a date to be advised but expected to be on or around 8.00 am on 14 May 2018 (or such later date as may be agreed between the Company and Peel Hunt, provided that such date is no later than the Long Stop Date).\nSettlement\nSettlement of transactions in the Placing Shares will take place inside the CREST system.\nSettlement of transactions in the Placing Shares will, unless otherwise agreed, take place on a delivery versus payment basis within the CREST system administered by Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited (\" CREST \").\nThe Company will procure the delivery of the Placing Shares to CREST accounts operated by Peel Hunt for the Company and Peel Hunt will enter its delivery (DEL) instructions into the CREST system. The input to CREST by each Placee of a matching or acceptance instruction will then allow delivery of the relevant Placing Shares to that Placee against payment.\nThe Company reserves the right to require settlement for and delivery of the Placing Shares (or a portion thereof) to any Placee in any form it requires if, in Peel Hunt's opinion, delivery or settlement is not possible or practicable within CREST or would not be consistent with the regulatory requirements in the Placee's jurisdiction.\nFollowing the close of the Bookbuild for the Placing, each Placee allocated Placing Shares in the Placing may be sent a Contract Note stating the number of Placing Shares, the Placing Price and the subscription amount payable to be allocated to it and will be required to provide Peel Hunt with funds sufficient to purchase such securities prior to the Closing Date.\nEach Placee is deemed to agree that, if it does not comply with these obligations, the Company may sell any or all of the Placing Shares allocated to that Placee on such Placee's behalf and retain from the proceeds, for the Company's account and benefit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any interest due. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the aggregate amount owed by it and may be required to bear any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (together with any interest or penalties) which may arise upon the sale of such Placing Shares on such Placee's behalf.\nIt is expected that settlement will take place on or about 14 May 2018 in CREST on a T+29 basis in accordance with the instructions set out in the Contract Note. Settlement will be through Peel Hunt against CREST ID: 871.\nEach Placee agrees that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed in accordance with the applicable registration and settlement procedures, including if applicable, CREST rules and regulations and settlement instructions that it has in place with Peel Hunt.\nIf the Placing Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees should ensure that the Contract Note is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person within that organisation.\nTrade date: 29 March 2018\nSettlement date: 14 May 2018 (Electronic)\nISIN code for the Placing Shares: GB00B4T0YL77\nNo UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax should be payable to the extent that the Placing Shares are issued into CREST to, or to the nominee of, a Placee who holds those shares beneficially (and not as agent or nominee for any other person) within the CREST system and registered in the name of such Placee or such Placee's nominee provided that the Placing Shares are not issued to a person whose business is or includes issuing depositary receipts or the provision of clearance services or to an agent or nominee for any such person.\nThe agreement to settle a Placee's subscription (and/or the subscription of a person for whom such Placee is contracting as agent) free of stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax depends on the settlement relating only to a subscription by it and/or such person direct from the Company for the Placing Shares in question. Such agreement assumes that the Placing Shares are not being subscribed for in connection with arrangements to issue depositary receipts or to transfer the Placing Shares into a clearance service. If there are any such arrangements, or the settlement relates to any other subsequent dealing in the Placing Shares, UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax may be payable, for which neither the Company nor Peel Hunt will be responsible, and the Placee to whom (or on behalf of whom, or in respect of the person for whom it is participating in the Placing as an agent or nominee) the allocation, allotment, issue or delivery of Placing Shares has given rise to such UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax undertakes to pay such UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax forthwith and to indemnify on an after-tax basis and to hold harmless the Company and Peel Hunt in the event that the Company or Peel Hunt has incurred any such liability to UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. If this is the case, each Placee should seek its own advice and notify Peel Hunt accordingly.\nIn addition, Placees should note that they will be liable for any stamp duty and all other stamp, issue, securities, transfer, registration, documentary or other duties or taxes (including any interest, fines or penalties relating thereto) payable outside the UK by them or any other person on the subscription by them of any Placing Shares or the agreement by them to subscribe for any Placing Shares.\nPlacing Agreement\nPeel Hunt entered into the Placing Agreement with the Company today under which Peel Hunt has agreed on a conditional basis to use its reasonable endeavours as agent of the Company to procure Placees at the Placing Price for the Placing Shares.\nConditions to the Placing\nThe Placing is conditional on, among other things:\nthe Company having complied with its obligations and satisfying all conditions to be satisfied by them under the Placing Agreement or the terms of this Appendix which fall to be performed or satisfied on or prior to Admission; the Placing Agreement not being terminated in accordance with its terms by Peel Hunt; the subscription agreement dated 23 March 2018 made between the Company and Greenstone Resources II LP in relation to Greenstone's subscription for 297,759,419 new ordinary shares in the Company not having lapsed or been terminated and having been completed in accordance with its terms; the passing of the resolutions to authorise the issue of the Placing Shares and to dis-apply pre-emptions in respect of the Placing Shares at the General Meeting of the Company; Admission taking place by the relevant time and date as stated in the Announcement; and the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional in all other respects.\nIf:\nany of the conditions contained in the Placing Agreement in relation to the Placing Shares are not fulfilled or waived (if capable of being waived) by Peel Hunt by the respective time or date where specified (or such later time or date as the Company and Peel Hunt may agree); any of such conditions becomes incapable of being fulfilled; or the Placing Agreement is terminated in the circumstances specified below,\nthe Placing in relation to the Placing Shares will lapse and the Placee's rights and obligations hereunder in relation to the Placing Shares shall cease and terminate at such time and each Placee agrees that no claim can be made by the Placee in respect thereof.\nPeel Hunt may, in its absolute discretion, upon such terms as it thinks fit, waive compliance by the Company with certain of the Company's obligations in relation to the conditions in the Placing Agreement save that the certain conditions including the condition relating to Admission taking place may not be waived. Any such extension or waiver will not affect the Placees' commitments as set out in this Announcement.\nPeel Hunt reserves the right to waive or extend the time and or date for the fulfilment of any of the conditions in the Placing Agreement to a time no later than 8 00 a.m. on the Long Stop Date.\nIf any condition in the Placing Agreement is not fulfilled or waived by Peel Hunt by the relevant time, the Placing will lapse and each Placee's rights and obligations in respect of the Placing will cease and terminate at such time.\nNeither the Company nor Peel Hunt shall have any liability to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) in respect of any decision it may make as to whether or not to waive or to extend the time and/or date for the satisfaction of any condition to the Placing nor for any decision they may make as to the satisfaction of any condition or in respect of the Placing generally and by participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees that any such decision is within the absolute discretion of the Company and Peel Hunt.\nTermination\nThe Placing Agreement may be terminated by Peel Hunt at any time prior to Admission in certain circumstances including, among other things, following a material breach of the Placing Agreement by the Company or the occurrence of certain force majeure events. The exercise of any right of termination pursuant to the Placing Agreement, any waiver of any condition in the Placing Agreement and any decision by Peel Hunt whether or not to extend the time for satisfaction of any condition in the Placing Agreement will be within the absolute discretion of Peel Hunt. Following Admission, the Placing Agreement is not capable of rescission or termination.\nThe rights and obligations of the Placees shall terminate only in the circumstances described in these terms and conditions and will not be subject to termination by the Placee or any prospective Placee at any time or in any circumstances. By participating in the Placing, Placees agree that the exercise by Peel Hunt of any right of termination or other discretion under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of Peel Hunt, and that it need not make any reference to Placees and that it shall have no liability to Placees whatsoever in connection with any such exercise.\nOffer personal\nThe offering of Placing Shares and the agreement arising from acceptance of the Placing is personal to each Placee and does not constitute an offering to any other person or to the public. A Placee may not assign, transfer, or in any other manner, deal with its rights or obligations under the agreement arising from the acceptance of the Placing, without the prior written agreement of Peel Hunt in accordance with all relevant legal requirements.\nPayment default\nA Placee's entitlement to receive any Placing Shares under the Placing will be conditional on Peel Hunt's receipt of payment in full for such Placing Shares by the relevant time to be stated in the written confirmation referred to above, or by such later time and date as Peel Hunt and the Company may in their absolute discretion determine, and otherwise in accordance with that confirmation's terms.\nIf any Placee fails to make such payment by the required time for any Placing Shares:\nthe Company may release itself, and (if at its absolute discretion it decides to do so) will be released from, all obligations it may have to allot and/or issue any such Placing Shares to such Placee or at its direction which are then unallotted and/or unissued; the Company may exercise all rights of lien, forfeiture and setoff over and in respect of any such Placing Shares to the full extent permitted under its Articles of Association or by law and to the extent that such Placee then has any interest in or rights in respect of any such shares; the Company or Peel Hunt may sell (and each of them is irrevocably authorised by such Placee to do so) all or any of such shares on such Placee's behalf and then retain from the proceeds, for the account and benefit of the Company relating to (or where applicable and in relation to (iii) below only, Peel Hunt): (i) any amount up to the total amount due to it as, or in respect of, allotment monies, or as interest on such monies, for any Placing Shares, (ii) any amount required to cover any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax arising on the sale, and (iii) any amount required to cover dealing costs and/or commissions necessarily or reasonably incurred by it in respect of such sale; and such Placee will remain liable to the Company and to Peel Hunt for the full amount of any losses and of any costs which either of them may suffer or incur as a result of it (i) not receiving payment in full for such Placing Shares by the required time, and/or (ii) the sale of any such Placing Shares to any other person at whatever price and on whatever terms as are actually obtained for such sale by or for it. Interest may be charged in respect of payments not received by Peel Hunt for value by the required time referred to above at the rate of two percentage points above the base rate of Barclays Bank plc.\nPlacees' representations, warranties and undertakings to the Company and Peel Hunt\nBy agreeing with Peel Hunt to be allotted Placing Shares under the Placing and participating in the Bookbuild, each Placee (and any person acting on a Placee's behalf) irrevocably acknowledges and confirms and represents and warrants and undertakes to, and agrees with, each of the Company and Peel Hunt (in its capacity as placing agent) and each of their respective affiliates, in each case as a fundamental term of such Placee's acceptance of its Placing participation and of the Company's obligation to allot and/or issue any Placing Shares to it or at its direction, that:\nit has read the Announcement in full, including this Appendix, and agrees to and accepts all the terms set out in the Announcement, including this Appendix, and that its acquisition of the Placing Shares is subject to and based upon all the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings and other information contained therein;
