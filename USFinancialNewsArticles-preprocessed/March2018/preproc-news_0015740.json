Estimated megawatts of energy capacity to be generated by wind blade sets invoiced in the period. Number of manufacturing lines that are dedicated to our customers under long-term supply agreements. Includes seven lines for GE Wind that were not renewed after December 31, 2017. Number of manufacturing lines installed and either in operation, startup or transition. Number of manufacturing lines in a startup phase during the pre-production and production ramp-up period. Number of manufacturing lines that were being transitioned to a new wind blade model during the period.\n“We finished our second year as a public company very strong, delivering another solid quarter along with record results for 2017,” said Steven Lockard, TPI Composites’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to execute on our strategy to grow globally, diversify among our customer base and across geographies, and expand profitability. Today we have up to $4.6 billion of potential revenue under long-term contracts covering 41 molds and a strong and diverse global pipeline of opportunities to support our growth targets. While 2018 will be a year of significant investment as we transition 14 existing manufacturing lines to larger blade models and start up 12 new lines, we estimate top line growth of approximately 10%. We believe our planned investments this year will position us for revenue growth in 2019 of approximately 35% and enable us to meet our three year revenue CAGR of between 20% and 25%.\n“From a business development standpoint, during 2017 we signed multiyear supply agreements for five new manufacturing lines, representing total contract revenue of up to $850 million, plus options for additional lines with Vestas, Siemens Gamesa and a new customer, Senvion, and announced a new manufacturing hub in Matamoros, Mexico. We remain very confident in our ability to convert our prioritized pipeline of 24 manufacturing lines over the next 24 months and in fact we are in active negotiations for a number of lines with the expectation of closing them in the next 1 to 2 months.\n“Finally, TPI continues to demonstrate additional commercial capabilities for our advanced composites expertise as we have grown our footprint in the transportation business with our expanded relationship with Proterra, a leading supplier of zero-emission buses. Additionally, today we announced that we entered into an agreement with Navistar, Inc. to design and develop a Class 8 truck comprised of a composite tractor and frame rails. This collaborative development project is being entered into in connection with Navistar’s recent award under the U.S. Department of Energy’s Super Truck II investment program, which is designed to promote freight efficiency in commercial vehicles.\n“We remain focused on our commitment to grow our wind business, improve our operational effectiveness, drive improved profitability and continue to drive down the levelized cost of energy while continuing to develop and explore additional opportunities in other strategic markets,” concluded Mr. Lockard.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales for the quarter increased by $61.6 million or 33.2% to $247.1 million compared to $185.6 million in the same period in 2016. Net sales of wind blades were $236.2 million for the quarter as compared to $164.8 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a 38% increase in the number of wind blades delivered during the quarter as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily from our Turkey, Mexico and China plants. This was partially offset by a decline in the average sales prices of the same blade models delivered in both periods as a result of geographic mix and savings in raw material costs, a portion of which we share with our customers. Total billings for the quarter increased by $45.1 million or 22.8% to $242.7 million compared to $197.6 million in the same period in 2016. The favorable impact of the currency movements on consolidated net sales and total billings were both 2.5% for the quarter.\nTotal cost of goods sold for the quarter was $219.9 million and included aggregate costs of $11.6 million primarily related to startup costs in our new plants in Mexico and Turkey. This compares to total cost of goods sold of $166.5 million for the same period in 2016, including aggregate costs of $6.7 million related to startup costs in our new plants in Mexico and Turkey. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales of wind blades decreased by four percentage points during the quarter as compared to the same period in 2016, driven by improved operating efficiencies and the impact of savings in raw material costs, partially offset by the increase in startup and transition costs and foreign currency fluctuations. The unfavorable impact of the currency movements on consolidated cost of goods sold was 1.8% for the quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $12.0 million as compared to $9.7 million for the same period in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses were 4.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, down from 5.2% in the same period in 2016. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by additional costs incurred related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, our work related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and increased personnel costs from filling our key global positions to support our growth and diversification strategy.\nNet income for the quarter was $5.9 million as compared to a net loss of $2.3 million in the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to the improved operating results discussed above and the write-off of debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of our previous credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share was $0.17 for the quarter, compared to a loss of $0.07 per share for the same period in 2016.\nEBITDA for the quarter increased to $20.9 million, compared to $12.5 million during the same period in 2016. The EBITDA margin increased to 8.4% compared to 6.7% in the 2016 period. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased to $25.1 million compared to $14.3 million during the same period in 2016. The Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 10.2% compared to 7.7% during the same period in 2016.\nCapital expenditures were $9.5 million for the quarter compared to $11.6 million during the same period in 2016. Current year capital expenditures were primarily related to new facilities and expansion or improvements at existing facilities and costs to enhance our information technology systems.\nWe ended the quarter with $148.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and net cash was $24.6 million as compared to net debt of $6.4 million as of December 31, 2016.\n2018 Outlook\nFor 2018, the Company is providing the following:\nTotal billings and net sales under ASC 606 of between $1.0 billion and $1.05 billion Adjusted EBITDA of between $75 million and $80 million under ASC 606 Fully diluted earnings per share of between $0.38 and $0.42 under ASC 606 Sets delivered of between 2,500 and 2,550 Average sales price per blade of between $125,000 and $130,000 Estimated megawatts of sets delivered to be between 6,950 and 7,100 Dedicated manufacturing lines under long-term agreements at year end to be between 51 and 55 Manufacturing lines installed at year end to be 47 Manufacturing lines in transition during the year to be 14 Manufacturing lines in startup during the year to be 12 Startup and transition cost of between $58 million and $62 million Capital expenditures to be between $85 million and $90 million (approx. 85% growth related) Effective tax rate to be between 40% and 42% Depreciation and amortization of between $30 million and $35 million Interest expense of between $11.5 million and $12.5 million Share-based compensation expense of between $10 million and $11 million\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nTPI Composites will host an investor conference call this afternoon, Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 5:00pm ET.
