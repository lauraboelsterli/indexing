    "text": "\nThis move increases Flipkart’s valuation to about $20 billion, up from $12 billion last year, according to researcher CB Insights . \nBoth Amazon and Walmart want to grow in India and China, where Alibaba makes it difficult to break into the market. Alibaba Group Holding backed local upstart Paytm E-commerce Pvt, a FlipKart competitor. \nExpanding into India’s market — where e-commerce sales are projected to reach $28 billion by 2020, according to estimates from Kotak Institutional Equities —will help the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer push back against the $5.5 billion Amazon has pledged to invest in the country, as the two retail giants continue battling to be the only company that sells people things. \nThe investment could be a win for both Walmart and FlipKart. \n“Walmart will make Flipkart a stronger rival to Amazon,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman of the New Delhi-based retail consultancy Technopak Advisors. “Strategically, combining forces makes sense for both.” \nGetting Walmart involved is good for the grocery business, where it’s imperative that FlipKart be competitive, according to Satish Meena, an analyst at research firm Forrester . \n“A deal with Walmart can give [FlipKart] leverage into offering grocery online through a combination of offline and online channels,” he told CNBC . \nFlipkart was Walmart’s “best available option” to access India’s growing retail market, Meena said.
