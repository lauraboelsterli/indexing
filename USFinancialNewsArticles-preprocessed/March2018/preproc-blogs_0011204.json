FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump announces that the United States will impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on imported aluminum during a meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo “Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!” Trump wrote in a Twitter post. North and South Korea will also hold their first summit in more than a decade next month at the border village of Panmunjom, the head of a delegation from South Korea told a media briefing. The delegation met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a visit to the North. Trump earlier tweeted: “We will see what happens!” Reporting by Eric Walsh and Susan Heavey; Editing by Will Dunham",
