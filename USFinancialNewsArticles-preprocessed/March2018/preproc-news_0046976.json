    "text": "TORONTO, March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Snipp Interactive Inc. (\"Snipp\" or the “Company”) (OTCQB:SNIPF) (TSX-V:SPN), a global provider of digital marketing promotions, rebates and loyalty solutions, announces that it will release its financial results for Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 prior to the market open on Tuesday April 3, 2018. Snipp management will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors on Tuesday, April 3, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s financial results. The conference call dial-in details will be posted to the Snipp website later this week under the ‘Investors’ section of www.snipp.com .\nThe Company also announces the closing of the fourth tranche (the “Fourth Tranche”) of the non-brokered private placement (the “Financing”) previously announced on March 2, 2018. The Fourth Tranche was comprised of 6 million shares at a price of CAD$0.10 per share for gross proceeds of CAD$600,000. The four-month hold period for all shares issued under the Fourth Tranche will expire on July 29, 2018 in accordance with Canadian securities laws. Finder's fees were paid to an agent in connection with the Fourth Tranche and consisted of commission of CAD$36,000 and 360,000 warrants (“Finder’s Warrants”). Each Finder’s Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share at an exercise price of CAD$0.10 for a period of 2 years from the date of distribution.\n“We are pleased with our Q4 and full year 2017 performance and look forward to sharing our results next week.
