    "text": "Revenues up 40% to €9.9mln and 40.5MW Order Intake in 2017, for €16.6mln Gross Margin at 40% brings EBITDA close to breakeven at €-1.7mln, even with R&D at 27% of revenues 2020 Strategic Plan on track: €25.1mln Project Backlog 1 and €150mln Pipeline 2 thanks to the ENGIE industrial partnership Successful deployments in the Maldives, Australia, Tasmania and Italy; construction site for 20MW in Spain launched Working Capital 5x higher than 2016 impacting net financial position, but continuous support from Intesa Sanpaolo with new credit lines\nCarlalberto Guglielminotti, Chief Executive Officer of EPS, commented, “We're thrilled to report another year of continuous growth, even if the increase by 40% in revenues only partially represents that growth, because of revenue recognition shifting value to 2018. We believe that the fourfold growth in project backlog to 25 million outlines more clearly what we have done in 2017 and proves that we are on the right track toward the 2020 Strategic Plan. The gross margin at 40% is a testament to our great operational and business performance, the pipeline at 150 million confirms our strong synergies with ENGIE, and the investment of 27% of our revenues in R&D confirms our commitment to innovation and state-of-the-art technology positioning. This continuous growth, which is the result of our team’s excellence and commitment, is just the first step toward establishing a driving force in energy transition and is the key cornerstone for our long-term growth within the ENGIE group.”\nPARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nElectro Power Systems S.A. (“ EPS ”) (Paris:EPS), technology pioneer in energy storage systems and microgrids listed on the French-regulated market Euronext Paris (EPS:FP), today announces its 2017 full-year financial results. The accounts have been examined and approved by the Board of Directors on 28 March 2018 and audited by the Statutory Auditors. The full 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements will be available on the EPS’s website www.electropowersystems.com and the full set of consolidated figures is attached to this press release.\n2017 KEY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nRevenues increased by 40% to 9,898k€, for an increase of 2,811k€ compared with 2016. Such result does not take into account 2,631k€ work in progress under the 20MW system in Spain, which would be shifted to 2018. Such growth is mainly due to the successful deployment of microgrids and off-grid solutions in emerging countries in East Africa, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, but even more importantly of grid-connected solutions in Europe. These positive developments were due also to the credibility of the Group established through projects with Enel, Terna, Edison, Toshiba, and other major utilities and industrial players.\n1 Project Backlog means, as of the date of this press release, the estimated revenue and other income attributable to (1) purchase orders received, contracts signed and projects awarded as of the date hereof, and (2) projects secured on a Power Purchase Agreement basis, therefore where the agreed value is a price per kWh of electricity and an amount of MW to be installed.\n2 Data as of the date of this press Release, in line with the announcement made with the publication of the 2016 annual results (data published on 23 March 2017)\nOrder intake 2017 accelerated to 40.5MW, representing approximately €16.6mln, up 37% compared to 2016, including not only utility-scale storage systems but also microgrids, smart islands and control systems for mobility and distribution applications.\nProject Backlog as of the date hereof represents €25.1mln, of which €10.1mln of firm and irrevocable orders are on an EPC basis, and €15mln of projects are secured on a Power Purchase Agreement basis, for which the financing is currently being structured. Pipeline as of today is essentially stable to €150mln, meaning that projects converted into Backlog have been replaced by new opportunities under development.\nThe main regions where these systems have been installed or are under commissioning are Asia, North Africa, Southern Europe, and the Middle East. This result confirms the effectiveness of the EPS business model, which has been strengthened by the team and of the technology that has enabled EPS to accelerate its growth to 43 customers in 18 countries.\nDespite an increase in projects’ size and complexity, the gross margin stands at 40%, confirming the visibility of the business cash flow potential.\nPersonnel costs decreased by 5% to 3,503k€ compared with 3,696k€ in 2016, despite a 7% increase in human resources. This is essentially due to the intensity of the R&D effort constantly undertaken in parallel to the business execution, and to the related personnel cost investments aimed at implementing the potential of the EPS technology. In this respect, investments in R&D amounted to 2,693k€, including both the amount accounted for in profit and loss and the one capitalised. These investments represent 27% of consolidated revenues, confirming the strong commitment of the Group to continued investing in research and development.\nOther Operating Expenses decreased by 797k€, amounting to 2,102k€, compared to 2,899k€ due to cost rationalization and a more efficient internal organizational structure.\nDespite the more structured industrial footprint, EBITDA loss has been reduced to -€1.7mln for 2017 compared to -€4.0mln in 2016. This is mainly due to the solidity of the Gross Margin generation in relative terms in parallel with the revenues’ scale up.\nAs of 31 December 2017 – net of the €3,1mln IFRS2 accounting of the EIB Warrants – the Net Income was reduced by 31% compared to 2016 (from -8,557.6k€ to -5,923.3k€). Non-recurrent items, which account for 2,576.6k€, significantly affected the net income and are mainly represented by non-recurring legal, accounting and certification costs (for 986k€), non-recurring distribution and business development expenses (for 1,022k€) and non-recurring travel, communication and roadshow expenses (for 428k€).\nAt the end of 2017, the net financial position of EPS, compared to 31 December 2016, decreased from -974.4k€ to -12,320.3k€, mainly due to the growth of revenues, the backlog of orders and the related increase in working capital, as well as to continuous investments in research and development aimed at implementing the potential of EPS technology. More particularly, the change in working capital was at 5,821k€ on 31 December 2017, a significant increase of 454% compared to 31 December 2016. In this respect, EPS has continued to be supported by Intesa Sanpaolo, which on 6 March approved an additional 3,810k€ of working capital facilities to support the growth of EPS.\nThe Cash position, represented by liquid assets, cash and cash equivalents, amounted to 4,238k€ compared to 5,478k€ at the end of 2016.\nOn 31 December 2017, EPS had 1,449k€ in equity (before the IFRS2 adjustment) and total assets of 23,441.9k€.\nMAIN EVENTS IN 2017\nThe following principal events occurred in 2017:\nMigrogrid in Australia: On 19 January 2017, the Group announced the successful delivery, the official start and commissioning phase of the storage systems sired to the Coober Pedy Renewable Hybrid Power Project’s microgrid in Coober Pedy, Southern Australia. The hybrid power plant will be connected to a microgrid composed, in its final configuration, of 1MW of solar panels, 4MW of wind turbines and up to 6MVA of generators combined with a 1MW of storage system. Migrogrid in the Maldives: On 8 February 2017, the Group announced the performance results of its second microgrid in the Maldives and confirmed CO 2 reduction and that renewables coupled with the EPS storage system covered up to 63% of the resort’s power requirements, enabling a reduction of diesel consumption by 423,000 litres per year, 50% more than expected at the time of commissioning in October 2016.

In addition, EPS Elvi obtained the OHSAS 18001:2007 certification on 6 July 2017. Management Investment: On 8 August 2017, the capital increase reserved for the management was duly executed through the issuance of 196,932 shares with a par value of €0.20. The new shares were issued at a unit price of €7.15, representing a par value of €0.20 and €6.95 issue premium, accounting for a total increase in capital, issue premium included, of €1,408,063.80. 34MW Order Intake : On 5 September 2017, EPS announced an order intake year-to-date of 34MW, amounting to approximately €14.3mln. According to the strategy presented in the 2020 Strategic Plan of the Group, most of that order intake is represented by EPC contracts (Engineering, Procurement and Construction), and it entails supply, installation, engineering and commissioning, as well as multi-year service agreements. 20MW Contract with Enel: On 13 September 2017, EPS announced the agreement with Endesa, the Spanish utility part of the Enel Group, for the supply of an energy storage system (ESS) with a power capacity of 20MW and a lifetime of 8 years. EPS will deliver a unique turnkey solution for serving Endesa’s thermoelectric plant Carboneras located in Almeria, Spain. The storage system will be the largest in Spain and aims to make the plant more flexible and improve its response to the load fluctuations in the current electricity system that result from the intermittency caused by an increased penetration of renewables. E-Mobility Business: On 2 November 2017, the transfer of the e-Mobility and Power Electronics Lab going concern from the Italian subsidiary EPS Elvi to EPS took place. By the end of March the setup of a permanent establishment in Italy will completed, with related eligibility for PIR investments. Microgrid in Chile : On 12 December 2017, Enel Green Power signed the SAT (site acceptance test) of the hybrid power plant developed by the EPS Group in Chile (Atacama Desert – 4,000m above sea level) that combines renewables with the complete set of innovative technologies: first hybrid mini-grid with hydrogen and Li-ion storage technology.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn 24 January 2018, ENGIE signed of a share purchase agreement with its main shareholders to acquire a majority stake of EPS slightly above 50% of the share capital and voting rights. In order to achieve that threshold, the agreement also involved the members of the Board of Directors and the management team. A new retention and long-term incentive plan linked to the development of the company has been set-up, to secure and strengthen the full commitment of the management team until 2021.
