    "text": "DENVER, March 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Royalty Flow Inc. (\"Royalty Flow\"), created by Royalty Exchange—an online marketplace for music and media royalties—today announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has qualified its re-filed Form 1-A in connection with its planned Regulation A+ initial public offering.\nInvestors can now subscribe to purchase common stock of Royalty Flow, which will use the proceeds from the offering to acquire and hold royalties from music catalogs and other media-based intellectual property. The first music catalog identified is the production company's master sound recording royalties from the 1999-2013 recording catalog of iconic hip-hop superstar EMINEM.\nRoyalty Flow is offering up to 6,666,666 shares at $7.50 per share, with a minimum investment of 300 shares during the offering. Royalty Flow aims to raise up to the full $50 million allowable under Regulation A+ rules.\nRoyalty Flow has received conditional approval to list its common stock on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol \"RLTY\" if it meets certain conditions following the close of the offering.\nRoyalty Flow originally filed to offer shares under Regulation A+ on Sept. 25, 2017, which the SEC initially qualified Nov. 22, 2017. The re-filing and requalification was undertaken to allow for Maxim Group LLC's addition as lead managing selling agent for the offering.\nIndividuals may obtain a copy of the offering circular with the following link: https://www.m-vest.com/RoyaltyFlow .

Such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"should,\" \"may,\" \"intends,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"projects,\" \"forecasts,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" and \"proposes.\" Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider any cautionary statements and other disclosures, including the statements made under the heading \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in the offering statement that we have filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the document in which they are contained, and Royalty Flow Inc. does not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements except as may be required by law.\nLegal Disclaimer\nThe offering will be made only by means of an offering circular.

The investment is suitable only for persons who can afford to lose their entire investment. No public market currently exists for the securities, and if a public market develops following the offering, it may not continue.
