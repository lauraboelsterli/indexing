    "text": "EAST AURORA, N.Y., March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Moog Inc. (NYSE:MOG.A) (NYSE:MOG.B) announced today the initiation of a dividend program under which Moog intends to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of its Class A and Class B stock. In connection with the dividend program, the Company declared a $.25 per share dividend on each of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The dividend will be paid on June 1, 2018 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2018. This marks the first time since 1988 that Moog has paid a cash dividend on common shares.\n“This announcement reflects the confidence we have in the strength of our business and our commitment to disciplined capital deployment,” said John Scannell, Chairman and CEO. “Looking to the future, our strong cash flow will ensure we can continue to invest in organic growth and strategic acquisitions, while also providing a regular return of capital to shareholders.”\nAs of December 31, 2017, Moog had 37,050,112 shares outstanding. The dividend represents a use of cash of approximately $9 million. Future declarations of quarterly dividends are subject to the determination and discretion of Moog’s board of directors.\nMoog Inc. is a worldwide designer, manufacturer, and integrator of precision control components and systems. Moog’s high-performance systems control military and commercial aircraft, satellites and space vehicles, launch vehicles, missiles, automated industrial machinery, wind energy, marine and medical equipment.

Such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company’s current views with respect to certain current and future events and financial performance and are not guarantees of future performance. This includes but is not limited to, the Company’s expectation and ability to pay a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock in the future, subject to the determination by the board of directors, and based on an evaluation of company earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation determinations and other factors, risks and uncertainties. The impact or occurrence of these could cause actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in the forward-looking statements. These important factors, risks and uncertainties include:\nthe markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate; we operate in highly competitive markets with competitors who may have greater resources than we possess; we depend heavily on government contracts that may not be fully funded or may be terminated, and the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales and increase our costs; we make estimates in accounting for long-term contracts, and changes in these estimates may have significant impacts on our earnings; we enter into fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns; we may not realize the full amounts reflected in our backlog as revenue, which could adversely affect our future revenue and growth prospects; if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted; contracting on government programs is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment; the loss of The Boeing Company as a customer or a significant reduction in sales to The Boeing Company could adversely impact our operating results; our new product research and development efforts may not be successful which could reduce our sales and earnings; our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete; our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, intrusions or new software implementations; our indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility; significant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements; a write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth; our sales and earnings may be affected if we cannot identify, acquire or integrate strategic acquisitions, or if we engage in divesting activities; our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments; unforeseen exposure to additional income tax liabilities may affect our operating results; government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the United States and otherwise adversely affect our business; the failure or misuse of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages; future terror attacks, war, natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control could negatively impact our business; our operations are subject to environmental laws, and complying with those laws may cause us to incur significant costs; and we are involved in various legal proceedings, the outcome of which may be unfavorable to us.\nThese factors are not exhaustive. New factors, risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time that may affect the forward-looking statements made herein. Given these factors, risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as predictive of future results. We disclaim any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made in this report.\nContact: Ann Marie Luhr 716-687-4225\nSource: Moog Inc",
