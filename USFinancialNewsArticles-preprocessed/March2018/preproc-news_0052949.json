    "text": "3 COMMENTS Latham & Watkins LLP lost its chairman last week. Then, it lost its rank as the world’s highest-grossing law firm. The two events are putting pressure on the firm—whose clients include American Airlines Group Inc. AAL 2.18% and JPMorgan Chase & Co.—to name a new leader and move past the distractions.\nLatham said vice-chairs Ora Fisher in Silicon Valley and Richard Trobman in London will take immediate responsibility as co-leaders after chairman William “Bill” Voge resigned abruptly last Tuesday. That exit followed revelations of his engaging in communications of a sexual nature with a woman unaffiliated with the law firm, Latham said in a statement. Some employees have been told that a permanent successor will be in place by summer, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nLegal recruiters, consultants and former partners say the shake-up, while surprising, is unlikely to have a lasting effect on Latham’s business. The 2,600-lawyer firm’s size and corporate structure make leadership changes less disruptive than at first-generation law firms that rely on a handful of founders to maintain client relationships.\n“I think whatever focus they might lose, nobody outside would notice a change in their performance,” said Michael Rynowecer, the president of BTI Consulting Group Inc., which provides market research to law firms. “They have been very disciplined on how to go about growing the firm and grooming leaders.”\nMr. Voge, a 61-year-old project-finance lawyer, took over leadership of the firm in January 2015 from Robert “Bob” Dell, a legendary chairman who had held the job for two decades. Mr. Voge was viewed during the last leadership election as a bridge candidate between Mr. Dell and the next generation of lawyers in their 40s, and said at the time he only planned to serve for one, five-year term.\nHis resignation hastens that transition by two years.\nMr. Voge’s successor will inherit a firm that recently ceded its top spot to competitor Kirkland & Ellis LLP after three years of being the world’s highest-grossing law firm, according to legal trade publication the American Lawyer. Kirkland & Ellis brought in $3.165 billion in global revenue in 2017, compared with Latham’s $3.064 billion, the publication reported last week. The two law firms are the first to surpass $3 billion in annual revenue.\nMr. Voge stepped down after disclosing to the firm that he had inappropriate contact with a woman whom he had never met and who had no ties to the firm, Latham said in a statement last week. The firm didn’t disclose the contents of the communications or the woman’s identity.\nIn his own statement, Mr. Voge said last week that “I made a personal mistake for which I bear considerable fault and humiliation. I deeply regret my lapse of judgment and I am sorry for the distress and embarrassment I have caused my family, friends, and colleagues.”\nMr. Voge was introduced to the woman through his work as a board member for the New Canaan Society, a Christian men’s group, according to a person familiar with the matter. The New Canaan Society describes itself as a place for men to find friendship and faith and support each other through regular gatherings.\nIn the course of facilitating a reconciliation between the woman and the founder of the New Canaan Society, Mr. Voge sent text messages of a sexual nature to the woman over a four-day period, the person said. The founder of the society didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nAfter Mr. Voge reported his conduct to Latham, the woman continued to contact Mr. Voge and others about the encounter, according to the person.\nLatham said in its statement last week that Mr. Voge’s subsequent conduct after his disclosure to the firm “while not unlawful, the executive committee concluded was not befitting the leader of the firm.” The conduct, according to a person familiar with the matter, involved heated communications with the woman’s husband.\nInside Latham last week, rank-and-file partners had no idea Mr. Voge was about to step down. Most learned during an all-partner conference call led by firm leaders shortly before the first news articles appeared March 20 , according to people familiar with the matter.\nIf Latham’s past leadership transition is any guide, the process to replace Mr. Voge will be a deliberative one.\nLatham takes a democratic approach to leadership roles, holding elections for the executive committee and other key positions. By contrast, many of its peers typically have leaders handpick their close advisers.\nMr. Voge, who had been based in Latham’s London office, became head of the firm after winning a runoff election against finance partner Jeffrey Greenberg that capped months of campaigning in Latham offices around the world. He replaced Mr. Dell, who quadrupled the firm in size during his tenure and transformed Latham from a Los Angeles-based firm into one with a global footprint.\nWrite to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com",
