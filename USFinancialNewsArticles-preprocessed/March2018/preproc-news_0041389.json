    "text": "Published: Mar 24, 2018 2:38 p.m. ET Share U.S. President Donald Trump pictured March 23, 2018. \nBy Michael C. Bender Rebecca Ballhaus \nWASHINGTON—President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill early Friday afternoon, but not before leaving both his staff and lawmakers on edge for four hours by tweeting he might veto it and trigger a government shutdown. \nJust days earlier at the White House, the president assured House Speaker Paul Ryan he would sign the bill. A half-hour after the tweet, Ryan (R., Wis.) called the president and urged him to keep the promise, a congressional aide said. \nWhite House aides huddled with Trump and warned him that he might catch blame for shutting down the government on a weekend he planned to spend at his Palm Beach, Fla., resort. \n“F— that,” Trump said in rejecting the argument, according to people familiar with the discussion. In the end, he signed the bill in a West Wing ceremony, but complained that it was so long no one had read it and warned Congress he wouldn’t sign another like it in the future. \nRead: There’s one topic Trump just doesn’t tweet about anymore \nIt was another unscripted moment of political drama in a two-week run that has left the Republican president’s opponents—and some of his allies—off balance. As he settles into the second year of his four-year term, Trump is showcasing a more unilateral executive style that relies on his own judgment and sense of what the moment requires. ",
