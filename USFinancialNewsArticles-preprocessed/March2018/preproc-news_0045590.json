    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States and Japan are “completely in sync” over North Korea and agree that it must abolish its medium- and short-range missiles as well as intercontinental and intermediate range ballistic missiles, Japan’s foreign minister said on Tuesday.\nJapan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono speaks during an interview with Reuters at the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo, Japan March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington next month before a proposed summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to discuss the crisis over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes.\nTrump’s decision to meet Kim has sparked concern in Japan that its security concerns might be ignored.\nForeign Minister Taro Kono also told Reuters in an interview that Trump’s decision not to exempt Japanese steel products from 25 percent tariffs could hurt the U.S. auto industry.\nHe urged the United States not to violate World Trade Organisation rules and expressed hope it would return to an Asia-Pacific trade pact negotiated by Trump’s predecessor.\nReporting by Linda Sieg; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ",
