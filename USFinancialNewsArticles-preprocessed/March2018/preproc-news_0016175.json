    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Upland Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: UPLD), a leader in cloud-based Enterprise Work Management software, today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 and provided guidance for its first quarter and full year of 2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue was $27.8 million, an increase of 44% from $19.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Subscription and support revenue was $24.8 million, an increase of 45% from $17.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net loss was $3.8 million, an increase of 92% from $2.0 million, in the fourth quarter of 2016, principally as a result of one-time expenses related to the accretive acquisition of Qvidian in the fourth quarter that was not present in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.7 million, or 35% of total revenue, an increase of 129% from $4.3 million, or 22% of total revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the financial tables that accompany this release. Cash on hand as of the end of the fourth quarter was $22.3 million.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue was $98.0 million, an increase of 31% from $74.8 million in 2016. Subscription and support revenue was $85.5 million, an increase of 30% from $65.6 million in 2016. GAAP net loss was $18.7 million, an increase of 39% compared to a net loss of $13.5 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $30.3 million, or 31% of total revenue, an increase of 140% from $12.6 million, or 17% of revenue, in 2016. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the financial tables that accompany this release.\n\"2017 was an outstanding year on all fronts,\" said Jack McDonald, chairman and CEO of Upland Software. \"We made four strategic and accretive acquisitions that added $48.5 million in annualized gross revenue run-rate, increased Adjusted EBITDA margins from 22% to 35% year-over-year reaching our exit 2017 goal, and continued our track record of strong product innovation and customer success,\" he said. \"Our pipeline of acquisitions remains robust, and we have the operating and financial resources to execute on significant revenue growth and margin expansion towards our long-term 40% Adjusted EBITDA target,\" he added.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Business Highlights\nExpanded 227 existing customer relationships, including 21 major expansions, during the fourth quarter for a total of 648 expanded customer relationships, including 68 major expansions, for the full year 2017. Added 151 new customer relationships, including 19 major accounts, during the fourth quarter for a total of 525 new customer relationships, including 52 major accounts, for the full year 2017. Delivered 93% annual net dollar retention rate (NDRR) as of December 31, 2017. Raised our long-term Adjusted EBITDA margin target to 40%. Completed four acquisitions delivering $48.5 million in aggregate annualized gross revenue run-rate. Each acquisition was accretive to Adjusted EBITDA per share, and included: Expanded our Workflow Automation family by acquiring Qvidian and AccuRoute. Qvidian is a premier cloud-based RFP and proposal automation software platform serving more than 1,000 companies worldwide, while AccuRoute is one of the industry's most powerful automation and document management platforms. Expanded our Digital Engagement family by acquiring Waterfall, a leading cloud-based mobile marketing solution that allows brands to build their existing customer database and drive top-line revenue with targeted, relevant mobile content. Expanded our Project and IT Management family by acquiring RightAnswers, an award-winning, cloud-based knowledge management system. Completed a $42.7 million, net, follow-on public offering of common stock in June and increased our acquisition credit facility to $200 million in August. Influenced by Customer Advisory Boards, Virtual User Conferences, Executive Outreach meetings, and through Upland communities, launched 15 major product feature releases in 2017 including improvements to integration, content monitoring, user experience, reporting, and administration. Transitioned nine products from co-location data centers to Amazon Web Services, creating a much more scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud environment to support our ongoing customer growth. Remaining products will be transitioned in 2018.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the quarter ending March 31, 2018, Upland expects reported total revenue to be between $29.6 and $30.6 million, including subscription and support revenue between $26.4 and $27.2 million, for growth in recurring revenue of 48% at the mid-point over the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.

To learn more, visit www.uplandsoftware.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the impact for foreign currency fluctuations or our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the tables provided below in this release.\nUpland defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus net income (loss) from discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, net, other expense (income), net, provision for income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, non-recurring litigation costs, and purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue. Prior to the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not include purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue as a component of Adjusted EBITDA, and as such, the prior year Adjusted EBITDA amounts presented herein have been recast to reflect the inclusion of purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue.\nUpland defines non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus, amortization of purchased intangible assets, amortization of debt discount, loss on debt extinguishment, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses, nonrecurring litigation expenses, purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue, and the related tax effect of the adjustments above.\nUpland defines annual net dollar retention rate as of December 31 as the aggregate annualized recurring revenue value at December 31 from those customers that were also customers as of December 31 of the prior fiscal year, divided by the aggregate annualized recurring revenue value from all customers as of December 31 of the prior fiscal year. This measure excludes the revenue value of uncontracted overage fees and on-demand service fees.\nUpland defines major accounts as accounts with greater than or equal to $25,000 in annual recurring revenue.\nUpland's earnings press releases containing such non-GAAP reconciliations can be found on the Investor Relations section of Upland's website at investor.uplandsoftware.com .\nForward-looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements which are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
