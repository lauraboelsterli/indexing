    "text": "6 COMMENTS To a market already wrestling hesitantly with rising inflation, rising bond yields and the end of an era of global central-bank stimulus, add another contestant: A flurry of uncertain geopolitics.\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday l aunched global tariffs on steel and aluminum and signaled that more aggressive action could come in the future. Hours later, he accepted an invitation to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a potential turning point after more than six decades of confrontation. \nThe geopolitical rumblings tug at an already volatile market. Last month, investors fixated on signs of a return of inflation and how central banks might react. Bond yields shot up and stocks dropped , interrupting a steady climb boosted by rising corporate profits and the appearance that the world’s major economies were at last growing together. \nThe tariffs and the Korean overtures add other questions to the mix. Will the U.S. tariffs evolve into a global trade war or pass with little enduring impact on world trade flows? Is there hope for calm in a dangerous global conflict, or is the proposed Korean meeting a false dawn? Shares of giant steelmakers like Korea’s Posco and China’s Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. tumbled in Asian trading on Friday, but broader markets rose solidly across the region, a rally that spread to the U.S. with the S&P 500 jumping 1.7%.\n“As we move toward a more normal interest-rate environment, these other factors” are taking on increased importance, said Alexander Wolf, senior emerging-markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong. \nOne way to gauge the changing environment lies in the increased market volatility after equities surged in historically calm fashion last year. The S&P 500 has moved at least 1% up or down in 17 trading days this year; that happened only eight times in all of 2017. \nIt also represents the highest total of such moves through March 9 since 2016, when there were 25 such days as China’s market turmoil reverberated around the world. Excluding 2016, the S&P 500 is experiencing its most volatile start to a year since 2009. \nUncertainty about how to factor in a possibly sustained global trade conflict has added to investors’ worries this year. The main concern is that a tit-for-tat rise in import tariffs could crimp what has been a synchronized global economic recovery, a key pillar of support for equity markets so far. \nYet Mr. Trump’s eventual tariff announcement was softer than initially expected; a large number of countries could be spared from the measures. That hasn’t stopped some investors from fretting.\n“If we had a trade war, the scariest thing for me is not what’s the likelihood of it but what would I even do?” said Michael Kelly, global head of multiasset at PineBridge Investments, which has $85 billion in assets under management. “I don’t have a good answer for you on that. It’s what keeps me up at night.” \nMr. Kelly added that he doesn’t think a global trade war is likely. He said he used the volatility in financial markets last month to lighten exposure to U.S. financials and add to European banks, which he said could prove less vulnerable to trade conflicts than other large, multinational firms. \nSeveral investors believe the U.S.’s move on tariffs shouldn’t cause widespread market panic: While stocks connected to the affected industries could suffer, broader positive trends in the global economy should remain on track. Some argue the international response to the U.S. move could be muted.\nRay Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, pegged the odds of an actual trade war as quite low.\n“I believe that what is happening now is more for political show than for real threatening,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this month. He said he expects a minimal impact from the tariffs and that the Chinese response would likely be “small and symbolic.”\nNonetheless, Colin Harte, a multiasset portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London, said he has started to cut exposure to large, internationally oriented companies in favor of small and midcap stocks, which tend to be more domestically focused and could be better insulated from trade tensions. \nWhile the proposed U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum aren’t necessarily a problem for all trade-reliant emerging markets, the broader issue is whether more trade actions follow. \nAny action from the U.S. regarding China and intellectual property could lead to a bigger escalation of tensions, said André Roux, co-head of emerging-market fixed income at Investec Asset Management.\n“I absolutely worry about it,” he said, referring to tariffs. “The worry is what do they signal?”\nMr. Roux said he has cut some of his exposure to emerging-market currencies this year, including the Chinese yuan and Thai baht, partly in response to his concerns about trade. Asia would be more vulnerable than other regions to a trade war, he said.\nFor now, at least, many still say a trade war is unlikely. \n“A trade war is now a higher risk, but it does not seem inevitable,” Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in a client note. He predicts a small impact on corporate earnings, noting the benefit of the 2017 tax overhaul in the U.S. should exceed the lost competitiveness from the tariffs. \n—Saumya Vaishampayan contributed to this article.\nWrite to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com",
