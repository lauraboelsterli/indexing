Corvus’ lead product candidate, CPI-444, a small molecule inhibitor of the A2A receptor, is currently being evaluated in a multicenter Phase 1/1b clinical trial in patients with various solid tumors. This successive expansion cohort trial is examining the activity of CPI-444 both as a single agent and in combination with Genentech’s Tecentriq, an anti-PD-L1 antibody. Corvus is conducting the trial with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, under a clinical trial collaboration the two companies entered into in October 2015. CPI-444 in combination with Tecentriq is also being evaluated in a Phase 1b/2 randomized control trial in non-small cell lung cancer conducted by Genentech.\nTecentriq® is a registered trademark of Genentech.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the completion, timing and use of proceeds of the proposed public offering. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond Corvus’ control. Corvus’ actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, risks detailed in Corvus’ most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on March 7, 2018, including documents incorporated by reference therein, which includes Corvus’ current and future reports filed with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018. In particular, the following factors, among others, could cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements: market conditions and satisfaction of closing conditions related to the proposed public offering; the accuracy of Corvus’ estimates relating to its ability to initiate and/or complete preclinical studies and clinical trials; the ability of Corvus to utilize biomarker data, select a suitable dosing regimen; the results of preclinical studies may not be predictive of future results; the unpredictability of the regulatory process; and regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries. Although Corvus believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot guarantee that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and the timing of events and circumstances and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. All such statements speak only as of the date made, and Corvus undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nInvestor Contact:\nGuillermo Elias, Ph.D.\nDirector, Business Development\nCorvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n+1-650-900-4511\nGElias@corvuspharma.com\nMedia Contact:\nJulie Normart, W2O Group\n415-946-1087\njnormart@w2ogroup.com\nSource:Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
