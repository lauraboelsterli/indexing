    "text": "Ambac executes on key strategic priorities:\nSuccessfully concluded the Segregated Account Rehabilitation on February 12, 2018, resulting in an increase, on a proforma basis, of $7.56 1 , or 25% to December 31, 2017 book value Adversely Classified Credits reduced by $1.1 billion or 7.5% to $14.1 billion driven mostly by active loss mitigation efforts Insured net par reduced by $4 billion, or 6%, to $63 billion Increased investment in Ambac insured COFINA and PRIFA bonds to 58% from 40% and 29% from 24%, respectively Net Loss of $(19.5) million or $(0.43) per Diluted Share and Adjusted Earnings 2 of $5.5 million or $0.12 per Diluted Share for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 Book Value per Share decreased $2.81 to $30.52 and Adjusted Book Value 2 per Share decreased $0.22 to $24.34 at December 31, 2017 from September 30, 2017\nNEW YORK, Ambac Financial Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:AMBC) (\"Ambac\"), a holding company whose subsidiaries, including Ambac Assurance Corporation (\"AAC\"), provide financial guarantees, today reported a net loss of $(19.5) million, or $(0.43) per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $(190.9) million, or $(4.20) per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $5.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to an Adjusted Loss of $(149.8) million, or $(3.30) per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in Net loss and increase in Adjusted Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 were driven by lower public finance losses, higher investment returns, higher income on VIEs, higher gains from credit and interest rate derivatives, and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower premiums earned. During the third quarter of 2017, the net loss and Adjusted Loss were adversely impacted by public finance losses and loss expenses incurred, primarily related to Puerto Rico.\nClaude LeBlanc, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are extremely pleased with our successful achievements during the quarter in progressing our strategic priorities. On February 12, 2018, Ambac announced the exit from rehabilitation of the Segregated Account, a key milestone for unlocking long-term value for shareholders. The transaction will result in delivering an increase to Book Value of approximately $7.56 per share on a pro forma basis, which will be reflected in our first quarter 2018 results. This transaction will also result in material future operating expense savings and will significantly improve the financial and strategic flexibility of the company. Our fourth quarter results also reflect the continued progress in advancing our key strategic priorities. During the quarter we took significant steps towards improving Ambac's risk profile and financial stability through various actions, including proactive steps to de-risk AAC's legacy insurance portfolio. We also continued to actively pursue recoveries and protect our rights through litigation.\"\nMr. LeBlanc continued, \"As we move forward into 2018, we are committed to building on the significant achievements of the previous year in our improved operating paradigm. Our focus will be to build on our established momentum and on executing our other strategic priorities with the goal of increasing long-term shareholder value.\"\n1 See Pro Forma Financial Information section of this press release for further information\n2 See Non-GAAP Financial Data section of this press release for further information\nAmbac's Fourth Quarter 2017 Summary Results Better (Worse) ($ in millions, except per share data) 4Q2017 3Q2017 Amount Percent Net premiums earned $ 31.5 $ 53.0 $ (21.5 ) (41 )% Net investment income 107.1 87.2 19.9 23 % Other than temporary impairment losses (1.0 ) (13.5 ) 12.5 93 % Net realized investment gains (losses) (0.1 ) 6.2 (6.3 ) (102 )% Net change in fair value of credit derivatives 8.5 0.2 8.3 4,150 % Net gains (losses) on interest rate derivatives 23.0 4.0 19.0 475 % Income (loss) on Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") 21.2 (4.0 ) 25.2 630 % Losses and loss expenses (benefit) 102.3 209.8 107.5 51 % Operating expenses 28.7 33.8 5.1 15 % Interest expense 31.0 29.1 (1.9 ) (7 )% Insurance intangible amortization 34.2 45.7 11.5 25 % Provision for income taxes 12.6 5.4 (7.2 ) (133 )% Net income (loss) attributable to Common Stockholders (19.5 ) (190.9 ) 171.4 90 % Net income (loss) per diluted share $ (0.43 ) $ (4.20 ) $ 3.77 90 % Adjusted earnings (loss) 1 5.5 (149.8 ) 155.3 104 % Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share 1 $ 0.12 $ (3.30 ) $ 3.42 104 % Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders' equity 1,381.1 1,508.0 (126.9 ) (8 )% Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders' equity per share $ 30.52 $ 33.33 $ (2.81 ) (8 )% Adjusted book value 1 1,101.3 1,111.6 (10.3 ) (1 )% Adjusted book value per share 1 $ 24.34 $ 24.56 $ (0.22 ) (1 )% Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) 45.4 45.4 — — %\nAmbac's 2017 Summary Results Better (Worse) ($ in millions, except per share data) 2017 2016 Amount Percent Net premiums earned $ 175.3 $ 197.3 $ (22.0 ) (11 )% Net investment income 361.0 313.4 47.6 15 % Other than temporary impairment losses (20.2 ) (21.8 ) 1.6 7 % Net realized investment gains (losses) 5.4 39.3 (33.9 ) (86 )% Net change in fair value of credit derivatives 16.4 20.1 (3.7 ) (18 )% Net gains (losses) on interest rate derivatives 59.6 (50.3 ) 109.9 218 % Income (loss) on Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") 19.7 (14.1 ) 33.8 240 % Losses and loss expenses (benefit) 513.2 (11.5 ) (524.7 ) (4,563 )% Operating expenses 121.5 113.7 (7.8 ) (7 )% Interest expense 119.9 124.3 4.4 4 % Insurance intangible amortization 150.9 174.6 23.7 14 % Provision for income taxes 44.5 30.7 (13.8 ) (45 )% Net income (loss) attributable to Common Stockholders (328.7 ) 74.8 (403.5 ) (539 )% Net income (loss) per diluted share $ (7.25 ) $ 1.64 $ (8.89 ) (542 )% Adjusted earnings (loss) 1 (165.1 ) 314.8 (479.9 ) (152 )% Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share 1 $ (3.64 ) $ 6.89 $ (10.53 ) (153 )% Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders' equity 1,381.1 1,713.9 (332.8 ) (19 )% Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders' equity per share $ 30.52 $ 37.94 $ (7.42 ) (20 )% Adjusted book value 1 1,101.3 1,331.7 (230.4 ) (17 )% Adjusted book value per share 1 $ 24.34 $ 29.48 $ (5.14 ) (17 )% Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) 45.4 45.7 0.3 1 % 1 Non-GAAP Financial Data\nNet Premiums Earned\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, net premiums earned were $31.5 million, compared to $53.0 million in the third quarter of 2017, including accelerations of $8.8 million and $26.2 million, respectively. Normal premiums earned decreased $4.1 million or 15% primarily due to the continued runoff of the insured portfolio, including previously pre-refunded policies. Accelerated premiums earned declined $17.4 million or 66% primarily related to the impact of the active de-risking of two international asset-backed policies that occurred in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe following table provides a summary of net premiums earned for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively:\nThree Months Ended ($ in millions) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 Public Finance $ 11.5 $ 14.7 Structured Finance 5.2 5.6 International Finance 6.0 6.5 Total normal premiums earned 22.7 26.8 Accelerated earnings 8.8 26.2 Total net premiums earned $ 31.5 $ 53.0 Net Investment Income\nNet investment income for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2017 was $107.1 million and $87.2 million, respectively. Net investment income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased primarily from accelerated accretion on Ambac-insured RMBS bonds, reflecting revised future cash flows from the impact of the exit of the Segregated Account from rehabilitation, which occurred on February 12, 2018. Net gains on invested assets classified as trading were $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe fair value of the consolidated investment portfolio decreased approximately $0.5 billion from September 30, 2017, to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2017, due primarily to an increase in the allocation to cash in anticipation of the Segregated Account rehabilitation exit transactions.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, AAC acquired additional AAC-insured Puerto Rico securities. As of December 31, 2017, AAC owned approximately 58% and 29% of its insured COFINA and PRIFA bonds, compared to 40% and 24%, respectively, at September 30, 2017. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, Ambac owned $2.2 billion of Ambac insured RMBS, which included approximately $1.6 billion or 41% of total Deferred Amounts (including interest) outstanding.\nLosses and Loss Expenses and Loss Reserves\nLosses and loss expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $102.3 million, as compared to $209.8 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nThe following table provides losses and loss expenses incurred by bond type for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017:\nThree Months Ended ($ in millions) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 RMBS $ 18.2 $ (34.4 ) Domestic public finance 42.2 212.5 Student loan 0.9 1.6 Ambac UK (7.3 ) (12.7 ) All other credits 2.6 (1.9 ) Interest on Deferred Amounts 45.7 44.7 Total losses and loss expenses $ 102.3 $ 209.8 Fourth quarter of 2017 RMBS losses and loss expenses of $18.2 million, were driven by excess spread compression, loss expenses incurred and a reduction of representation and warranty subrogation recoveries, partially offset by a benefit of $21.8 million related to RMBS transactions terminated during the quarter. Third quarter of 2017 RMBS losses and loss expenses were a benefit of $34.4 million, driven by improved credit performance and the impact of a settlement with a mortgage insurer and a trustee (among other parties) resulting in recoveries of previously recorded losses.\nDomestic public finance losses and loss expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $42.2 million primarily related to adverse development in Puerto Rico. In the third quarter of 2017, domestic public finance losses and loss expenses were $212.5 million and were also impacted mostly by adverse developments in Puerto Rico.\nAmbac UK losses and loss expenses were a benefit of $7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of improved credit performance and foreign exchange gains. Third quarter of 2017 Ambac UK losses and loss expenses were a benefit of $12.7 million primarily as a result of foreign exchange gains.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, net claim and loss expenses recovered, net of reinsurance, were $14.2 million which included $73.9 million of losses and loss expenses paid, offset by $88.1 million of subrogation received. Subrogation received included $49.7 million received from a mortgage insurer settlement. During the third quarter of 2017, net claim and loss expenses paid, net of reinsurance, were $140.7 million which included $178.3 million of losses and loss expenses paid, primarily driven by claims paid on Puerto Rico bonds, offset by $37.6 million of subrogation received.\nGross loss and loss expense reserves (gross of reinsurance) were $4.114 billion at December 31, 2017, and $4.0 billion at September 30, 2017, which were net of $1.834 billion and $1.844 billion, respectively, of estimated subrogation recoveries related to AAC's pursuit of legal remedies to seek redress for breaches of representations and warranties. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $3.867 billion of Deferred Amounts, including accrued interest payable of $839.7 million, remained unpaid. The Deferred Amounts, including accrued interest, were fully discharged as a result of the Segregated Account rehabilitation exit transactions in February 2018. (See Subsequent Event section of this press release).\nThe following table provides gross loss and loss expense reserves by bond type at December 31, 2017, and September 30, 2017:\n($ in millions) December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 RMBS $ 2,598 $ 2,489 Domestic public finance 816 801 Student loans 308 307 Ambac UK 286 290 All other credits 17 14 Loss expenses 89 99 Total loss and loss expense reserves $ 4,114 $ 4,000 Net Gains (Losses) on Interest Rate Derivatives\nThe interest rate derivatives portfolio is positioned to benefit from rising interest rates as a partial economic hedge against interest rate exposure in the AAC insured and investment portfolios (the \"macro-hedge\").\nNet gains on interest rate derivatives were $23.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $4.0 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nExpenses\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by $5.1 million to $28.7 million from $33.8 million in the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower compensation costs reflecting lower salaries and severance costs, partially offset by a net increase in performance based compensation. Fourth quarter operating expenses included $5.2 million and $5.0 million of expenses associated with the restructuring transaction that concluded on February 12, 2018, and the OCI, respectively, compared to $7.0 million and $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2017. Subsequent to the conclusion of the Segregated Account rehabilitation, all restructuring expenses and a majority of OCI related operating expenses associated with the Segregated Account are expected to be eliminated.\nTaxes and Net Operating Loss Carry-Forwards (\"NOLs\")\nProvision for income taxes was $12.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $5.4 million for the third quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter provision included $8.7 million of Ambac UK current taxes as compared to $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $2.0 million of state income taxes. The fourth quarter provision also included $1.9 million of net impact related to the implementation of H.R.1 (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) stemming from $31.4 million in deferred taxes associated with foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a benefit of $29.6 million from the repeal of the corporate AMT. The deferred tax expense will reverse over future periods and the AMT credit will be refunded to AAC in installments through 2021.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Ambac consolidated group had $3.7 billion of NOLs, including $1.4 billion at Ambac and $2.3 billion at AAC.\nAs a result of taxable income at AAC in 2017, AAC utilized NOLs in an amount that resulted in the accrual of $30.5 million of tolling payments. These tolling payments are anticipated to be received by Ambac from AAC in May 2018.\nTotal Ambac Financial Group, Inc. Stockholders' Equity\nStockholders’ equity at December 31, 2017, was down 8% to $1.4 billion, or $30.52 per share compared to $1.5 billion or $33.33 per share as of September 30, 2017, due to the net (loss) of $(19.5) million, and unrealized losses on certain Ambac insured bonds held in the investment portfolio.\nInsured Portfolio\nThe financial guarantee insurance portfolio net par amount outstanding declined 6% during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, to $62.7 billion from $66.7 billion at September 30, 2017. The reduction in the insured portfolio was primarily related to a decrease of $2.7 billion in the public finance sector related to call and refunding activity; a decrease of $1.1 billion in the structured finance portfolio primarily related to amortization and pre-payments, including the RMBS terminations noted above; and a $0.2 billion decrease in the international portfolio.\nDetails of financial guarantee insurance portfolio are highlighted in the below table.\nNet Par Outstanding December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 By Sector: Public finance 51 % 52 % Structured Finance 22 % 22 % International 27 % 26 % By Holder: General account 60 % 61 % Ambac UK 25 % 24 % Segregated account 15 % 15 % Adversely Classified Credits decreased by a net $1.1 billion, or 7.5% to $14.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to active risk mitigation and runoff of RMBS transactions; calls, refundings and negotiated refinancings in the public finance sector; and an active de-risking related to the termination of an international transportation exposure.\nSubsequent Events\nAmbac Assurance's Segregated Account Rehabilitation Concluded\nOn February 12, 2018, Ambac announced the exit from rehabilitation of AAC's Segregated Account, following the successful completion of the holistic restructuring transaction (the \"Transaction\") announced on July 19, 2017. The Transaction was completed following the expiration of AAC's surplus note exchange offers and consent solicitation, and the satisfaction of all remaining conditions precedent.\nThe Transaction resulted in the discharge of all deferred payment obligations, including accretion thereon, of approximately $3.9 billion and the cancellation of approximately $809.5 million in principal plus accrued and unpaid interest outstanding of General Account Surplus Notes in exchange for an effective consideration package of (i) $0.40 in cash, (ii) $0.41 in principal amount of new Secured Notes and (iii) $0.125 General Account Surplus Notes. As presented below, in Non-GAAP Financial Data, the impact of this Transaction on Ambac's Total Shareholders' Equity and Adjusted Book Value at December 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis, is an increase of $7.56 per share to $38.08 per share of Book Value and $31.90 per share of Adjusted Book Value (a non-GAAP financial measure).\nSurplus Note Interest Payment\nIn connection with the consummation of the Transaction, the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance approved a $13.5 million interest payment, to be made on March 1, 2018, representing approximately six months of interest on the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest for surplus notes that remain outstanding (including surplus notes that were issued by the Segregated Account, all of which are held by AFG) after the closing of the Transaction. AFG will receive approximately $2.6 million of this interest payment based on its remaining ownership of surplus notes.\nTier 2 Financing\nAmbac Assurance also issued $240.0 million of new money senior notes in connection with the closing of the Transaction on February 12, 2018, secured by Ambac Assurance’s rights, title and interest in cash and non-cash proceeds (net of reinsurance) above $1.6 billion received in connection with certain RMBS litigations.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard\nOn January 1, 2018 Ambac adopted FASB ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10) - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which impacts the accounting for financial assets and liabilities. Ambac elected the fair value option for all VIE financial assets and financial liabilities with net fair value changes reported in Income (loss) on variable interest entities in the Consolidated Statements of Total Comprehensive Income. Upon implementation of ASU 2016-01, the credit component of fair value changes in VIE liabilities will no longer be reported in net income; rather it will be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Accordingly, we will likely experience greater volatility in net income (specifically the Income (loss) on variable interest entities line item) in future periods.\nNon-GAAP Financial Data\nIn addition to reporting Ambac’s quarterly financial results in accordance with GAAP, Ambac reports two non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Book Value. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance or financial position that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures are net income attributable to common stockholders for Adjusted Earnings and Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders’ equity for Adjusted Book Value. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures because they provide greater transparency and enhanced visibility into the underlying drivers of our business. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Book Value are not substitutes for Ambac’s GAAP reporting, should not be viewed in isolation, may be subject to change, and may differ from similar reporting provided by other companies, which may define these non-GAAP measures differently.\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss). Adjusted Earnings (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, as reported under GAAP, adjusted on an after-tax basis for the following:\nNon-credit impairment fair value (gain) loss on credit derivatives: Elimination of the non-credit impairment fair value gains (losses) on credit derivatives, which is the amount in excess of the present value of the expected estimated credit losses. Such fair value adjustments are affected by, and in part fluctuate with, changes in market factors such as interest rates and credit spreads, including the market’s perception of Ambac’s credit risk (“Ambac CVA”), and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. These adjustments allow for all financial guarantee contracts to be accounted for consistent with the Financial Services – Insurance Topic of ASC, whether or not they are subject to derivative accounting rules. Insurance intangible amortization: Elimination of the amortization of the financial guarantee insurance intangible asset. This adjustment ensures that all financial guarantee contracts are accounted for consistent with the provisions of the Financial Services – Insurance Topic of the ASC. Foreign exchange (gains) losses: Elimination of the foreign exchange gains (losses) on the re-measurement of assets, liabilities and transactions in non-functional currencies. This adjustment eliminates the foreign exchange gains (losses) on all assets, liabilities and transactions in non-functional currencies, which enables users of our financial statements to better view the business results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly as assets held in non-functional currencies have grown, and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of Ambac's operating performance. Fair value (gain) loss on interest rate derivative from Ambac CVA: Elimination of the gains (losses) relating to Ambac’s CVA on interest rate derivative contracts. Similar to credit derivatives, fair values include the market’s perception of Ambac’s credit risk and this adjustment only allows for such gain or loss when realized.\nAdjusted Earnings were $5.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2017 as compared to an Adjusted Loss of $(149.8) million or $(3.30) per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted Earnings for the fourth quarter 2017 relative to the Adjusted Loss for third quarter of 2017 resulted mostly from lower losses and loss expenses.\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to the non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Earnings (Loss), for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017, and September 30, 2017, respectively:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 ($ in millions, other than per share data) $ Amount Per Diluted Share $ Amount Per Diluted Share Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ (19.5 ) $ (0.43 ) $ (190.9 ) $ (4.20 ) Adjustments: Non-credit impairment fair value (gain) loss on credit derivatives (7.9 ) (0.17 ) (0.1 ) — Insurance intangible amortization 34.2 0.75 45.7 1.01 Foreign exchange (gains) losses (1.3 ) (0.03 ) (4.5 ) (0.11 ) Adjusted Earnings (loss) $ 5.5 $ 0.12 $ (149.8 ) $ (3.30 ) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) 45.4 45.4 Adjusted Book Value. Adjusted Book Value is defined as Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders’ equity as reported under GAAP, adjusted for after-tax impact of the following:\nNon-credit impairment fair value losses on credit derivatives: Elimination of the non-credit impairment fair value loss on credit derivatives, which is the amount in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit loss. GAAP fair values are affected by, and in part fluctuate with, changes in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, including Ambac’s CVA that are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. These adjustments allow for all financial guarantee contracts to be accounted for within Adjusted Book Value consistent with the provisions of the Financial Services—Insurance Topic of the ASC, whether or not they are subject to derivative accounting rules. Insurance intangible asset: Elimination of the financial guarantee insurance intangible asset that arose as a result of Ambac’s emergence from bankruptcy and the implementation of Fresh Start reporting. This adjustment ensures that all financial guarantee contracts are accounted for within Adjusted Book Value consistent with the provisions of the Financial Services—Insurance Topic of the ASC. Ambac CVA on interest rate derivative liabilities: Elimination of the gain relating to Ambac’s CVA on interest rate derivative contracts. Similar to credit derivatives, fair values include the market’s perception of Ambac’s credit risk and this adjustment only allows for such gain when realized. Net unearned premiums and fees in excess of expected losses: Addition of the value of the unearned premium revenue (\"UPR\") on financial guarantee contracts, in excess of expected losses, net of reinsurance. This non-GAAP adjustment presents the economics of UPR and expected losses for financial guarantee contracts on a consistent basis. In accordance with GAAP, stockholders’ equity reflects a reduction for expected losses only to the extent they exceed UPR. However, when expected losses are less than UPR for a financial guarantee contract, neither expected losses nor UPR have an impact on stockholders’ equity. This non-GAAP adjustment adds UPR in excess of expected losses, net of reinsurance, to stockholders’ equity for financial guarantee contracts where expected losses are less than UPR. Net unrealized investment (gains) losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: Elimination of the unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s investments that are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The AOCI component of the fair value adjustment on the investment portfolio may differ from realized gains and losses ultimately recognized by the Company based on the Company’s investment strategy. This adjustment only allows for such gains and losses in Adjusted Book Value when realized.\nAmbac has a significant tax NOL that is offset by a full valuation allowance in the GAAP consolidated financial statements. As a result of this and other considerations, for purposes of non-GAAP measures, we utilize a 0% effective tax rate, which is subject to change in the future.\nAdjusted Book Value was $1.101 billion, or $24.34 per share, at December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.112 billion, or $24.56 per share, at September 30, 2017.\nThe following table reconciles Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders’ equity to the non-GAAP measure Adjusted Book Value as of each date presented:\nDecember 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 ($ in millions, other than per share data) $ Amount Per Share $ Amount Per Share Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders’ equity $ 1,381.1 $ 30.52 $ 1,508.0 $ 33.33 Adjustments: Non-credit impairment fair value losses on credit derivatives 0.6 0.01 8.5 0.19 Insurance intangible asset (847.0 ) (18.71 ) (878.0 ) (19.41 ) Net unearned premiums and fees in excess of expected losses 597.3 13.20 625.4 13.82 Net unrealized investment (gains) losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (30.8 ) (0.68 ) (152.4 ) (3.37 ) Adjusted Book Value $ 1,101.3 $ 24.34 $ 1,111.6 $ 24.56 Shares outstanding (in millions) 45.3 45.3 Pro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of Ambac as of December 31, 2017, is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Ambac giving effect to the Rehabilitation Exit Transactions as further described in Note 1. Background and Business Description and Note 17. Subsequent Events of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Ambac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2017. The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of Ambac includes unaudited pro forma adjustments that are driven by assumptions and factually supportable information directly attributable to the Rehabilitation Exit Transactions and the Tier 2 Notes issuance as if they occurred on December 31, 2017 rather than February 12, 2018.\nPro Forma Condensed Consolidated GAAP Balance Sheet\n(Unaudited)\n($ in Millions) December 31,\n2017 Adjustments Pro forma\nDecember 31,\n2017 Assets: Total non-variable interest entity investments, cash and cash equivalents $ 6,364 $ (1,786 ) (1 ) $ 4,578 Subrogation recoverable 631 1,312 (2 ) 1,943 Other assets 1,696 (9 ) (3 ) 1,687 Total VIE assets 14,501 — 14,501 Total assets $ 23,192 $ (483 ) $ 22,710 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity: Liabilities: Loss and loss expense reserve $ 4,745 $ (2,555 ) (2 ) $ 2,190 Long-term debt 992 1,952 (4 ) 2,944 Accrued interest payable 437 (224 ) (4 ) 213 Other liabilities 1,007 — 1,007 Total VIE liabilities 14,366 — 14,366 Total liabilities 21,547 (827 ) 20,720 Stockholders' equity 1,645 344 (2)(5)(6) 1,989 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 23,192 $ (483 ) $ 22,710 (1) The net cash and investment outflows reflects the distributions under the Rehabilitation Exit Transactions as follows:\n($ in Millions) Cash payment to third parties for settlement of Deferred Amounts and Surplus Notes $ (1,347 ) Cash payment for unpaid claims presented after record date (30 ) Cash payment for one-time interest payment on remaining surplus notes (11 ) Cash payment for remaining debt issuance costs (8 ) Receipt of Tier 2 proceeds 240 Receipt of Secured Notes issued by Ambac LSNI 764 Reduction in value of Ambac-insured RMBS securities held in the investment portfolio (1,394 ) $ (1,786 ) (2) The transactions pursuant to the Second Amended Plan of Rehabilitation where Ambac is settling its unpaid claims at a discount is being accounted for as an extinguishment, where the discount of approximately $287 is reflected in the pro forma consolidated balance sheet as an increase to Retained Earnings. As a result of the settlement, future net cash flows on certain policies will become an asset and are reclassified to Subrogation recoverable.\n(3) Reflects the reclass of previously capitalized costs directly associated with the issuance of the Ambac Note or Tier 2 Notes to Long-term debt that will be amortized as part of the effective yield calculation.\n(4) The discount received in the other Rehabilitation Exit Transactions are being accounted for as a debt modification since the creditors before and after the discount remain the same and the change in the terms is not considered substantial. A substantial change is considered to be a change in cash flows of equal to or greater than 10% as a result of the modification of terms. As the change in cash flows is less than 10%, debt modification accounting is appropriate. Under debt modification accounting, no gain or loss is recorded, and a new effective interest rate is established based on the Ambac Note cash flows. Additionally, any consideration paid that is directly related to the issuance of the Ambac Note is capitalized and amortized as part of the effective yield calculation. The net long-term debt increase reflects the impact of the Rehabilitation Exit Transactions as follows:\n($ in Millions) Long-term Debt Accrued Interest Payable Tier 2 Notes issuance $ 240 $ — Ambac Note issuance 2,145 — Cash payment for on-time current interest payment on remaining surplus notes — (11 ) Deferred loss on Rehabilitation Exit Transactions and debt issuance costs (20 ) — Reduction in carrying value of Surplus Notes (413 ) (213 ) $ 1,952 $ (224 ) (5) As a result of the Rehabilitation Exit Transactions, Ambac will receive settlement of its ownership in Deferred Amounts and would realize a gain of $57 over the carrying value of the associated Ambac-insured RMBS as of December 31, 2017.\n(6) This pro forma information does not incorporate any assumptions regarding taxes.\nPro Forma Adjusted Book Value\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table reconciles total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders' equity to the non-GAAP measure Adjusted Book Value on both a Reported and Pro Forma basis.\nPro Forma Reported Post Restructuring (1) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Change ($ in millions, except per share data) $ Amount Per Share $ Amount Per Share $ Amount Per Share Total AFGI Shareholders' Equity $ 1,381.1 $ 30.52 $ 1,725.2 38.08 $ 344.0 $ 7.56 Adjustments: Non-credit impairment unrealized fair value losses on credit derivatives 0.6 0.01 0.6 0.01 — — Insurance intangible asset (847.0 ) (18.71 ) (847.0 ) (18.71 ) — — Net unearned premiums and fees in excess of expected losses 597.3 13.20 597.3 13.20 — — Net unrealized investment (gains) losses in AOCI (30.8 ) (0.68 ) (30.8 ) (0.68 ) — — Adjusted book value $ 1,101.3 $ 24.34 $ 1,445.3 $ 31.90 $ 344.0 $ 7.56 Shares Outstanding (in millions) 45.3 45.3 (1) Pro forma amounts are estimates, subject to revisions and are not reflective of actual or future operating results.\nEarnings Call and Webcast\nOn March 1, 2018 at 8:30am (ET), Claude LeBlanc, President and Chief Executive Officer, and David Trick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss fourth quarter 2017 results during a conference call.
