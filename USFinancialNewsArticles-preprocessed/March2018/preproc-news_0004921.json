    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 7:30 AM / Updated 25 minutes ago Madame Tussauds owner Merlin profit rises on more global visitors Reuters Staff 2 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Merlin Entertainments ( MERL.L ), operator of tourist attractions such as Madame Tussauds, met reduced guidance with a 9.5 percent rise in 2017 core earnings, benefitting from an increase in global visitors. The group also said on Thursday it was “highly confident” of the long term prospects for its business. Merlin, which also runs Legoland, the London Eye, Sea Life and theme parks such as Alton Towers in Britain, had warned on profit in October, saying a series of militant attacks in the UK had hit demand. Its shares have fallen 31 percent over the last year. However, the world’s second-biggest visitor attractions group behind Walt Disney ( DIS.N ) gets most of its profit from outside the UK. For 2017 it made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 474 million pounds ($653 million) - in line with company guidance of 470-480 million pounds and ahead of 433 million pounds made in 2016. Merlin said globally it had a record 66 million worldwide visitors in 2017, up 3.5 percent. Revenue rose 11.6 percent to 1.59 billion pounds, driven by growth in like-for-like revenue, new business development and favorable currency movements. The Legoland business was a particularly strong performer with revenue up 18.2 percent, helped by the opening of Legoland Japan. Legoland New York is targeted to open in 2020. “Merlin continues to evolve and, with attractive market fundamentals and the right strategy in place, we remain highly confident in the long term prospects for the business,” said Chief Executive Nick Varney. Shares in Merlin closed Wednesday at 340 pence, valuing the business at 3.5 billion pounds. Reporting by James Davey, Editing by Paul Sandle",
