We achieved double-digit growth in revenues year over year and recognized positive income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter. I'm incredibly proud of the whole Luna team, whose sharp focus allowed us to deliver these results. The demand for our test and measurement products is growing and this was reflected in our robust fourth quarter and 2017 full year results. Silicon photonics and its applications in high speed networks and data centers is driving the telecommunications test segment, and our ODiSI platform continues to gain traction with the ever-expanding use of composite materials in manufacturing. We believe the macro trends behind the growing demand in these markets leave us well positioned to continue our growth into 2018 and beyond.\"\nTotal revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were $13.2 million, compared to $11.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Technology development revenues grew to $5.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $4.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Products and licensing revenues were $8.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe company recognized income from continuing operations of $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"adjusted EBITDA\") was $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.

Research, development and engineering expenses increased to $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nBefore taxes, the company achieved essentially break-even results from continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to pre-tax income from continuing operations of $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the expenses recognized in connection with the retirement of the company's former chief executive officer, the pre-tax income from continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 would have been $0.7 million. After tax, the company recognized income from continuing operations of $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe company had income from discontinued operations of $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to a loss from discontinued operations of less than $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.

Technology development revenues increased to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Products and licensing revenues increased to $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, grew to $18.1 million compared to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross margin was 39% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 38% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses remained flat at $14.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2017 included $0.7 million of costs related to the retirement of the company's former chief executive officer as described above.\nResearch, development and engineering expenses were $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe company's resulting pre-tax loss from continuing operations improved to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. After tax, the company recognized a loss from continuing operations of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the company recognized income from discontinued operations of $14.7 million related to the after-tax gain associated with the sale of the company's HSOR business.\nThe company recognized net income attributable to common stockholders of $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net income for 2017 resulted from the income from discontinued operations discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn evaluating the operating performance of its business, the company's management considers adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain charges and credits that are required by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding the effect of certain non-cash expenses and items that the company believes may not be indicative of its operating performance, because either they are unusual and the company does not expect them to recur in the ordinary course of its business or they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA has been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the table following the financial statements attached to this press release.\nConference Call Information\nAs previously announced, the company will conduct an investor conference call at 5:00 p.m. (EDT) today to discuss its financial results and business developments for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the full year ended December 31, 2017.
