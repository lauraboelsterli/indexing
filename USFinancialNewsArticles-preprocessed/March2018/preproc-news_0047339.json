    "text": "CLARKSTON, Mich., March 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Association of Independent Mortgage Experts (AIME), the newly launched organization created to empower and support independent mortgage professionals, has grown its leadership team by announcing John L. Councilman as the Senior Vice President of Legislative and Government Affairs, and establishing a Compliance and Regulatory Advisory Council to spearhead progressive legislative and social measures.\nCouncilman, a well-known and highly regarded mortgage industry veteran, served as President of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB) from 2014 to 2015. He started one of the first true secondary-market mortgage brokerages in the state of Maryland in 1985. A founding member of that state association, Councilman was successful in rewriting the state's mortgage law, passing loan originator licensing legislation, and authoring its appraisal management law. He was named the state's first Mortgage Broker of the Year in 1998 and 1999, and was also named the National Mortgage Broker of the Year in 2009 and 2010.\n\"Filling out these leadership positions is a major initial step in fortifying AIME as a strong, high-powered organization for independent mortgage professionals,\" said Anthony Casa, founder of AIME. \"We're not a fledgling startup. AIME has some of the top legal and compliance minds from some of the biggest players in the wholesale industry, and will shine as the premier membership organization for mortgage experts.\"\nIn addition, AIME also pegged seven people to serve as members of its Compliance & Regulatory Advisory Council, which includes compliance executives from several top lenders, and leading industry attorneys. The Council will serve to guide AIME across industry topics and initiatives, as well as assist AIME members with a range of pertinent issues and compliance-related topics. The Council appointees are:\nMichael Barone, Managing Partner, Abrams, Garfinkel, Margolis, Bergson, LLP Matthew Cronin, Vice President, Regulatory Compliance, Flagstar Bank Ronald Gapp, General Counsel and Compliance Officer, PRMG G. Bradley Hargrave, Shareholder, Medlin & Hargrave Jeffrey Midbo, SVP, Deputy General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, United Wholesale Mortgage Bonnie S. Nachamie, Partner, Bonnie S. Nachamie, P.C. Wayne A. Watkinson, Principal, Offit, Kurman\nThe mission of AIME is dedicated to providing \"independent\" mortgage experts – brokers, loan originators, processors and the like, who own or work for or in support of a company or entity that does not underwrite its own loans – with real tangible value.\nFor more information on the benefits associated with an AIME membership, visit www.AIMEGroup.com .\nMedia Contact: info@aimegroup.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/former-namb-president-john-l-councilman-takes-leadership-role-with-newly-formed-association-of-independent-mortgage-experts-aime-300620718.html\nSOURCE Association of Independent Mortgage Experts",
