    "text": "China said it will begin applying its so-called social credit system to flights and trains and stop people who have committed misdeeds from taking such transport for up to a year.\nPeople who would be put on the restricted lists included those found to have committed acts like spreading false information about terrorism and causing trouble on flights, as well as those who used expired tickets or smoked on trains, according to two statements issued on the National Development and Reform Commission's website on Friday.\nThose found to have committed financial wrongdoings, such as employers who failed to pay social insurance or people who have failed to pay fines, would also face these restrictions, said the statements which were dated March 2.\nIt added that the rules would come into effect on May 1.\nThe move is in line with President's Xi Jinping's plan to construct a social credit system based on the principle of \"once untrustworthy, always restricted\", said one of the notices which was signed by eight ministries, including the country's aviation regulator and the Supreme People's Court.\nChina has flagged plans to roll out a system that will allow government bodies to share information on its citizens' trustworthiness and issue penalties based on a so-called social credit score.\nHowever, there are signs that the use of social credit scoring on domestic transport could have started years ago. In early 2017, the country's Supreme People's Court said during a press conference that 6.15 million Chinese citizens had been banned from taking flights for social misdeeds.",
