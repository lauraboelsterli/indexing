    "text": "Retiring early can actually lengthen your life, economists from the University of Amsterdam affirmed in a 2017 study published in the journal of Health and Economics .\nMale Dutch civil servants over the age of 54 who retired early were an astounding 42 percent less likely to die over the subsequent five years compared to those who continued working. (There were too few women in the sample who met the early retirement eligibility requirements — including having contributed to the public sector pension fund for ten consecutive years — to be included.)\nThe researchers explain the potentially life-extending effects of retiring in two ways.\nshow chapters This couple retired in their 30s and travels full-time in an Airstream trailer      7:59 AM ET Thu, 19 Oct 2017 | 01:01 For one, retiring frees you up, allowing you more time to invest in your health. That benefits you whether you're sleeping more, exercising or simply going to the doctor as soon as an issue appears.\nSecond, work can be stressful, while retirement can alleviate that stress, and stress can create hypertension, a risk factor for various potentially fatal conditions. Retirees in this study were significantly less likely to die from stroke or from cardiovascular diseases.\nThe finding echoes a few others, the New York Times reports: \"An analysis in the United States found about seven years of retirement can be as good for health as reducing the chance of getting a serious disease (like diabetes or heart conditions) by 20 percent. Positive health effects of retirement have also been found by studies using data from Israel , England , Germany and other European countries .\"\nshow chapters How this couple saved over $1 million in retirement savings to retire by 43      9:59 AM ET Wed, 8 March 2017 | 01:32 Still, there are benefits to having a job, too. That's why the advice from a Japanese doctor and longevity expert who lived until 105 is, \" Don't retire .\"\nBeing in a work environment can keep your mind and, in some cases, your body active. If you work alongside others, that might also provide a sense of belonging . Social isolation, as the Times notes, is linked to cognitive decline and even death.\nA job might also give you a sense of purpose , which research has shown to be associated with a host of benefits, including having a healthier heart and lower risk of dementia . In fact, one study found that the longer you work, the lower your risk for dementia.\n\nBut those kinds of needs can also be fulfilled outside of the office, as long as you remain active and social. Many retirees choose to volunteer , for example, which can benefit you immensely, especially if you're passionate about the cause, the",
