    "text": "4 Hours Ago | 01:00 \nWant to be Oprah Winfrey's next door neighbor? Whoever buys this $45 million Montecito, California estate will be. \nMontecito, located nearly two hours west of Los Angeles, is \"the Hollywood Riviera,\" says The Agency's Mauricio Umansky, who is listing the home. \"It has definitely become an enclave for celebrities coming from L.A. This is where they like to come and rest.\" \nAlong with Winfrey, stars in the hood include Ellen Degeneres and Rob Lowe. The Agency \nThe 21,345-square-foot mansion is featured on a new episode of \"Secret Lives of the Super Rich.\" \nTake a look inside. \nA long journey up the estate's winding driveway leads to a luxurious entrance, which Umansky says reminds him of an Italian Villa. The Agency \nThe mansion has eight bedrooms and 13 baths. The Agency \nBuilt by former chairman of Comcast Spectacor, the late Ed Snider (who once had stakes in sports teams like Super Bowl LII champions, the Philadelphia Eagles), the place still exhibits his expensive tastes. \nFor example, the library boasts a leather-bound ceiling. CNBC \nAnd the mansion has its own pub. \n\"I could just picture myself right here playing poker, having a scotch, sitting with my pals listening to a little Frank Sinatra,\" says Umansky. The Agency \nOutside, there are 9 acres of meticulously landscaped land, including a backyard complete with award-winning roses. The Agency \n\"I dont know what that means. But can you imagine having an award winning rose in your backyard?\" says Umansky. \"That's pretty cool.\" \nMiraculously, the property was unscathed following devastating mudslides and the largest wildfire in California's history, which hit the area in December. \nWatch all new episodes of \"Secret Lives of the Super Rich,\" Wednesdays at 10pm ET/PT on CNBC. show chapters",
