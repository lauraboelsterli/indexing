Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, adding back net loss from discontinued operations, interest expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, litigation costs, acquisition and restructuring costs, write-off of long-lived assets, and other adjustments, as noted in the tables below.\nYear Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2017 2016 2015 Net loss attributable to cogint $ (53,206 ) $ (29,086 ) $ (84,535 ) Net loss from discontinued operations attributable to cogint - - 41,950 Interest expense, net 9,683 7,593 468 Income tax benefit - (14,042 ) (16,583 ) Depreciation and amortization 14,193 12,631 841 Share-based compensation expense 33,996 29,249 34,160 Litigation costs 9,395 2,588 1,483 Acquisition and restructuring costs 5,541 488 1,268 Write-off of long-lived assets 3,626 4,055 - Non-cash loss on amendments of warrants 1,005 1,273 - Contingent earn-out costs - - 14,300 Non-recurring fund-raising costs - 224 - Adjusted EBITDA $ 24,233 $ 14,973 $ (6,648 ) Three Months Ended (In thousands) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net loss attributable to cogint $ (5,977 ) $ (5,386 ) Interest expense, net 2,585 2,032 Income tax benefit - (2,523 ) Depreciation and amortization 3,733 3,519 Share-based compensation expense 6,294 7,308 Non-cash loss on amendments of warrants 1,005 - Acquisition-related costs 749 57 Non-recurring legal and litigation costs 225 1,095 Non-recurring fund-raising costs - 224 Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,614 $ 6,326 We present adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe it provides useful information to our investors as it eliminates the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. In addition, we use it as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments, evaluate the performance of our senior management and measure the operating strength of our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours and is an indicator of the operational strength of our business. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect across all reportable segments of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and write-off of long-lived assets.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a performance measure that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The way we measure adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.\nSpin-off of Red Violet\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to spin-off its data and analytics business, Red Violet, earlier than anticipated (the “Spin-off”). The Spin-off, which is governed by a Separation and Distribution Agreement as well as other related agreements between cogint and Red Violet, each entered into on February 27, 2018 (collectively, the “Spin-off Agreements”). The Company will contribute $20.0 million in cash to Red Violet upon completion of the Spin-off. Red Violet has filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form 10, registering under the Exchange Act, the shares of Red Violet to be distributed in the Spin-off. As a result, upon completion of the Spin-off, cogint stockholders will hold shares of two public companies, cogint and Red Violet. cogint common stock will continue trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”).\nOn March 7, 2018, the Company announced that the Board of Directors established March 19, 2018 as the record date (the “Record Date”) and March 26, 2018 as the distribution date (the “Distribution Date”) for the Spin-off. On March 9, 2018, in order to meet NASDAQ initial listing requirement of a minimum $4.00 bid price, the Company adjusted the Spin-off ratio so that on the Distribution Date, stockholders of the Company will receive, by way of a dividend, one share of Red Violet common stock for each 7.5 shares of cogint common stock held as of the Record Date. On March 13, 2018, NASDAQ approved Red Violet’s application to list its common stock on NASDAQ under the symbol “RDVT.”\nPro forma of cogint reflecting the Spin-off of Red Violet (unaudited)\nThe following table includes the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma statements of operations of cogint for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as if the Spin-off of Red Violet had been completed as of the beginning of the periods being presented.\nPro Forma Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2017 2016 Revenue $ 211,690 $ 182,251 Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 140,341 129,492 Sales and marketing expenses 16,176 13,501 General and administrative expenses 29,895 22,163 Depreciation and amortization 13,055 12,024 Write-off of long-lived assets 3,626 - Total costs and expenses 203,093 177,180 Income from operations 8,597 5,071 Interest expense, net (5,653 ) (4,587 ) Income before income taxes 2,944 484 Income taxes 1,122 184 Net income $ 1,822 $ 300 Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.03 $ 0.01 Diluted $ 0.02 $ - Weighted average number of shares outstanding: Basic 72,369,185 57,322,752 Diluted 75,491,094 60,255,704 The unaudited pro forma disclosure gives effect to the following transactions and events as if they occurred at the beginning of the periods presented:\nPursuant to the Spin-off Agreements mentioned above, cogint will spin-off Red Violet by distributing 100% of Red Violet’s common stock to holders of cogint’s common stock and certain warrants, as a stock dividend on the Record Date of the Spin-off. Upon the Spin-off, cogint will continue to trade on the NASDAQ, with Fluent being its wholly-owned subsidiary. Certain corporate expenses, such as corporate expenses related to legal services, accounting and finance services, and other professional services, incurred during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were allocated to cogint assuming the Spin-off occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. In addition, the pro forma also includes the impact of additional restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to be granted to the new cogint directors, and additional costs in relation to transition period services provided to cogint by Red Violet. cogint will refinance its debt upon the Spin-off of Red Violet. In preparation of the pro forma, we used the assumption of a five-year long-term debt in the aggregate amount of $70.0 million, with an estimated annual interest rate of 8.5%. On March 12, 2018, cogint accelerated the outstanding shares of stock options, RSUs and restricted stock held by certain employees, consultants, and directors, including only those employees who will continue with Red Violet upon completion of the Spin-off, subject to such employees still being employed or providing services on the acceleration date. The related compensation expense will be recorded fully in the discontinued operations prior to the Spin-off. Income taxes are based on an expected effective income tax rate of 38.1%. As a result of the tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, we expect the effective income tax rate to be lowered going forward. The pro forma basic weighted average number of shares outstanding is primarily computed based on the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding of cogint, plus the number of accelerated or vested but not delivered shares of RSUs previously granted to employees, consultants, and directors, including only those employees who will continue with Red Violet upon completion of the Spin-off. The pro forma diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is primarily computed based on the pro forma basic weighted average number of shares outstanding, plus the outstanding RSUs that are not subject to acceleration.\nWe will continue to evaluate the financial performance of cogint after the Spin-off on a variety of key indicators, including adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, adding back interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, write-off of long-lived assets and other adjustments, as noted in the table below. Also see “Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above for details.\nPro Forma Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2017 2016 Net income $ 1,822 $ 300 Interest expense, net 5,653 4,587 Income tax expense 1,122 184 Depreciation and amortization 13,055 12,024 Share-based compensation expense 7,608 5,897 Write-off of long-lived assets 3,626 - Litigation costs 204 106 Acquisition and restructuring costs 890 488 Adjusted EBITDA $ 33,980 $ 23,586 The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only, and may not necessarily reflect our future results of operations or what the results of operations would have been had we completed the Spin-off of Red Violet as of the beginning of the periods presented.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180314005963/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nAlex Partners, LLC\nScott Wilfong, 425-242-0891\nPresident\nScott@alexpartnersllc.com\nSource: Cogint, Inc.",
