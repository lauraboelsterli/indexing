    "text": "SAN CLEMENTE, Calif., March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ReShape Lifesciences Inc. (NASDAQ:RSLS), a developer of minimally invasive medical devices to treat obesity and metabolic diseases, today announced that it will be rescheduling its conference call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 to Monday, April 2, 2018 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time.\nReShape Lifesciences management is in the process of reviewing the ReShape product lines and cost structure as it completes the integration of ReShape Medical and BarioSurg into the company. The company believes it can further reduce operating expenses, after accounting for integration-related expenses, by roughly 25%, resulting in a target cash burn of approximately $1.8 million per month, which is reduced from the earlier guidance of $2.5 million per month. Management of ReShape Lifesciences will share further details on the integration and on financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 on the conference call on April 2, 2018.\nIndividuals interested in listening to the conference call may do so by dialing (877) 280-7473 for domestic callers or (707) 287-9370 for international callers, using Conference ID: 4085569. To listen to a live webcast or a replay, please visit the investor relations section of the Company website at: ir.reshapelifesciences.com .\nAbout ReShape Lifesciences Inc.\nReShape Lifesciences™ is a medical device company focused on technologies to treat obesity and metabolic diseases. The FDA-approved ReShape Balloon™ System involves a non-surgical weight loss procedure that uses advanced balloon technology designed to take up room in the stomach to help people with a 30-40 kg/m 2 Body Mass Index (BMI) and at least one co-morbidity lose weight. ReShape vBloc™ Therapy, delivered by an FDA-approved pacemaker-like device called the ReShape vBloc System, is designed to help patients with a 40-45 kg/m 2 , or a 35-39.9 kg/m 2 BMI and at least one co-morbidity feel full and eat less by intermittently blocking hunger signals on the vagus nerve. The ReShape Vest™ System is an investigational, minimally invasive, laparoscopically implanted medical device that wraps around the stomach, emulating the gastric volume reduction effect of conventional weight-loss surgery, and is intended to enable rapid weight loss in obese and morbidly obese patients without permanently changing patient anatomy.\nForward-Looking Safe Harbor Statement:\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
