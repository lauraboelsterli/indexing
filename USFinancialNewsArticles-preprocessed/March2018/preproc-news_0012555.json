    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is planning to offer Canada and Mexico a temporary exemption from new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.\nThe proposal, which is expected to be unveiled on Thursday, would give Canada and Mexico a 30-day exemption from the tariffs, the Post reported, citing administration officials.\nIt said the exemptions could be extended based on progress on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.
