    "text": "Thanasak Wanichpan | Getty Images Facebook's news feed \nCambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm used by the Trump campaign during the 2016 elections, insisted on Saturday that it did not misuse or hold data obtained from Facebook users, despite having been sanctioned by the platform for doing so. \nOn Friday, Facebook announced that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica , suggesting the firm had not been honest about deleting user data sent to it by the makers of a popular psychology test app. That particular app, called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" was itself banned by Facebook back in 2015. \nHowever, the firm issued a statement on Saturday insisting that it \"fully complies\" with Facebook's terms of service, and was in touch with the platform to resolve the issue. \n\"Cambridge Analytica's Commercial and Political divisions use social media platforms for outward marketing, delivering data-led and creative content to targeted audiences. They do not use or hold data from Facebook profiles,\" the firm said, as it sought to distance itself from a company that originally gave them the data. \n\"In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States,\" Cambridge Analytica said. \n\"This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the U.K. Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent,\" it added. \n\"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" Cambridge said. \n\"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" it added. Spencer Platt | Getty Images People listen as Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a rally on October 22, 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio. \nDespite Facebook's claims that Cambridge Analytica used the information in the service of President Donald Trump's presidential election, the firm dismissed the notion. \n\"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\" it said. \"Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly.\"",
