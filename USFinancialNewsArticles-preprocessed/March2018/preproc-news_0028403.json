    "text": "DALLAS, March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Critical Start today announced a definitive agreement to acquire Advanced Threat Analytics , a next generation security analytics platform. Under terms of the agreement, Critical Start will acquire Advanced Threat Analytics for an undisclosed amount in cash and stock. The acquisition is expected to close in the next 30 days.\nIn its most recent Worldwide Semiannual Security Spending Guide , IDC forecasts the market for security-related hardware, software and services will reach nearly $120 billion by 2021 with managed security services representing the largest and fastest growing technology category with a CAGR of 14.3% 1 .\nAs the largest cybersecurity company based in Texas, Critical Start built its business on security strategy, assessment and implementation services, but expanded into managed security services in 2016 based on customer demand. After investing in a security operations center (SOC), Critical Start partnered with Advanced Threat Analytics to leverage its zero trust security analytics platform after researching existing SIEM services.\n\"We have won major enterprise deals against the largest legacy MSSPs because the combination of our CyberSOC, expert analysts and the ATA platform offer our clients something unique â€“ managed security services delivered in a completely transparent process using a mobile-first, zero trust platform,\" said Rob Davis, CEO, Critical Start. \"We're excited to have the Advanced Threat Analytics employees and technology join Critical Start as they will provide clear and compelling competitive differentiation for us in the rapidly expanding market for MSSP/MDR services.\"\n\"From day one, our mission has been to create a next generation SOC platform that solves the industry-wide problem of security alert overload. Only when false positives and known good items are removed can quality MSSP / MDR service be delivered to clients,\" said Alin Srivastava, President, Advanced Threat Analytics. \"The combination of Critical Start's CyberSOC team and the Advanced Threat Analytics platform creates an extremely unique way to deliver security services via our cloud-based SOC portal and the MobileSOC TM iOS and Android applications.\"\nIn addition to offering MSSP/MDR services to its own clients, the combination of Critical Start's CyberSOC team and ATA's technology also provides a white label offering for value added resellers (VARs) and managed service providers (MSPs) that are looking for a differentiated, turnkey solution for offering managed security services to their clients.\nAbout Critical Start\nCritical Start is the fastest-growing cybersecurity integrator in North America.
