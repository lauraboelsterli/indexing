The blocks are believed to mostly contain natural gas.\nShale production will also carry a set of challenges. Mexico is racked by gangland violence in states where the shale lies, and it also lacks infrastructure from pipelines to weight-bearing roads sufficient to handle intensive shale projects.\nAdditionally, the hydraulic fracturing used by the industry to break up shale deposits and get oil and gas to flow out also requires large amounts of water that arid northern Mexico lacks.\n60 BILLION BARRELS Mexico’s total prospective shale resources have been estimated at some 60 billion barrels of oil equivalent.\nThe shale potential is even larger than the country’s deepwater resources in its territorial waters in the Gulf, where Royal Dutch Shell is set to be the biggest producer in the years ahead after winning the most blocks at a January auction.\nThe September auction will be the fourth for 2018, the final year of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s six-year term. Shallow water blocks will be on offer later this month and then conventional onshore areas in July.\nSince a landmark energy reform was enacted in 2013-2014, Mexico has conducted eight oil and gas auctions, awarding some 90 contracts covering onshore and offshore acreage, according the CNH, which conducts the auctions and supervises the contracts.\nIf successful, the approximately 90 contracts could be worth more than $150 billion over their lifetime, according to energy ministry estimates.\nThe energy reform ended Pemex’s nearly 80 years of monopoly control over the sector and paved the way for the auctions, ending a long-standing constitutional prohibition on private companies operating fields on their own.\nDespite a decade-long shale boom in the United States, including lucrative plays near the U.S.-Mexico border like the Eagle Ford Formation, similar petroleum-rich geology that almost certainly extends into northern Mexico has yet to take off.\nEagle Ford has been heavily drilled and produces around 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of a total of 6.5 million bpd in output from the seven largest U.S. shale regions, U.S. government data shows.\nInterested companies might include Mexico’s Newpek, a unit of conglomerate Alfa, which has developed shale projects in Texas, and U.S. independent Lewis Energy, which has operated on both sides of the border.\nAlfa executives said on a February conference call that the company was in a good position to participate in Mexican energy projects, without specifying which ones.
