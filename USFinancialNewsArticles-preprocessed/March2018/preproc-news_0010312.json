    "text": "Rudy Gobert scored 21 points and collected 17 rebounds for his third straight double-double to help lead the Utah Jazz to a 94-80 victory over the Orlando Magic on Monday at Vivint Smart Home Arena in Salt Lake City.\nDonovan Mitchell tallied 19 points, five rebounds and four assists for the Jazz. Joe Ingles added 18 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. Utah won its third straight game.\nNikola Vucevic scored 15 points and collected 12 rebounds while Aaron Gordon chipped in 13 points to lead Orlando. The loss snapped a two-game winning streak for the Magic, who shot just 29-of-85 (34.1 percent) from the field.\nBoth teams got off to a strong start on offense. During a two-minute stretch in the first quarter, Orlando and Utah traded baskets over eight consecutive possessions. The Magic shot 12-of-22 in the quarter, while the Jazz were 11-of-22 from the field.\nOrlando finally got some separation when Shelvin Mack hit a go-ahead 3-pointer and Mario Hezonja drove for a layup in the final minute of the first quarter. It helped the Magic open up a 31-25 lead early in the second quarter.\nThe Jazz came to life in the second quarter behind some hot shooting from Ingles and Gobert. Both players contributed back-to-back baskets during a 19-5 run that gave Utah a 54-44 halftime lead. They combined to score 14 of 29 second-quarter points for the Jazz.\nOn the other end, Utah’s defense stifled Orlando. The Magic shot just 5-of-24 (20. 8 percent) from the field during the second quarter and made just one 3-pointer.\nRicky Rubio and Gobert opened the third quarter with back-to-back baskets and Jonas Jerebko drilled a 3-pointer to extend Utah’s lead to 62-46. Orlando rallied late in the quarter and cut the Jazz lead to 72-67 on back-to-back 3-pointers from Hezonja.\nThe Magic couldn’t get any closer. Utah pushed the lead back to double digits on a Jerebko 3-pointer a minute into the fourth quarter. The Jazz eventually built up a 92-78 lead when Ingles drove for a layup with 2:00 left.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
