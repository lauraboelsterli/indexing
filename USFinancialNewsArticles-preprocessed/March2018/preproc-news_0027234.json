    "text": "BOISE, Idaho, March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Syringa Networks , a fiber-optic network provider headquartered in Boise, announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice has approved the company's acquisition of certain CenturyLink, Inc . (former Level 3) metro network assets in the Boise, Idaho, area. This sale is subject to other governmental approvals, including the Federal Communications Commission, along with other customary closing conditions.\nLast fall, CenturyLink entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to divest former Level 3 metro fiber network assets in the metro areas of Albuquerque, N.M.; Boise, Idaho; and Tucson, Ariz., in connection with CenturyLink's acquisition of Level 3 Communications, Inc. The sale of the Level 3 Boise area network assets to Syringa Networks, once concluded, will fulfill part of that commitment.\nCenturyLink will continue to serve all former Level 3 customers in Boise unless they choose to be served by Syringa Networks following the closing of the sale. Where needed to provide uninterrupted service to its customers in Boise, CenturyLink will purchase network connectivity and services from Syringa Networks.\nThe proposed sale to Syringa does not include or affect the Boise area networks and business assets CenturyLink operated prior to the Level 3 acquisition. CenturyLink retains those assets and will continue to provide a full suite of leading edge telecommunications services to residential and business customers in Boise.\nThe financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\nAdditional Resources\nLearn more about the divestiture of assets: U.S. Department of Justice clears CenturyLink's acquisition of Level 3\nAbout Syringa Networks\nSyringa Networks specializes in custom network solutions for businesses, providing a broad range of networking services throughout Idaho, Utah, and Washington.
