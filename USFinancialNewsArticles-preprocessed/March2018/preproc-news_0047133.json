People disembark a Ryanair flight as some wait to board at Stansted airport in London, Britain September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne \nPortuguese union representatives have said the strikes are motivated by below-par labour conditions, including disciplinary processes and threats for not reaching in-flight sales objectives. \nAsked whether there will by flight cancellations, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O’Leary, who was in Vienna to promote the Laudamotion cooperation, said: “It depends on how many disruptions there are.
