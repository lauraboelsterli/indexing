    "text": "0 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department moved Thursday to limit a gap that could have let some investment-fund managers avoid higher taxes on their carried-interest income.\nThe formal move, previously announced by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, will be followed by regulations that will be retroactive to Jan. 1, the government said. \n“Treasury and the IRS stand ready to implement the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as Congress intended and provide the appropriate taxpayer guidance on how the law will be implemented,” Mr. Mnuchin said.\nRead More \nU.S. to Block Tax-Law Loophole on ‘Carried Interest’ Treasury Official, Critical of Parts of Tax Law, Quits (Feb. 23) Boom in Share Buybacks Renews Question of Who Wins From Tax Cuts Sign Up: Real Time Economics newsletter The tax law passed by Congress last year would let fund managers receiving a profits interest to get long-term capital-gains rates only if the asset is held for at least three years, beyond the one-year requirement that previously existed.\nThe top capital-gains tax rate is 20%, while the top tax rate on ordinary income that would otherwise apply is 37%.\nIn the new tax law, Congress’s change to carried-interest provisions was much narrower than many lawmakers had been talking about. It would still allow most private-equity firms, which hold assets for more than three years, to benefit from the capital-gains rates.\nBut even the narrower step contained a potential problem. The law doesn’t apply the new three-year holding-period requirement to assets owned by a corporation. But it doesn’t specify whether that means a traditional C corporation that has two layers of taxation or an S corporation that pays just one layer of tax.\nSome investors were considering using S corporations to avoid the three-year limit. The notice from Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service would prevent that by saying that S corporations can’t qualify for the exception from the three-year limit.\nMike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Investment Council, the private-equity industry’s trade group, welcomed the notice and said it “correctly clarifies the intent of the law on this tax provision.”\nTreasury’s notice warns taxpayers that the government wants to act retroactively and they should disclose any positions on tax returns that are contrary to the government guidance, said Steve Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington.\nBut, Mr. Rosenthal said, the notice is “skimpy,” lacks support in the law and stands in contrast with the plain words of the statute.\n“Would I be given pause by this if I were advising clients?” he said. “No. I would tell clients, disclose and be ready for challenge. But in the end you’re likely to win.”\nWrite to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com",
