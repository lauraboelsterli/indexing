REUTERS/Stephen Hird/File Photo/File Photo \nThe preference shares ( 35PG.L ) ( GACC_p.L ), which give holders fixed dividends that take priority over ordinary share dividends, fell sharply after Aviva said earlier this month it might cancel them. Cancelling the shares would have saved Aviva about 38 million pounds ($53.64 million) a year in coupon payments. \nThe preference shares recovered after Aviva said on Friday it would not go ahead with the plan, following complaints from shareholders and the British parliament’s Treasury Select Committee. \n“We are focusing on the treatment of those holders (and potentially now former holders) of the company’s irredeemable preference shares that may have lost out financially as a result of these events,” the Financial Conduct Authority said in a letter to the Treasury Select Committee. \n(Graphic: Preference share prices recover - reut.rs/2pKPel0 ) \n“We are undertaking a review to establish whether there are circumstances that might require an investigation to be conducted.” \nThe FCA said it was also looking at whether the way the FTSE 100 insurer’s plan was communicated was in line with listing, transparency and disclosure rules. \nPreference shares issued by other financial firms such as LLoyds ( LLOY_pb.L ) and Standard Chartered ( STAN_pa.L ) fell across the board as investors worried that the firms might follow Aviva’s lead in finding a way cancel the shares, which are generally described as irredeemable. \nThe FCA said it could support a broader review of the legal issues raised by this case, but also said that legal changes might not come within its remit. \nTreasury Committee chair Nicky Morgan responded in a public letter that she expected the Treasury to tackle the legal uncertainty around preference share rights “as a matter of urgency”. \nAviva declined to comment. \n($1 = 0.7084 pounds) Reporting by Carolyn Cohn and Sinead Cruise, graphic by Alasdair Pal, editing by Alexandra Hudson and Jane Merriman",
