    "text": "(Updates throughout)\nBy David Randall\nNEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - The threat of a trade war sent many world stock markets broadly lower in choppy trading on Friday and boosted safer assets like the yen and government bonds, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods.\nTrump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, although the measures have a 30-day consultation period before they take effect.\nAfter another bruising week, a key gauge of world equity markets was broadly headed for its first quarterly loss since early 2016 as a spike in volatility, rising inflation and the specter of a trade war spooked investors who had enjoyed a multi-year bull run.\nMSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.66 percent. The index has lost around 3.4 percent since Monday and was set for its worst week since early February when a spike in volatility had sent markets into a tailspin.\n“The equity markets are getting clobbered, which is not that surprising with fears of a trade war breaking out,” said Paul Fage, a TD Securities emerging markets strategist.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 134.85 points, or 0.56 percent, to 24,092.74, the S&P 500 gained 3.17 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,646.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.50 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,160.17.\nDefense stocks including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp rose after Trump signed a spending bill that will increase military spending despite an earlier threat to veto it.\nEuropean stocks fell broadly, with the Euro Stoxx index dropping 0.9 percent. That followed large declines in Asia, where the Nikkei tumbled 4.5 percent and the Hang Seng index lost 2.5 percent.\nChina urged the United States to “pull back from the brink,” but investors fear Trump’s tariffs are leading the world’s two largest economies into a trade war with potentially dire consequences for the global economy.\nChina disclosed its own plans on Friday to impose tariffs on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation against U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum products.\nSAFETY Amid the uncertain world economic climate, investors seeking safer assets jumped into government bond markets in Europe and the United States.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.8428 percent, from 2.832 percent late on Thursday.\nIn Europe, benchmark issuer Germany’s 10-year bond yields hovered close to 10-week lows struck a day earlier at around 0.52 percent. While German bond yields recovered in European trading, they were still on track for their biggest two-week drop since November.\nMany investors also turned to the Japanese yen, a currency likely to benefit from a full-fledged trade war.\nThe currency gained as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar to 104.635 yen, the first time it has been below 105 since November 2016. Investors later booked profits to leave the yen up 0.1 percent at 105.19 yen per dollar.\nThe Swiss franc, another currency bought in times of market uncertainty, rose 0.2 percent versus the dollar, although it fell against the euro.\nThe dollar index, tracking it against other major currencies, fell 0.45 percent.\nU.S. crude rose 1.85 percent to $65.49 per barrel and Brent was last at $69.38, up 1.46 percent.
