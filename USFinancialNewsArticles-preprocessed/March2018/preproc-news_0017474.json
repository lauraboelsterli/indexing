    "text": "2 COMMENTS Regarding the letters of Feb. 21 (“ Politicians Make Housing Less Affordable ”): Houston is about as unrestricted as it gets and has been no more successful than any other city at creating or maintaining affordable housing, This is true even though the lack of such housing has become an increasing bottleneck to development.\nGovernment is damned if it does and damned if it doesn’t. Once urban areas outgrow the land area that allows a mix of housing prices within a reasonable travel distance for most workers, the problem is inevitable. Good public transportation seems to be the most workable solution, but currently there is little will by taxpayers or developers to pay for it.\nThe market will fix it, of course, at a price.\nAugusta Era Golian\nSpring, Texas",
