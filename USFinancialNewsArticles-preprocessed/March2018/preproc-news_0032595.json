    "text": " 47 AM / Updated 16 minutes ago EU to investigate German grid firm TenneT's cross border power capacity curbs Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BRUSSELS, March 19 (Reuters) - EU antitrust authorities are investigating whether limits placed by German grid operator TenneT on cross border electricity capacity with Denmark breaches EU antitrust rules. The European Commission said it has a “constructive dialogue” with the German transmission system firm TenneT, a subsidiary of the Dutch government-owned operator of electrical grids in the Netherlands and Germany TenneT Holding IPO-TTH.AS. “The electricity produced by a wind mill in one country can reach the consumers in another,” Europe’s antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement on Monday. “Our investigation into TenneT is part of our efforts to ensure that electricity grid operators do not unjustifiably restrict the free flow of electricity between member states, to the detriment of European energy consumers.” (Reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel @AdeCar Editing by Foo Yun Chee)",
