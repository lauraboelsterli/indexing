    "text": "0 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose strongly in February, overcoming stiff headwinds from a shortage of inventory and rising mortgage rates and home prices.\nExisting-home sales increased 3% in February from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Compared with a year earlier, February sales were up 1.1%.\nThe strong showing eases concerns that declines in sales in the two previous months presaged a significant long-term slowdown in the market.\n”There was a lot of concern that housing has peaked. What today’s numbers tell us is that housing probably hasn’t peaked,” said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance and a former Fannie Mae chief economist.\nHome sales have long been weighed down by a shortage of supply , but in the last few months new factors have emerged that could also potentially weigh on demand, including rising mortgage rates and a tax bill that reduced the incentives for homeownership.\n”For the first time we’re seeing some of these hits to demand. It really hasn’t been enough to deter people who have maybe been on the market for a while,” said Cheryl Young, senior economist at home-tracker Trulia.\nAffordability is a growing obstacle for new buyers trying to enter the market. The national median existing home price rose 5.9% in February compared with a year earlier to $241,700.\nRising mortgage rates are compounding the affordability problem. The average rate nationwide for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage climbed nearly half a percentage point to 4.43% by the beginning of March from 3.95% at the beginning of January, according to mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac . Rates as of last Thursday stood at 4.44%, according to Freddie Mac. Borrowing costs remain low by historical standards.\nLawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said the group’s members are reporting that some owners are wary of selling because they would face higher mortgage rates on the next home. That “rate-lock” effect could be a growing challenge, given that economists expect mortgage rates to remain at their current levels or increase.\n”People ... don’t want to give up the lowest mortgage rates they’ve ever seen and probably will see,” Mr. Berson said.\nThe tax bill that passed late last year also reduces the tax advantages afforded to homeowners, which could have some impact on the market, especially in high-cost regions such as New York, New Jersey, California and the high-end suburbs of Chicago. Sales were strong last month in the West but sluggish in the Northeast, likely due in part to bad weather.\nThus far, Mr. Yun said the tax bill is having less of an impact on the market than the Realtors had warned. “Surprisingly, consumers are not looking at the mortgage interest deduction or the property tax deduction,” he said.\nHome sales were particularly strong on the upper end of the market. Sales of homes in the $500,000 to $750,000 range increased 11.9% in February from a year earlier. Meanwhile, sales in the $100,000 to $250,000 range, which accounts for more than 40% of the market, declined by 0.6%, according to NAR.\nA shortage of homes for sale has driven up prices in many regions and is helping to lock millennials out of the starter-home market. First-time buyers were 29% of the market in February, down from 31% a year ago.\nThere was a 3.4 month-supply of homes on the market at the end of February, based on the current sales pace, down from 3.8 months of supply at the same time last year—the 33rd straight months of year-over-year declines in inventory. Economists consider six months’ worth of inventory indicative of a balanced market between buyers and sellers.\n“We’re in a generational low and it’s going to take us years to crawl out of it,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union.\nNews Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.\nBuilders are struggling to ramp up construction to meet demand and alleviate the supply shortage. Total U.S. housing starts, which includes single-family homes and apartments, declined 7% in February , the Commerce Department said last week. Single-family starts crept up 2.9%, though they remain well below normal levels.\nEconomists said the lack of supply, along with new headwinds to demand from the tax bill and mortgage rates, could lead to a weak spring selling season, with sales expected to remain essentially flat from last year. That could offer some good news for buyers, who may have a little more wiggle room to negotiate.\nWrite to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com and Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com",
