    "text": "BOSTON, March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Advanced Cyber Security Center (ACSC) today announced that Joel Schwartz has joined its Board of Directors. A long-time Senior Vice President and most recently, manager of Global New Business Development with Dell EMC, Schwartz brings his experience and perspective as a high-level executive at one of New England’s largest corporations to the ACSC Board.\nThe ACSC is a collaborative bringing together organizations to solve common cyber security problems across Massachusetts and New England.\n“Cyber security is one of the greatest challenges facing businesses and organizations across New England,” said Schwartz, board member, Advanced Cyber Security Center. “I am looking forward to working with other members of the ACSC Board of Directors to help develop policies and programs that will help our membership deploy the best possible defenses.”\nEighteen months ago, Schwartz co-led a cyber-security mission to Israel, sponsored by Combined Jewish Philanthropies, with representatives from Massachusetts government, academic, commercial companies and cyber-security firms in attendance.\nSince retiring from Dell EMC in 2016, Schwartz has worked as a new business consultant helping start-ups and VCs on business strategy, scaling, international growth, financing, recruiting, governance and organizational development. He is also a course developer and guest lecturer on Israeli entrepreneurship at both Brandeis University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). Dell Technologies (formerly Dell EMC), Brandeis and WPI are all member organizations of the ACSC.\nAs Senior Vice President and General Manager global new business development at Dell EMC, Schwartz was responsible for the overall strategic direction of EMC’s global new business activities. This included initiating EMC’s R&D efforts in Brazil, Russia, India, China, Singapore, Kazakhstan, Colombia and Mexico, as well as led numerous investments/acquisitions in Israeli companies and joint ventures in China. Prior to this role, Joel headed EMC’s Clariion Division, growing its revenues from $500M to $2B in five years.\nIn addition to the ACSC Board of Directors, Schwartz also sits on the board of directors for the Finca Vigia Foundation helping Cuba restore Hemingway’s estate there, the Overseers of the Brandeis International Business School, the Board of Advisors at WPI’s Foise Business School, The International Visiting Committee of Case Western Reserve, Board of Advisors to Mass Challenge Israel and the Board of Advisors of Israel and Co. He also is a board member and advisor to several healthcare IT startups.\nJoel holds a BSEE and MSEE from Case Western Reserve University and also attended the Executive Management Program at Stanford University.\n“Having worked closely with Joel when he was a senior executive at EMC, I know how deeply he cares about both cyber security and the value of university partnerships, a central focus of our organization,” said William Guenther, Chairman of the ACSC. “I am very pleased we will have his counsel on the board.”\n“Joel Schwartz is a recognized cyber security leader in the New England business community who brings a unique executive perspective to the Advanced Cyber Security Center Board of Directors,” said Michael Figueroa, Executive Director of the ACSC. “His business acumen and technical expertise make him a double asset to our team and I look forward to working with him as we continue to evolve our programming to establish a new baseline for cyber security.”\nAbout the Advanced Cyber Security Center\nThe Advanced Cyber Security Center (ACSC) is a non-profit and cross-sector regional collaborative that is focused on building a stronger community defense by harnessing the collective resources of its members to solve common cyber security problems. As a leading federally-registered regional Information Sharing and Analysis Organization (ISAO), the ACSC serves as a security community hub that encourages cross-sector collaboration, taps advanced technology solutions, and promotes effective practices to help organizations strengthen their own cyber defense. At the same time, the ACSC deepens the capacity of the broader cyber community by enabling organizations to collectively address common problems, reduce duplicative effort, and establish a new baseline for security across Massachusetts and the New England regional community.\nMedia Contact:\nJoan Geoghegan\nCavalier Communications,\njoan@cavalier-communications.com , 978-371-3921\nSource:Advanced Cyber Security Center(ACSC)",
