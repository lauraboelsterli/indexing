REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Highlights\nIt started as a bill to help manufacturers – now companies that shuttered U.S. factories are poised to benefit.

The Russian president's \"hybrid warfare” strategy mixing nuclear posturing and cutting-edge technology with covert action was deliberately designed \"to find ways to weaken and undermine the United States and its allies without sparking all-out war.\" However, \"it’s a dynamic that brings with it some very real dangers, not least of accidental conflict.\"\nWorld\n5-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio waves as he leaves after casting his vote at a polling station in Pomigliano d'Arco, Italy March 4, 2018.

The audience is Caterpillar’s local network of dealers , who inspect the machines for the latest technological innovations to help make their sales pitches to buyers in China.\nChina may allow its offshore-listed tech giants to sell a form of shares on the mainland, people with knowledge of the plan said, in a move that would pit Shanghai and Shenzhen against Hong Kong in the battle to host the country’s tech giants .\nA U.S. national security panel ordered Qualcomm to put off its March 6 annual shareholder meeting , delaying a long awaited showdown in the company’s attempt to see off a takeover bid by Broadcom.\nTop stories on Reuters TV\nSaudi crown prince signs $10bn deal on mega-city\nXi Jinping's power looms over China's parliament\n ",
