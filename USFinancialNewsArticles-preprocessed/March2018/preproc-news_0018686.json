    "text": "CJ McCollum led the way as the Portland Trail Blazers earned their sixth straight victory Saturday night, downing the Oklahoma City Thunder 108-100 at Moda Center.\nMcCollum finished with 28 points, eight rebounds and six assists as the Trail Blazers won for the 13th time in 14 games at home. Damian Lillard added 20 points despite a 5-for-18 shooting game for Portland.\nRussell Westbrook totaled 30 points, 11 rebounds and six assists and Paul George added 21 points for Oklahoma City, which lost for the eighth straight time at Moda Center. Westbrook also struggled with his shooting, making just 12 of 31 shots for the game.\nThe Thunder were going without starting small forward Carmelo Anthony, who sat out the game to rest.\nMcCollum scored 13 points and Lillard 11 as Portland took a 53-50 lead into intermission. Westbrook had 14 points and George 11 for the Thunder.\nThe Blazers scored seven straight points to go on top 73-67 midway through the third quarter. Portland carried an 83-75 edge into the final period.\nZach Collins’ 3-pointer gave the Blazers a 92-81 advantage with 8:58 to play. The Thunder closed to within 95-90 on a three-point play by Westbrook with 4:22 remaining. Westbrook’s jumper made it 95-92 with 3:59 to play.\nMcCollum followed with back-to-back baskets to push Portland in front 99-92. OKC’s Steven Adams sank 1 of 2 at the line to make it 99-93, but Collins knocked down another 3 for a 102-93 lead with 2:22 left.\nA Westbrook 3-pointer got OKC within 102-96, and Jerami Grant followed with a driving layup to trim the difference to 102-98 with 1:39 to play. Lillard hit two free throws for a 104-98 lead with 44.7 seconds remaining.\nOklahoma City jumped to an 18-12 lead. The Thunder settled for a 28-25 advantage after one quarter.\nPortland used a 17-2 run to go ahead 44-35 midway through the second quarter. The Thunder closed the quarter with an 8-2 run to draw to within three points at the half.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
