    "text": "10 COMMENTS Meredith Corp. said it intends to lay off 1,000 staffers at Time Inc. over the next 10 months in addition to 200 positions it cut this week, part of a push to reduce expenses following its acquisition of the storied magazine publisher in January.\nThe moves are part of an integration process that Meredith expects will yield $400 million to $500 million in cost savings over the next two years.\nSeparately, Meredith said it is exploring the possible sale of Time Inc. titles including the flagship Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money.\nA person close to the situation said most of the inbound interest in each of the four titles hasn’t been from strategic buyers but rather from wealthy individuals interested in the subject area. Now that bankers have been hired and a sales process is under way, it is possible that more strategic buyers could express interest, this person said.\nThis person added that “there has been strong interest in these titles from recognizable names in the sports world, the tech world and the business world.”\nThose affected by this week’s layoffs are primarily corporate employees in New York in areas such as legal, finance and consumer marketing, according to the company.\nMeredith, which publishes magazines such as Better Homes & Gardens and Shape, has previously said it would lay off an estimated 600 staffers at a fulfillment center in Tampa that is in the process of being closed, bringing the total number of Time Inc. employees who will eventually lose their jobs to at least 1,800.\nMeredith officially closed its acquisition of Time Inc. on Jan. 31 of this year.\n“We said we’d try to move as quickly as we could,” said Tom Harty, chief executive, in an interview. Mr. Harty said some staffers will be offered an opportunity to relocate to Des Moines, Iowa, where the company is based, but that he anticipates the numbers will be relatively low.\nTime Inc. employed about 7,450 people at the end of 2016, with 4,950 based in the U.S. and about 1,500 based in the U.K, according to a regulatory filing. Meredith earlier this month completed the sale of Time Inc. UK to a private-equity firm.\nMr. Harty said Meredith has now completed a reorganization of its ad-sales operations and the details will be released on March 28.\nHe said discussions toward a sale of select Time Inc. titles is going well and he hopes to sell all four publications within 60 to 120 days. “We’ve gotten good inbound interest for those titles, which gave us enough confidence to enter into a formal sales process,” said Mr. Harty.\nAt a meeting Mr. Harty attended Wednesday with TIME employees, he was asked whether TIME would be sold to David Pecker, CEO of National Enquirer publisher American Media Inc., or the Koch brothers, according to one attendee. Mr. Harty, who confirmed the meeting, said the publication wouldn’t be sold to Mr. Pecker and that the Kochs had not expressed any interest.\nIn a statement, American Media said it “no longer has any interest” in acquiring any former Time Inc. brands being offered for sale by Meredith.”\nKoch Equity Development, a private-equity unit of Koch Industries Inc., invested $650 million as part of Meredith’s $1.85 billion purchase of Time Inc. A spokesman for Koch Industries didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n—Stephanie Yang contributed to this article.\nWrite to Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg at jeffrey.trachtenberg@wsj.com",
