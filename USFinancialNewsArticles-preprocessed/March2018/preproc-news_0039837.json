Forward-looking statements tend to include words such as “will”, “may”, “could”, “expects”, “plans”, “estimates”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “targets”, “forecasts”, “schedules”, “goals”, “budgets”, or similar terminology. Forward-looking statements herein include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the Casino Project being Canada’s premier copper-gold mine, Casino’s potential costs and production, and future market interest in the Company.
