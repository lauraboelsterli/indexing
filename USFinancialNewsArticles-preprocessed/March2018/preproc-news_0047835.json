    "text": "The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, rebounding from a five-week low hit earlier in the session, as trade tensions receded and the greenback found support from month-end flows.\nThe dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.39 percent at 89.38, after slipping to a five-week low of 88.942.\n\"Overall the dollar is seeing a bit of a rebound. A lot of that is due to monthend flows that tend to be supportive of the dollar,\" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho in New York.\n\"Investors like to square out their positions that they take during the month by repatriating some of those back into dollar,\" she said.\nConcerns regarding a trade war appear to have abated a little overnight and that too was helping the greenback, Harajli said.\nGlobal markets were shaken this month after U.S. President Donald Trump moved to impose tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing threatened similar measures. But fears of a trade war eased on hopes that the United States and China would begin negotiations.\nshow chapters CNBC Markets Now: March 26, 2018 23 Hours Ago | 01:16 Wall Street's main indexes rose on Tuesday, extending their sharp rally from the previous session and the yen, often viewed as a safe-haven currency in times of market turbulence and economic uncertainty, slipped against the greenback.\nAfter a big gain on Monday, the euro had added another 0.3 percent to hit $1.2476 in after, less than a cent off the three-year highs it hit in mid-February, helped by receding worries about a trade war.\nBut the common currency slipped 0.35 percent against the greenback after data showing that lending to euro zone companies slowed last month, and comments by European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen that underlying euro zone inflation may remain lower than expected even if growth is robust.\n\"Should markets anticipate a reduction in the synchronicity of global growth, it would also support near-term USD strength,\" Hans Redeker, global head of currency strategy at Morgan Stanley, said in a note.\nSterling fell against the dollar, the Swiss franc and the euro as expectations of selling pressure from a large corporate healthcare deal prompted investors to take profits after a recent rally.\nQuarterly flows as global asset and fund managers rebalance their portfolios, a move that can distort markets, could have also played a role in the pound's decline, strategist said.\nThe British pound was down 0.51 percent to 1.4153 against the dollar.",
