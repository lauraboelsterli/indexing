    "text": "By Emily Price 11:41 AM EDT \nBlack Panther has already beaten box office records , and now the film has scored another accolade: the most tweeted-about movie of all time. \nThe film was tweeted about more than 35 million times, according to Twitter , allowing it to overtake both Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi , which currently hold the number two and three spots, respectively. \nThe most retweeted Black Panther tweet was originally tweeted in January by musician Kendrick Lamar, who shared the track list for the film’s soundtrack. His tweet has been retweeted more than 240,000 times.

We tried getting the two for one special at black panther. The manager was not having it. pic.twitter.com/Ktqsuh7s3m \n— Pillsbury (@stevelikescups) February 16, 2018 \nPopular hashtags for tweets about the film include #BlackPanther, #WakandaForever, and #Wakanda. \nBlack Panther has remained at the top of box office lists since its opening weekend five weeks ago . The movie has currently made more than $1.1 billion worldwide and holds a 97% review score on Rotten Tomatoes, making it one of the highest-rated comic book movies of all time.
