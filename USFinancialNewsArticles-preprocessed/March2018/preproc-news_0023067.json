    "text": "LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - British satellite company Inmarsat said it would lower its dividend in 2018 and beyond to fund an investment drive in its aviation division, after core earnings fell in the fourth quarter.\nInmarsat said the board has taken a decision to reduce the annual dividend to 20 cents per share and keep it there until cash flow improves.\nThe group will pay a total dividend of 33.62 cents per share for 2017.​ (Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Paul Sandle)\n ",
