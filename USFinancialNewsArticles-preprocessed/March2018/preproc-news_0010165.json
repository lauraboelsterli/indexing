    "text": "LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May and government departments are being kept informed about developments in Salisbury, her spokesman said on Tuesday after two people were hospitalised following suspected exposure to an unknown substance.\n“All relevant departments including Number 10 (May’s official residence) are being kept informed of developments as you’d expect. This is an ongoing investigation which is being led by the police,” he told reporters.\nAsked how May would describe Britain’s relationship with Russia, he said the prime minister had been clear on her views on Russia.
