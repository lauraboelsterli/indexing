    "text": "SAN ANTONIO, - The board of directors of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. announced that Jarvis V. Hollingsworth, a partner in the Bracewell LLP law firm, has been nominated for election to the board by Cullen/Frost shareholders at the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders on April 25, 2018.\n\"We're looking forward to having Jarvis join the board,\" said Phil Green, Cullen/Frost Chairman and CEO. \"His background in public policy and corporate governance, as well as his knowledge of Houston and our Texas markets, will lend insight into many of our activities. Beyond that, Jarvis is well-known and highly respected, and is a great match with our company's culture because he shares our commitment to top quality service, high ethical standards, and safe, sound assets.\"\nHollingsworth leads Bracewell's public/education law practice group and is a former member of the firm's six-member management committee. He serves on the firm's finance, diversity and inclusion, and political action committees. His practice involves counseling boards of government and educational entities on their fiduciary roles, corporate governance and director liability, as well as regulatory and finance matters. Hollingsworth is a former regent on the board of the University of Houston System, where he served as chairman of the board as well as chairman of the finance, endowment, executive and compensation committees during his tenure. Texas Governor Greg Abbott recently reappointed Hollingsworth as chairman of the board of trustees of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, a state agency that manages a nearly $147 billion pension trust fund and an array of health care and other benefits for the more than 1.5 million active and retired teachers and education employees in Texas. Hollingsworth previously served as a trustee and chairman of the TRS board from 2002-08. Prior to his career as a lawyer, Hollingsworth served as an officer in the U.S. Army and Army Reserve. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a Juris Doctorate from the University of Houston.\nCullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
