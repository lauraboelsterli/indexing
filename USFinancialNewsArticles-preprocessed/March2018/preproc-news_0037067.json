    "text": "VANCOUVER, March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Choom™ (CSE: CHOO; OTCQB: CHOOF) (the \"Company\" or \"Choom\") is pleased to announce that the Company has entered into a definitive amalgamation agreement, effective March 16, 2018 (the \"Definitive Agreement\"), among itself, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Arbutus Brands Inc. (\"Arbutus Brands\"), and International Tungsten Inc. (\"ITI\"). Pursuant to the Definitive Agreement: (i) Arbutus Brands will amalgamate with ITI, with the amalgamated company remaining a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company operating under the name of Arbutus Brands, and (ii) all of the issued and outstanding securities of ITI will be exchanged for securities of Choom (the \"Transaction\"). ITI has entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Specialty Medijuana Products Inc. (\"SMP\"), an applicant under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (the \"ACMPR\"), that has submitted its Affirmation of Readiness (\"AOR\") evidence package to Health Canada and expects to receive a cultivation license from Health Canada within the next several weeks.\nTransaction Highlights\nThe expected benefits of the Transaction for Choom™ include that it will:\nenable Choom™ to acquire a company in British Columbia that has submitted its AOR evidence package to Health Canada and expects to receive its cultivation license in the next few weeks;\ncreate significant synergies in operational infrastructure and expertise across multiple disciplines to drive strong growth potential;\nsignificantly improve and advance operational scale and production capacity; and\nstrengthen and accelerate Choom's strategic direction as a fully-integrated cannabis company, representing a premiere lifestyle brand in Canada.\nSpecialty Medijuana Products Inc.\nSMP, based in Canada's beautiful Sooke, B.C., is committed to becoming a Licensed Producer of cannabis under the ACMPR. SMP was founded by a seasoned business team with extensive experience in growing cannabis, the operation of pharmacies, medical clinics, land development and construction. The SMP team, in conjunction with Choom's™ management team, plan to build upon their collective past business successes and leverage their expertise to create Canada's premiere lifestyle brand in adult-use cannabis.\nFacility Overview\nSMP's marijuana production growth strategy is expected to be executed in three phases:\nPhase I - First Facilities: AOR evidence package submitted to Health Canada: Buildings are at operational readiness with state-of-the-art-facilities, consistent with ACMPR standards, and SMP expects to receive its cultivation license from Health Canada within the next several weeks. A sales license is expected to be granted by Health Canada in the third quarter of 2018.\nPhase II - Second Facility: Expand existing production by constructing an approximately 19,600 sq. ft. facility that will bring total production capacity to over 29,000 sq. ft. in the combined facility footprint.\nPhase III - New Facility : Expand existing production by constructing two additional buildings that will increase the total building gross square footage to just over 700,000 sq. ft. This new facility, a hybrid model of indoor and greenhouse production, is expected to bring Choom's total production capacity to over 750,000 sq. ft. The Municipality of Sooke has already approved cannabis production zoning for the site. The building expansion fits within the zoning regulations and final planning for this expansion is currently underway.\nThe SMP Team\nSMP's team has the experience to ensure that they successfully navigate the ACMPR licensing process and deliver on their vision. The SMP team includes:\nMichael Forbes\nNamed one of 2017's Top Entrepreneurs by Quantum Shift, Michael has a long history of creating and operating successful companies in the pharmaceutical and health care industries. Over the course of 14 years in business, he has created and operated a chain of nine pharmacies and eight medical clinics, including three methadone clinics, employing over 160 people.\nThis expertise led to him being nominated to help create the procedures for the College of Pharmacists of British Columbia in 2010. His expertise in creating standard operating procedures in the pharmaceutical space is vital in ensuring proper drug dispensing to the public. This experience is crucial in creating trust with the consumer and the industry at large. He holds an Honorary Degree in Business from the Ivey School of Business and a Bachelor of Science, Pharmacy. Mr. Forbes will be joining the Choom™ Board of Directors upon the completion of the Transaction.\nIan Laing\nIan has over 20 years of experience in real estate, development and construction in a range of areas, including apartment buildings, custom home construction, land development, rezoning, condominiums, commercial and industrial buildings.\nSince 1998, Ian has consistently proven his ability to build and grow multi-million dollar projects from the ground up. He has a background in Urban Land Economics from the University of British Columbia and a commitment to building with integrity. Ian is currently running four companies, and has experience in the recreational space with Salt Spring Island Brewery. This experience is expected to benefit the development of SMP's business practices and the anticipated build out and scaling of facilities. SMP will rely on this expertise as it grows its facilities and expands operations.\nNeil Michael MacLean\nNeil MacLean has over 20 years of experience with the Department of National Defence (\"DND\"), primarily dealing with electronics, and previously was an environmental officer for HMCS Huron. His safety and WHMIS training, combined with his understanding of security procedures, are expected to assist SMP with compliance with the highest level of government regulations. He has effectively managed the integration of new equipment and systems, and has extensive personnel training experience, which, together with his training in environmental issues, electronics and operations of complex systems, will support the operational side of SMP.\nTransaction Summary\nIn accordance with the terms of the Definitive Agreement, ITI will amalgamate with Arbutus Brands following which the resulting amalgamated entity will continue as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In consideration for the completion of the Transaction, the holders of ITI common shares will be issued one common share of the Company (each, a \"Common Share\") in exchange for every share of ITI held, up to a combined maximum of 92,000,000 Common Shares. Existing convertible securities of ITI will be exchanged for convertible securities of the Company on substantially the same terms, and applying the same exchange ratio. In connection with the closing of the Transaction, Choom will pay finder's fees of 4,000,000 Common Shares to eligible parties.\nIn connection with the Transaction, Choom has completed an offering of subscription receipts, at a price of $0.60 per subscription receipt, for aggregate gross proceeds of $7.0 million (the \"Offering\").
