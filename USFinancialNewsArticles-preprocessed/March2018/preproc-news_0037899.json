    "text": "MADISON, Wis., March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Exact Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: EXAS), the company that developed and commercialized Cologuard®, the only FDA-approved, noninvasive stool DNA-based test for early detection of colorectal cancer, today announced that Mark Stenhouse has been appointed to the new role of president, Cologuard. Stenhouse, vice president, U.S. Immunology at AbbVie, will assume this new position on April 2, 2018.\n\"More than 85 million people are eligible to be screened with Cologuard, and Mark brings the experience and passion to help us reach further into this enormous population,\" said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. \"Mark's track record launching and guiding a product to blockbuster status, and his experience within the field of gastrointestinal diseases, makes him the ideal leader to amplify our early success after launching Cologuard.\"\nAt Abbott Laboratories/AbbVie, Stenhouse leads the sales and marketing teams for one of the most successful pharmaceutical products, the anti-inflammatory drug HUMIRA®. The top-selling drug in the United States for the fifth straight year, it generated $18.4 billion in worldwide net revenue and accounted for 65 percent of AbbVie's total net revenue in 2017.\n\"The story of Exact Sciences and the science powering Cologuard are incredibly compelling, which is why I'm enthusiastic about accepting this opportunity,\" Stenhouse said. \"There's nothing more important to me than leading a team of smart people who engage collaboratively and lean in to their mission. I view this as an opportunity to take a highly innovative screening test that fills an unmet healthcare need, and which has already undergone the most successful launch of any diagnostic product in history, to the next level. Exact Sciences truly captures it all – the highest quality science, committed people, and the value its products offer.\"\nStenhouse spent nearly 30 years at Abbott Laboratories/AbbVie, where he was first hired for a field sales position. He steadily worked his way through product management and sales management to become national sales director in the U.S. Immunology-Gastroenterology franchise. From there, he rose to marketing director, followed by senior director of commercial initiatives. In 2010, Stenhouse was appointed a general manager within the company before being promoted to vice president. He earned a Bachelor of Science in business administration from College of Charleston.\nAbout Cologuard\nCologuard was approved by the FDA in August 2014 and results from Exact Sciences' prospective 90-site, point-in-time, 10,000-patient pivotal trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2014. Cologuard is included in the American Cancer Society's (2014) colorectal cancer screening guidelines and the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Cologuard is indicated to screen adults of either sex, 50 years or older, who are at average risk for colorectal cancer. Cologuard is not for everyone and is not a replacement for diagnostic colonoscopy or surveillance colonoscopy in high-risk individuals. False positives and false negatives do occur. Any positive test result should be followed by a diagnostic colonoscopy. Following a negative result, patients should continue participating in a screening program at an interval and with a method appropriate for the individual patient. Cologuard performance when used for repeat testing has not been evaluated or established. For more information about Cologuard, visit www.cologuardtest.com . Rx Only.\nAbout Exact Sciences Corp.\nExact Sciences Corp. is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of the deadliest forms of cancer. The company has exclusive intellectual property protecting its non-invasive, molecular screening technology for the detection of colorectal cancer.
