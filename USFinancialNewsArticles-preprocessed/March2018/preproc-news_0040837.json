    "text": "CHICAGO, March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cars.com Inc. (NYSE: CARS) (\"Cars.com\" or the \"Company\"), a leading online automotive marketplace, today announced that its Board of Directors (the \"Board\") has authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company's common stock. The Company intends to fund the share repurchase program with cash from operations.\nAlex Vetter, Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Over the past several months, we have successfully negotiated the conversion of nearly 60% of our wholesale revenue into our direct sales channel, closed on the acquisition of Dealer Inspire and Launch Digital Marketing, and made strategic investments in technology and product innovation. With these transactions and investments completed, the Board has now considered our strong free cash flow and the funding required to execute the Cars.com business plan, and we are pleased to execute this next step in our capital allocation strategy to further enhance shareholder returns.\"\nThe Company may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws and subject to the Company's blackout periods. The timing and amounts of any purchases under the share repurchase program will be based on market conditions and other factors including price. The repurchase program has a two-year duration, does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nVetter continued, \"Since our inception as a public company nine months ago, the Board has regularly reviewed the Company's capital allocation strategy to ensure it is directed to the areas where we believe we can drive the greatest value for our shareholders. Following today's announcement, our board will continue to evaluate our capital allocation policies in ordinary course.\"\nAbout Cars.com\nCars.com™ is a leading two-sided digital automotive marketplace that creates meaningful connections between buyers and sellers.
