The company said earnings before interest, tax and amortization fell to $598 million, from $673 million a year earlier, on a pro forma basis, as its core oil and gas business remained challenging. Revenue fell 12 percent to $9.9 billion on a pro forma basis. Reporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier",
