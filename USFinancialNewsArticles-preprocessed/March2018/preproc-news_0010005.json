    "text": "BUCHANAN, Va . , March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of Botetourt (OTCPK: BORT) announced today its consolidated financial results and performance for fiscal period ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2017, Bank of Botetourt reported net income of $2.28 million, compared to $2.25 million for the same time period in 2016, an increase of 1.3% and surpassing budget expectations by 1.6%. Earnings for the year resulted in a return on average assets of 0.6% and a return on average equity of 6.6%, compared to prior year ratios of 0.7% and 6.8%, respectively. Both basic and diluted earnings per share increased $0.02 per share from $1.58 in 2016 to $1.60 in 2017. Book value of the Bank's stock increased $0.84 per share from $23.66 at December 31, 2016 to $24.50 at December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the continued positive financial performance, the quarterly dividend increased 7.1% from $0.14 per share to $0.15 per share in February 2018. CEO G. Lyn Hayth, III stated \"Providing a return on investment to shareholders is one of our top priorities. The vote by our Board to again increase the dividend solidifies our commitment to this goal.\"\nAt December 31, 2017, total assets amounted to $387,736,000, an increase of 12.0% from the same time period of 2016 of $346,335,000. Total deposits for the year-end 2017 amounted to $341,000,000, compared to $309,863,000 for the prior year, an increase of 10.0%. Net loans grew 16.7% to $337,665,000 in 2017 from $289,416,000 in 2016.\nBank of Botetourt remains well-capitalized as we report consolidated total capital to risk-weighted assets at 11.9%, consolidated tier 1 to risk-weighted assets and consolidated tier one common equity capital of 10.9%, respectively, and tier 1 leverage capital to average assets of 9.4% at year-end 2017.\nShareholders continue to take advantage of the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.
