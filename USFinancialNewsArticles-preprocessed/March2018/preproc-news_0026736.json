Hearst Health includes the market-leading healthcare companies FDB, Zynx Health, MCG Health, Homecare Homebase and MedHOK, as well as Hearst Health Ventures and the Hearst Health Innovation Lab. Each year in the U.S., care guidance from Hearst Health reaches 85 percent of discharged patients, 205 million insured individuals, 70 million home health visits and 3.2 billion dispensed prescriptions.\nSwartz commented: “Hearst has assembled a unique set of companies that address a great need to support decision making across the healthcare spectrum. Chuck will play a vital role in extending our influence and reach, and I am delighted he will join Greg’s senior leadership team.”\n“I have worked closely with Chuck for many years, and he is an exceptionally talented leader and innovator with an outstanding record of success operating businesses,” Dorn said. “Chuck will help me shape Hearst Health’s strategy to ensure our group’s continued growth and positive impact on healthcare.”\nIn 2014, Tuchinda was named president of FDB, the leading provider of drug and medical device knowledge. Under his leadership, the company expanded into adjacent markets and delivered double-digit growth. He first joined Hearst in 2010 as the chief innovation officer for healthcare, after holding a variety of executive roles at Eclipsys (now Allscripts), including vice president of business development and product strategy, vice president of acute care solutions and vice president of content solutions.\n“I am excited to work with Greg and my talented colleagues across Hearst Health to advance our important mission,” Tuchinda said. “The care guidance we provide has proven to be essential for improving healthcare, and there is still much work to be done.”\nA board certified internal medicine physician, Tuchinda completed both his medical doctorate and residency training at Johns Hopkins. He received a master’s degree in business administration from Harvard Business School and a biomedical engineering degree from Harvard College.\nAbout Hearst\nHearst is one of the nation's largest diversified media, information and services companies with more than 360 businesses.
