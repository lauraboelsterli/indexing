It was a charitable trust pick and I suggest that you do not hold onto the stock either way. There are a lot better ways to be in the oil patch.\"\nTellurian Inc. : \"They're getting involved in buying more properties. My problem with Tellurian is it is pure spec. As long as you know it's pure spec â€¦ then I think you're fine. But it's speculative.\"\nAtara Biotherapeutics Inc. : \"They may have something for [multiple sclerosis], which is therefore fabulous, but I never like to give people false hope. That's all I can say.\"\nAmarin Corporation PLC : \"I used to like this stock. It is a real speculative stock. I mean, I'm talking about a real speculative stock. As long as you're willing to recognize that you can lose what you invested in that one, I'm OK with it.\"\nTwilio Inc. : \"This is a very controversial story because they screwed up a couple of quarters and then they've come back. This is [CEO] Jeff Lawson. I think he's a terrific guy. They lost a customer, they had a customer come back and now their business is booming. So what can I say? I think it's a good situation but they were volatile. But it's good now.\"\nDynavax Technologies : \"Oh, man. We nailed that when it was much lower. I don't think that I can commit to it all the way up here, but we did get that.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: I screwed up on Apache and won't stop you from selling 21 Hours Ago | 04:30 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apache.\n ",
