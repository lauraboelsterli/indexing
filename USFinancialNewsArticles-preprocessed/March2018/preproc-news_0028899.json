    "text": "STG Expands First and Final Mile Delivery Services Nationwide\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- St. George Logistics (“STG”), North America’s leading provider of specialty 3PL and transportation services critical to the global supply chain, has expanded its position in first and final mile delivery services through the acquisition of Freight Force. Freight Force management, led by Chris Coppersmith, will continue with the business and will join STG as shareholders and senior members of its operations management team.\nHeadquartered in Anaheim, CA, Freight Force operates the nation’s largest network of independent carriers serving freight forwarders and other third party logistics providers. Freight Force specializes in first mile and last mile transportation services, facilitating the original pickup or the final delivery of international freight. Freight Force maintains partnerships with local and regional motor carriers in 52 metro areas and serves as a one-stop source for access to reliable, high quality, and specialized capacity across the entire United States. Founded in 1982, Freight Force serves more than 2,200 freight forwarders and other 3PL providers and executes approximately half a million first and last mile deliveries annually.\n“Fueled by e-commerce and increased specialization among freight forwarders, the first and final mile segments are among the highest growth but most challenging components of the global supply chain,” said Chris Jamroz, Executive Chairman of STG. “Freight Force immediately enables STG to offer a compelling first and final mile solution to our diverse base of customers and will help them compete in one of the fastest growing sectors of the logistics industry. Freight Force is the perfect complement to our existing suite of national value added warehousing, fulfillment, distribution and transportation services.”\n“I am excited to welcome Chris Coppersmith and the Freight Force team to the STG family,” said Hessel Verhage, STG’s President and CEO. “The expansion of our first and final mile services has been a critical strategic initiative for STG as we are eager to respond to the surge in demand for our domestic transportation management services. We can now offer specialized equipment, TSA certified carriers, compliance with tight timelines for air and ocean delivery cutoffs, and ample storage space nationwide in support of our clients’ first and final mile needs.”\nKonrad Salaber, Managing Director at Wind Point Partners, added, “We are very excited to continue our support of STG’s robust acquisition program. Consistent with our original investment thesis, Chris, Hessel and the STG team are building a truly unique enterprise that stands as a leader in the global supply chain. Freight Force is the sixth add-on we have acquired since forming the platform in July 2016 and we expect that acquisitions will continue to complement STG’s strong organic growth as a driver of future value creation.”\nWind Point is an active investor in transportation, logistics and route-based businesses with previous investments including Dicom Transportation Group, Valicor Environmental, RailWorks Corporation and AIR-Serv Group.\nAbout St. George Logistics\nSTG (St. George Logistics) is a leading asset-light provider of complex and highly customized logistics and transportation services focused on the global supply chain.
