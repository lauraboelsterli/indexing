    "text": "March 21, 2018 / 1:14 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Germany's Merkel rejects nationwide driving bans for diesel cars Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday the federal government rejects the idea of introducing comprehensive driving bans for diesel vehicles, calling instead for tailored solutions to bring down car emissions in heavily polluted cities. Protests against Germany's \"Dieselgate\" in front of Germany's Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure where ministers and car executives hold a meeting to agree ways to cut inner-city pollution to try to stave off bans on diesel cars and restore the tarnished reputation of the country's auto industry in Berlin, Germany, August 2, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke “We’re against nationwide driving bans,” Merkel told lawmakers in the Bundestag lower house of parliament, adding that German carmakers had to make up for the mistakes they had made in the past.
