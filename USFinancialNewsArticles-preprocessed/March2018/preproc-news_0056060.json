    "text": "MILAN, March 30 (Reuters) - Italy’s private broadcaster Mediaset said on Friday it reached a deal with Sky’s Italy unit to broadcast part of its pay-TV channels on the group’s satellite platform.\nThe agreement will also allow Sky Italia to use Mediaset’s Premium pay-TV digital platform for its own offering of services, a statement said.\nMediaset added that the accord gave the Milan-based TV group, controlled by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, to hand over to Sky Italia the control of a new company to which the assets of its pay-TV Premium would be transferred.
