    "text": "12 COMMENTS I am sure it is true, as Oren Cass indicates, that advanced countries will adapt to climate change (“ Doomsday Climate Scenarios Are a Joke ,” op-ed, March 12). They can move cities inland, build massive sea walls, air-condition everybody and grow crops in climate-controlled shelters. That may well be where the 20% of GDP goes. The poorer countries of the world won’t have these options. Their only hope will be to migrate to the advanced countries—an emigrant crises much greater than anything we see now.\nDavid B. Wood\nLincoln, Calif.\nMr. Cass ignores the social and economic costs of adaptation. Yes, the mortality rate associated with extreme heat in cities is being reduced by increased use of air conditioning, but that increased use itself helps drive climate change, as it requires electric power largely derived from fossil fuels.\nRiley Newman\nIrvine, Calif.\nIf a person moved from Boston, Mass., to Miami, Fla., he or she would experience a 26-degree Fahrenheit change in the average temperature in a matter of days. There would certainly be some serious adjusting but I doubt that he or she would shrivel up and die. If the global temperature were to rise three, four or five degrees in the next 50 to 75 years, I don’t think anyone would even notice except the doomsday crowd.\nPaul C. Quigg\nLuray, Va.",
