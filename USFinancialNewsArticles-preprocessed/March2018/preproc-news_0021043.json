    "text": "ROME, March 5 (Reuters) - Italian centre-right leader Silvio Berlusconi aims to strengthen a centre-right coalition which won the most seats at a national election in Sunday in order to form a government, his party said in a statement on Monday.\nBerlusconiâ€™s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party was unexpectedly surpassed by the far-right League in the alliance, which together won about 37 percent of the vote, shy of a parliamentary majority.\nForza Italia said Berlusconi had met League leader Matteo Salvini on Monday and congratulated him.\nReporting by Francesca Piscioneri, writing by Isla Binnie\n ",
