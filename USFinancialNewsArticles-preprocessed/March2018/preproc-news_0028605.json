    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 4:06 AM / Updated an hour ago Exclusive - Shell close to clinching Hong Kong's first LNG import deal: sources Jessica Jaganathan 2 Min Read SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) is close to bagging a deal to supply Hong Kong with liquefied natural gas (LNG), beating out major competitors for the right to be the first company to supply LNG to the city. A logo for Shell is seen on a garage forecourt in central London March 6, 2014. REUTERS/Neil Hall Shell has edged out companies such as Malaysia’s Petronas to supply LNG through a long-term contract to Hong Kong utility CLP Power, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Related Coverage Shell, GT Bank agree $270 million oil-backed loan to Nigeria's Amni Hong Kong is undertaking a massive shift to using more natural gas to fuel its electric power generation from coal, potentially creating a steady and lucrative demand source in the Asian LNG market. Under the deal, Shell will supply about 1.2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG for about 10 years starting after 2020, the sources said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media. However, the supply agreement will be subject to a final investment decision (FID) for an offshore LNG import terminal that will include a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), one of the sources said. It was not immediately clear if the deal was binding or a memorandum of understanding. CLP and Petronas did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Shell declined to comment on the specific deal and said it “continuously seeks opportunities to grow and improve profitability”. “This may include talking with third parties from time to time, any conversations are confidential,” a spokeswoman said. As part of its commitment to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, Hong Kong is aiming to increase the use of natural gas in its total fuel mix for power generation to about 50 percent by 2020 from 22 percent as of 2012. Hong Kong currently produces power using imported fuel in domestic power plants or from imported natural gas from the mainland. The country’s coal-fired plants will reach the end of their useful life in the next decade. Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan; Editing by Christian Schmollinger",
