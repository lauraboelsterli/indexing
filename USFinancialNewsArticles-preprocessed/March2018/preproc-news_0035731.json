Commercial cGMP biologics manufacturing facility at Wuxi site with 30,000L disposable bioreactor capacity (MFG2) commenced operations in December 2017. U.S. FDA completed the pre-license inspection (PLI) of our current cGMP manufacturing facilities for production of Ibalizumab in August 2017, with no critical observations.\n[1] Excluding the share-based compensation expenses, Listing expenses and a foreign exchange loss due to translation loss from the IPO proceeds.\n[2] An integrated project refers to a project that requires the Company to provide services across different stages of the biologics development process.\nManagement Comments\nDr. Ge Li, Chairman of WuXi Biologics, commented : \"2017 was a landmark year for WuXi Biologics. In June, we successfully listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and have continued to prove the success of our \"follow-the-molecule\" business model in achieving phenomenal growth and profitability. We have continued to expand our number of projects, while further enhancing our client base and increasing client stickiness.\" As we look to 2018 and beyond, the outlook continues to be extremely promising. With massive growth opportunities ahead, the global biologics market has never been as robust. The imminent launch of our commercial manufacturing business will catapult us into a new growth era. In addition, we will continue to invest in our business through expansion of our state-of-the-art facilities as well as our world-class talent base. We are truly excited for our future.\n\"The strengths of our \"follow-the-molecule\" business model have enabled WuXi Biologics to firmly seize opportunities in the fast-growing global biologics market. Success of this strategy is reflected in our results,\" said Dr. Chris Chen, CEO of WuXi Biologics. As the pipeline continues to move along the product development cycle, our revenue and backlog will both grow substantially. In 2017, our service backlog grew by 97.5% year-on-year to US$476.0 million, and upcoming potential milestone fees surging from US$24.0 million as of December 31, 2016 to US$1,002.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\nDr. Chris Chen added: \"Our Group's number of ongoing integrated projects grew significantly year-on-year from 103 to 161. Our number of late phase (phase III) projects increased substantially to eight as of December 31, 2017 as compared to three as of December 31, 2016, a further demonstration of the Group's phenomenal capabilities to successfully execute for our client base.\"\nAs the only open-access biologics technology platform in the world, the Group is able to readily capitalize on its advantages in R&D costs, efficiency and production standards to forge strong relationships with leading global pharmaceutical companies, startups as well as medium and small biotechnology companies. In August 2017, we, together with our partner Gloria, granted the US biotechnology company Arcus Biosciences exclusive rights to the novel anti-PD-1 antibody GLS-010 in several markets outside China, resulting in potential milestone payments of up to US$816.0 million and a 10% royalty on commercial sales. In addition, we have the exclusive rights to produce GLS-010, and are the exclusive partner of Arcus for a term of three years in the development of its biologics portfolio. This significant licensing deal is another testament of the Group's best-in-class biologics R&D capabilities.\nIn August 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") completed the PLI of our cGMP facility for the production of Ibalizumab. On March 6, 2018, the approval for Ibalizumab (Trogarzo) was formally granted by the U.S. FDA, and has cemented WuXi Biologics as the Company with the first FDA-approved cGMP production facility to commercially manufacture biologics drugs in China. This marks WuXi Biologics' first major commercial manufacturing project, showcasing the Group's strength in achieving global quality standards and industry leadership in utilizing single-use technology for commercial manufacturing, laying a solid foundation for fast expansion of our CMO business that will open a new chapter for the Company.\nAs a result, we are also aggressively implementing our expansion plans. A cGMP biologics manufacturing facility with 30,000L disposable bioreactor capacity (MFG2), commenced commercial operations in December 2017. Furthermore, we are constructing 7,000L cGMP facilities at our Shanghai site (MFG3), which is expected to commence operations in April 2018. The facility will subsequently more than double our clinical manufacturing capacity. We also began construction on four new cGMP manufacturing facilities at Wuxi city this year: 10,000L commercial drug substances (\"DS\") facility (MFG4), 60,000L commercial DS facility (MFG5), commercial drug products (\"DP\") facility (DP2) and a new ADC facility (DP3). Such facility expansion will further enable us to execute our \"follow-the-molecule\" strategy for our client base, and maintain our strong growth trajectory and industry leadership.\nOur extensive industry experience and one-stop services platform continues to drive our industry leading R&D efficiency. We are able to reduce the IND enabling timeline to between 15 to 18 months, and in certain programs as short as 9 months, as compared to the industry norm of approximately 18 to 24 months. This is creating a competitive advantage for us, but also significant benefits for our customers, and most importantly, patients.\n\"Recruiting additional talents has always been a priority for WuXi Biologics, as this enables the Group to maintain its core competitive advantage in research, development and production. Our workforce had grown from 1,624 personnel at the end of 2016 to 2,543 personnel as at December 31, 2017. In January 2018, it was our great honor to appoint Dr. Chiang Syin, a former Associate Country Director of the U.S. FDA, as our Chief Quality Officer to accelerate our trajectory as a global premier provider of commercially manufactured biologics,\" Dr. Chen added.\nThese are exciting times in biologics! As a fully integrated platform company, WuXi Biologics enables all phases in the biologics development process, working with a wide and ever-expanding range of clients worldwide. We have demonstrated the successful implementation and execution of our \"follow-the-molecule\" strategy and through continued investments in laboratory and production facilities, continued expansion of business on a global basis, further additions to our world-class talent base, together with the ramp-up of our commercial manufacturing business, we see massive growth potential in the years ahead.\n2017 Annual Results\nThe Group's revenue increased by 63.7% year-on-year to RMB1,618.8 million in 2017. The major revenue growth drivers were: (i) a steady year-on-year increase in number of customers from 163 for 2016 to 202 for 2017 and strong growth in number of integrated projects; (ii) a rapid backlog growth reflected into the Group's revenue growth; (iii) more pre-IND projects successfully processing to later stages such as early-phase (phase I & II) and late-phase (phase III) in accordance with our \"follow-the-molecule\" strategy, which also increased the customer and project stickiness; (iv) effective marketing efforts made by the Group, resulting in robust market performance in the United States, China and Europe.\nGross profit increased by 69.8% year-on-year to RMB660.6 million in 2017 with gross profit margin up 150 basis points from 39.3% in 2016 to 40.8% in 2017. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to the increase in the milestone payments, coupled with higher capacity utilization and more efficient business operations.\nNet profit increased by 79.0% year-on-year to RMB252.6 million in 2017 with net profit margin up 130 basis points from 14.3% for 2016 to 15.6% in 2017. The higher net profit margin was attributable primarily to (i) a higher gross profit margin; (ii) sound spending control of administrative expenses lowered its growth rate as compared to that of the revenue; (iii) an increase in government subsidy, interest income from IPO proceeds, and gains from funds investment (recorded in other gains or losses); (vi) a decrease in Listing expenses; partially offset by (v) a net foreign exchange loss due to the Renminbi appreciation against the U.S. dollar.\nAdjusted net profit , excluding share-based compensation expenses, Listing expenses and a foreign exchange loss due to translation loss from the IPO proceeds, increased by 85.1% year-on-year to RMB408.1 million in 2017 with adjusted net profit margin up 290 basis points from 22.3% in 2016 to 25.2% in 2017.\nBasic and diluted EPS were RMB0.24 and RMB0.22, respectively in 2017, compared to RMB0.15 and RMB0.15, respectively in 2016.\nAdjusted diluted EPS increased by 52.2% year-on-year to RMB0.35 in 2017 from RMB0.23 in 2016.\nKey Financial Ratios\n(For the year ended December 31)\nKey Financial Ratio\n2017\n2016\nChange\nRevenue (In RMB million)\n1,618.8\n989.0\n63.7%\nGross profit (In RMB million)\n660.6\n389.1\n69.8%\nGross profit margin (%)\n40.8%\n39.3%\n150 bps\nNet profit (In RMB million)\n252.6\n141.1\n79.0%\nNet profit margin (%)\n15.6%\n14.3%\n130 bps\nAdjusted net profit (In RMB million)\n408.1\n220.5\n85.1%\nAdjusted net profit margin (%)\n25.2%\n22.3%\n290 bps\nAdjusted EBITDA (In RMB million)\n608.9\n372.2\n63.6%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (%)\n37.6%\n37.6%\n--\nAdjusted diluted EPS (In RMB)\n0.35\n0.23\n52.2%\nAbout WuXi Biologics\nWuXi Biologics is the only open-access biologics technology platform in the world offering end-to-end solutions to empower anyone to discover, develop and manufacture biologics from concept to commercial manufacturing.
