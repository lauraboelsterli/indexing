    "text": "3:43 PM ET Mon, 5 March 2018 | 02:57 \nIt's time to binge on shares of Netflix . \nThat's the message Oppenheimer technician Ari Wald is reading in the charts. The streaming giant hit yet another all-time high Tuesday, further establishing a breakout by the stock that has Wald looking at some key levels to watch. \n\"You can see the stock breaking through its January peak, that was right at around $287,\" he said Monday on the \"Trading Nation\" segment of CNBC's \"Power Lunch.\" \"That level should now be viewed as support. On the upside, that breakout measures to about $337.\" \nIn other words, the charts are telling Wald that Netflix could rally another 3 percent or so. \nAnd according to Phil Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, Netflix has been a big driver of the Nasdaq . \"It's done a really beneficial job for the Nasdaq,\" he said on \"Power Lunch. \"We're up 6 percent year to date, far outperforming the S&P 500 and the Dow which are floating right at around unchanged.\" \nNetflix has soared 69 percent year to date.",
