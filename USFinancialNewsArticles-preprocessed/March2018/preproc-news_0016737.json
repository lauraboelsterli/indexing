    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Myomo, Inc. (NYSE American: MYO) (“Myomo” or the “Company”), a commercial stage medical robotics company, today reports its financial results and year end December 31, 2017.\nRecent Highlights and Accomplishments:\nTotal revenue 2017 increased 22% year-over-year to $547,000, from $448,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, total revenue increased 41% to $1,559,000. Gross margin for the full year 2017 and 2016 was 68% and 74%, respectively. Raised $10.4 million, net of financing costs, in our follow-on public offering. During the fourth quarter, we repaid our Notes Payable with the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center and also issued 193,509 shares of common stock to repay the Notes Payable with a former shareholder. We obtained a Medical Device License in Canada, which enables us to sell the MyoPro in Canada. Expanded sales and marketing team and increased marketing activity to promote MyoPro accessibility to more individuals in the U.S. and internationally. This includes joint patient screening events with clinical and rehabilitation partners. Continued the roll out of MyoPro Centers of Excellence at O&P practice organizations. We currently have 36 U.S. locations offering the MyoPro line of powered orthosis. Announced publication of peer-reviewed clinical research conducted by the Ohio State University School of Medicine. The study concluded that upper extremity impairment is significantly reduced and subjects improved their ability to perform activities of daily living with use of the MyoPro. These results exceeded the clinically important difference threshold of standard impairment tests. Increased recognition by the clinical community. This includes recent presentations made at the American Society of Hand Therapists (”ASHT”), American Academy of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (“AAPM&R”) Assembly and the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (“ACRM”).\nPaul R.Gudonis, Chairman & CEO of Myomo, stated: “2017 was an important year for Myomo as we continued to build our operational and commercial capabilities for the MyoPro product line. During the year, we completed our IPO and follow-on offering to raise growth capital to fund our transition from our controlled launch phase to now scaling up operations. In 2018, we look forward to continued execution of our business plan, and our mission to restore functionality to the many individuals with upper limb paralysis. We continue our efforts to bring awareness to veterans and the broader clinical and patient communities, as we target this large unmet need.”\nFinancial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter and Year End December 31, 2017\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nPeriod-to-period\nchange\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\nPeriod-to-period\nchange\n2017 2016 $ % 2017 2016 $ % Revenue $ 547,412 $ 448,093 $ 99,319 22 % $ 1,558,866 $ 1,103,277 $ 455,589 41 % Cost of revenue 203,972 95,830 108,142 113 % 505,280 282,164 223,116 79 % Gross margin $ 343,440 $ 352,263 $ (8,823) (3) % $ 1,053,586 $ 821,113 $ 232,473 28 % Gross margin% 63 % 79 % (16) % 68 % 74 % (6) % Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue was $547,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017; an increase of $99,000, or 22%, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nGross margin was 63% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 79% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The change in gross margin was primarily due to revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 relating to payments received for minimum purchase requirements under our distribution agreement for which there were no units required to be shipped.\nResearch and development expenses were $357,000, a decrease of $50,000, or 12%, during the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative costs of $1,803,000 increased $760,000, or 73%, during the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increased costs were primarily due to increased employee compensation costs and professional fees as we transitioned to a publicly traded company in 2017.\nInterest and other expense, net was $84,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared with a net expense of $114,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company’s net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $1,900,000, compared with a net loss of $1,211,000 for the corresponding 2016 period. Net loss available to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1,900,000 or ($0.25) per share, compared with a net loss available to common stockholders of $1,404,000, or ($1.25) per share, for the corresponding year ago period.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was a loss of $1,770,000, compared with a loss of $1,073,000 for the corresponding 2016 period. A reconciliation of GAAP to this non-GAAP financial measure has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of this measure is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue increased by $456,000, or 41%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, product revenue increased $358,000, or 33%, versus the comparable period of 2016. We recognized $118,000 of grant revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $21,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGross margin decreased to 68% for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 74% in the comparable 2016 period, reflecting $104,000 more in revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the payments received for minimum purchase requirements under our distribution agreement for which there were no units required to be shipped, inventory reserves recorded as a result of introduction of our MyoPro 2 products and lower margins on demonstration units sold in 2017. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in grant revenue in the 2017 period associated with research projects, without incurring any additional incremental costs.\nResearch and development expenses were $1,752,000, an increase of $631,000 or 56%, primarily due to increased compensation related expense, which included an incentive bonus to an engineering executive and additional engineering personnel costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses were $5,850,000, an increase of $2,875,000 or 97%, primarily due to increases in personnel and other headcount related costs for additional administrative and sales staff hired, increased professional and other public company costs, as we prepared for our initial public offering and transitioned to a publicly traded company and additional expenses for marketing and clinical research to support our sales and reimbursement efforts.\nInterest and other expense was $5,549,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared with a net expense of $342,000 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This change was due primarily to the debt discount on convertible notes.\nThe Company’s net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $12,097,000, compared with a net loss of $3,617,000 for the corresponding 2016 period. Net loss available to common stockholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $12,659,000 or ($2.93) per share, compared with a net loss available to common stockholders of $4,384,000 or ($4.13) per share, for the corresponding year ago period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was a loss of $6,257,000, compared with a loss of $3,173,177 for the corresponding 2016 period. A reconciliation of GAAP to this non-GAAP financial measure has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash on hand at December 31, 2017 was $12,959,000, compared to $797,000 at December 31, 2016. The increase in cash reflects the $14.8 million in net proceeds from our public offerings in 2017, $2.9 million from our concurrent private placement and $1.8M of additional convertible notes issued during the year. This was partially offset by cash used in operating activities and by $1.2 million in principal and interest payments made to repay our Note Payable with the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nMyomo will hold a conference call today, March 7, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. EST.
