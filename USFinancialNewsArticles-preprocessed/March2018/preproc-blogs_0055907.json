    "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico and the United States have signed three accords to improve bilateral customs procedures and expedite the flow of agricultural produce across their almost 2,000-mile (3,220-km)border, the two governments said on Monday.\nU.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen shakes hands with Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray after delivering a joint message in Mexico City, Mexico March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Romero In a joint news conference with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said the first agreement aimed to promote joint cooperation to stop illegal merchandise crossing the border.\nThe two agreed to implement programs of joint inspections of cargo between the neighbors, whose bilateral trade is worth half a trillion dollars a year.\n“It’s about creating efficiencies,” Videgaray said.\nFinally, the governments signed an accord that would promote the trade of agricultural goods, the minister added.\nNielsen said the two countries were also working on about 20 further memorandums of understanding and letters of intent.\nU.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Mexico's Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete Prida pose for a picture after delivering a joint message in Mexico City, Mexico March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido Border security needs to be ramped up to halt the illicit flow of arms, Mexico’s Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete said in a subsequent joint news conference with Nielsen.\n“There needs to be much more caution taken... to reduce gradually but conclusively the high levels of violence when arms enter Mexico illegally,” Navarrete added.\nSlideshow (7 Images) The neighboring nations also need to share the responsibility of attending to refugee and asylum cases, he said.\nMexican-U.S. relations have been strained by U.S. President Donald Trump’s insistence that Mexico pay for the southern border wall he wants built to keep out illegal immigrants.\nTensions have also been stirred by Trump’s repeated threats to dump the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if it is not reworked to his satisfaction.\nNAFTA has encouraged companies to relocate to lower-cost Mexico at the expense of U.S. manufacturing workers, he argued.\nIn January, Reuters reported that Mexico and the United States were looking into whether armed U.S. federal air marshals could be deployed on commercial cross-border flights, the latest example of Mexico seeking to ingratiate itself to its northern neighbor.\nReporting by Christine Murray and Gabriel Stargardter, Writing by Dave Graham and Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ",
