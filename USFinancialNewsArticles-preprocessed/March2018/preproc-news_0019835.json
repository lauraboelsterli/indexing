    "text": "Second quarter sales increased 20.7 percent, driven by strong growth in both segments\nTax reform charges drove a loss per share of $0.40; adjusted EPS increased 22.9 percent\nFull-year 2018 sales expected up between 13 and 15 percent, adjusted EPS up 14 to 19 percent\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Donaldson Company, Inc. (NYSE: DCI) today announced a net loss in second quarter 2018 of $52.9 million, or $0.40 per share, 1 compared with net earnings of $46.5 million, or $0.35 per share, in 2017. The Company’s second quarter 2018 results included a one-time charge of $109.7 million, or $0.83 per share, related to the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). 2 Excluding this charge, Donaldson delivered second quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) 3 of $0.43, an increase of 22.9 percent from 2017. The tables attached to this press release include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures.\n“Market strength combined with benefits from consistent execution of our strategy drove notable sales increases across our business last quarter, and we expect to be at the high end of the full-year sales forecast we provided last quarter,” said Tod Carpenter, chairman, president and chief executive officer. “We remain encouraged by the operating environment, with continued strength in engine-related markets and further improvement in several industrial markets.\n“With improving market conditions, we are also experiencing pressure on gross margin from raw materials inflation, mix of sales and other costs related to higher-than-expected demand. While we pursue additional cost-reduction and pricing initiatives to mitigate these pressures, we are also focused on executing our strategic agenda, including: increasing the level of investment in technology development, launching our e-commerce site and expanding capacity. The commitment and effort shown by our employees gives me confidence that we will deliver on our key objectives this year while further strengthening our foundation for long-term value creation.”\n1\nAll earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share. 2\nSee the “Accounting Considerations” section of this release for more information. 3\nAdjusted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of certain matters not related to the Company’s ongoing operations. Second Quarter 2018 Performance\nSecond quarter 2018 sales increased 20.7 percent to $664.7 million from $550.6 million last year. The year-over-year increase includes a benefit of approximately 4.6 percent from currency translation and 1.5 percent from acquisitions completed by the Company during fiscal 2017.\nCompared with the prior year, second quarter 2018 sales increased 22.3 percent in the Engine Products segment and 17.7 percent in the Industrial Products segment, or 18.1 percent and 12.2 percent, respectively, excluding the benefit from currency translation. The table below illustrates year-over-year performance with and without the impact from currency translation.\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended January 31, 2018 January 31, 2018 Reported\n% Change\nConstant\nCurrency\n% Change\nReported\n% Change\nConstant\nCurrency\n% Change\nOff-Road 37.0 % 30.8 % 37.0 % 32.9 % On-Road 50.6 46.8 37.3 35.6 Aftermarket 18.3 14.5 21.5 18.6 Aerospace and Defense 2.0 (1.4 ) 0.8 (1.8 ) Total Engine Products segment 22.3 % 18.1 % 23.6 % 20.6 % Industrial Filtration Solutions 13.4 % 8.1 % 10.0 % 6.3 % Gas Turbine Systems 55.7 51.1 10.5 8.0 Special Applications 11.3 4.7 7.6 3.6 Total Industrial Products segment 17.7 % 12.2 % 9.6 % 6.0 % Total Company 20.7 % 16.1 % 18.7 % 15.5 % Second quarter 2018 operating income rate declined to 12.3 percent from 12.6 percent in 2017, reflecting lower gross margin that was partially offset by operating expense leverage. Gross margin declined 1.2 percentage points to 32.9 percent from 34.1 percent, reflecting the negative impacts from higher raw materials and supply chain costs combined with an unfavorable mix of sales. Operating expense as a rate of sales (“expense rate”) improved 0.9 percentage points to 20.6 percent from 21.5 percent, reflecting leverage on increasing sales, partially offset by strategic investments and higher incentive compensation. Additionally, this fiscal year Donaldson moved its annual stock option incentive grant from second quarter to first quarter, which contributed approximately 0.5 percentage points to the year-over-year expense rate favorability.\nDonaldson’s second quarter 2018 net other expense was $0.1 million, compared with net other income in 2017 of $1.7 million. Second quarter interest expense was $5.1 million in 2018, compared with $4.8 million in 2017. The Company’s second quarter 2018 effective income tax rate includes additional tax expense of $109.7 million related to the TCJA. Excluding this impact, the second quarter 2018 rate declined to 25.7 percent from 29.8 percent in 2017, reflecting tax benefits of stock option activity combined with a lower U.S. corporate tax rate.\nDuring second quarter 2018, Donaldson repurchased 400 thousand shares, or 0.3 percent, of its common stock at an average price of $50.55 for a total investment of $20.2 million. Year to date, the Company has repurchased 1.3 million shares, or 1.0 percent, of its common stock at an average price of $47.17 for a total investment of $62.9 million. Donaldson paid dividends of $23.4 million in second quarter 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nDonaldson expects fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS between $1.93 and $2.01, consistent with prior guidance at the midpoint. Fiscal 2018 GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.83 lower than adjusted EPS, reflecting charges taken in second quarter 2018 related to the TCJA.\nDonaldson increased the midpoint of its full-year 2018 sales guidance range, with sales now expected to grow between 13 and 15 percent, compared with 10 to 14 percent in prior guidance. The total sales forecast includes benefits of approximately 3 percent from currency translation and 1 percent from acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017.\nSales of Engine Products are now expected to increase between 17 and 19 percent, compared with prior forecast of 13 to 17 percent. Donaldson raised its growth projections for Off-Road and On-Road, while Aftermarket and Aerospace and Defense year-over-year growth rates are consistent with prior guidance. Industrial Products sales are expected to increase 5 to 7 percent, reflecting growth in Industrial Filtration Solutions and Special Applications, partially offset by declining sales in Gas Turbine Systems. The midpoint of the Industrial Products sales range is consistent with prior guidance.\nDonaldson expects fiscal 2018 operating margin between 13.8 and 14.2 percent, or 0.3 percentage points below prior guidance due to increased pressure on gross margin. The Company expects full-year 2018 interest expense of approximately $21 million, and the forecast for other income is now $1 million to $5 million, compared with prior forecast of $3 million to $7 million. Excluding one-time charges related to the TCJA, Donaldson’s fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate will be 26.5 to 28.5 percent. The revised guidance reflects the estimated net impact from the TCJA, which includes a partial-year benefit from the U.S. corporate tax rate reduction that is largely offset by foreign withholding tax and other matters related to the TCJA.\nThe Company expects fiscal 2018 capital expenditures of $90 million to $100 million and cash conversion between 60 and 75 percent, with increased working capital needs resulting in lower cash conversion than previously expected. Donaldson plans to repurchase approximately 2 percent of its outstanding shares in fiscal 2018.\nAccounting Considerations\nDonaldson’s second quarter 2018 results include non-cash charges related to the Company’s provisional estimates of the impact from the TCJA. These charges include $108.3 million related to the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, which will be paid over eight years beginning in fiscal 2019, and $1.4 million related to the re-measurement of Donaldson’s net deferred tax assets. These items were excluded from the calculation of adjusted EPS.\nDuring first quarter 2017, Donaldson recorded income of $6.8 million related to the settlement of claims against an escrow account that had been established with the Company’s acquisition of Northern Technical, L.L.C., which was completed in first quarter 2015. The income was recorded as other income in Donaldson’s first quarter 2017 consolidated statement of earnings and within the Industrial Products segment earnings. The income was excluded from the calculation of adjusted EPS.\nMiscellaneous\nThe Company will webcast its second quarter 2018 earnings conference call today at 9:00 a.m. CST.

free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted effective tax rate are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, the Company believes they are useful in understanding its financial results. Free cash flow is a commonly used measure of a company’s ability to generate cash in excess of its operating needs. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of operating earnings less non-cash expenses. The Company evaluates its results of operations both on an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company believes providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding its results of operations. The Company calculates constant currency percentages by converting its current period local currency financial results using the prior period exchanges rates and compared these adjusted amounts to its prior period reported results. The adjusted basis presentation excludes the impact of certain matters not related to the Company's ongoing operations. Adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended January 31, 2018 uses 132.8 million weighted average shares in the computation to reflect dilution associated with having adjusted net earnings. A shortcoming of these financial measures is that they do not reflect the Company’s actual results under GAAP. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306005196/en/\nDonaldson Company, Inc.\nBrad Pogalz, 952-887-3753\nSource: Donaldson Company, Inc.",
