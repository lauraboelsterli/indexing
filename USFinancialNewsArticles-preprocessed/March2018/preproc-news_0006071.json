    "text": "SANTA ANA, Calif., Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ducommun Incorporated (NYSE:DCO) (“Ducommun” or the “Company”) today reported results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Recap\nRevenue of $142.3 million\nGAAP net income of $9.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted share Adjusted net income for the quarter was $4.6 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, which excludes net of tax, $12.6 million tax benefit from adoption of Tax Cuts Jobs Act, $6.9 million restructuring charges, and $0.9 million inventory purchase accounting adjustment Adjusted EBITDA of $13.6 million Backlog of $726.5 million\n“I am happy to report that we closed 2017 with several major accomplishments as we move into a busy year ahead,” said Stephen G. Oswald, the Company’s president and chief executive officer. “Along with posting solid revenue and making progress towards higher margins, our backlog surged to over $720 million this quarter - marking a milestone for the Company that once again illustrates the enduring demand for our applications, the value we provide, and the key programs we serve.\n“We took the initial steps this quarter, as previously announced, to further streamline our operations and improve margins, particularly within the structures business. We have a good amount of work to do this year as well but remain on track to reduce some $14 million of annualized cost out of the Company starting in 2019. Overall, I am optimistic about the future for Ducommun as we take additional measures to increase margins, accelerate top line growth, and improve returns to our shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter Results\nNet revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $142.3 million, compared to $142.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease year-over-year was primarily due to the following:\n$1.3 million lower revenue within the Company’s military and space end-use markets mainly due to timing of certain orders which impacted scheduled deliveries on the Company’s fixed-wing and helicopter platforms; partially offset by $0.9 million higher revenue in the Company’s commercial aerospace end-use markets mainly due to added content with existing customers; and $0.2 million higher revenue within the Company’s industrial, medical and other (“Industrial”) end-use markets.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter 2017 was $4.6 million, or $0.41 per adjusted diluted earnings per share, compared to $4.8 million, or $0.43 per adjusted diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income was primarily due to the following:\n$17.5 million lower income tax expense mainly due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) enacted in December 2017 which required the Company to remeasure its deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017; partially offset by $8.7 million (of which, $0.5 million was recorded as cost of sales) higher restructuring charges as a result of the Company approving and commencing a restructuring plan in November 2017 that is expected to increase operating efficiencies; $1.4 million higher selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expense mainly due to higher compensation and benefit costs and higher professional service fees; and $1.1 million of inventory purchase accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $25.7 million, or 18.1% of revenue, compared to gross profit of $27.8 million, or 19.5% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross margin percentage year-over-year was primarily due to unfavorable product mix and, as part of our restructuring activities, $0.5 million in inventory write-offs.\nOperating loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $(2.7) million, or (1.9)% of revenue, compared to operating income of $9.0 million, or 6.3% of revenue, in the comparable period last year. The year-over-year decrease in operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to higher restructuring charges of $8.7 million, higher SG&A expenses of $1.4 million, and higher amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of LDS in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.1 million, or 5.0% of revenue, compared to adjusted operating income of $9.1 million, or 6.4% of revenue, in the comparable period last year.\nInterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.7 million compared to $2.0 million in the comparable period of 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a higher utilization of the Company’s revolving credit facility, mainly for the acquisition of Lightning Diversion Systems, LLC (“LDS”).\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.6 million, or 9.6% of revenue, compared to $15.1 million, or 10.6% of revenue, for the comparable period in 2016.\nThe Company’s backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $726.5 million compared to $641.3 million as of December 31, 2016, which reflects an increase of $60.3 million in Commercial aerospace, $21.0 million in military and space, and $3.9 million in Industrial.\nBusiness Segment Information\nStructural Systems\nStructural Systems reported net revenue for the current quarter of $65.1 million, compared to $60.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the following:\n$4.1 million higher revenue within the Company’s commercial aerospace end-use markets mainly due to build rate increases and added content with existing customers, which favorably impacted the Company’s large airframe platforms; and $0.2 million higher revenue within the Company’s military and space end-use markets mainly due to higher demand, which favorably impacted the Company’s helicopter platforms.\nStructural Systems segment operating loss for the current-year fourth quarter was $(2.7) million, or (4.1)% of revenue, compared to operating income of $3.2 million, or 5.2% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to restructuring charges of $5.8 million.\nAdjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.1 million, or 4.8% of revenue, compared to adjusted operating income of $3.2 million, or 5.2% of revenue, in the comparable period last year.\nElectronic Systems\nElectronic Systems reported net revenue for the current quarter of $77.2 million, compared to $81.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the following:\n$3.2 million lower revenue within the Company’s commercial aerospace end-use markets mainly due to timing of certain orders which impacted scheduled deliveries on certain of the Company’s large airframe programs; and $1.5 million lower revenue within the Company’s military and space end-use markets mainly due to timing of certain orders which impacted scheduled deliveries on certain of the Company’s fixed-wing and helicopter platforms; partially offset by $0.2 million higher revenue within the Company’s Industrial end-use markets.\nElectronic Systems operating income for the current year fourth quarter of $6.8 million, or 8.8% of revenue, compared to $9.2 million, or 11.3% of revenue, for the comparable quarter in 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to restructuring charges of $1.2 million and higher amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of LDS.\nAdjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.1 million, or 11.7% of revenue, compared to adjusted operating income of $9.4 million, or 11.5% of revenue, in the comparable period last year.\nCorporate General and Administrative (“CG&A”) Expense\nCG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.9 million, or 4.8% of total Company revenue, compared to $3.4 million, or 2.4% of total Company revenue, in the comparable quarter in the prior year. The increase in CG&A expense in the current year quarter was primarily due to restructuring charges of $1.8 million, higher professional service fees, and higher compensation and benefit costs.\nConference Call\nA teleconference hosted by Stephen G.
