    "text": "JUPITER, Fla., March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dyadic International, Inc. (“Dyadic”) (OTCQX:DYAI), a global biotechnology company focused on further improving and applying its proprietary C1 expression system to help speed up the development and production of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales, announced today that it will report its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 after the market close on Tuesday, March 27, 2018 and that it will host a conference call that day at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss those results.\nIn order to participate in the live session, please use the following dial-in numbers five to ten minutes prior to the start time:\nCalling from the United States or Canada: 888-437-9445\nCalling from other countries: + 719-325-4857\nConfirmation Code: 5790217\nA replay of the conference call will be available on Dyadic’s website ( www.dyadic.com ) within 24 hours after the live event.\nAbout Dyadic International, Inc.\nDyadic International, Inc. is a global biotechnology company which is developing what it believes will be a potentially significant biopharmaceutical gene expression platform based on the fungus Myceliophthora thermophila , nicknamed C1. The C1 microorganism, which enables the development and large-scale manufacture of low cost proteins, has the potential to be further developed into a safe and efficient expression system that may help speed up the development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales. Dyadic is using the C1 technology and other technologies to conduct research, development and commercial activities for the development and manufacturing of human and animal vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, biosimilars and/or biobetters, and other therapeutic proteins. Additionally, the Company has entered into a proof of concept research project to explore the potential of its C1 technology to produce an important active moiety for a third party. Dyadic pursues research and development collaborations, licensing arrangements and other commercial opportunities with its partners and collaborators to leverage the value and benefits of using these technologies in the development and manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. In particular, as the aging population grows in developed and undeveloped countries, Dyadic believes the C1 technology may help bring biologic vaccines and drugs to market faster, in greater volumes, at lower cost, and potentially with new properties to drug developers and manufacturers and, hopefully, improve access and cost to patients and the healthcare system, but most importantly save lives.\nPlease visit Dyadic’s website at www.dyadic.com for additional information, including details regarding Dyadic’s plans for its biopharmaceutical business.\nDyadic trades on the OTCQX tier of the OTC marketplace.
