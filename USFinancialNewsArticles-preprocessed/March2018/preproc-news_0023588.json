Wichita State has made the tournament each of the last six seasons.\nAfter Landry Shamet drew Wichita State even at 54-all with 9:39 left, there were five lead changes before Robinson converted a Robert Gray Jr. assist into what turned out to be the game-winning points.\nThe basket was just Robinson’s second of the game. He also had a game-high six assists.\nWichita State had two chances to regain the lead, but Austin Reaves missed a jumper and Robinson recorded his critical steal, setting up two game-clinching free throws by Gray.\nGray’s two late free throws made him 13-for-15 from the line, accounting for a huge chunk of his game-high 33 points.\nCorey Davis Jr. added 19 points for the Cougars, while Nura Zanna collected a team-high nine rebounds.\nThe win was Houston’s fifth straight and gave it 26 wins for the season, the program’s most since the 1984 national finalists won 32.\nHouston had reached the tournament semifinals by beating Central Florida 84-56 on Friday night.\nShamet had a team-high 19 points for Wichita State, which lost for just the second time in its last 10 games. The Shockers had eliminated Temple 89-81 in one of Friday’s quarterfinals.\nRashard Kelly grabbed a game-high 12 points to go with 10 points for the Shockers, while Shaquille Morris had 12 points and Reaves 10.\nThe teams had split their regular-season games, each winning at home.\nHouston led by as many as nine points in the first half and by 37-31 at halftime.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
