    "text": "EVANSTON, Ill., March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Silver Oak Services Partners, LLC (\"Silver Oak\"), a leading lower middle market private equity firm focused exclusively on service businesses, announced it has led the recapitalization of Brilliant Staffing (\"Brilliant\" or the \"Company\") in partnership with management and co-investors.\nBrilliant is a leading provider of temporary and permanent Finance, Accounting (\"F&A\") and IT professionals to the Greater Chicago and South Florida markets. Founded in 2009, Brilliant is able to provide high quality professionals with a variety of backgrounds and experience levels to meet the needs of clients across a wide range of industries.\n\"Brilliant has been very successful, and we realized that to continue to grow our business, we would need a strategic partner that shared our vision for growth and had the capital resources to help us execute our strategy. We're very excited about our partnership with Silver Oak, particularly given their success investing in the staffing space and track record of partnering with management to execute successful growth strategies. We look forward to working with them as we continue to grow our business,\" said Jeff Mariola, CEO of Brilliant. Visit http://www.brilliantfs.com .\nSilver Oak was attracted to the professional staffing sector given the continued strong demand for F&A and IT professionals that far outpaces supply of these individuals, the highly fragmented nature of the industry and attractive cash flow dynamics. Greg Barr, Managing Partner at Silver Oak, said, \"Brilliant is well regarded in the industry for its excellent client service and ability to identify top talent to meet their clients' needs. We're very excited to partner with such an experienced management team, and we look forward to working with the team to execute on their growth strategy to grow our existing offices and enter new geographies where we believe our unique approach will continue to resonate with clients and candidates.\" Brilliant is actively looking for add on acquisition opportunities.\nPlease contact Greg Barr or David Friedman of Silver Oak for additional information.\nSilver Oak invests in business, consumer and healthcare services companies in the lower middle market, typically with EBITDA of $4 million to $20 million.
