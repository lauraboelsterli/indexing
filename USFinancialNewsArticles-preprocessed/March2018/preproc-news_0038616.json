    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 12:23 PM / Updated an hour ago TenneT says working with EU on cross-border grid issues Reuters Staff 2 Min Read BRUSSELS, March 19 (Reuters) - German grid company TenneT is working with the European Commission to find solutions to cross-border grid issues for which it is under antitrust investigation by Brussels, it said on Monday. EU antitrust authorities on Monday launched an investigation into whether limits placed by TenneT — a subsidiary of TenneT Holding IPO-TTH.AS, the Dutch government-owned operator of electrical grids in the Netherlands and Germany — on cross-border electricity capacity with Denmark breaches EU antitrust rules. TenneT said the German-Danish border suffered from transmission bottlenecks, adding that transmission capacities were stretched to the limit because of market liberalisation and the transition to renewable energy. A statement from TenneT said the EU investigation will include calculations on whether capacities approved under European law put foreign providers at an unfair disadvantage. “The examination can therefore set a precedent for all border connections in Europe,” it added.
