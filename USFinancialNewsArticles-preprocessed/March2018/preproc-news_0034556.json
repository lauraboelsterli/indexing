    "text": "Facebook shares fell as much as 8 percent on Monday after reports that Cambridge Analytica mined the data of over 50 million users of the social network without their permission. \n\nCambridge Analytica worked on Facebook ads for President Donald Trump during the 2016 election. It was initially funded by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer and led by former Trump advisor Steve Bannon.\nWhistleblower Christopher Wylie revealed the alleged role played by Cambridge Analytica in obtaining data from Facebook users to The Observer newspaper in the U.K. and The New York Times .\nBoth newspapers ran stories Sunday outlining how Cambridge academic Aleksander Kogan made an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" that prompted users to answer questions for a psychological profile.

Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" Grewal said.\n\nCambridge Analytica has",
