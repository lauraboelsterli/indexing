GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Trump says prepared to meet North Korea's Kim in first-ever summit U.S President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was prepared to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first U.S.-North Korea summit, marking a potentially dramatic breakthrough in nuclear tensions with Pyongyang. • Trump sets steel and aluminum tariffs but exempts Canada, Mexico U.S. President Donald Trump pressed ahead on Thursday with import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent for aluminum but exempted Canada and Mexico and offered the possibility of excluding other allies, backtracking from an earlier \"no-exceptions\" stance. • China's Feb factory inflation slows, consumer price growth hits more than 4-year high China's producer price inflation eased to the slowest pace in 15 months in February, as the cost of raw materials and other inputs rose at a milder pace, pointing to a potential softening in industrial sector profits. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were higher at 10,280.00, up 0.4 percent from previous close. • The Indian rupee is likely to trade little changed amid bets that gains in equities would help offset strength in the dollar after U.S President Donald Trump signed U.S. tariffs. • Indian government bonds are likely to gain in early trade as some investors expect inflation to have slowed in February and as crude oil prices fell. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.62 percent - 7.68 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • The three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to soften his stance on trade tariffs, easing trade war fears that had had the market on edge for a week. • Asian shares rallied and the safe-haven yen eased after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un offered to stop nuclear and missile testing and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to a meeting that could come before May. • The dollar rose versus the safe haven yen as hopes of a breakthrough in the North Korean nuclear standoff rose after U.S. President Donald Trump showed willingness to accept an invitation to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by May. • The yield on the U.S. benchmark government bond moved within a range of three basis points on Thursday, continuing a trend of muted fluctuation in the week ahead of Friday's payrolls data. • Crude oil futures rose as Asian stock markets gained on news that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump. • Gold prices extended losses into a third session as the dollar strengthened against the yen on hopes of easing tensions between the United States and North Korea and ahead of U.S. non-farm payroll data later in the day.
