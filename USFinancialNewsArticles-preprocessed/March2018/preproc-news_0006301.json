    "text": " unheralded 4x400m relay men caused entire world indoor championships in the final track event on Sunday — and even astonished themselves when they set the event’s only world record at the last gasp.\nMar 4, 2018; Birmingham, United Kingdom; Members of the Poland 4 x 400m relay celebrate after setting a world record of 3:01.77 during the IAAF World Indoor Championships at Arena Birmingham. From left: Jakub Krzewina and Karol Zalewski and Rafal Omelko and Lukasz Krawczuk. Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports “It is a big shock and surprise for us. We were targeting the European record but really did not expect a result like this and never dreamed about the world record,” said one of the Poles’ astonished quartet, Rafal Omelko, with a bewildered smile.\nThe quartet of Karol Zalewski, Omelko, established a world indoor mark of three minutes 01.77 seconds, which was remarkable enough in itself.\nYet what truly amazed was the manner in which Krzewina, turning himself into an instant Polish hero, hunted down American anchor leg runner Vernon Norwood to pip what was supposed to be an unbeatable U.S. squad in the dying strides.\nNorwood, the 2016 U.S. indoor champion who has a lifetime best indoors of 45.31 seconds compared to Krzewina’s 46.15, should have made it a formality, as he took the baton for the final leg while leading by some five meters.\nYet the man who had anchored the Americans to victory two years ago in Portland ran a curiously distracted race out front, something he appeared to accept afterwards when he reflected gloomily:“The team did a great job but no comment on my last leg.”\nEverybody, though, was commenting on Krzewina’s never-say-die effort to win from a seemingly impossible position.“I think the last lap with Jakub was the crucial one,” said Omelko.\n“He pushed it so hard and he is very, very strong this year. He helped us to win the most.”\nThe 28-year-old Krzewina, who has never before won a major gold medal, sports plenty of garish tattoos.“But those who know me, know that they are not for show, they add to my strength when I’m fighting for Poland,” he likes to say.\nAll four of the team punched above their weight here as they eclipsed\nThe Americans’ consolation was the scant one of also\nOmelko explained that it was teamwork which had won the day for Poland.\n“We’ve all worked hard together,” he said.“We met two weeks before the championships to train together for the relays and had a lot of exchange training. Still, this was a big shock.”\n ",
