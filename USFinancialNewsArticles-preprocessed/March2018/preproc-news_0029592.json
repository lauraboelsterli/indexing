Lodzinski, President and Chief Executive Officer of Earthstone Energy, Inc., commented, “2017 was clearly a great year for Earthstone. As our numbers demonstrate, we have set corporate records in virtually all metrics including, production volumes, revenues and Adjusted EBITDAX, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In spite of the industry downturn and significant commodity price volatility, in just three years we achieved annual revenues of more than $100 million and entered 2018 with production of more than 10,000 Boepd. We have successfully transformed our Company to have a clear focus on the Midland Basin in west Texas. We intend to further expand our footprint in west Texas while we drive down costs and profitably increase production.”\nSelected Financial Data (unaudited)\n($000s except where noted) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 (3)\n2016 (4)\nTotal Revenue 35,677 15,152 108,078 42,269 Net Income (Loss) 5,497 (33,048 ) (44,733 ) (54,541 ) Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share (Basic and Diluted) (2) 0.09 (1.48 ) (0.53 ) (2.92 ) Adjusted EBITDAX (1) 22,102 7,827 60,640 18,743 Production (6) : Oil (MBbls) 529 271 1,828 878 Gas (MMcf) 933 578 3,260 2,171 NGL (MBbls) 150 64 500 225 Total (MBoe) (5) 834 431 2,872 1,465 Average Daily Production (Boepd) 9,071 4,685 7,869 4,002 Average Prices: Oil ($/Bbl) 54.34 45.94 48.42 39.13 Gas ($/Mcf) 2.62 2.89 2.69 2.32 NGL ($/Bbl) 30.01 16.08 21.51 12.74 Total ($/Boe) 42.75 35.15 37.63 28.86 Adj. for Realized Derivatives Settlements: Oil ($/Bbl) 52.28 45.98 48.00 42.77 Gas ($/Mcf) 2.78 2.69 2.71 2.34 NGL ($/Bbl) 30.01 16.08 21.51\n12.74 Total ($/Boe) 41.63 34.91 37.38 31.06 (1) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below.

(“CGA”), were approximately 80.0 MMBoe, 25% of which were proved developed and 59% of which were oil.\nSEC rules require that calculations of economically recoverable reserves use the unweighted average price on the first day of the month for the prior twelve month period. The resulting oil and natural gas prices used for the Company’s 2017 year-end reserve report, prior to adjusting for quality and basis differentials, were $51.34 per barrel and $2.98 per MMBtu, respectively. Prices net of differentials were $48.99 per barrel and $2.56 per MMBtu.\nBased on such prices, the Company’s estimated proved reserves by category as of December 31, 2017, are provided in the following table.\nOil Gas NGL Total PV-10 Reserve Category (MBbls) (MMcf) (MBbls) (MBoe) ($ in thousands) Proved Developed 11,949 23,336 4,123 19,961 273,793 Proved Undeveloped 35,378 67,752 13,345 60,015 324,848 Total 47,327 91,088 17,468 79,976 598,641 Note: PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nFinancial Position\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $23 million in cash and $25 million outstanding under its credit facility with a borrowing base of $185 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring 2017, in addition to the completion of the Bold Transaction in May 2017, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $81.1 million, on an accrual basis, primarily consisting of drilling and completion costs, of which $35.7 million was incurred during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nImpairments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized $72.2 million of non-cash asset impairments. These impairments consisted of $63.1 million to our proved oil and natural gas properties and $9.1 million to our unproved oil and natural gas properties, primarily to our properties located in the Eagle Ford Trend of south Texas.\nHedging Update\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had hedged a total of 1,483 MBbls of 2018 oil production at an average price of $51.38/Bbl and 548 MBbls of 2019 oil production at an average price of $52.32/Bbl. As of December 31, 2017, we had hedged a total of 810,000 MMBtu of 2018 natural gas production at an average price of $3.066/MMBtu.\nIn January 2018, the Company entered into additional fixed price oil and natural gas swap agreements, hedging an additional 365 MBbls of 2019 oil production at a price of $58.38/Bbl and 1,552,000 MMBtu of 2018 natural gas production at a price of $2.96/MMBtu.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company has set its 2018 capital budget, which currently assumes a one-rig program for its operated acreage in the Midland Basin and a 10 well program for its operated Eagle Ford acreage. As previously discussed, the Company will continue to evaluate and prepare operationally for the possible deployment of a second rig in its operated Midland Basin acreage. Capital expenditures, production and operating costs for 2018 are currently estimated to be:\n2018 Capital Expenditures $ millions\n(Net)\nNumber of\nGross / Net\nWells Spudded\nNumber of\nGross / Net\nWells On Line\nDrilling and Completion: Operated Midland Basin (1 Rig) $130 20 / 19 22 / 19.6 Non-Operated Midland Basin 14 5 / 2 5 / 2 Operated Eagle Ford 12 10 / 2.1 16 / 3.6 Land / Infrastructure 14 2018 Total Capital Expenditures $170 2018 Average Daily Production (Boepd) 12,000 – 12,500 % Oil 64% % Gas 17% % NGL 19% 2018 Operating Costs Lease Operating and Workover ($/Boe) $4.75 – $5.25 Production Taxes (% of Revenue) 5.0% – 5.3% Cash G&A ($/Boe) $5.00 – $5.50 Note: Guidance is forward-looking information that is subject to considerable change and numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Earthstone’s control.

Adjusted EBITDAX\nAdjusted EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income (loss) because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator.\nWe define “Adjusted EBITDAX” as net income (loss) plus, when applicable, accretion; impairment expense; depletion, depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; transaction costs; (gain) on sale of oil and gas properties; exploration expense; rig idle expense; unrealized loss on derivatives; stock based compensation; and income tax (benefit) expense.\nOur Adjusted EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand our operations. Adjusted EBITDAX is one of several metrics that we use as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. Adjusted EBITDAX, as used by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other users of our consolidated financial statements. For example, Adjusted EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure and to assess the financial performance of our assets and our company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAX for the periods indicated:\n($000s) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ 5,497 $ (33,048 ) $ (44,733 ) $ (54,541 ) Accretion 56 147 434 551 Impairment expense 5,451 24,283 72,191 24,283 Depletion, depreciation and amortization 8,657 9,685 36,915 25,937 Interest expense, net 826 348 2,699 1,282 Transaction costs 56 843 4,732 2,483 (Gain) on sale of oil and gas properties\n(5,257 ) — (9,105 ) (8 ) Rig idle and termination expense — — — 5,059 Exploration — — 1 5 Unrealized loss on derivative contracts 11,186 4,016 7,278 9,863 Non-cash stock based compensation 1,956 1,412 6,601 3,301 Income tax (benefit) expense (6,327 ) 141 (16,373 ) 528 Adjusted EBITDAX $ 22,102 $ 7,827 $ 60,640 $ 18,743 II. PV-10\nPV-10 is derived from the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10%. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our PV-10 measure and the Standardized Measure do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 of the Company’s estimated proved properties to the Standardized Measure (in thousands):\nPresent value of estimated future net revenues (PV-10) $ 598,641 Future income taxes, discounted at 10% (5,941 ) Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows $ 592,700\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180314006117/en/\nEarthstone Energy, Inc.\nMark Lumpkin, Jr., 281-298-4246\nExecutive Vice President – Chief Financial Officer\nmark.lumpkin@earthstoneenergy.com\nor\nScott Thelander, 281-298-4246\nDirector of Finance\nscott@earthstoneenergy.com\nSource: Earthstone Energy, Inc.",
