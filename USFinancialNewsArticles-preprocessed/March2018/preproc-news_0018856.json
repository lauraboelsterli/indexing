Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, addresses the Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse The context for Venezuela’s presidential poll, planned for May 20 - which the opposition is boycotting in defiance of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro - “does not in any way fulfill minimal conditions for free and credible elections” - Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein told the U.N. Human Rights Council. “Once again, I encourage the Council to consider mandating a Commission of Inquiry to investigate human rights violations in Venezuela,” Zeid told the Geneva forum, where Venezuela is among the 47 member states.
