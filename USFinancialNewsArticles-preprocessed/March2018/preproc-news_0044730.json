The value given in Spotifyâ€™s filing was only for the purposes of calculating registration fees and there is no proposed maximum value of the offering)\nMarch 23 (Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify Technology SA said on Friday about 2 million of its non-paying users were suppressing advertisements, highlighting a potential revenue risk for the soon-to-be public company.\nSpotify had 157 million active users as of Dec. 31, of which about 71 million were paid subscribers who access ad-free versions of the service.\nIn a regulatory filing, Spotify said here it previously included the 2 million users in calculations for some of its key performance indicators, including MAUs, ad-supported users, content hours, and content hours per MAU.\nThe streaming music leader had filed this week for a direct listing of its shares, instead of a traditional IPO.\nThe direct listing will let investors and employees sell shares without the company raising new capital or hiring a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite the offering.
