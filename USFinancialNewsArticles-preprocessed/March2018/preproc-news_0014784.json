    "text": "ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Belden Inc. (NYSE: BDC) today announced the pricing of its private offering (the “Notes Offering”) of €350 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior subordinated notes due 2028 (the “Notes”) at an issue price of 100% of their principal amount. Belden expects the Notes Offering to close on March 14, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by certain of Belden’s current and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee Belden’s indebtedness under its revolving credit agreement.\nBelden intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering along with cash on hand to fund its concurrent cash tender offers (the “Tender Offers”) for any and all of its outstanding 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). The Notes Offering is not conditional upon the consummation of either Tender Offer at any minimum level of acceptance. Belden has given notice that it will redeem on April 5, 2018 any 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes not validly tendered and purchased in the Tender Offers, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture relating to the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes, as applicable, conditioned upon and subject to satisfaction of the successful completion of the Notes Offering on terms satisfactory to Belden.\nThe Notes offered have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or any state securities laws; and unless so registered, the Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Notes are expected to be eligible for resale to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and non-U.S. persons under Regulation S.\nThis announcement shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Notes, nor shall there be any sale of the Notes in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state. This announcement shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes, which are the subject of the above-referenced cash Tender Offer.\nIn connection with the Notes Offering, the initial purchasers may engage in stabilizing transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. Any such stabilization action must be conducted in accordance with all applicable laws and rules.\nAbout Belden\nBelden Inc. delivers a comprehensive product portfolio designed to meet the mission-critical network infrastructure needs of industrial, enterprise and broadcast markets.
