    "text": "BERLIN, March 9 (Reuters) - German industrial output fell unexpectedly in January, data showed on Friday, adding to signs that factories in Europeâ€™s largest economy are operating at a slower pace at the start of the year.\nData from the Economy Ministry showed output fell by 0.1 percent, confounding expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.5 percent rise.\nSeparate data published by the Federal Statistics Office showed exports fell unexpectedly by 0.5 percent in January, undershooting a Reuters forecast for a 0.3 percent increase.\nImports also declined by 0.5 percent. A Reuters poll had forecast an unchanged reading.\nThe seasonally adjusted trade balance was unchanged at 21.3 billion euros ($26.22 billion), the data showed. ($1 = 0.8122 euros) (Reporting by Joseph Nasr Editing by Michelle Martin)\n ",
