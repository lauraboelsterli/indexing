    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Renault ( RENA.PA ) shares fell in early session trading on Thursday, as Nissan ( 7201.T ) said the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance had no plans to change the cross-shareholding ratios of its member companies, echoing views from the French government.\nFILE PHOTO: New Renault and Nissan automobiles are loaded onto a transporter at the Renault SA car factory in Flins, France, February 23, 2017. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo Renault shares were down 1.4 percent in early session trading, giving up some of the gains it made in the previous day, when the stock had ended 5.6 percent higher.\nRenault shares rallied on March 7, after Reuters reported that Renault and its alliance partner Nissan were discussing plans for a closer tie-up in which the Japanese carmaker would acquire the bulk of the French state’s 15 percent Renault holding.\nThe French finance ministry said late on Wednesday that France was not prepared to accept Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn’s reported proposal to let Nissan buy the French state’s stake in carmaker Renault.\nNissan also said on Thursday there were no plans to change the cross-shareholding ratios in the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; editing by Luke Baker\n ",
