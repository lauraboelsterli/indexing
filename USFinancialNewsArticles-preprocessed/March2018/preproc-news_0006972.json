    "text": "(Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Darwin Deason filed a new lawsuit against Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) on Friday after it refused to allow him to make nominations to its board after a deadline, the latest blows in a row over its proposed merger with Fujifilm Holdings Corp ( 4901.T ).\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Xerox company is seen on a building in Minsk, Belarus, March 21, 2016. REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko/File Photo Related Coverage Timeline: Icahn and Deason's fight with Xerox Deason said on Monday he had the right to nominate directors, despite missing a deadline, because the current board had made a series of significant decisions and disclosures to stockholders after the deadline.\nXerox earlier on Friday said Deason did not have the right to nominate directors outside of the nomination window. ( bit.ly/2HX4y5x )\nDeason and fellow shareholder and hedge fund manager Carl Icahn are trying to stop Japan’s Fujifilm from taking over Xerox in a $6.1 billion deal.\nThe two investors, who control 15 percent of Xerox, argue the transaction dramatically undervalues the company and“disproportionately” favors Fuji.\n\"We need a strategy that is grounded in reality, not wishful thinking. In the coming weeks, that is exactly what we will lay out for your consideration\" Icahn and Deason said in a joint statement. ( bit.ly/2CTDKPM )\nShares of Xerox were down 1.5 percent at $30.10 in early trading.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Patrick Graham\n ",
