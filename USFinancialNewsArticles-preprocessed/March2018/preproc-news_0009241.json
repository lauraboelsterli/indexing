    "text": "BEDMINSTER, N.J., and DUBLIN, Ireland, March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amarin Corporation plc (NASDAQ:AMRN) today announced that, in connection with its previously announced underwritten public offering of American Depositary Shares (\"ADSs\"), it has issued 1,438,356 additional ADSs, pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional ADSs. The underwriter has agreed to purchase ADSs from us at a price of $3.41 per ADS, which includes an underwriting fee. The exercise of the option increases the size of the offering to an aggregate of approximately $75.2 million in gross proceeds to the Company. The purchase of the additional ADSs closed on March 5, 2018.\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co. is the sole book-running manager for the offering. The underwriter may offer the ADSs from time to time for sale in one or more transactions on The NASDAQ Global Market, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.\nAmarin intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to expand medical education and market awareness initiatives, including, in advance of REDUCE-IT results being known, pilot testing of new promotional initiatives for potential broader application following REDUCE-IT results, to increase its inventory balances for incremental inventory build prior to REDUCE-IT results and for general corporate and working capital purposes.\nThe securities described above are being offered by Amarin pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (No. 333-216385) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on March 1, 2017 and automatically became effective upon filing. The securities may be offered only by means of a written prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, forming a part of the effective registration statement.
