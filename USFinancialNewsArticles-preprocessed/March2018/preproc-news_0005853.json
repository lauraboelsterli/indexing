    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 9:19 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago U.S. approves possible sale of javelin missiles worth $47 million to Ukraine Reuters Staff 1 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale of Javelin missiles and launch units to Ukraine at an estimated cost of $47 million, the Pentagon said on Thursday. “The Javelin system will help Ukraine build its long-term defence capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to meet its national defence requirements,” the Pentagon said in a statement. It said the proposed sale would not alter the military balance in the region. More than 10,000 people have been killed since 2014 in a conflict that pits Ukrainian forces against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.
