(Nasdaq:BOOM) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter sales were $54.5 million, a 4% sequential increase versus the 2017 third quarter, and a 36% improvement from $40.2 million reported in the 2016 fourth quarter. The results exceeded management’s forecast of a 30% year-over-year sales increase due to accelerated efforts at DynaEnergetics, DMC’s oilfield products business, to address rapidly growing demand for its well perforating technologies.\nFourth quarter gross margin was 33% versus 33% in the third quarter and 25% in the year-ago fourth quarter. The results exceeded management’s 30% gross margin forecast primarily due to improved pricing and a more profitable product mix.\nDMC recorded a $3.8 million fourth-quarter restructuring charge, which relates to the previously announced consolidation of European manufacturing facilities at NobelClad, DMC’s explosion welding business. Including the charge, fourth quarter operating income was $513,000 versus an operating loss of $1.9 million in last year’s fourth quarter. Excluding the charge, adjusted operating income was $4.3 million.\nNet loss was $2.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $2.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the year-ago fourth quarter. The 2017 fourth quarter included an income tax provision of $1.6 million, $946,000 of which was a transition tax related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding restructuring charges, fourth quarter adjusted net income* (non-GAAP measure) was $1.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $7.7 million versus $8.6 million in the 2017 third quarter and $1.5 million in last year’s fourth quarter.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2017, was $18.0 million and the Company’s debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 0.8. Net debt* (lines of credit less cash and cash equivalents) was $9.0 million versus $13.1 million at the end of the 2017 third quarter and $9.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nDynaEnergetics\nFourth quarter sales at DynaEnergetics were a quarterly record $37.1 million, up 5% sequentially and a 115% increase versus last year’s fourth quarter. Gross margin was 38%, up from 27% in last year’s fourth quarter. Operating income was $6.6 million versus an operating loss of $2.4 million in the year-ago fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.3 million versus negative EBITDA of $702,000 in the 2016 fourth quarter.\nNobelClad\nNobelClad reported fourth-quarter sales of $17.4 million, up 3% sequentially and down 24% versus the 2016 fourth quarter. Gross margin was 22% versus 23% in last year’s fourth quarter. Operating loss was $3.0 million versus operating income of $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted operating income was $777,000. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 million versus $3.5 million in last year’s fourth quarter.\nNobelClad’s trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 1.04. Order backlog was $37.5 million, up 17% from $32.0 million at the end of the third quarter.\nFull-year results\nConsolidated full-year sales were $192.8 million, up 22% from $158.6 million in 2016. Gross margin was 31% versus 25% in the prior year. Operating loss was $12.3 million versus an operating loss of $5.3 million in 2016. Excluding goodwill impairment and restructuring charges, full-year adjusted operating income was $9.6 million.\nNet loss was $18.9 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $6.5 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in 2016. Excluding goodwill impairment and restructuring charges, adjusted net income was $2.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share.\nFull-year adjusted EBITDA was $23.1 million versus $9.0 million in 2016.\nDynaEnergetics\nFull-year sales at DynaEnergetics were a record $121.3 million, up 80% from $67.3 million in the prior year. Gross margin was 36%, up from 29% in 2016. Operating income was $15.5 million versus an operating loss of $5.4 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $22.8 million versus $2.5 million in the previous year.\nNobelClad\nNobelClad reported full-year sales of $71.6 million, down 22% from $91.3 million in 2016. Gross margin was 22% versus 21% in the prior year. Operating loss was $17.4 million versus operating income of $8.9 million in 2016. Excluding restructuring and goodwill impairment charges, 2017 adjusted operating income was $4.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.7 million versus $12.9 million in 2016.\nManagement Commentary\n“The fourth quarter represented a strong finish to a pivotal year at DMC,” said Kevin Longe, president and CEO. “As the recovery in unconventional drilling and completion activity gained momentum, operators and service companies sought technologies that would enable more efficient, reliable and cost effective perforating programs. This fueled very strong demand at DynaEnergetics, particularly for the intrinsically safe DynaSelect™ detonator and Factory-assembled, Performance-assured™ DynaStage™ system. Orders accelerated throughout the year for these advanced products, which now generate the majority of DynaEnergetics’ total sales.\n“DynaEnergetics is working on multiple fronts to address growing customer demand. Two DynaStage assembly lines were added at our Mt. Braddock, Pennsylvania facility during the fourth quarter. A new automated detonator assembly line is scheduled for installation in April in our Troisdorf, Germany plant, and will double the production capacity of our DynaSelect and DynaStage initiators. Steel is being erected on 74,000 square feet of new manufacturing, assembly and administrative space on DynaEnergetics’ manufacturing campus in Blum, Texas, and the new facilities should be operational by the third quarter.\n“While NobelClad’s 2017 sales reflect continued weak capital spending in global industrial infrastructure markets, the business made important progress establishing new commercial uses for explosion-welded plate. Two of the largest orders booked during 2017 were for new clad plate applications. Although the backlogs at most major engineering and construction companies have yet to show improvement, we have seen two consecutive quarters of backlog growth and improved quoting activity at NobelClad, and are optimistic the business will return to year-over-year sales growth in 2018.”\nLonge added, “I am extremely proud of the entire DMC team and the effort put forth during the past year to achieve our strategic objectives. As we embark on 2018, I am confident DMC is well positioned for another year of strong financial growth and operational success.”\nGuidance\nMichael Kuta, CFO, said first quarter 2018 sales are expected to be in a range of $59 million to $62 million versus the $39.0 million reported in the 2017 first quarter. At the business level, DynaEnergetics is expected to report sales in a range of $43 million to $45 million versus the $22 million reported in last year’s first quarter, while NobelClad’s sales are expected in a range of $16 million to $17 million versus the $16.9 million reported in last year’s first quarter. Gross margin is expected to be 30% to 31% versus the 27% in last year’s first quarter.\nFirst quarter selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense is expected to be approximately $12.5 million versus the $11.7 million reported in the 2017 first quarter, while amortization expense is expected to be approximately $800,000.\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $8.5 million versus $930,000 in last year’s first quarter.\nFor fiscal 2018, consolidated sales are expected in a range of $255 million to $270 million versus the $192.8 million reported in 2017. Sales at DynaEnergetics are expected in a range of $180 million to $190 million versus the $121.3 million reported in 2017, while NobelClad’s sales are expected in a range of $75 million to $80 million versus the $71.6 million in 2017. Full-year gross margin is expected in a range of 31% to 32% versus the 31% reported in 2017.\nKuta said full-year SG&A should be $50 million to $52 million versus the $45.7 million reported in 2017. The anticipated increase is primarily due to capacity expansion initiatives at DynaEnergetics. Full-year amortization expense is expected to be approximately $3.0 million versus the $4.1 million reported in 2017. The decline reflects the full amortization of a portion of DynaEnergetics’ intangible asset balance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $39 million to $43 million, up from 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $23.1 million.\nCompletion of NobelClad’s European consolidation is expected to result in approximately $1.5 million in additional restructuring expense. Full-year interest expense is expected in a range of $2.0 million to $2.25 million.\nCapital expenditures in 2018 are expected to total approximately $30 million, $25 million of which will relate to the capacity expansion at DynaEnergetics.\nKuta said total debt is anticipated to peak at approximately $40 million during 2018, and should then begin to decline after the new capacity at DynaEnergetics comes on line.\nNew Credit Facility\nEarlier today, DMC entered into a $75 million credit agreement with a banking syndicate led by KeyBanc Capital Markets. The credit agreement consists of a $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $25 million capital expenditure facility. The revolving credit facility replaces a prior $35 million revolver. The capital expenditure facility is multi-draw for one year and subsequently converts to a term loan that amortizes at 12.5% per annum over the remaining four-year term. The term loan will be used to fund capacity expansion initiatives at DynaEnergetics. Details of the new facilities are available in DMC’s 2017 Form 10-K, which will be filed today.\nConference call information\nManagement will hold a conference call to discuss these results today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (3:00 p.m. Mountain).

Non-GAAP results are presented only as a supplement to the financial statements based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the reader's understanding of DMC’s financial performance, but no non-GAAP measure should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided within the schedules attached to this release.\nEBITDA is defined as net income plus or minus net interest plus taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from EBITDA stock-based compensation, restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance (as further described in the attached financial schedules). Adjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) plus restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance. Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) plus restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share is defined as diluted earnings (loss) per share plus restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC’s operating performance. Net debt is defined as lines of credit less cash and cash equivalents. None of these non-GAAP financial measures are recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or any other GAAP measure.\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA in its operational and financial decision-making, believing that it is useful to eliminate certain items in order to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance. As a result, internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews feature adjusted EBITDA measures. Management believes that investors may find this non-GAAP financial measure useful for similar reasons, although investors are cautioned that non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP disclosures. In addition, management incentive awards are based, in part, on the amount of adjusted EBITDA achieved during relevant periods. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are also used by research analysts, investment bankers and lenders to assess operating performance. For example, a measure similar to adjusted EBITDA is required by the lenders under DMC’s credit facility.\nNet debt is used by management to supplement GAAP financial information and evaluate DMC’s performance, and management believes this information may be similarly useful to investors. Adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share are presented because management believes these measures are useful to understand the effects of restructuring and impairment charges on DMC’s operating income (loss), net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share, respectively.\nBecause not all companies use identical calculations, DMC’s presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the company’s performance against its peer companies because management believes the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures. For example, a company with greater GAAP net income may not be as appealing to investors if its net income is more heavily comprised of gains on asset sales. Likewise, eliminating the effects of interest income and expense moderates the impact of a company's capital structure on its performance.\nAll of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are either (i) non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization of purchased intangibles and stock-based compensation) or (ii) items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing DMC’s operating performance (e.g., income taxes, restructuring and impairment charges). In the case of the non-cash items, management believes that investors can better assess the company’s operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because, unlike cash expenses, these adjustments do not affect DMC's ability to generate free cash flow or invest in its business. For example, by adjusting for depreciation and amortization in computing EBITDA, users can compare operating performance without regard to different accounting determinations such as useful life. In the case of the other items, management believes that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance.\nAbout DMC\nBased in Boulder, Colorado, DMC operates in two sectors: industrial infrastructure and oilfield products and services.
