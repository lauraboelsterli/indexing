The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities has approved the merger of Foundation Bank into First Commonwealth and the bank merger.

Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, Foundation Bank operates five full service banking offices with convenient locations in Woodlawn, Norwood, Hyde Park, Milford and downtown Cincinnati.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this release which are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, certain plans, expectations, goals, projections and benefits relating to the merger transaction between First Commonwealth Financial Corporation and Garfield Acquisition Corp. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and often include words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate\" or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs such as \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could\" or \"may.\" Such statements are based on assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to factors previously disclosed in reports filed by First Commonwealth with the Securities and Exchange Commission, risks and uncertainties relating to the merger transaction and the integration of Foundation Bank into First Commonwealth after the merger include, but are not limited to: the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the risk that integration of Foundation Bank’s operations with those of First Commonwealth will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected; the inability to close the merger in a timely manner; diversion of management's attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the merger, including receipt of required regulatory and other approvals; the failure of the proposed merger to close for any other reason; the challenges of integrating and retaining key employees; the effect of the announcement of the merger on First Commonwealth’s, Foundation Bank’s or the combined company's respective customer relationships and operating results; the possibility that the merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; and general competitive, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations. All forward-looking statements included in this filing are made as of the date hereof and are based on information available at the time of the filing. Except as required by law, First Commonwealth assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nContact:\nMedia Relations\nAmy Jeffords\nAssistant Vice President / Communications and Community Relations\nPhone: 724-463-6806\nE-mail: AJeffords@fcbanking.com\nInvestor Relations\nRyan M.
