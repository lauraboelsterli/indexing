    "text": "DOWNERS GROVE, Ill., FTD Companies, Inc. (Nasdaq:FTD) (“FTD” or the “Company”), a premier floral and gifting company, today announced that it will delay the release of its fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results.\nBased on the Company’s year-to-date results of operations and outlook for 2018 as it works to implement its strategic plan announced in January 2018, as previously announced in a press release on March 7, 2018, FTD remains in discussion with its lenders and Liberty Interactive Corporation (“Liberty”), its largest stockholder, regarding modifications to FTD’s credit agreement and other financing transactions in order to assist the Company to be able to comply with the financial covenants under the credit agreement. These potential solutions involve a possible commitment from Liberty to provide the Company with a $50 million senior subordinated loan. The Company would use the proceeds of this loan to repay a portion of its outstanding debt under the credit agreement. Discussions with the Company’s lenders and Liberty are ongoing and no agreement has been reached regarding any financing transaction or other modification to the credit agreement. The Company cannot give any assurance that these discussions will be successful.\nDue to the time and attention required as the Company pursues the financing initiatives described above, and the corresponding potential impact of the financial covenant issues on the Company’s financial statements and its consequent impact on the Company’s compliance with the terms and covenants of its credit agreement, the Company has experienced a delay in the timely filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “Form 10-K”) and is filing a notification of late filing on Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to obtain an automatic 15-day extension of the filing deadline for the Form 10-K. The Company expects to file the Form 10-K within the time period prescribed in Rule 12b-25 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe Company is working diligently on this matter and will, as soon as practicable, make a further announcement regarding the timing of the release of its complete audited financial results and a conference call for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The Company continues to expect its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 to be in-line with its preliminary financial results previously released on March 7, 2018.\nAbout FTD Companies, Inc.\nFTD Companies, Inc. is a premier floral and gifting company.
