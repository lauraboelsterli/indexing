    "text": " 22 p.m. ET Share \nFormer adult-movie star seeks to get out of NDA Getty Images Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, wants to tell her story. \nBy Michael Rothfeld Joe Palazzolo \nThe former adult-movie star who accepted $130,000 from President Donald Trump’s lawyer would return the money in exchange for being released from a contract barring her from discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, according to a letter from her attorney. \nThe letter Monday to Trump attorney Michael Cohen said Stephanie Clifford, the former actress, would pay Trump the money by Friday if he and Cohen agree to end the contract, halt an arbitration proceeding against her and allow Clifford to speak “openly and freely about her prior relationship with the President and attempts to silence her.” \nCohen and his attorney, Lawrence S. Rosen, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter from the lawyer for Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels. \nPreviously, the White House has denied any sexual relationship between Trump and Clifford and refused to answer questions about the nondisclosure agreement.",
