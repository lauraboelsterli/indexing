ET\nBRAINTREE, Mass., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Altra Industrial Motion Corp. (NASDAQ:AIMC), a global manufacturer and marketer of electromechanical power transmission and motion control products announced today that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a definitive agreement to combine Altra with four operating companies from Fortive’s Automation and Specialty platform (“Fortive A&S”) in a transaction, having an estimated aggregate value of approximately $3.0 billion, based on the 20-day volume weighted average stock price of Altra shares as of March 6, 2018. The transaction is expected to be tax free to the companies’ respective shareholders.\nFortive A&S includes the market leading brands of Kollmorgen, Thomson, Portescap, and Jacobs Vehicle Systems. Fortive A&S, excluding the Hengstler and Dynapar assets, generated approximately $907 million in revenue and $220 million in adj. unaudited EBITDA (approximately 24% margins) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of this transaction, Altra will significantly expand its position across the technology spectrum by bringing together its strong mechanical and electronic capabilities in engineered power transmission, such as couplings, clutches and brakes and gearing with Fortive A&S’s strong electric, electronic and software content in precision motion control, including engineered servo-motors, direct drive and linear automation. Altra will have increased exposure to higher growth, higher margin categories as well as the scale and global reach to better serve its customers. It will also have an enhanced financial profile, with sales and earnings growth expected to generate substantial free cash flow enabling the company to quickly de-lever.\n“This combination creates a focused global leader in the power transmission and motion control industry and is an important next step in our strategy to accelerate growth and build value,” said Carl Christenson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Altra. “With Fortive A&S, we gain exposure to industries with attractive secular growth dynamics, including the medical, robotics, factory automation and food and beverage industries. We believe that our significantly expanded position across the technology continuum will uniquely position us to drive innovation and better serve our customers across all markets. We look forward to combining the strengths of our businesses and capitalizing on the opportunities inherent in this transaction to deliver enhanced value to shareholders.”\nFortive’s President and CEO, Jim Lico, said, “We are excited about this powerful and unique opportunity to combine our highly complementary businesses in a transaction that will benefit all Fortive and Altra shareholders, customers and employees. This combination of powerful brands and remarkable people creates an organization well-positioned to capture robust Industry 4.0 growth opportunities.”\nPat Murphy, Senior Vice President of Fortive A&S and Sensing Technologies divisions, said, “We have great respect for Carl Christenson and the Altra team and their commitment to innovation and continuous improvement. This business combination broadens the new company’s portfolio of products, increases its global footprint and creates significant scale to better serve and grow with customers.”\nStrategic and Financial Benefits\nCreates a leading power transmission and motion control company: The combination of Altra and Fortive A&S creates a focused leader in power transmission and motion control with combined revenue of approximately $1.8 billion, and a portfolio of market leading brands including Boston Gear, Stromag, Bauer Gear Motor, Warner Electric, Kollmorgen, Thomson, Portescap and Jacobs Vehicle Systems. The result is a truly global business with approximately 52 manufacturing facilities, over 25 engineering/service centers and approximately 9,300 employees worldwide.\nExpands portfolio of capabilities across the technological spectrum: The combined company expands its presence across the technological spectrum into highly attractive areas, from electromechanical capabilities to precision motion control. Adding engineered servo, direct drive and specialty miniature motor technology along with precision linear automation products and capabilities to Altra’s leading power transmission line-up will enable the combined company to provide a broader suite of solutions to a larger customer base. Including Jacobs Vehicle Systems’ engine braking products with Altra’s already strong clutch brake offering will expand the addressable market and provide a unique portfolio of braking technologies.\nIncreases exposure to end markets with attractive secular trends: The combined company will maintain broad market coverage, with increased position in higher-growth verticals such as medical, material handling and robotics. The combination also results in reduced exposure to more cyclical end-markets such as mining, renewable energy and oil & gas.\nBenefits from a best in class Business System: Fortive A&S employees will bring with them deep experience and knowledge of the Fortive Business System tools to drive continuous improvement in lean manufacturing, leadership and growth to enhance Altra’s ability to achieve its aggressive strategic objectives.\nEstablishes attractive financial profile with significant cash flow generation: The transaction will double Altra’s revenue to approximately $1.8 billion and increase its EBITDA to approximately $350 million (before synergies), or 20% margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The combined company is expected to generate cumulative five-year free cash flows in excess of $1 billion. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share i .\nDelivers achievable cost savings to drive synergies: Altra has a proven track record of acquiring and integrating businesses. The combined company will benefit from enhanced strategic flexibility and scale, with compelling opportunities to leverage cost synergies through application of Fortive A&S’s supply chain expertise and Altra’s Operational Excellence Program. The transaction is expected to generate annual cost synergies of $46 million by year four. The combined company will also have the opportunity to expand existing products manufactured by Altra and Fortive A&S into additional geographies and markets, which has the potential to generate revenue synergies resulting in $6 million of additional annual EBITDA by year four.\nManagement, Board of Directors and Headquarters\nUpon close of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Altra’s current Chairman and CEO, Carl Christenson, and Christian Storch will remain CFO. Altra’s senior management team will be expanded to include both Altra and Fortive A&S employees.\nAltra will increase the size of its Board with the addition of one board member designated by Fortive.\nAltra will remain headquartered in Braintree, Massachusetts. Following completion of the transaction, the combined company is expected to have approximately 9,300 employees worldwide, with approximately 4,600 coming from Altra and 4,700 joining from Fortive A&S.\nTransaction Terms and Financing\nTotal consideration to Fortive and its shareholders is approximately $3.0 billion, including $1.4 billion of cash proceeds and debt reduction for Fortive and $1.6 billion in newly issued Altra common stock to Fortive’s shareholders based on the 20-day volume weighted average stock price of Altra shares as of March 6, 2018.\nA portion of the transaction combining Altra with Fortive A&S is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust, in which:\nFortive will contribute a portion of Fortive A&S to a newly created wholly owned subsidiary of Fortive (“Spinco”); Fortive will distribute the equity interests in Spinco to Fortive shareholders in either a split-off or spin-off transaction; and Spinco will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of Altra, as a result of which Spinco will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Altra and Spinco shareholders will receive 35 million shares of Altra common stock.\nIf Fortive elects a spin-off, all Fortive shareholders will participate pro-rata. If Fortive elects a split-off, Fortive shareholders will have the opportunity to exchange their Fortive shares for shares of Spinco. Fortive will determine which approach it will take prior to closing the transaction.\nUpon closing, current Altra shareholders will own approximately 29.4 million shares or 46 percent of the combined company. Approximately 64.4 million of diluted Altra shares are expected to be outstanding upon closing, with Fortive shareholders owning 35.0 million shares or 54 percent of the combined company.\nAltra intends to finance the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and new debt, and has received approximately $2.0 billion of committed financing from Goldman Sachs Bank USA subject to customary terms and conditions to facilitate the transaction close. Upon completion of the transaction, Altra is expected to have net debt of approximately $1.7 billion, or net debt/EBITDA of ~4.3x. Altra intends to prioritize debt pay down until leverage metrics return to the 2.0-3.0x net debt/EBITDA range while maintaining its current dividend policy.\nClear Roadmap to Completion\nThe transaction is expected to close by end of the year, subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Altra shareholders, IRS tax ruling and applicable tax opinions, and regulatory approvals.\nAdvisors\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC served as financial advisor to Altra and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP served as legal counsel to Altra. KeyBanc Capital Markets provided a fairness opinion to the Altra Board of Directors.\nConference Call\nThe two companies will host a joint conference call today at 8:30 A.M.
