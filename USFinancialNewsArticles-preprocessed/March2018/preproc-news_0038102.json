REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo “We are trying to find a solution that will be an expression of a good wage for good work and will be balanced for the company. We have negotiation next week, I hope we will reach an agreement,” Wojnar told Reuters. He said wage talks were separate from discussions on a new shift system aimed at raising production, and which is opposed by unions. Union chief Jaroslav Povsik said earlier that the unions could call a strike in May if no deal is agreed. He said unions wanted a double-digit pay hike this year.
