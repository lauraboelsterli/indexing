Brett Wilhelm‚ÄîNCAA Photos via Getty Images By Christina Austin 8:34 PM EDT \nMarch Madness is (sadly) coming to a close, with the Final Four games of 2018 scheduled for this Saturday, March 31. Loyola-Chicago, an 11 seed, and the University of Michigan, a three seed, will face off in a Cinderella match-up for the ages . The double one-seed battle between the University of Kansas and Villanova is perhaps less surprising. The winners of each of those games will appear in the final championship game on Monday, Apr. 2. \nThanks to the surprise factor of Loyola-Chicago, along with the team‚Äôs lovable 98-year-old chaplain Sister Jean, the school‚Äôs fans have come out in droves to show their support during March Madness. Loyola-Chicago fans make up 9% of ticket sales for the March Madness semi-finals, according to ticket agent StubHub. \"This is the most fun I've had in my life.‚Äù‚ÄîSister Jean in front of a packed room at her NCAA Tournament press conference. üôå #OnwardLU üê∫üèÄ #MarchMadness #FinalFour pic.twitter.com/FdMuONRygm \n‚Äî Loyola Chicago (@LoyolaChicago) March 30, 2018 \nSan Antonio will also be full of Michigan fans, who represent 5% of championship game attendees this year, according to StubHub. Overall, 41% of those buying tickets are from the host state Texas. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great day to be a Michigan Wolverine!‚Äù ‚Äì @JohnBeilein #GoBlue | #FinalFour pic.twitter.com/u5JVUxwXkX \n‚Äî Michigan Men's Basketball (@umichbball) March 30, 2018 \nWhile Loyola-Chicago fans have shown their support in person, Kansas fans are taking over Facebook and Instagram. They lead the other March Madness teams in terms of engagement on the platforms, according to social media analytics firm Sharablee. Loyola-Chicago fans are, however, proudly representing on Twitter. \nStubHub says that March Madness fans can pick up tickets for Final Four for less than in years past, with $175 seats available in the upper baseline, and $464 on average. The championship game is currently $102 for seats in the upper baseline area, and $325 on average (though expect these to go significantly up once the final matchup is decided.) \nSatuday‚Äôs games start at 6:09 p.m. Eastern with the Loyola-Chicago and Michigan match up. You can catch that one on TBS . Kansas and Villanova tip off at 8:49 p.m. Eastern on TBS as well. \n",
