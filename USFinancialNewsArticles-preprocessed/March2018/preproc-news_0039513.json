    "text": "March 21, 2018 / 2:55 AM / Updated an hour ago METALS-London copper edges up from 3-month low on weaker dollar Reuters Staff 4 Min Read BEIJING, March 21 (Reuters) - London copper prices traded higher on Wednesday, on course to end a four-day losing streak, as a weaker dollar provided some respite after the metal hit a three-month low in the previous session following another big increase in inventories. FUNDAMENTALS * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.3 percent to $6,772 a tonne by 0219 GMT, after closing down 1.4 percent on Tuesday and touching $6,730 a tonne, its lowest level since Dec. 14. * INVENTORIES: LME copper stocks MCUSTX-TOTAL grew by a further 3,200 tonnes on Tuesday to 322,475 tonnes, bringing this month's rise to 61 percent. * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was down for a fourth day, falling 0.9 percent to 50,910 yuan ($8,043) a tonne. It touched a low of 50,640 yuan, its lowest since Sept. 25. * USD: The dollar index was down 0.1 percent at 90.30. A weaker dollar makes metals cheaper for holders of other currencies and can support prices. * SHFE ZINC: Zinc was down 1.3 percent in Shanghai to 24,490 yuan a tonne, tracking a 1.8 percent drop in LME zinc on Tuesday. * COPPER: Workers at Antofagasta PLC's Los Pelambres copper mine in Chile have opted to extend a period of government mediation in an effort to reach agreement on a new labor contract, an industry group said on Tuesday. * DRC: Democratic Republic of Congo said on Tuesday it would open negotiations with mining companies on Wednesday about implementing a new mining code that hikes taxes and royalties. * ALUMINIUM: Global primary aluminium output excluding China dipped to 2.009 million tonnes in February from a revised 2.221 million tonnes in January, International Aluminium Institute (IAI) data showed on Tuesday. * TARIFFS: The United Arab Emirates is asking Washington to exempt it from new U.S. tariffs on aluminium and steel and believes it has a strong case, a senior government official said on Tuesday. * LITHIUM: A global battle for lithium has landed in the office of a tiny Chilean regulator, which may decide a winner as it reviews a petition to block Chinese firms from buying a stake in top producer SQM.
