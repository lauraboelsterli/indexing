    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Graphite Energy Corp. (CSE:GRE) (OTC:GRXXF) (FWB:G0A) (“ Graphite Energy ” or the “ Company ”) is pleased to announce that the Company has signed a non-binding letter of intent (the “ LOI ”) for an option to acquire 100% of the Bouthillier Graphite Property (the “ Bouthillier Property ”) located in the Province of Quebec from an arm’s length vendor, Mr. Luc Lamarche (the “ Vendor ”). The Bouthillier Property consists of 14 mining claims, totaling 830.1 hectares or 8.3 square kilometres, located 20 km east of the Village Maniwaki, Quebec, Canada, and only 8.7 km northwest of the Timcal Graphite Mine and Graphite Energy’s current property, the Lac Aux Bouleaux Property.\nIn order to exercise the option to acquire a 100% interest in the Bouthillier Property (the “ Option ”), the Company must complete cash payments, share issuances and exploration expenditures over a two-year period as follows:\nMilestone Cash Payment Share Issuance Exploration Expenditures Signing of a definitive option agreement $30,000 200,000 common shares Nil 1 st anniversary $30,000 150,000 common shares $100,000 2 nd anniversary $30,000 150,000 common shares $150,000 Total: $ 90,000 500,000 common shares $ 250,000 Upon the exercise of the Option, the Vendor will be granted a 3% net smelter returns royalty, of which 50% may be repurchased by the Company at any time for $1,000,000.\nThe LOI is non-binding, and subject to certain conditions precedent, including board approval, the completion of due diligence, and the execution of a definitive option agreement. The Vendor has agreed to a binding 60-day exclusivity period during which due diligence will be completed and the definitive option agreement will be settled.\nGeologically, the rocks on the Bouthillier Property are mainly composed of migmatites. Historical information available from Energie et Ressources naturelles Quebec website: https://www.mern.gouv.qc.ca indicates that in 1990 the company Exploration Graphicor Inc. performed exploration work such as line cutting, multifrequency-multicoil separation Maxmin II, Beepmat, survey, and ground prospecting (Source: Exploration reports GM051081, GM051082, and GM67859).\nTwo zones were stripped and sampled during that work with 19 samples assayed from 1.9 to 16.22% graphite carbon (“Cg\") content with the best results as follows:\nZone 1: 13.95% and 16.22% Cg Zone 2: 6.11% Cg\nStripping and trenching were followed by reconnaissance diamond drilling with 11 holes to a depth of 50 m or less to test potential graphitic horizons. Available assay results from the 11 holes drilled to probe suspected graphitic horizons were encouraging.\nThe best results were 10.26% Cg over 2.77 metres and 7.71% over 3.23 metres.\nThe foregoing exploration results are historical in nature, and have not been verified by a qualified person (as defined in National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ). The Company does not have access to any information on the quality assurance / quality control programs, if any, associated with the foregoing exploration results, and, therefore, the foregoing exploration results should not be relied upon.\nAfzaal Pirzada, CEO of Graphite Energy, stated that, “We are very pleased for this potential acquisition located near our existing LAB graphite property. The Company will try to complete its due diligence process as soon as possible to sign a definitive agreement. The new option, if completed, will give the Company more prospective ground for further exploration.”\nThe technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Afzaal Pirzada, P.Geo., a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101, of Geomap Exploration Inc. Mr. Pirzada is a member of Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia and holds a restricted permit for the Order of Geologists of Quebec (OGQ). He also serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\nAbout Graphite Energy Corp.\nGraphite Energy Corp. is a Canadian-based issuer listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange. It is currently engaged in the business of exploration of mineral properties in Canada and holds the right to acquire a 100% interest, subject to certain royalties, in and to the Lac Aux Bouleaux Graphite Property located near the town of Mont-Laurier in Southern Quebec.
