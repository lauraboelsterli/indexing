    "text": "AUCKLAND (Reuters) - New Zealand bowled England out for 320 in the final session of the fifth day to record an innings and 49 run win in the day-night first test at Eden Park to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.\nCricket - Test Match - New Zealand v England - Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand, March 26, 2018. England's Stuart Broad dives to make his ground as New Zealand's Neil Wagner tries to field the ball during the fifth day of the first cricket test match. REUTERS/David Gray England had started the final day on 132 for three and while they trailed New Zealandâ€™s first innings by 237 runs, in reality they needed to bat out 96 overs to save the match.\nThe hosts captured three wickets in the first session, just one in the second and three in the third as leg-spinner Todd Asstle and Neil Wagner mopped up the tail in the final session.\nThe second match, a traditional red-ball day game, is at Hagley Oval in Christchurch from March 30-April 3.\nReporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by John O'Brien\n ",
