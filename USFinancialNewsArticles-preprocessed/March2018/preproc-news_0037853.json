    "text": "Russia is behaving like a \"rogue nation,\" former British Prime Minister John Major said Monday.\nSpeaking at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong , Major named Russia as one of the economies whose actions affect the international order. The others he cited were the U.S. , China and the European Union .\nHis comments came in the wake of worsening U.K.-Russia relations. Last week, Britain accused Russia of carrying out a nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent and his daughter on British soil; the Kremlin has denied responsibility.\n\"Russia is behaving like a rogue nation. She cannot be ignored,\" Major said in a speech about the geopolitical forces currently at play.\n\"The British experience suggests Russia will also use murder as a sanction in other countries' territories.\"\nWhat happened in the U.K. is just one example of Russia's attempt to flex its muscles both \"diplomatically and militarily,\" Major said. Moscow has also had a hand in the Syrian civil war, influenced elections overseas and conducted cyberattacks globally, he said.\nAll that happened because Russia, under President Vladimir Putin , wants to show that the country still matters on the international stage, Major said.\n\"The root cause, it seems to me, is clear: Russia was once, as the Soviet Union, a super power, but it is no more. To compensate, Putin wishes his people to see their president standing up to the economic and political super powers of the world.\"",
