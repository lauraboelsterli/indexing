The company’s decision led to a firestorm of protest from politicians, who are facing national municipal elections next week, as well as reports of customers closing their accounts in protest. Chairman Jeroen van der Veer acknowledged the bank had“underestimated the public response” to the idea. (Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)",
