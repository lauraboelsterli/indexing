    "text": "PARIS, March 7 (Reuters) - France’s Canal+ media group, part of Vivendi, will resume later on Wednesday broadcasts of channels owned by TF1 at the request of the regulator, the group said.\nCanal+ had suspended broadcasts last week saying that Groupe TF1 was imposing “unreasonable” fees on distributors to transmit TF1’s free programmes.\nTF1, part of Bouygues, is also engaged in a legal tussle with Orange over a similar fee dispute.
