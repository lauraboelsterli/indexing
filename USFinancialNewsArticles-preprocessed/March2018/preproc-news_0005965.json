(Nasdaq:EDGE), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel hospital-based therapies for the management of acute, life-threatening conditions, today announced financial results and corporate highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\n“In 2017, Edge Therapeutics achieved meaningful progress as we continued to develop and seek to commercialize EG-1962 to address the unmet need of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH),” said Brian A. Leuthner, Edge’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our Phase 3 NEWTON 2 study of EG-1962 is proceeding on track to the interim analysis after completion in December 2017 of the pre-planned futility analysis. In preparation for potential commercialization of EG-1962, we secured a commercial supply agreement with an external manufacturer for EG-1962. In addition, as part of our pre-commercial planning, we continue to gain a better understanding regarding health economic outcomes and the tremendous economic burden of aSAH.”\nLeuthner continued, “Looking ahead, we are operationally and financially well-positioned to execute our corporate growth strategy, in particular, continuing to advance EG-1962 through achievement of key additional clinical milestones including the NEWTON 2 interim analysis by the end of April, and if the study continues to full enrollment as planned, top-line results from the full NEWTON 2 study in late 2018. In 2018, we are also focused on expanding our pipeline by conducting additional preclinical development in order to select the next PRECISA TM -based development candidate, as well as pursuing external business development opportunities to acquire additional products for our development portfolio.”\n2017 Key Achievements\nCompleted the EG-1962 Phase 3 NEWTON 2 Futility Analysis; Study Continues as Planned. In December 2017, Edge announced that an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that the Phase 3 NEWTON 2 study of EG-1962 continue as planned based on the completion of a pre-planned futility analysis. The DMC made this recommendation after evaluating data from the Day 90 follow-up visit of the first 150 patients randomized and treated, as well as the available safety data in the study. Presented Health Economic Data at the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) 15th Annual Meeting. Edge presented new retrospective, claims-based health economic data showing aSAH per patient hospital charges represent a high economic burden for U.S. hospitals, and ultimately to government and commercial insurers. The analysis also showed that the aSAH patient population currently being studied in the NEWTON 2 study had the highest per patient hospital charges and experienced the longest hospitalizations among all aSAH patients. Specifically, these are patients who require an external ventricular drain (EVD), and undergo either neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling for repair of their aneurysm. Received Pediatric Investigation Plan Waiver from the European Medicines Agency. Edge received from the European Medicines Agency a product-specific pediatric waiver for EG-1962 across all subsets of the pediatric population, which removes the requirement for pediatric clinical studies to support a marketing authorization application for EG-1962 in Europe. Secured a Commercial Supply Manufacturer for EG-1962. Edge signed a supply agreement with Oakwood Laboratories for the commercial manufacture of EG-1962 for initial product launch and thereafter. Continued to expand and strengthen the organizational infrastructure and leadership team. Edge appointed experienced executives in regulatory affairs and finance, and added to its Board of Directors.\nFinancial Results\nCash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017 were $88.1 million, compared with $106.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $40.7 million for the year.\nResearch & Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $10.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $34.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $6.8 million and $24.8 million in the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to an increase in external expenses related to EG-1962 clinical development, EG-1964 formulation development, and personnel-related costs for the NEWTON 2 study.\nGeneral & Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $17.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.2 million and $14.7 million in the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in G&A expense was largely due to increases in personnel-related costs, investor relations costs, stock-based compensation expenses, and legal and professional fees.\nNet Loss: Net loss was $13.9 million for the fourth quarter and $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net loss of $9.5 million and $38.8 million for the comparable periods of 2016.\nConference Call Details\nEdge will host a conference call and webcast today, Thursday, March 1, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.
