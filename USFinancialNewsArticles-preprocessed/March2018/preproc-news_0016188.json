    "text": "March 8, 2018 / 2:29 AM / Updated 32 minutes ago Boeing air tanker delivery likely delayed again - U.S. Air Force Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force said the first delivery of KC-46 aerial refuelling tankers from Boeing Co, scheduled for the second quarter of 2018, would more likely occur late in the year.

Christopher Okula/ U.S. Air Force/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo “This assessment is based on known risks and predicted impacts associated with airworthiness certifications and slower than expected flight test execution,” the Air Force said in a statement on Tuesday. The potential delays will not result in additional programme cost to the taxpayer, the statement said. Boeing previously missed a forecast that the aircraft would be delivered last year. In a statement on Wednesday, Boeing said: “There is always risk on any development program, we’re relying on our partnership with the Air Force to help mitigate those risks, complete KC-46 testing and deliver 18 game-changing tankers to them as quickly as possible.” The world’s biggest maker of jetliners said it had discussed a range of delivery dates with the Air Force. In the third quarter of 2017, the company took a $329 million (236.7 million pounds) charge for its KC-46 aerial refuelling tanker programme. Charges related to the programme have reduced profit by $1.9 billion after tax. Boeing expects to build a substantial business from the tanker, which is based on its twin-aisle 767 commercial jet. Boeing plans to deliver 179 tankers to the U.S. Air Force and expects to sell about 400 in total worldwide.
