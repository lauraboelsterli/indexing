    "text": "MONTREAL, March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dorel Industries Inc. (TSX:DII.B) (TSX:DII.A) today announced that it has filed its audited consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) for the year ended December 30, 2017 with the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities. These consolidated financial statements differ from the year-end financial results issued on March 8, 2018, as outlined below, due to the evolving situation with Toys“R”Us.\nOn March 15, 2018, Toys“R”Us, one of Dorel’s customers, announced that it had filed a motion seeking Bankruptcy Court approval to begin the process of conducting an orderly wind-down of its U.S. business and liquidation of inventory in all of its U.S. stores. Dorel assessed whether an additional impairment loss on the trade accounts receivable from this customer should be recorded in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017. Dorel has determined that an amount of US$7.6 million of trade accounts receivable from this customer as at December 30, 2017 is at risk of collection. Accordingly, Dorel has recorded a bad debt expense of US$3.8 million within general and administrative expenses in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017 with respect to these trade accounts receivable from Toys“R”Us U.S., of which US$0.7 million is within Dorel Juvenile and US$3.1 million is within Dorel Sports. This amount represents Management’s current best estimate of potential losses arising from non-payment based on limited information available to date; the actual loss incurred may differ from this amount. The maximum credit risk to which Dorel is exposed as at December 30, 2017 represents the total value of the trade accounts receivable.\nRevenue recorded from sales to Toys“R”Us U.S. business in Dorel’s 2018 first quarter, up to March 21, 2018, amounts to US$13.4 million. As at March 21, 2018, in total, Dorel has trade accounts receivable from Toys“R”Us U.S. amounting to US$17.2 million (net of allowance for anticipated credits and allowance for doubtful accounts including the bad debt expense referred to above but excluding any bad debt allowance on 2018 sales). This represents US$2.8 million within Dorel Home, US$5.2 million within Dorel Juvenile and US$9.2 million within Dorel Sports.\nDorel will continue to carefully monitor the Toys“R”Us situation as it unfolds, and will revise its estimated bad debt allowance for the 2017 sales and record any required allowance for the 2018 sales accordingly in Dorel’s 2018 first quarter consolidated financial statements, which Dorel expects to issue on May 4, 2018.\nAs a result of this adjusting event, Dorel is issuing revised financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 30, 2017 revised from those included in its press release issued on March 8, 2018. This represents a reduction of US$3.1 million in net income for both the fourth quarter and year ended December 30, 2017. Accordingly, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$17.3 million or US$0.53 per diluted share compared to US$7.7 million or US$0.24 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Reported net loss for the quarter was US$6.1 million or US$0.19 per diluted share compared to US$5.6 million or US$0.17 per diluted share a year ago.\nAdjusted net income for the year rose 14.9% to US$67.0 million or US$2.05 per diluted share, compared to US$58.3 million or US$1.79 per diluted share in 2016. Reported net income for the year was US$27.4 million or US$0.84 per diluted share, compared to a reported net loss of US$11.6 million or US$0.36 per diluted share the previous year.\nIn 2017, Toys“R”Us U.S. business accounted for approximately 3% of Dorel’s total revenue.\nThe consolidated financial statements and MD&A for the year ended December 30, 2017 are available on the Company’s website, www.dorel.com , and under Dorel’s profile on the SEDAR website, www.sedar.com . In addition, this press release contains the updated tables to indicate changes in certain Company metrics.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nAs a result of impairment losses, restructuring and other costs, remeasurement of forward purchase agreement liabilities and loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt incurred in 2017 and 2016, the Company is including in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: “adjusted net income” and “adjusted earnings per diluted share”. The Company believes that this results in a more meaningful comparison of its core business performance between the periods presented. These non-GAAP financial measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Please refer to the Company’s MD&A for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nProfile\nDorel Industries Inc. (TSX:DII.B) (TSX:DII.A) is a global organization, operating three distinct businesses in juvenile products, bicycles and home products. Dorel's strength lies in the diversity, innovation and quality of its products as well as the superiority of its brands. Dorel Juvenile’s powerfully branded products include global brands Safety 1 st , Quinny, Maxi-Cosi and Tiny Love, complemented by regional brands such as Cosco, Bébé Confort and Infanti.

Except as may be required by Canadian securities laws, Dorel does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Forward-looking statements, by their very nature, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on several assumptions which give rise to the possibility that actual results could differ materially from Dorel’s expectations expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements and that the objectives, plans, strategic priorities and business outlook may not be achieved. As a result, Dorel cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will materialize, or if any of them do, what benefits Dorel will derive from them. Forward-looking statements are provided in this press release for the purpose of giving information about Management’s current expectations and plans and allowing investors and others to get a better understanding of Dorel’s operating environment. However, readers are cautioned that it may not be appropriate to use such forward-looking statements for any other purpose.\nForward-looking statements made in this press release are based on a number of assumptions that Dorel believed were reasonable on the day it made the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Dorel’s expectations expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements include: general economic conditions; changes in product costs and supply channels; foreign currency fluctuations; customer and credit risk, including the risk resulting from the liquidation and reorganization of Toys“R”Us referred to in this press release and the concentration of revenues with small number of customers; costs associated with product liability; changes in income tax legislation or the interpretation or application of those rules; the continued ability to develop products and support brand names; changes in the regulatory environment; continued access to capital resources and the related costs of borrowing; changes in assumptions in the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets; and there being no certainty that Dorel’s current dividend policy will be maintained. These and other risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements are discussed in Dorel’s annual Management Discussion and Analysis and Annual Information Form filed with the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The risk factors outlined in the previously-mentioned documents are specifically incorporated herein by reference.\nDorel cautions readers that the risks described above are not the only ones that could impact it. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to Dorel or that Dorel currently deems to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on Dorel’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.\nDOREL INDUSTRIES INC.
