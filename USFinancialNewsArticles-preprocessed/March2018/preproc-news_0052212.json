    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 3:27 PM / Updated 21 minutes ago FACTBOX-Cricket-How the world reacted to bans for Australian   \n  Reaction after Cricket Australia (CA) banned sacked   vice-captain David Warner for 12 months and opening batsman Cameron Bancroft for nine months for their roles in the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town. \nMICHAEL VAUGHAN, former England captain \n“Steve Smith I think is a good guy who made a huge mistake. He needed punishing but I think this is too harsh. Bancroft who I don’t know was led astray but deserved punishing but again too harshly IMO (in my opinion). The other guy I really don’t care about.” \nTOM MOODY, former Australia all-rounder \n“What happened in South Africa is incredibly sad on so many levels but what appears clear in my view is the punishment certainly doesn’t fit the crime.” \nHARSHA BHOGLE, cricket commentator \n“I honestly do not believe any other country would have handed its captain and lead player a 12 month ban for attempted ball-tampering.” \nSHANE WARNE, former Australia spinner \n“We are all so hurt and angry and maybe we weren’t so sure how to react. We’d just never seen it before. But the jump to hysteria is something that has elevated the offence beyond what they actually did, and maybe we’re at a point where the punishment just might not fit the crime.” \nJOHN HOLDER, former test match umpire \n“The problem with cricket is this perception that cricket is a gentleman’s game. Cricket is not a gentleman’s game... as you get more and more money in cricket the pressure to win big money increases. Cricket now is about winning and players will cheat... do whatever they can get away with.” \nSANJAY MANJREKAR, former India batsman \n“As expected, CA have been very strict in their punishment to the offending players. The major take away from this is how critical your track record is.” \nMOHAMMAD KAIF, former India batsman \n“So with the one year ban on Smith and Warner and also a two year captaincy ban on both, think India will be favourites when they tour Australia later this year. Wonder, who will captain Australia at the World Cup. Aaron Finch?” (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru  ",
