    "text": "CLEVELAND, March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: FCEA) (\"Forest City\" or the \"Company\") announced today that its Board of Directors concluded its previously announced review of strategic alternatives. After extensive evaluation and deliberation, including review and analysis of multiple offers, the Board has determined that stockholder value would be better enhanced on a standalone basis than by pursuing a transaction on the terms and pricing indicated by the offers received.\nThe Board has issued a letter to stockholders in connection with the conclusion of its review. The full text of the letter follows:\nDear Stockholders of Forest City Realty Trust, Inc.:\nWe are writing to report on the conclusion of the Board's strategic review process and on governance changes we have agreed to going forward.\nThe Board of Directors announced a review of the Company's strategic, operating, financial and structural options to enhance stockholder value on September 11, 2017. The announcement of this review followed from the governance-enhancing collapse of the dual-class voting structure at the 2017 Annual Meeting and feedback we received from stockholders during our extensive outreach following the 2017 Annual Meeting. In order to execute the strategic review, the Company retained financial advisors led by Lazard together with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. Additionally, the Board established a Transaction Committee constituted by a majority of independent directors to oversee the review process and provide guidance and instruction to management of the Company and the Company's financial advisors between Board meetings.\nThe Company's financial advisors communicated with over 50 potentially interested buyers during the initial stage of the process, and 18 of those parties executed confidentiality agreements and received confidential information about the Company. An initial round of bidding at the end of October 2017 resulted in seven non-binding preliminary indications of interest â€“ five represented all-cash offers to acquire the Company and two contemplated structured, tax-efficient transactions involving a portion of the Company's business. The Board then authorized a second round of bidding with six potentially interested buyers. Second round indications of interest were received beginning in mid-December. Two parties submitted non-binding indications of interest to acquire the Company, two submitted proposals to acquire the Company's development portfolio and one party reaffirmed its interest in pursuing a structured, tax-efficient transaction for a portion of the Company's business. The two full Company acquisition proposals and a structured, tax-efficient portfolio transaction were conditioned on a grant of exclusivity to the potentially interested buyers.\nFollowing a review of each indication of interest and negotiation of the two full Company acquisition proposals, the Board determined to pursue the non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for $26 per share in cash, which was submitted by a large financial investor with a strong track record of executing large, complex real estate and corporate transactions. A majority of the Board viewed the proposal as potentially attractive for stockholders. On this basis, the Company and the financial investor mutually entered into a 45-day exclusivity period during which the financial investor would complete confirmatory diligence and negotiate a fully financed merger agreement at $26 per share in cash with conditions to closing customary for transactions of this type.\nAn extension to the exclusivity period was granted through March 9, 2018 to permit the counterparty to complete its confirmatory diligence. The financial investor submitted a letter on March 7, 2018 (the \"March 7 Proposal\") that it was prepared to make a fully financed, binding proposal to acquire the Company for $24.50 per share in cash subject to: (i) cessation of future dividend payments, (ii) obtaining certain JV partner consents to a change of control prior to signing a definitive agreement, (iii) obtaining certain government consents to a change of control related to Company assets and development projects prior to closing and (iv) the Company completing an internal reorganization prior to closing to facilitate the counterparty's financing plans, which plans were not provided in connection with the March 7 Proposal or thereafter. The Transaction Committee unanimously determined that it would not recommend a transaction on the terms and pricing contemplated by the March 7 Proposal to the Board, and instructed the Company's financial advisors to inform the counterparty in the event it wished to revise its proposal in advance of a Board meeting on March 10. The counterparty did not so revise its proposal, and on March 10, the Board unanimously accepted the recommendation of the Transaction Committee to reject the March 7 Proposal and a majority of the Board authorized the Company's financial advisors to inform the counterparty that the Board would be supportive of a transaction at $25.50 per share in cash with dividends paid through closing, and no conditions with respect to third-party consents or completion of an internal reorganization. The counterparty responded on March 13 (the \"March 13 Proposal\") with a revised price of $25.00 per share in cash subject to: (i) cessation of future dividend payments and (ii) a willingness to review in more detail the projects for which third-party consents might be required for a change of control transaction with the goals of reaching consensus about the relevant projects, developing a more complete understanding of the means and prospects for obtaining consents on a timely basis and developing a mutually agreeable solution to allocating any risk associated with third-party consents. Between March 13 and March 16, the Company, the financial investor, and their respective advisors held a series of diligence calls for the purpose, among others, of confirming whether the financial investor would be prepared to eliminate third-party consents as a condition to signing and closing a transaction. On March 16, the counterparty communicated to our advisors that while the Company had presented reasonable bases to conclude that many of the requested third-party consents were not required, as a commercial matter, it was not willing to eliminate some portion of the previously identified third-party consents as a condition to either signing or closing.\nAfter evaluation and deliberation the Board unanimously decided not to pursue a transaction on the terms and pricing of the March 13 Proposal. The Board concluded that stockholder value would be better enhanced on a standalone basis and that the conditional requirements specified by the counterparty in the March 13 Proposal created more uncertainty around a potential transaction than the Board was prepared to accept.\nHaving completed an extensive strategic review process, the Board remains focused on enhancing value for all stockholders. To this end, we engaged in constructive discussions with certain significant stockholders of the Company to identify a mutually acceptable group of new independent directors to join the Board as part of a substantial refreshment. This refreshment will help improve the Company's corporate governance structure for the benefit of all stockholders and we are confident the new directors will bring substantial industry expertise and new and diverse perspectives for the benefit of our stockholders. We also thank the directors that will not be continuing for their distinguished service and dedication to the Company and the leadership and integrity that has been a hallmark of their tenures.\nThe Board remains committed to pursuing the right course of action for the Company and all stakeholders, and to that end we believe the Company is well positioned to create and sustain stockholder value under the governance of a new group of independent directors. We expect to deliver strong returns to stockholders over time through (i) leveraging the Company's scale in core, high-barrier-to-entry markets, (ii) taking advantage of embedded growth from the development activities and accretive partner buyouts, (iii) continuing to focus on margin enhancement and (iv) returning additional capital to stockholders via dividend growth and share repurchases.\nSincerely,\nJames A. Ratner\nChairman\nScott S. Cowen\nLead Independent Director\nReconstituted Board\nForest City also announced that it has entered into agreements with Starboard Value LP (\"Starboard\"), which currently owns approximately 3.0% of the Company's outstanding shares, Scopia Capital Management LP (\"Scopia\"), which currently owns approximately 8.3% of the Company's outstanding shares, and RMS, Limited Partnership (\"RMS\"), which, prior to the elimination of the Company's dual-class stock structure, was the controlling stockholder of the Company, pursuant to which:\nNine current directors have agreed to resign from the Board; Michelle Felman, Adam S.
