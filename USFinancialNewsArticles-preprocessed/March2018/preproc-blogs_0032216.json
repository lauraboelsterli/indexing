    "text": "3 Hours Ago | 01:08 \nApple is having an event this month to \"hear creative new ideas for teachers and students,\" according to an invitation released to the media Friday. \nThe event will be held at a Chicago high school on March 27 at 10 a.m, according to the invitation, which said \"Let's take a field trip.\" \nAs usual, the invitation was thin on details â€” Apple is notoriously tight-lipped about future products and programs. But while the event would be a departure from past March confabs which are usually held in the Bay Area, it would fall in line with recent initiatives at the tech giant. \nApple has always had strong partnerships with schools and universities, but has expanded in recent years to support coding education programs and education for young women. \nApple's \" Everybody Can Code \" program, focused on mobile apps, recently expanded to 70 colleges and universities in Europe. And the iPhone maker announced a major partnership in January to fund 2014 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai's women's education advocacy . \nThe invitation's script is reminiscent of a past launch. In March 2016 Apple unveiled the new iPad Pro , with Apple Pencil support. The company's iPad devices host Swift Playgrounds, a code education platform. \nTechnology like augmented and virtual reality has already been used in classrooms to expand the traditional \"field trip\" experience for students, and Apple has expressed interest in that area, too. \nLast year, CEO Tim Cook said AR has \"broad mainstream applicability across education, entertainment interactive gaming, enterprise and categories we probably haven't even thought of.\"",
