    "text": "LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - British hedge fund firm Man Group said on Wednesday it had added $12.8 billion in new assets for the financial year ended Dec. 31, bringing its total funds under management to $109.1 billion.\nMan Group said strong client demand for emerging market debt, managed accounts in the fund of funds unit FRM and computer-driven strategies, combined with FX movements and the acquisition of Aaalto, helped assets to rise by 35 percent.\nAdjusted profit before tax was $384 million in 2017.
