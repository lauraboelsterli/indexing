    "text": "Hours after his lead attorney in the Russia probe quit, President Donald Trump said Thursday he still wants to be interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller 's office as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\"Yes, I would like to. I would like to,\" Trump told reporters at the White House after being asked whether he still is interested in testifying for the special counsel.\nEarlier Thursday, John Dowd, the lead lawyer in the probe, quit the president's legal team. \nAmong other things, Dowd reportedly disagreed with Trump over potentially submitting to an interview with Mueller's team. On Tuesday, Dowd pushed back against the notion that the president was on the verge of shaking up his legal team .\nOver the weekend, Dowd called for the special counsel's probe to end , and Trump criticized Mueller by name on Twitter for the first time.\nIn addition to probing Russian meddling in the election, Mueller is investigating whether associates of Trump colluded with Russians during the campaign.\nTrump has repeatedly and angrily denied any such collusion occurred.\nWATCH: Trump's lead lawyer in Mueller probe resigns show chapters Trump lead lawyer in Mueller probe resigns, say reports      2 Hours Ago | 01:53",
