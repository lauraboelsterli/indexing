Ms. Gavant, whose appointment becomes effective on the date after the filing of the Company's 2017 Form 10-K, will lead VCB's financial operations, including internal and external reporting, accounting, asset liability management, investments, planning, and controls.\nMs. Gavant has extensive experience of over 36 years in accounting, taxation, finance, and mergers and acquisitions. She most recently served as Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer of Xenith Bankshares, Inc. (\"Xenith\").
