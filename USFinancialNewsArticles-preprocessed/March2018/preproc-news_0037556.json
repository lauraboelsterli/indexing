REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo “Hamilton” musical creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ben Platt, the Tony-winning star of teen musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” recorded a mashup of two songs from the respective shows called “Found/Tonight.” A portion of the proceeds from the song will support the March for Our Lives initiative aimed at pressuring U.S. lawmakers to tighten laws on gun ownership. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are organising marches in Washington D.C. and elsewhere in the United States on March 24 after 17 students and teachers at their school in Parkland, Florida, were killed in a mass shooting last month. 71st Tony Awards – Arrivals – New York City, U.S., 11/06/2017 - Actor Ben Platt. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/File Photo “It’s so inspiring to see young people standing up for what is probably the most important cause right now in this country, and demanding action,” Platt, 24, said in a statement. “I hope that this song can play some small part in bringing about real change.” Miranda said he was “awestruck by the strength and leadership of the students and their ability to speak truth to power.” The emotional song and a music video combines the “Hamilton” song “Story of Tonight” with “You Will Be Found” from Tony-winning musical “Dear Evan Hansen.” It was among the top five trending items on YouTube on Monday. “I just listened to it and I can’t stop crying I’m gonna listen to this forever holy heck,” Emma Gonzalez, one of the student leaders, said on Twitter. March for Our Lives has also received support and hefty financial donations from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney, director Steven Spielberg and singers Justin Timberlake, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and Demi Lovato.
