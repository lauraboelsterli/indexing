The country plans to float shares in state oil company Engineering for Petroleum and Process Industries (ENPPI) in September, Garhy said. The government owns vast swathes of Egyptâ€™s economy, including three of its largest banks - National Bank of Egypt, Banque Du Caire, the United Bank of Egypt - along with much of its oil industry and real estate sector. ($1 = 17.6000 Egyptian pounds) (Reporting by Ehab Farouk; Writing by Nadine Awadalla; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",
