    "text": "0 COMMENTS Commercial insurance is turning into Land of the Giants—and AXA ’s AXAHY -9.60% investors are right to be nervous.\nThe French insurer is the latest group to bulk up with a $15.3 billion deal to buy XL Group , the U.S.-listed insurer and reinsurer, which itself only recently paid $4 billion for London rival Catlin Group in 2015. \nAXA’s deal announced Monday shows it is keeping pace with the world’s biggest property and casualty insurers—but it is paying an eye-watering price and taking risks with its balance sheet. Investors reacted badly, sending its shares down more than 9%.\nThe industry is under pressure: excess capital has weakened returns especially for reinsurers , while technology changes demand big investments to use data better in setting prices and deal with customers in more direct ways.\nThe need to boost pricing power and spread costs has prompted big deals, such as Ace’s $30 billion takeover of Chubb in 2015 and AIG’s recent $5.6 billion deal for Validus of Bermuda.\nAt AXA, Thomas Buberl, who became CEO in late 2016, has already been pursuing a radical, technology-driven transformation. This deal makes for a revolution.\nLife insurance, which used to dominate the group, is being increasingly left behind. Two transactions, the XL takeover and the planned initial public offering of AXA’s U.S. life business, will change the shape of the company. Life and savings will fall to 18% of group earnings from 33% now; while property and casualty insurance will rise from 39% to 50%.\nIn the U.S. and Europe, life insurance is turning into an expensive form of asset management for companies and customers, which is driving consolidation and specialization there. AXA hopes to get more pricing power and capital benefits from being bigger in property and casualty.\nOne big risk is that AXA’s U.S. life IPO is meant to provide almost half the money for the XL deal. The IPO is due by the end of June, but markets are looking more volatile. AXA has bank financing to fall back on, but using that could trouble its credit rating.\nAXA CEO Thomas Buberl speaks at an event in Paris in February. Photo: pascal rossignol/Reuters AXA said the XL deal wasn’t conditional on the IPO, but the risks mean AXA would probably accept a lower valuation to get it done, according to analysts at CreditSights.\nThen there is the price. AXA will pay $57.60 a share for XL, that is a 33% premium to Friday’s close, but a 54% premium to the price in early February before XL stock jumped on speculation about potential bids. XL stock was depressed, like rivals, after the industry suffered big losses from natural disasters but saw little improvement in pricing.\nAXA is paying 15.4 times XL’s forecast earnings for 2018—the only time it has traded near that level in recent years was when its forecast earnings were rapidly cut last October.\nAXA’s radical transformation makes sense, but it is paying a big price and taking big risks. The speed of change promises investors a white-knuckle ride.\nRelated \nAXA to Buy Insurer XL Group for $15.3 Billion Write to Paul J. Davies at paul.davies@wsj.com",
