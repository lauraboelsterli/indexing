    "text": "74 COMMENTS A former Playboy playmate who says she had an extramarital affair with President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to extricate herself from a contract with the publisher of the National Enquirer that prevented her from telling her story publicly in the months before the 2016 presidential election.\nAmerican Media Inc., run by a Trump friend, agreed in August of that year to pay Karen McDougal $150,000 for her exclusive story of the alleged 2006 affair, which it then didn’t publish, a tactic known in the tabloid world as “catch and kill.” The Wall Street Journal revealed the agreement in a November 2016 story , citing documents reviewed by the newspaper and people familiar with the matter.\nMs. McDougal’s lawsuit, filed against American Media in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges that the publisher and her own lawyer, Keith Davidson, misrepresented the deal as guaranteeing fitness columns under her name and magazine covers that would revive her career. In actuality, says the lawsuit, the fine print of the contract offered no such guarantees.\nThe true aim of the deal was to grant American Media the rights to her story of an affair with Mr. Trump and prevent her from discussing it with news media, the lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit asks a judge to invalidate the contract on grounds that it’s both fraudulent and illegal. The complaint says the agreement amounted to an illegal corporate donation from American Media to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, with the aim of boosting his chances in the 2016 election by helping him keep the alleged affair under wraps.\nMs. McDougal’s complaint follows a lawsuit filed earlier this month by a former adult-film star, Stephanie Clifford, seeking to escape a nondisclosure agreement that prevents her from discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 for signing the deal, the Journal revealed in January.\nThe White House has denied Ms. McDougal’s story of an affair with the president, as well as Ms. Clifford’s. A White House spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nThe Journal previously reported that Mr. Cohen was also in communication with AMI Chief Executive David Pecker and the company’s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, during the course of their negotiations with Ms. McDougal, citing a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Pecker is friends with both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump.\nAn American Media spokesman said Ms. McDougal’s contract gave the company discretion to publish her “life story, and she promised to write health and fitness columns and appear on the cover of two magazines.” He said that American Media has published 20 of her columns and put her on the cover of one of its fitness magazines.\n“Her lawsuit is the first time AMI has learned of her desire to go a different direction,” the spokesman said. “AMI has a valid contract with Karen and we look forward to reaching an amicable resolution satisfactory to her and to AMI.​”​ ​\nAmerican Media has previously denied the campaign-finance allegations. “Neither President Trump, Mr. Cohen, nor any other individual has ever influenced (or will ever influence) coverage at AMI’s publications,” the company said in a statement emailed to the Journal in February.\nThe campaign-finance allegations mirror February complaints filed with the Federal Election Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice by Common Cause, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit group.\n“If AMI won’t let her out of this illegitimate contract we’re going to litigate,” said Peter Stris, Ms. McDougal’s lawyer. “We’re going to litigate and prove there was coordination between American Media, Karen’s own lawyer and Michael Cohen and that this was an illegal contribution that renders the entire agreement void.”\nA spokesman for Mr. Davidson said he couldn’t comment in detail on attorney-client matters. “Mr. Davidson fulfilled his obligations and zealously advocated for Ms. McDougal to accomplish her stated goals at that time,” said the spokesman.\nAfter initially passing on purchasing her story in June 2016, AMI showed renewed interest after Ms. McDougal entered negotiations to sit for an interview with ABC News, according to the complaint. The agreement prohibited her from giving press interviews or sharing on social media “any romantic, personal and/or physical relationship McDougal has ever had with any then-married man,” according to a copy of the agreement reviewed by the Journal.\nAMI amended the agreement after Ms. McDougal switched lawyers in November 2016, according to the lawsuit. The change allowed her to respond to “legitimate press inquiries.” But the publisher has continued to instruct her to say nothing about her alleged relationship with Mr. Trump to reporters, the lawsuit says.\nAfter she declined to comment for a New Yorker story in July 2017, AMI’s Mr. Pecker invited her to a meeting in New York and thanked her for her “loyalty,” and promised more magazine covers and exposure, the lawsuit says.\nBut the company threatened her with lawsuits and “financial ruin” after the New Yorker last month published a story based on handwritten notes by Ms. McDougal outlining her alleged affair with Mr. Trump, according to the lawsuit.\n​The AMI spokesman said Ms. McDougal has been free to respond to inquiries about her relationship with Mr. Trump since 2016.\nWrite to Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com",
