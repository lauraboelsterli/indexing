Soccer Football - Serie A - AS Roma vs Torino - Stadio Olimpico, Rome, Italy - March 9, 2018 Roma's Daniele De Rossi celebrates scoring their second goal with Radja Nainggolan and team mates REUTERS/Max Rossi De Rossi helped his team win after attending the Florence funeral on Thursday of his friend and former Roma and Italy team mate Davide Astori, who was found dead on Sunday aged 31. There was a minute’s silence for the Fiorentina captain before kickoff on an emotional night at the Stadio Olimpico. The match was goalless until 10 minutes into the second half when Roma’s Greek international Kostas Manolas headed them in front and then dedicated his goal to the memory of Astori. De Rossi pounced on Radja Nainggolan’s headed ball forward to knock in Roma’s second in the 73rd, while his replacement Lorenzo Pellegrini wrapped up the win in stoppage time. Roma are third in Serie A on 56 points, four ahead of city rivals Lazio who travel to Cagliari on Sunday and five in front of Inter Milan who host leaders Napoli in that day’s late game.
