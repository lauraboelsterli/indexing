Lastly, we once again demonstrated exceptional operating expense control and operating leverage in our financial model,” commented Iain MacKenzie, President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of SMART Global Holdings.\n“We remain confident in our ability to drive additional growth and improvement in both SMART Brazil and our Specialty Memory businesses as the global memory market and economic trends in Brazil remain positive, and we see increasing demand from our OEM customers, particularly in the storage and networking end markets,” added Mr. MacKenzie.\n“As we announced on March 14, 2018, I am very pleased that Ajay Shah has agreed to accept the role of President and CEO. Ajay’s extensive industry knowledge and long history with SMART make him the ideal executive to lead SMART through this next phase of growth. I look forward to working closely with Ajay through this transition,” concluded Mr. MacKenzie.\nQuarterly Financial Results GAAP (1) Non-GAAP (2) (In millions, except per share amounts) Q2 FY18 Q1 FY18 Q2 FY17 Q2 FY18 Q1 FY18 Q2 FY17 Net sales $ 314.0 $ 265.4 $ 172.0 $ 314.0 $ 265.4 $ 172.0 Gross profit $ 73.0 $ 57.8 $ 37.2 $ 73.2 $ 58.1 $ 37.3 Operating income $ 45.1 $ 31.5 $ 9.3 $ 48.5 $ 34.6 $ 13.3 Net income (loss) $ 36.8 $ 21.0 $ (2.3 ) $ 39.9 $ 23.8 $ 4.9 Earnings (loss) per share - diluted $ 1.60 $ 0.92 $ (0.17 ) $ 1.73 $ 1.05 $ 0.35 GAAP represents U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

These statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to: business and economic conditions and growth trends in the technology industry, our customer markets and various geographic regions; global economic conditions and uncertainties in the geopolitical environment; overall information technology spending; the success of our strategic initiatives including additional investments in new products and additional capacity; the DRAM market and the temporary and volatile nature of pricing trends; deterioration in customer relationships; production or manufacturing difficulties; competitive factors; technological changes; difficulties with or delays in the introduction of new products; slowing or contraction of growth in the memory market in Brazil; reduction in or termination of local content requirements in Brazil; changes to applicable tax regimes or rates; prices for the end products of our customers; fluctuations in material costs and availability; deterioration in or loss of relations with any of our limited number of key vendors; and other factors and risks detailed in SMART’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such factors and risks as outlined above and in such filings may not constitute all factors and risks that could cause actual results of SMART to be materially different from the historical results and/or from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. SMART operates in a continually changing business environment and new factors emerge from time to time. SMART cannot predict such factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, from such factors on SMART or its results. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and SMART does not intend, and has no obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this press release, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Information\nCertain non-GAAP financial measures are contained in this press release or will be discussed on our conference call, including Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and non-GAAP diluted EPS. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, amortization of non-cash debt discount related to warrants, non-cash charges in connection with refinancing, and other infrequent or unusual items. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to, not a substitute for, our results of operations presented on the basis of U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA also does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be used as a measure of liquidity.\nThe non-GAAP financial results presented herein do not include stock-based compensation expense, intangible amortization expense, amortization of non-cash debt discount related to warrants and non-cash charges in connection with refinancing. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our financial performance. By excluding these charges and gains, as well as any related tax effects, our non-GAAP results provide information to management and investors that is useful in assessing SMART's core operating performance and in evaluating and comparing our results of operations on a consistent basis from period to period. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to evaluate financial results, to plan and forecast future periods, and to assess performance of certain executives for compensation purposes. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be a substitute for the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these measures may not be used similarly by other companies and therefore may not be comparable between companies.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Results” and “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA” tables below for more detail on Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP calculations.\nAbout SMART Global Holdings\nThe SMART family of companies are global leaders in specialty memory, storage and hybrid solutions serving the electronics industry with standard and custom products for over 25 years.
