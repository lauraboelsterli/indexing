    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 8:35 AM / Updated 12 hours ago Rugby-Wainui try secures tight Chiefs win over Highlanders Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nMarch 30 (Reuters) - A 68th-minute Sean Wainui try and two others scored either side of half time has propelled the Waikato Chiefs to a 27-22 victory over the Otago Highlanders in Hamilton on Friday. \nWainui gave his side the lead for good after a topsy-turvy encounter on the scoreboard even though the home side had dominated much of the possession and territory. \nFullback Solomon Alaimalo and hooker Nathan Harris had scored either side of half time to give the home side a 20-7 lead only for the visitors to come storming back with tries to Tevita Li and Sio Tomkinson and take a two-point lead with about 20 minutes remaining. \nThe Highlanders, who lost flyhalf Lima Sopoaga early in the match with what appeared to be a serious Achilles injury, had scored the match’s first try through All Blacks winger Waisake Naholo. \nThe Highlanders had held a 7-6 lead after a scrappy first half before fullback Alaimalo crossed after a sustained buildup and brilliant leap, catch and pass in one movement by winger Toni Pulu following a cross kick. \nThe Chiefs extended their 13-7 halftime advantage just four minutes into the second spell when hooker Harris was driven over to give the home side a 20-7 lead and looking like they could run away with the game. \nThe visitors, however, managed to fight their way back into the game with winger Li put over by a brilliant wide pass from scrumhalf Aaron Smith. \nWhile replacement flyhalf Fletcher Smith missed the conversion he added his first penalty to get his side to 20-15 with a little over 20 minutes remaining. \nThe visitors then surprisingly grabbed the lead when a Damian McKenzie clearing kick was charged down, brilliantly scooped up by hooker Ash Dixon and swung wide by Aaron Smith to Luke Whitelock who put replacement outside back Tomkinson over. \nThe Chiefs, however, struck back with Wainui’s try in the left corner and the home side then stole two crucial lineout throws from the Highlanders in the final minutes to ensure they did not sneak a late win.
