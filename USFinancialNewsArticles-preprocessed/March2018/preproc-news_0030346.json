    "text": "SILICON VALLEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Robins Kaplan LLP® announced today that Steven Carlson has joined the firm’s Intellectual Property and Technology Litigation Group as partner. A seasoned trial lawyer, Carlson will focus his practice on intellectual property litigation, including commercial, patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and unfair competition.\n“Steve has built an impressive practice representing innovators in the fields of robotics, databases, software, medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, chemistry, and telecommunications that dovetails well with the portfolio of our clients’ technologies, and further enhances our capabilities in California,” said Michael Geibelson , managing partner of Robins Kaplan’s California offices.\nCarlson began his career with clerkships at the District Court of Delaware and at the Federal Circuit, followed by his move to Silicon Valley where he has practiced intellectual property litigation for 17 years. He is currently lead counsel in district court patent litigations on behalf of a smart-oven developer, an expense reporting pioneer, and an electronic key fob innovator, among a broad array of clients for whom he performs strategic IP consulting services. As lead counsel, he also has invalidated patents at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Carlson has expertise in cross-border enforcement actions, including a worldwide licensing campaign concerning biotechnology diagnostics that inspired him to co-author a leading guidebook on patent enforcement in Germany, entitled Patents in Germany and Europe: Procurement, Enforcement, and Defense.\n“From patent disputes to the broader litigation needs faced by technology companies, Steve and his clientele are an ideal fit for Robins Kaplan’s work on both sides of the ‘v’,” added Martin Lueck , chairman of Robins Kaplan’s executive board.\n“I’ve long recognized Robins Kaplan as a powerhouse in patent litigation, and I’m thrilled to be joining such a talented group of trial lawyers,” said Carlson. “Robins Kaplan is one of the great trial firms in the country, with a truly polished and collegial group of individuals.” Carlson joins Robins Kaplan from Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP.\nCarlson is a frequent writer and speaker on cutting-edge topics in patent law. He is an adjunct lecturer at Berkeley School of Law, as well as a co-author of the treatise provided to all federal judges, the Patent Case Management Judicial Guide. Carlson received his J.D. from Yale Law School and his B.A. in chemistry from Reed College. He is actively involved in his community and is president-elect of the Rotary Club of San Carlos.\nAbout Robins Kaplan LLP ®\nRobins Kaplan is among the nation’s premier trial law firms, with more than 220 lawyers located in Bismarck, N.D.; Boston; Los Angeles; Minneapolis; Naples, Fla; New York; Silicon Valley; and Sioux Falls, S.D.
