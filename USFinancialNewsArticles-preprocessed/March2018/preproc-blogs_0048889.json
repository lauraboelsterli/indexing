    "text": "Earlier on Thursday, pet food company Nutrish said in a tweet that it is \"in the process of removing our ads from Laura Ingraham's program.\" \nIngraham is the host of The Ingraham Angle, an evening news and opinion show on Fox News. \nThe companies were responding to a controversy over a tweet sent by Ingraham on Wednesday appearing to mock David Hogg, a survivor of the February massacre that left 17 students and adults dead. \n\"David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it,\" Ingraham said in the tweet. \nShe added that Hogg was \"Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance rates.\" Ingraham tweet \nIn the wake of the massacre, the 17-year-old student has become a prominent voice in a resurgent debate on mass shootings and gun control measures. Hogg Tweet \n\"We will continue to monitor where our advertisements appear in the open market to ensure they fit our guidelines,\" TripAdvisor's spokesperson said. \nLater on Thursday, online home goods company Wayfair told CNBC that it plans to stop advertising on Ingraham's program over the tweet. \n\"As a company, we support open dialogue and debate on issues. However, the decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values,\" Wayfair's head of public relations, Jane Carpenter, told CNBC. \n\"We do not plan to continue advertising on this particular program,\" Carpenter said. \nThe other companies listed in Hogg's tweet did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. \nHogg thanked TripAdvisor in a tweet shortly following Ingraham's apology.",
