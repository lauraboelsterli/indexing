    "text": "Published: Mar 5, 2018 8:53 a.m. ET Share \nDoubt raised over the effectiveness of the country’s largely state-led industrial policies, some of which brought overproduction Reuters In his speech Monday, Premier Li cited challenges from rising global protectionism. Without giving details, Li pledged to step up efforts to invite in foreign capital and promised tax deferrals for profits reinvested in China. \nBy Lingling Wei \nBEIJING—Premier Li Keqiang’s nearly-two-hour speech laying out China’s economic priorities for 2018 is unlikely to ease trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. \nOpening the National People’s Congress on Monday, Li again emphasized industrial policies the West has criticized as benefiting Chinese companies at the expense of foreign competitors. \nRead: Is there an agreement to renew trade talks? China says yes, but White House says no \nHe listed broad goals for advances in technologies, from big data to aircraft engines to clean cars, articulated in the “Made in China 2025” plan to boost manufacturing. Senior U.S. officials including Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer have called the plan a threat to fair competition, saying it encourages state subsidies for domestic companies and drives them to force technology transfer from foreign partners. \nRead: Trump Today: President says Canada, Mexico steel tariffs will only come off under ‘fair’ Nafta \nLi’s pledge Monday to “speed up work to build China into a leader in manufacturing” is likely to feed critics’ concerns about Beijing’s quest for self-sufficiency in tech sectors like robotics and semiconductors. Trump administration officials are weighing trade and investment penalties against China as they complete an investigation into allegations of Chinese theft and expropriation of American intellectual property. \nIn the past month, senior Chinese officials have sought to restart economic talks with the U.S., but that hasn’t deterred President Donald Trump’s trade offensive. On Thursday, he announced stiff new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports—even as President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser, Liu He, was in Washington meeting with U.S. officials including Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn.
