    "text": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s Space Communications said on Monday it signed a $112 million deal with Space Systems/Loral (SSL) to build its Amos-8 advanced communications satellite.\nThe satellite, which is designed to provide service for at least 15 years, is slated to be launched by Elon Musk’s SpaceX in the second half of 2020, Spacecom said.\nSpacecom chose SSL, a unit of Maxar Technologies, over state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries, the maker of previous Amos satellites.\nA year ago, Spacecom began operating Amos-7 — obtained in a deal with Asia Satellite Telecommunications Holdings — after losing two satellites in the prior two years.\nIn September 2016, Amos-6 was destroyed days before its scheduled launch when a SpaceX launcher exploded. Spacecom also lost contact with another satellite in 2015.\nAmos-8 will replace Amos-3, which was launched in 2008.\nSpacecom is 64 percent owned by Eurocom Holdings.\nReporting by Steven Scheer; By Tova Cohen\n ",
