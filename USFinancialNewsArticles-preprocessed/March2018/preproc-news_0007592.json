    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Mich., Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conifer Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:CNFR) (“Conifer” or the “Company”) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights (all comparisons to prior year period)\nCommercial lines net earned premiums increased by 10.1% in the fourth quarter Partially offsetting the Commercial lines growth was a 19.7% decline in Personal lines net earned premiums for the same period Overall, net earned premiums increased 4.0% to $25.4 million Loss ratio improved to 58.3% from 73.4%; Expense ratio improved to 41.4% from 45.3% Combined ratio was 99.7% for the period, compared to 118.7% in the prior year period Net income of $221,000, or $0.03 per diluted share based on 8.5 million weighted average common diluted shares outstanding\nAnnual 2017 Highlights\nStrengthened reserve position through an adverse development cover (“ADC”) agreement with Swiss Re which provides up to $17.5 million of loss development cover in excess of stated reserves as of June 30, 2017 Completed $30.0 million Private Placement of Subordinated Notes Repaid outstanding senior credit facility in full Issued $5.0 million of additional common equity through a private placement. After a change in business mix in 2017, gross written premiums remained flat at $114.3 million Net earned premiums increased 2.3% to $91.7 million versus fourth quarter of 2016 Book value per share of $6.20 at December 31, 2017\nManagement Comments\nJames Petcoff, Chairman and CEO, commented, “During the fourth quarter Conifer benefitted from the initiatives we put in place in the second half of last year, leading to considerable improvements in our combined ratio and a return to profitability. We achieved a 16 percentage point improvement in the combined ratio to 94% in commercial lines, which was driven by improved underwriting performance from our hospitality, security guards, and quick service restaurants lines of business. We attribute this improvement to a renewed focus on our best performing lines of business which more than offset the marginal performance of select personal lines business.”\nOutlook for 2018\nMr. Petcoff concluded, “Over the past year we implemented a number of initiatives aimed at correctly positioning Conifer for sustained profitability and long-term book value appreciation. We will continue to focus on shifting our business mix towards those lines in which we have historically outperformed our peers within the P&C industry. There is considerable runway for growth in our specialty markets, where Conifer has a particular advantage in knowing how to effectively price and distribute our products. In 2018, we expect a modest increase in gross written premiums, with higher core commercial business being offset by lower premiums in select personal lines. We expect this to result in improved underwriting income in the coming periods and profitability over the long-term.”\n2017 Fourth Quarter Financial Results Overview\nAs of and for the Three Months Ended December 31, As of and for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change (dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Gross written premiums $ 31,247 $ 31,308 -0.2 % $ 114,284 $ 114,923 -0.6 % Net written premiums 27,439 27,069 1.4 % 91,240 99,929 -8.7 % Net earned premiums 25,433 24,463 4.0 % 91,729 89,627 2.3 % Net investment income 720 548 31.4 % 2,728 2,173 25.5 % Net realized investment gains 39 761 ** 70 1,365 ** Other gains - (400 ) ** 750 (400 ) ** Net income (loss) 221 (4,421 ) ** (21,542 ) (8,437 ) ** Net income (loss) per share, diluted $ 0.03 $ (0.58 ) $ (2.74 ) $ (1.11 ) Adjusted operating income (loss)* 161 (4,279 ) ** (22,781 ) (9,549 ) ** Adjusted operating income (loss) per share, diluted* $ 0.02 $ (0.56 ) $ (2.90 ) $ (1.26 ) Book value per common share outstanding $ 6.20 $ 8.88 $ 6.20 $ 8.88 Weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted 8,519,648 7,632,390 7,867,344 7,618,588 Underwriting ratios: Loss ratio (1) 58.3 % 73.4 % 79.2 % 65.0 % Expense ratio (2) 41.4 % 45.3 % 46.8 % 47.2 % Combined ratio (3) 99.7 % 118.7 % 126.0 % 112.2 % * The \"Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures\" section of this release defines and reconciles data that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles. ** Percentage is not meaningful (1) The loss ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of net losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums and other income. (2) The expense ratio is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses to net earned premiums and other income. (3) The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss. Fourth Quarter 2017 Premiums\nGross Written Premiums\nGross written premiums decreased 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $31.2 million, compared to $31.3 million in the prior year period. The slight decrease was largely due to a 6.8% decline in gross written premiums from the Company’s personal lines of business, offset by single-digit growth in commercial lines.\nNet Earned Premiums\nNet earned premiums increased 4.0% to $25.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $24.5 million for the prior year period. The increase is mainly attributed to an increase in gross earned premiums and lower ceded premiums during the period.\nCommercial Lines Financial and Operational Review\nCommercial Lines Financial Review Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change (dollars in thousands) Gross written premiums $ 25,854 $ 25,517 1.3 % $ 92,112 $ 88,242 4.4 % Net written premiums 23,600 22,671 4.1 % 78,217 78,439 -0.3 % Net earned premiums 21,344 19,394 10.1 % 76,786 68,921 11.4 % Underwriting ratios: Loss ratio 55.3 % 76.4 % 72.0 % 61.2 % Expense ratio 39.1 % 34.2 % 41.1 % 36.5 % Combined ratio 94.4 % 110.6 % 113.1 % 97.7 % Contribution to combined ratio from net (favorable) adverse prior year development -0.1 % 19.9 % 9.3 % 9.8 % Accident year combined ratio (1) 94.5 % 90.7 % 103.8 % 87.9 % Impact of hurricanes -0.7 % 0.0 % 3.0 % 0.0 % Accident year combined ratio\nbefore impact of hurricanes 95.2 % 90.7 % 100.8 % 87.9 % (1) The accident year combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio, less changes in net ultimate loss estimates from prior accident year loss reserves. The accident year combined ratio provides management with an assessment of the specific policy year's profitability and assists management in their evaluation of product pricing levels and quality of business written. The Company’s commercial lines of business, representing 83% of total gross written premiums in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily consist of mainly property and liability coverage offered to owner-operated small- to mid-sized businesses, such as hospitality risks including restaurants, bars, taverns and professional organizations.\nCommercial lines gross written premiums increased by 1.3% to $25.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was largely due to higher gross written premiums for the Company’s quick service restaurant and liquor liability businesses.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the commercial lines combined ratio was 94.4%, compared to 110.6% in the prior year period, due to the reduction of adverse development from $3.9 million in 2016 to $19,000 of favorable development in 2017.\nPersonal Lines Financial and Operational Review\nPersonal Lines Financial Review Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change (dollars in thousands) Gross written premiums $ 5,394 $ 5,789 -6.8 % $ 22,172 $ 26,681 -16.9 % Net written premiums 3,838 4,397 -12.7 % 13,023 21,490 -39.4 % Net earned premiums 4,090 5,096 -19.7 % 14,943 20,706 -27.8 % Underwriting ratios: Loss ratio 74.0 % 62.7 % 115.9 % 77.9 % Expense ratio 47.0 % 50.4 % 53.0 % 45.3 % Combined ratio 121.0 % 113.1 % 168.9 % 123.2 % Contribution to combined ratio from net (favorable) adverse prior year development 1.2 % 12.5 % 14.5 % 16.1 % Accident year combined ratio 119.8 % 100.6 % 154.4 % 107.1 % Impact of hurricanes 17.8 % 0.0 % 26.3 % 0.0 % Accident year combined ratio\nbefore impact of hurricanes 102.0 % 100.6 % 128.1 % 107.1 % Personal lines, which consist of low-value dwelling and wind-exposed homeowners insurance, represented 17% of total gross written premiums for the fourth quarter of 2017. Personal lines gross written premiums decreased 6.8% to $5.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year period. This was mainly due to a 15.8% decline in gross written premiums in the Florida homeowners program due to the Company’s initiative to reduce exposure in this line.\nConifer’s low-value dwelling products gross written premiums decreased by 14.3% during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the prior year period.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the personal lines combined ratio was 121.0%, compared to 113.1% in the prior year period. Additional losses from Hurricane Harvey and Irma of $654,000 emerged in the fourth quarter of 2017. Coupled with these losses, there was an additional $103,000 of reinstatement premiums relating to Hurricane Irma, which increased the combined ratio in the fourth quarter. Before the impact of the hurricanes, the personal lines accident year combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 102.0%.\nCombined Ratio Analysis\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) Underwriting ratios: Loss ratio 58.3 % 73.4 % 79.2 % 65.0 % Expense ratio 41.4 % 45.3 % 46.8 % 47.2 % Combined ratio 99.7 % 118.7 % 126.0 % 112.2 % Contribution to combined ratio from net (favorable) adverse prior year development 0.1 % 18.3 % 10.1 % 11.3 % Accident year combined ratio 99.6 % 100.4 % 115.9 % 100.9 % Impact of hurricanes 2.2 % 0.0 % 6.8 % 0.0 % Accident year combined ratio\nbefore impact of hurricanes 97.4 % 100.4 % 109.1 % 100.9 % Combined Ratio\nThe Company's combined ratio was 99.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 118.7% for the same period in 2016.\nLoss Ratio : The impact of prior accident year reserves on the Company's loss ratio has been significantly reduced due to the benefits of the ADC.

The Company is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market (Nasdaq: CNFR). Additional information is available on the Company’s website at www.CNFRH.com .\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures\nConifer prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.\nWe believe that investors’ understanding of Conifer’s performance is enhanced by our disclosure of adjusted operating income. Our method for calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. We define adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure, as net income (loss) excluding net realized investment gains and losses, and other gains and losses, after-tax, and excluding the tax impact of changes in unrealized gains and losses. We use adjusted operating income as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our results of operations and our underlying business performance.\nReconciliations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) Net income (loss) $ 221 $ (4,421 ) $ (21,542 ) $ (8,437 ) Less: Net realized gains and other gains (losses), net of tax 39 508 820 1,112 Effect of tax law change 63 63 Tax effect of investment unrealized gains and losses (42 ) (650 ) 356 - Adjusted operating income (loss) $ 161 $ (4,279 ) $ (22,781 ) $ (9,549 ) Weighted average common shares, diluted 8,519,648 7,632,390 7,867,344 7,618,588 Diluted income (loss) per common share: Net income (loss) $ 0.03 $ (0.58 ) $ (2.74 ) $ (1.11 ) Net realized gains and other gains (losses), net of tax - 0.07 0.10 0.15 Effect of tax law change 0.01 - 0.01 - Tax effect of investment unrealized gains and losses - (0.09 ) 0.05 - Adjusted operating income (loss) per share $ 0.02 $ (0.56 ) $ (2.90 ) $ (1.26 ) Forward-Looking Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
