The fixed amounts distributed per share are subject to change at the discretion of each Fund’s Board of Directors/Trustees. Under its Plan, each Fund will distribute all available investment income to its shareholders, consistent with its primary investment objectives and as required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Funds will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to their shareholders in order to maintain a level distribution.\nThe Funds’ estimated sources of the distributions paid this month and for their current fiscal year are as follows:\nEstimated Allocations as of March 29, 2018 Fund Distribution Net Investment\nIncome\nNet Realized\nShort-Term Gains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term Gains\nReturn of Capital BCX 1 $0.051600 $0.051234 (99%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.000366 (1%) BDJ $0.046700 $0.027468 (59%) $0 (0%) $0.019232 (41%) $0 (0%) BGR 1 $0.077600 $0.055782 (72%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.021818 (28%) BGY $0.038000 $0.038000 (100%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) BME 1 $0.2 $0.029898 (15%) $0 (0%) $0.062369 (31%) $0.107733 (54%) BOE $0.078000 $0.074281 (95%) $0.003719 (5%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) BUI 1 $0.121000 $0.046935 (39%) $0.045753 (38%) $0 (0%) $0.028312 (23%) CII 1 $0.082800 $0.030906 (37%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.051894 (63%) BST $0.130000 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.130000 (100%) $0 (0%) EGF 1 $0.041000 $0.022494 (55%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.018506 (45%) Estimated Allocations for the Fiscal Year through March 29, 2018 Fund Distribution Net Investment\nIncome\nNet Realized\nShort-Term Gains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term Gains\nReturn of Capital BCX 1 $0.154800 $0.051234 (33%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.103566 (67%) BDJ $0.140100 $0.039443 (28%) $0 (0%) $0.100657 (72%) $0 (0%) BGR 1 $0.232800 $0.063185 (27%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.169615 (73%) BGY $0.114000 $0.043172 (38%) $0.068572 (60%) $0.002256 (2%) $0 (0%) BME 1 $0.6 $0.030767 (5%) $0 (0%) $0.267209 (45%) $0.302024 (50%) BOE $0.234000 $0.074281 (32%) $0.035322 (15%) $0.124397 (53%) $0 (0%) BUI 1 $0.363000 $0.093294 (26%) $0.096035 (26%) $0 (0%) $0.173671 (48%) CII 1 $0.248400 $0.042295 (17%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.206105 (83%) BST $0.390000 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.390000 (100%) $0 (0%) EGF 1 $0.082000 $0.058866 (72%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.023134 (28%) 1 The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net-realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder’s investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nFund Performance and Distribution Rate Information: Fund Average annual\ntotal return\n(in relation to NAV)\nfor the 5-year period\nending on\n2/28/2018\nAnnualized current\ndistribution rate expressed\nas a percentage of NAV\nas of 2/28/2018\nCumulative total\nreturn (in relation to NAV)\nfor the fiscal year through\n2/28/2018\nCumulative fiscal\nyear distributions\nas a percentage of\nNAV as of\n2/28/2018\nBCX 1.13% 6.18% (4.88)% 1.03% BDJ 10.29% 5.71% (0.60)% 0.95% BGR (2.90)% 6.45% (8.29)% 1.08% BGY 4.03% 6.74% (2.96)% 1.12% BME 15.52% 6.59% 1.62% 1.10% BOE 6.74% 7.36% (2.69)% 1.23% BUI 7.27% 7.12% (4.65)% 1.19% CII 12.57% 5.81% 0.09% 0.97% BST* 21.93% 5.00% 9.37% 0.83% EGF 1.31% 3.59% (1.41)% 0.60% * Portfolio launched within the past 5 years; the performance and distribution rate information presented for this Fund reflects data from inception to 2/28/2018.\nShareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s current distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan.\nAbout BlackRock\nBlackRock helps investors build better financial futures.
