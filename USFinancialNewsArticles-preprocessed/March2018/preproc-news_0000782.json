    "text": "1 COMMENTS Good morning. Sharing’s caring. And when it comes to people sharing passwords for streaming apps , pay-TV companies are finally starting to care a bit more, according to Bloomberg. Some companies are planning to thwart the password-swapping brigade by limiting the number of simultaneous streams that can run on any one account, while Charter is reportedly encouraging programmers to look at forcing subscribers on its apps to log in more often (great!). Such efforts could help pay-TV providers and programmers get a better view of their total audiences, which might help push up ad prices if more people eventually cave and pay for their own accounts.\nDigital Love The latest Interactive Advertising Bureau ad spend figures are out, which means, with a little bit of extrapolating, we can get a better sense of the duopoly’s dominance. First the figures themselves: In the first half of 2017, digital advertising revenue in the U.S. grew 23% to $40 billion. Mobile advertising made up over half (54%) of that figure, while digital video was the fastest-growing format. The IAB said the “top 10 companies” captured 75% of digital revenues in the period. ( AdExchanger coverage .) Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser estimates that Google and Facebook were responsible for collecting 83% of U.S. digital advertising growth in the second quarter of this year and 73% of all digital advertising in the period. And while that’s still ginormous, there’s some good news for the rest of the sector. Mr. Wieser says the figures suggest digital advertising that did not flow through Google or Facebook grew by 15% in the quarter, more than the 8% growth rate estimated in the first quarter of the year and the 7% growth rate estimated for all of 2016.\n—But!—\nThe digital advertising sector has been growing at a remarkable clip. But we’re going to get to a saturation point eventually, when that double-digit growth begins to level out. Marketers don’t have endless budgets and they’re still going to assign a portion of their spend to traditional media like TV for some time to come. “This helps explain why digital media owners — and Facebook in particular — have become more aggressive in finding ways to capture television advertising budgets in recent periods,” Mr. Wieser writes.\nWhat’s My Age Again? The investigations team at ProPublica has been digging into Facebook again, and they’ve found another potential issue: Facebook allows advertisers to place recruitment ads that are limited to certain age groups . The federal Age Discrimination Employment Act prohibits bias against people aged 40 or older in hiring or employment and ProPublica and the New York Times found examples of dozens of companies buying Facebook ads that aimed to recruit workers within limited age ranges. In a blog post , Facebook said it disagrees with the concerns raised in the article. Individual ads targeted only at young people may have been part of broader campaigns that did also reach people over 40, with different contextual creative for each age group, for example. Facebook says it also recently began requiring businesses running employment ads to certify they comply with the law before it shows their ads. LinkedIn, meanwhile, in response to inquiries from ProPublica, also added a self-certification step.\nJust Like a Rolling Stone Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner is marking the iconic music magazine’s fiftieth year by selling a controlling stake in parent company Wenner Media. The buyer is Penske Media , which owns trade publications including Variety, Deadline and Women’s Wear Daily, and the deal values the company at around $100 million, WSJ’s Jeffrey Trachtenberg reports. Rolling Stone’s brand has waned in recent years amid a decline in the print publishing business, the emergence of new digital culture media brands that appeal to younger audiences and the damage to its reputation caused by a 2014 story about an alleged university fraternity gang rape that was found to contain factual errors. What’s Penske got planned? It’s all about finally accelerating Rolling Stone into the digital age , Recode reports.\nThree Wishes...With Samsung’s Michelle Froah Photo: Samsung This week, as we wind down the year, we are asking leaders across the marketing and advertising industries to share their wishes for what 2018 might bring. Today, we speak to Michelle Froah, vice president of marketing excellence, strategy and integration at Samsung Electronics America. Below are edited excerpts from our interview.\nYour wish for the marketing discipline in 2018?\nMarketers have an opportunity to redefine what integrated marketing means and how we use true consumer insights to get there and connect with consumers in a more meaningful way.\nYour wish for media in 2018?\nWe want to make sure we are using our platforms and media partnerships as ways to engage differently, bring value to consumers and not just be sponsorships. We really need more partnership with our media partners so that we can combine our ecosystem of products and services with their services and products and create a new experience for consumers\nYour wish for the technology sector in 2018?\nUsing technology to really help people with new needs and desires as work changes. There’s a need for the next generations who want to work and play seamlessly, and I think that’s where technology can really help. That’s been our north star at Samsung and I’m really excited for what that seamless experience is going to be.\nBest of the rest A new Walmart subsidiary called Code Eight has started testing a personal shopping service aimed at “busy NYC moms.” Meanwhile, Walmart’s startup incubator Store No. 8 is working on a project that aims to operate physical stores without checkouts or cashiers, similar to Amazon’s “Go” store concept. [ Recode ]\nPinterest reportedly generated $310 million in revenue in the first three quarters of the year and is expected to record $490 million in full-year revenue, up 64% on 2016. A report from Recode in March suggested Pinterest had been aiming to hit the $500 million revenue mark this year [ The Information ]\nSome ad buyers say they’re struggling to navigate Amazon’s client service teams. [ Digiday ]\nFox News is reportedly readying a subscription streaming service that will include exclusive content from its on-screen talent. Fox News-parent 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership. [ BuzzFeed News ]\nBarstool Sports has appointed sports-marketing veteran Deirdre Lester as its first chief revenue officer.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the self-certification step prevents employers from using age ranges when choosing the targeting criteria for an employment ad. (March 1, 2018)",
