    "text": "Check out the companies making headlines after the bell :\nShares of Stitch Fix fell 1 percent in extended trading. The online personal shopping service missed analyst estimates for earnings on its second financial report since going public in November.\nThe company reported EPS of 2 cents on revenue of $296 million, versus the 6 cents on $291 million expected.\nShares of Time Warner climbed close to 1 percent after the bell. A U.S. district judge ruled AT&T's arguments may be included in the trial over its proposed merger with Time Warner.\nCurrently, the government argues the merger would hike subscribers bills by 45 cents a month. AT&T counters that analysis does not factor in its seven year commitment to binding arbitration over disputes with distributors like DISH Network or Comcast , according to Thomson Reuters.",
