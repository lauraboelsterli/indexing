Century Aluminum and Steel Dynamics rose 7.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Earlier, a White House official said Trump will announce tariffs at a meeting Thursday. The stocks traded near session highs seen earlier in the day after Trump said he will implement tariffs on steel and aluminum exports next week. 3 Hours Ago | 04:33 \nSteel and aluminum stocks traded in a wide range Thursday as a battle between President Donald Trump and his advisors on the implementation of tariffs played out in real time. \nShares of U.S. Steel closed up 5.8 percent, while AK Steel gained surged 9.5 percent. Century Aluminum and Steel Dynamics rose 7.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively. U.S. Steel and AK Steel rose as much as 9.5 percent and 13.2 percent, respectively, while Century Aluminum and Steel Dynamics traded up 14.7 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively, at session highs. \nThe stocks reached their session highs after Trump said he will implement tariffs on steel and aluminum exports next week. This comes after the administration had said that an announcement on tariffs was unlikely Thursday as top trade advisors disagreed about the steps that could be taken by the administration. \nBut earlier, a White House official said Trump will announce tariffs at a meeting Thursday. This came after CNBC learned that executives from top U.S. steel and aluminum companies had been invited to the White House for an emergency meeting on Thursday. \nThe White House has been working on implementing tariffs on metals imports since last year. In June, Axios reported Trump was \"hell-bent\" on imposing tariffs on steel and other imports. \nOn Thursday, Trump reiterated his desire for changes to U.S. trade in the steel and aluminum industries, tweeting the industries \"have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world.\"",
