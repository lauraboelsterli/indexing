    "text": "4 COMMENTS ROME—The triumph of antiestablishment parties in Sunday’s parliamentary elections in Italy thrusts onto center stage the 5 Star Movement and the League, two groups that have staked out starkly different ideological ground but have both tapped a deep reservoir of discontent among Italians.\nJust more than half of Italians cast votes for populist parties Sunday, exposing the depth of Italians’ dissatisfaction with their leadership class following the worst economic downturn since the war, rising poverty and huge inflows of African and Middle Eastern migrants.\nNow, 5 Star and the League are vying for the chance to form a government. While the League rejects the idea of joining forces with 5 Star, some observers say a lack of other options could drive the pair to band together to govern—a scenario that would deeply shake Europe’s establishment.\n5 Star Movement's leader Luigi Di Maio, center, being greeted before a press conference on the election results in Rome on Monday. Photo: ANDREW MEDICHINI/ASSOCIATED PRESS 5 Star emerged from Sunday’s vote as Italy’s single largest political group with 32% of the popular vote, according to projections, a huge jump from its showing in the 2013 election. Sunday’s vote “drives us inevitably towards governing Italy,” said Luigi Di Maio, 5 Star’s 31-year-old candidate for premier, on Monday.\nAlso claiming the upper hand, however, was Matteo Salvini, the 44-year-old firebrand leader of the League, who drove the party to victory on a fierce anti-immigration stance and a tough platform on law and order.\nMatteo Salvini, head of the League, gesturing during a press conference in Milan on Monday. Photo: DANIEL DAL ZENNARO/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK/EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY The League won 18% of the popular vote, making it the senior partner in the center-right coalition that also includes former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and a smaller hard-right party. The conservative alliance won 37% of the vote in all.\nBecause neither group secured a parliamentary majority, Italy faces weeks or months of consultations to form a new government.\nVotes for the two antiestablishment groups correlated geographically with two issues: immigration and unemployment. The League strengthened its grip on the northern regions that have seen the largest increase in foreign-born population and the fiercest debates on their presence, according to an analysis by Rome’s LUISS University.\nWinner by Region The 5 Star Movement increased its popular support again, winning as Italy's most popular party.

The group’s plans for a universal basic income and anti-poverty measures have played especially well there.\n5 Star began as a grass-roots movement that shuns tradition political labels and places great faith in the power of the internet to deliver direct democracy and circumvent legacy parties. Founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo, it has rocketed in popularity on its criticisms of the perks and privileges of politicians in Rome.\nBy contrast, the League was born in Italy’s wealthy north as a secessionist party advocating a split with the country’s poorer south. As the Northern League, it governed for years alongside Mr. Berlusconi and succeeded in securing more federalism in Italy, but sank to just 4% of voting intentions by 2013.\nMr. Salvini then took over the party, dropping its secessionist platform and adopting a brash, sharp-tongued criticism of immigration and of establishment parties, which he accuses of having ceded control to Brussels.\nVote of Distress The 5 Star Movement was the most popular party, winning 10 of Italy's 20 regions. They did well in the south where unemployment runs especially high. 5 Star Movement support Chamber of Deputies vote by region Unemployment rate Third quarter, 2017 Sources: Italian Ministry of the Interior (5 Star); Italian National Institute of Statistics (unemployment) 5 Star and the League find common cause in their antipathy to the euro. A referendum on Italy’s membership in the common currency is part of 5 Star’s platform. Mr. Di Maio has softened that position in recent months, but remains openly critical of EU budget constraints on Italy, and some 5 Star parliamentarians still openly espouse a return to the lira.\nSimilarly, Mr. Salvini has called the euro “a wrongheaded social and economic experiment” destined to collapse.\n“The common currency isn’t dogma,” he said. “It isn’t irreversible.”\nThe two parties differ, however, on a slate of issues. In particular, Mr. Salvini—who drew plaudits after the election from French far-right leader Marine Le Pen —has espoused a harsh view of immigration. He opposes the building of mosques and has called for the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of the Middle Eastern and African migrants who have arrived in Italy in recent years, claiming that help for undocumented immigrants diverts resources from Italians living in poverty.\n“If we don’t win, in the next five years they will donate a house, a job and the right to vote to some millions of immigrants,” Mr. Salvini said at a rally last week. “Italians will become refugees in Italy.”\nRelated\nVotes Further Fray Europe’s Center What Happens Next After Italian Vote Merkel’s Fourth Term Likely Her Last as Chancellor Europe’s Center Holds, but Just Barely Stocks Weak as Markets Digest Italian Elections By contrast, Mr. Di Maio, one of 5 Star’s more moderate figures, worked during the campaign to brush off its image as a political force hostile to the business community and the eurozone—a shift that may have helped draw voters wary of 5 Star’s more unorthodox ideas, but who were seeking an outlet for their anger at establishment politicians.\nOn Monday, Mr. Salvini said the center-right coalition excluded the prospect of any deal with 5 Star to gain the parliamentary seats it needs for a majority, but he didn’t explain where the alliance would find the extra seats.\nMeanwhile, in remarks Monday, Mr. Di Maio left the door open “to dialogue with all parties.”\nHis supporters say 5 Star, as the country’s biggest single vote-getter, is an indispensable partner in any government. “Nobody can govern without 5 Star,” Riccardo Fraccaro, a leading party member.",
