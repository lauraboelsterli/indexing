    "text": "Arizona’s Jake Lamb had two hits and four RBIs, and Jarrod Dyson contributed two hits and two runs in the Diamondbacks’ 8-2 victory over the visiting Colorado Rockies in the regular-season opener for both teams on Thursday at Chase Field.\nLamb had a two-run double in a three-run first inning off right-hander Jon Gray, and he added a two-run single in a three-run sixth to give the Diamondbacks a 6-2 lead. Lamb has nine career RBIs on Opening Day, breaking Luis Gonzalez’s franchise record of seven.\nDyson beat out a bunt single and was part of a double steal in the sixth inning, when Arizona got only one ball out of the infield while scoring three runs. In a two-run seven, Dyson hit an RBI triple and scored on Deven Marrero’s single to make it 8-2.\nArizona left-hander Patrick Corbin (1-0) gave up two runs on bases-empty homers by DJ LeMahieu and Nolan Arenado while winning his first career Opening Day start. He gave up seven hits, struck out eight and walked one in 5 2/3 innings.\nGray (0-1) gave up six hits and three runs in four-plus innings in his first Opening Day start. He struck out four and walked three. Gray allowed four runs in a career-short 1 1/3 innings in an 11-8 loss in the NL wild-card playoff game at Chase Field last Oct. 4.\nLeMahieu homered as the second batter of the game to give the Rockies a 1-0 lead. LeMahieu has 15 hits and four homers off Corbin in 40 career-at bats.\nThe Diamondbacks scored three runs in their half of the first inning.\nDavid Peralta and A.J. Pollock opened with singles, and Paul Goldschmidt walked on a 3-2 pitch to load the bases. Lamb doubled to the base of the center field fence, driving in two runs, and Goldschmidt scored on Alex Avila’s one-one groundout to make it 3-1.\nArenado’s bases-empty homer in the sixth inning cut the Diamondbacks’ lead to 3-2.\nArizona right-hander Archie Bradley entered with runners on first and second and one out in the seventh inning and got a double-play grounder to preserve a 6-2 lead. He pitched a 1-2-3 eighth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
