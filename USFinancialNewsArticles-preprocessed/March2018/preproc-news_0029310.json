Gross written premiums were $767 million, up 8.3%, driven by growth in warranty and credit products. Net written premiums were $418 million, up 24.0%, driven by increase in retention of credit products and growth in warranty products. In Q4'17, we completed the issuance of $125 million of 40 year Junior Subordinated Notes which refinanced existing indebtedness and strengthened the capital position as part of our strategy to grow the insurance company.\nTiptree Capital:\nOn February 1, 2018, we sold our senior living operations to Invesque in exchange for 16.6 million shares. Tiptree’s increase to book value was approximately $0.91 per share, or a 9.1% increase over our December 31, 2017 book value per share, as exchanged. The transaction is expected to be accretive to our 2018 GAAP earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA. At December 31, 2017, our senior living operations are carried as discontinued operations. Through the Invesque transaction, along with additional pending or closed sales in 2017, Tiptree’s consolidated debt was reduced by $518 million from September 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017. After giving effect to these transactions, the Company’s debt to equity leverage was reduced from 2.2x to less than 0.9x. On October 1, 2017, we sold our investment in our commercial lending subsidiary for $13.5 million in a combination of cash and a seller’s note. On December 12, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Luxury Mortgage. The agreement is subject to, among other things, regulatory approval, and is expected to close during the second half of 2018. Throughout 2017, we exited substantially all of our CLO subordinated note positions and related hedges for $3.9 million in gains over our carrying value. As a result of the above divestitures, we have approximately $90 million of cash, net of cash at regulated insurance subsidiaries, that can be used for investments and acquisitions. We returned $11.8 million to investors through $7.3 million of share buy-backs and $4.5 million of dividends paid.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nRevenues\nThe increase in revenues from 2016 to 2017 was $75.4 million, or 14.9%, driven by growth in earned premiums and net investment income in our insurance operations, partially offset by reduced service and administrative fees, ceding commissions, and unrealized losses on equities in our specialty insurance investment portfolio, as compared to prior period gains. This was consistent with our strategy to grow written premiums of our insurance business, which contributes to increased investable assets and investment income. In addition to the growth in revenues, the combination of unearned premiums and deferred revenues on the balance sheet grew by $93.0 million or 19.9%, as we continue to grow credit protection and warranty written premiums, which are earned over multiple years.\nNet Income (Loss) before non-controlling interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income before non-controlling interests was $5.2 million compared to net income of $32.3 million in the 2016 period, a decrease of $27.1 million, or 83.8%. The decline was primarily a result of the unrealized losses on equities in our insurance investment portfolio, compared to unrealized gains in the prior period. Increased stock-based compensation expense in specialty insurance and increased earn-out expense associated with our Reliance acquisition also contributed to the decline. We also reduced our exposure to CLO subordinated notes throughout 2017 which resulted in less distributions compared to 2016. Those factors were partially offset by a net tax benefit of $15.2 million driven by remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act’s change in federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and decreases in corporate expenses.\nNet Income (Loss) Available to Class A Common Stockholders\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income available to Class A common stockholders was $3.6 million, a decrease of $21.7 million from the prior year period. The key drivers of net income available to Class A common stockholders were the same factors which impacted the net income before non-controlling interests.\nNon-GAAP\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA and book value per share, as exchanged as measurements of operating performance which are non-GAAP measures. Management believes that use of Adjusted EBITDA provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze financial performance, and to analyze a company’s ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparison among companies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used in determining incentive compensation for the Company’s executive officers. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP net income. Book value per share, as exchanged assumes full exchange of the limited partners units of TFP for Tiptree Class A common stock. Management believes that use of this financial measure provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze company growth on a relative per share basis.\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $38.0 million compared to $78.9 million for the 2016 period, a decrease of $40.9 million, or 51.8%. The key drivers of the change in Adjusted EBITDA were the same as those which impacted our net income before non-controlling interests, excluding the increase in the Reliance earn-out expense, the change in the tax provision and non-recurring expenses which were added back to Adjusted EBITDA. See “— Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for a reconciliation to GAAP net income.\nAs exchanged book value per share for the period ended December 31, 2017 was $9.97, a decrease from $10.14 as of December 31, 2016. The key drivers of the period-over-period impact were increases in net income that drove 2017 diluted earnings per share of $0.11 and the purchase of 1.0 million shares at an average 28% discount to book value. Those increases were more than offset by dividends paid of $0.12, officer and director compensation share issuances, and the exercise of an option in June 2017, the latter of which resulted in 1.5 million shares being issued at $5.36 per share. Given the strike price of the option, the impact was a $0.19 reduction to book value per share. In 2017, Tiptree returned $11.8 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid.\nKey Non-Cash Drivers of Pre-tax Income and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe table below highlights certain key non-cash drivers impacting our consolidated results. We believe highlighting these significant, non-cash items provides useful additional information to investors. For a further discussion on these key drivers, see —“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Consolidated Results of Operations” in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Unrealized & realized gains (losses) on equity securities $ (23,753 ) $ 11,694 Stock-based compensation $ (6,560 ) $ (2,584 ) Reliance contingent earn-out liability (1) $ (3,039 ) $ (1,277 ) Depreciation and amortization (1)(2) $ (29,486 ) $ (28,468 ) (1) Added back to Adjusted EBITDA. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nto GAAP financials, see “—Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”\n(2) Includes depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations.\nDepreciation and amortization associated with Care was $15.6 million for 2017\nand $14.2 million for 2016.\nResults by Segment\nTiptree is a holding company that combines insurance operations with investment management expertise. In addition to our specialty insurance operations, we allocate our capital across our investments in other companies and assets which we refer to as Tiptree Capital. As of December 31, 2017, Tiptree Capital consists of asset management operations, mortgage operations and other investments. As such, we classify our business into three reportable segments– specialty insurance, asset management and mortgage. Corporate activities include holding company interest expense, employee compensation and benefits, and other expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company sold its interests in Siena and classified Care and Luxury as held for sale. At the time of such classification, the pending sale of Care also met the requirements to be classified as a discontinued operation. Each of these divestitures are no longer considered operating segments. As a result of these divestitures, our reportable segments dropped from four to three, with the elimination of Senior Living segment and renaming Specialty Finance to Mortgage. The following table presents the components of total pre-tax income including continuing and discontinued operations.\nPre-tax Income\n($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Specialty insurance $ 5,404 $ 46,804 Tiptree Capital: Asset management 14,245 25,264 Mortgage 2,090 4,882 Other 4,001 6,996 Corporate (29,070 ) (34,806 ) Pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations $ (3,330 ) $ 49,140 Pre-tax income (loss) from discontinued operations (1) (6,222 ) (5,824 ) (1) Consists of Care for 2016 and 2017. Management evaluates the return on Invested Capital and Total Capital, which are non-GAAP financial measures, when making capital investment decisions. Invested Capital represents its total cash investment, including any re-investment of earnings, and acquisition costs, net of tax. Total Capital represents Invested Capital plus Corporate Debt. Management believes the use of these financial measures provide supplemental information useful to investors as they are frequently used by the financial community to analyze how the Company has allocated capital over-time and provide a basis for determining the return on capital to shareholders. Management uses both of these measures when making capital investment decisions, including reinvesting cash, and evaluating the relative performance of its businesses and investments. The following table presents the components of Total Capital and Adjusted EBITDA.\nInvested Capital and Adjusted EBITDA - Non-GAAP (1)\n($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Total Capital Adjusted EBITDA 2017 2016 2017 2016 Specialty Insurance $ 441,317 $ 410,190 $ 26,961 $ 60,526 Tiptree Capital 161,825 215,262 35,430 49,954 Asset management 4,977 73,173 14,245 25,265 Mortgage 30,725 25,257 5,677 6,671 Other (2) 126,123 116,832 15,508 18,018 Corporate 37,965 393 (24,403 ) (31,564 ) Total Tiptree $ 641,107 $ 625,845 $ 37,988 $ 78,916 (1) For further information relating to the Company’s Total Capital and Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation to GAAP total stockholders equity and pre-tax income, see “—Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”\n(2) Includes discontinued operations related to Care.
