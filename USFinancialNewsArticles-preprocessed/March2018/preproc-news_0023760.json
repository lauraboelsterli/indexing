FILE PHOTO : Sebastien Ogier of France talks to journalists during the shakedown of Rally Sweden, in Torsby, Sweden February 09, 2017. TT News Agency/Micke Fransson/REUTERS Stewards imposed a 10-second penalty on Ogier for hitting a chicane in the final Power Stage, in which he had been second fastest. Neuville gained an additional bonus point as a result of Ogier’s demotion out of the top five in the stage, leaving the rally winner on 56 and his Belgian rival on 52 after three rounds. The next rally is Corsica on April 5-8. Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond",
