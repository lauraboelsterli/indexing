    "text": "Tel Aviv, Israel, March 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InspireMD, Inc. (NYSE AMER:NSPR), a leader in embolic prevention systems (EPS) / thrombus management technologies and neurovascular devices, today announced that it has received regulatory approval for the CGuard™ Embolic Prevention System (EPS) and MGuard Prime™ in Peru. The approval was granted by Peru’s Ministry of Health.\nIn May of 2017 the company announced it had entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Dispositivos Medicos E.I.R.L, a leading medical device distributor in Peru. The two companies have collaborated since the initial agreement in order to successfully secure this regulatory approval. Sales for both products, CGuard™ EPS and MGuard Prime™, will commence immediately in Peru.\nMaximiliano Arboleda, General Manager of Dispositivos Medicos E.I.R.L, commented, “We have been working closely with InspireMD in order to educate key opinion leaders and top hospital chains in preparation for marketing clearance, which we have now secured. The clinical data from both of these products is quite impressive and we expect our physicians to start using the products very quickly.”\n“We are excited to officially launch our commercial efforts in Peru following an extensive regulatory review and approval by the Peruvian health authorities,” said Agustin Gago, EVP and Chief Commercial Officer of InspireMD. “The approval of both CGuard™ EPS and MGuard Prime™ in Peru is further recognition of the importance of our products and supports our expansion into Latin America. With a population of more than 30 million and solid GDP growth, Peru is an attractive market and Dispositivos Medicos E.I.R.L is a great partner, as it represents many of the leading global medical device manufacturers in Peru.”\nAbout InspireMD, Inc.\nInspireMD seeks to utilize its proprietary MicroNet™ technology to make its products the industry standard for embolic protection and to provide a superior solution to the key clinical issues of current stenting in patients with a high risk of distal embolization, no reflow and major adverse cardiac events.\nInspireMD intends to pursue applications of this MicroNet technology in coronary, carotid (CGuard™), neurovascular, and peripheral artery procedures.
