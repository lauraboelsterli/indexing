    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. For some people, deleting Facebook is a psychological roller coaster akin to the five stages of grief: denial; anger; bargaining; depression; then, finally, acceptance. WSJ follows the paths of people who have gone Facebook cold turkey amid the #DeleteFacebook movement. It reveals the complicated relationship many of us have with the social-networking site.\n2 Broker Girls It wouldn’t be a March CMO Today newsletter without leading on the latest twist in Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica fallout. Facebook announced Wednesday that it will curb the information it exchanges with data brokers , such as Acxiom, Oracle Data Cloud and Experian, Business Insider first reported. Specifically, it’s shutting down its “Partner Categories” tool, which let advertisers use data from these brokers to target consumers based on their offline behavior, such as people in the market for a luxury car, credit-card holders or frequent shampoo buyers. Acxiom said that could hurt its fiscal 2019 revenue and profit by as much as $25 million , WSJ reported. Furthermore, people familiar with the matter say Facebook will end its practice of providing anonymized data from its platform to data brokers, which is used to measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns—although the social network is looking to find more secure ways to share data for ad measurement purposes. Remember, Facebook isn’t reacting just to the Cambridge Analytica data-sharing hubbub: Like every other company, it’s also preparing for Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation.\n—What It Means for Marketers—\nIt all depends on which category your brand is in. As Rob Blackie, an independent digital strategist, explained to me, Facebook may have reams of data, but there’s a lot of information missing that certain marketers—in categories such as automotive or consumer goods—find extremely useful for audience segmentation. “Facebook has loads of data about the sort of thing you talk about on Facebook, such as your football team. With sports, people leave a huge data trail, but [working out a person’s] income is really hard because people don’t talk about it or leave strong signals.” That’s where the brokers came in, collecting data from sources including loyalty programs, census data and surveys. Perhaps Facebook’s loss could be Amazon’s gain. The e-commerce giant has direct access to its own unique data on how people shop, which helps advertisers refine their targeting for ads on Amazon.com and the rest of the web. And it has the kind of reach advertisers desire.\nJohnny B Goode Turner CEO John Martin took to the stand again in the AT&T-Time Warner and Department of Justice antitrust trial Wednesday and detailed how the proposed merger would help the companies better compete against Google and Facebook, Variety reported. “We are not even playing the same arena,” said Mr. Martin, commenting on the duopoly’s dominance of the ad market. He reiterated the argument that AT&T’s treasure trove of data on its mobile users would give Time Warner’s Turner “a tremendous head start” when it comes to building a data-driven advertising targeting model, rather than relying on broader demographic information and dayparts. That’ll give Turner’s ads more value as the network looks to reduce its ad load. And Turner is looking for more data to prove people actually watch the advertising it airs, with Mr. Martin repeating the often-cited John Wanamaker line about knowing half of your ad dollars are wasted, but just not knowing which half. Thursday’s festivities will feature testimony from MIT professor John Hauser and Comcast executive Greg Rigdon, time allowing.\nRoseanne (Put On Your Red Light) TV ratings stories in recent years have usually been doom and gloom analyses about the impact of cord-cutting on linear TV. Not so for ABC’s revival of “Roseanne,” which brought in a huge 18.2 million viewers for the season 10 premiere Tuesday, according to Nielsen. Three big stats from CNN to put that figure into context: 1) Tuesday’s show scored the highest rating for the 18 to 49 demographic for any comedy telecast since 2014. 2) The only scripted show to have a bigger audience this season was the episode of NBC’s “This Is Us” that aired after the Super Bowl and brought in 26.9 million viewers. 3) Tuesday night’s episode racked up 10% more viewers than the original show’s finale 21 years ago. Even President Donald Trump was impressed and reportedly personally called the show’s creator and star, Roseanne Barr, to congratulate her on the ratings triumph. In the reboot, Roseanne Conner is a Trump supporter, as is Ms. Barr. “Hollywood is now faced with indisputable evidence that there’s a huge potential audience out there for programs that don’t actively insult 63 million Trump voters,” John Podhoretz wrote for the New York Post .\nI Don’t Like Cricket Australia’s national cricket team sent three players home from their South Africa tour on Saturday for their role in a ball-tampering incident on day three of the third Test. It’s cricket’s “Deflategate” moment , and, unsurprisingly, many sponsors have ripped up their deals with the players involved . More unusual, though, is Magellan Financial Group’s move to terminate its three-year contract (which only began in August 2017) with Cricket Australia as the naming rights sponsor of the Australian Men’s Domestic Test Series. “I’ve never seen an event sponsor do this before, and never as quickly, not even close,” sports marketing consultant Tim Crow told me. What’s different from other scandals (Lance Armstrong, Tiger Woods, doping), he said, is that there has been “universal condemnation of the team” in Australia—from ordinary people, not just from headline writers and hard-core sports fans. For corporates, sponsorships have moved beyond badging exercises to an opportunity to “project their values,” and Magellan’s move “is a real sign of how important this is becoming,” Mr. Crow said.\nBest of the rest Apple CEO Tim Cook has called for more privacy regulation, saying consumers should have more visibility into the personal information they share online and how companies use that data to build profiles of those users. [ WSJ ]\nWalmart is pulling Cosmopolitan from its checkout aisles, following a long campaign targeting the magazine for its “hyper-sexualized” content. In a statement, Walmart said, “While this was primarily a business decision, the concerns raised were heard. [ NPR ]\nTrade group the Advertising Research Foundation gave an award to Cambridge Analytica last year for the research firm’s “big data” work during the 2016 presidential election. Now the ARF plans to work with other industry groups to form new guidelines for collecting and protecting user information. [ New York Times ]\nThe number of over-the-top-only U.S. households has tripled since 2013 to 14.1 million homes, or 11% of all U.S. TV households. [ Adweek ]\nAMC Networks is launching a team to sell data products to advertisers. [ Variety ]\nRender Media, the owner of Cooking Panda and Opposing Views, is the latest digital publisher to shut down after Facebook’s algorithm changes. [ CMO Today ]\nHavas Group has launched “Havas Blockchain,” which will offer international communications services to initial coin offering and blockchain products.
