(NASDAQ: USCR) (\"U.S. Concrete\" or the \"Company\"), a leading supplier of ready-mixed concrete and aggregates in active construction markets across the country, announced that it has bolstered its presence in the Philadelphia metropolitan market with the acquisition of a new, state-of-the-art ready-mixed concrete plant located north of downtown Philadelphia. The Company will integrate all of the acquired assets into its existing Philadelphia operation, Action Supply Co., Inc. (\"Action Supply\").\n\"In the Philadelphia market, demand for ready-mixed concrete across all of our market segments is quite strong, so we are very pleased to have completed this acquisition,\" said U.S. Concrete President, CEO and Vice Chairman, William J. Sandbrook. \"This acquisition, coupled with the recent acquisitions of Action Supply and Corbett Aggregates Companies, greatly enhances our ability to serve the Greater Philadelphia area. We will continue to look for opportunistic ways in which we can grow our market share and strengthen our geographic footprint in this region.\"\nU.S. Concrete, which first entered the Philadelphia market in October 2017 through its acquisition of Action Supply, now has three ready-mixed concrete plants in the city and over 30 trucks.\nAbout U.S. Concrete, Inc.\nU.S. Concrete serves the construction industry in several major markets in the United States through its two business segments: ready-mixed concrete and aggregate products.
