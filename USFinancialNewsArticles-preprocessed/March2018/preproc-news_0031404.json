    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 9:17 PM / Updated 13 hours ago Rugby-Frustrated France take positives from Six Nations Reuters Staff 2 Min Read CARDIFF, March 17 (Reuters) - France coach Jacques Brunel was frustrated after his team lost 14-13 to Wales in their last Six Nations game, but he is confident Les Bleus are on the right path before next year’s World Cup. France dominated the game in Cardiff but failed to make it count especially in the second half, losing their third match of the championship by six points or less to end up fourth in the table. A last-gap Johnny Sexton drop goal gave Ireland a 15-13 win at the Stade de France before Les Bleus lost 32-26 to Scotland at Murrayfield. They were hoping to back up their 22-16 win over England but eventually proved too clumsy. “The players and the staff are disappointed,” said Brunel, who was in his first campaign in charge. There were notable signs of improvement during the championship, however. “We have shown that we were close (to the best teams) after we were said to be far from them at the beginning of the tournament,” said Brunel who stamped his authority when he left out several key players after they went out on a night out after the defeat in Scotland. “We wanted to get closer to the best teams and we achieved that goal.” A certain lack of discipline, however, cost France dearly and that is a department in which they will need to improve if they are to shine in Japan in 2019. “At the end of the day, we can be satisfied, but also not satisfied. We are close but we will have to improve quickly,” Brunel said. “But we have the players, the technique, and the mindset that make me believe that we will improve quickly.” France will be seriously tested by their next challenge, a tour of New Zealand in June.
