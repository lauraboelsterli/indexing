    "text": "Tiger Woods, finally healthy after four years of injury struggles, is gearing up to take on a bigger golf schedule in 2018 — and he plans to play at his tournament this summer in Montgomery County.\nWoods said Monday he would play The National, his charitable tournament in Potomac. It will run June 28 to July 1 at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm.\n\"I am really looking forward to being back in the D.C. area this summer playing in The National,\" Woods said in a statement. \"As a two-time champion of this event benefiting my foundation, The National has always been a special event for me.\"\nMore from Washington Business Journal:\nD.C. lining up millions to build new affordable housing units, Bowser says\nEverything you need to know about the D.C. tipped wage initiative\nThe region's population is growing. But a key demographic is still leaving.\nWoods, 42, hasn't played the tournament since 2015. He won it in 2012 and 2009. He's been in good form recently, putting together a couple of top-five finishes ahead of the Masters next month.\nGetty Images Tiger Woods Woods' presence is sure to be a boost for the tournament, which is currently without a sponsor — hence the simplified name. Quicken Loans ended its title sponsorship with the tournament last year. It launched in 2007 as the AT&T National. It has also been held at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda.\nThe tournament typically draws about 200,000 visitors. A 2009 Montgomery County study said the Woods' tournament has an estimated economic impact of about $29 million in direct and indirect spending.\nThe National has a $7.1 million purse and proceeds benefit the TGR Foundation, Woods' charitable arm focused on children. Lockheed Martin Corp. offers complimentary tickets to The National to members of the military. Tickets for the tournament start at $29 .",
