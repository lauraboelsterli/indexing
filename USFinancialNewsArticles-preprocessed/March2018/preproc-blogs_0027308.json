FILE PHOTO: General Joseph Votel, commander of U.S. Central Command, delivers remarks at the National Council on at 26th Annual Arab-U.S. Policymakers Conference in Washington, U.S., October 18, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas “The JCPOA addresses one of the principle threats that we deal with from Iran, so if the JCPOA goes away then we will have to have another way to deal with their nuclear weapons program,” said U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command. He was using an acronym for Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name of the accord with Iran agreed in July 2015 in Vienna. When asked by a lawmaker whether he agreed with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford that staying in the deal was in the national security interest of the United States, Votel said:“Yes, I share their position.” Reporting by Idrees Ali",
