    "text": "Maxim Mamin scored midway through the third period to lead the Florida Panthers to their fourth straight victory in a 3-2 win over the New Jersey Devils on Thursday at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Fla.\nMamin flipped a shot on the short side that bounced off the back of Devils goaltender Cory Schneider at 8:38 for his second goal of the season.\nAleksander Barkov added his second goal of the game and 23rd this season on a 2-on-1 break at 16:26 nearly eight minutes later.\nTaylor Hall and Jesper Bratt scored for the Devils.\nFlorida’s Roberto Luongo posted 29 saves.\nSchneider returned to the lineup and recorded 26 saves. He missed 16 games due to a groin/hip injury, last playing in a 3-2 loss against Boston on Jan. 23.\nHe returned to action this week after making a start at AHL affiliate Binghamton on Tuesday.\nThe Panthers went 9-3-0 in February, lifting them to within five points of Columbus entering Thursday for the Eastern Conference’s final wild-card spot with three games in hand on the Blue Jackets.\nIn the debut of new Devils forward Patrick Maroon, acquired from Edmonton at the trade deadline and playing on the fourth line’s right wing, Florida scored in the first period on a collision in front of Schneider at 6:51.\nBarkov slid a shot on goal from a tight angle, and Schneider made the initial stop. But New Jersey rookie center Nico Hischier, battling with Florida’s Nick Bjugstad, had the puck deflect in as he skated hard through the crease and into his goalie.\nNew Jersey challenged for goaltender interference, but the goal call on the ice was confirmed for a 1-0 lead.\nBarkov’s 22nd goal gave the Finnish center a career-high 60 points.\nNew Jersey answered with another goal that went off an opposing player.\nHall’s shot from the point was inadvertently directed past Luongo by defenseman Aaron Ekblad 50 seconds into the second.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
