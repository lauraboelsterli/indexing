    "text": "Published: Mar 25, 2018 4:13 p.m. ET Share \nJoseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing cite conflict of interest Reuters President Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House on Friday before his departure for the weekend in Palm Beach, Fla. \nBy Rebecca Ballhaus \nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump won’t hire two previously announced lawyers to the team representing him in the Russia probe, a member of the group said Sunday, leaving the legal team short-handed as it negotiates a possible interview between the president and special counsel Robert Mueller. \nJay Sekulow, one of the president’s lawyers, said Sunday that Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing, a married couple who are founding partners of a law firm, wouldn’t join the legal team because of a conflict of interest. The team had already been seeking to add to its ranks in recent weeks and reached out to a number of lawyers to discuss joining. \nJohn Dowd, who had been the president’s lead outside lawyer in the Russia probe, left last week partly because of the hiring of diGenova, who was expected to take a more confrontational approach, two people close to the team said. DiGenova in TV appearances has raised the idea that federal agents have sought to frame Trump for partisan political purposes. \nTrump has stepped up attacks on the Mueller probe, which is looking into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, as well as whether Trump obstructed justice in firing James Comey as Federal Bureau of Investigation director last year. Mueller has now publicly charged a total of 19 people in the wide-ranging probe, including several Trump associates. ",
