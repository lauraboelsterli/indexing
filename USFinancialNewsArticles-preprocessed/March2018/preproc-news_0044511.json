FILE PHOTO: Grab cars are seen during a launch ceremony in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, December 19, 2017. REUTERS/Samrang Pring/File Photo Slideshow (5 Images) As part of the transaction, Uber will take a stake of 27.5 percent in the Southeast Asian company, Grab said in a statement. Expectations of consolidation in Asia’s fiercely competitive ride-hailing industry were stoked after Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp made a multi-billion dollar investment in Uber.
