    "text": "Under Armour Says 150 Million MyFitnessPal Accounts Were Hacked The Under Armour logo is displayed on the new Stephen Curry basketball shoe in San Rafael, Calif. Photograph by Justin Sullivan—Getty Images By Bloomberg March 29, 2018 \nUnder Armour Inc., joining a growing list of corporate victims of hacker attacks, said about 150 million user accounts for its MyFitnessPal nutrition tracker were breached earlier this year. \nAn unauthorized party stole data from the accounts in late February, Under Armour said on Thursday. It became aware of the breach earlier this week and took steps to alert users about the incident, the company said. \nThe data didn’t include government-issued identifiers, including Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers, Under Armour said. \nShares of Under Armour fell 2.6 percent to $15.93 in late trading following the announcement.
