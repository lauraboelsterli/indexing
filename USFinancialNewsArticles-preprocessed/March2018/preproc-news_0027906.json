(Nasdaq:VNET) (\"21Vianet\" or the \"Company\"), a leading carrier-neutral Internet data center services provider in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company will hold a conference call at 8:00 pm on Monday, March 12, 2018 U.S. Eastern Time to discuss the financial results. Dial-in details are provided at the end of this release.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nNet revenues for hosting and related services increased by 8.9% year over year to RMB765.8 million (US$117.7 million). Gross profit increased by 9.2% year over year to RMB200.2 million (US$30.8 million). Gross margin expanded to 26.1% from 20.4% in the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 228.9% year over year to RMB171.0 million (US$26.3 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 22.3% from 5.8% in the same period of 2016.\nMr. Steve Zhang, Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “2017 was an exciting and milestone year for 21Vianet. We completed the restructuring of the Company by optimizing and then ultimately divesting our loss-generating managed network services (MNS) business, which allows us to fully focus our resources on our core hosting and related services business. During the past quarter, we further expanded our client base, including new relationships with Meitu, Douyu, and 99Bill, while many of our large clients, such as Xiaomi, Momo, Huawei and Lianjia, continued to expand their capacity at our IDC centers. As China’s internet companies migrate from public cloud to the hybrid cloud, their demand for customized cloud solutions rose continuously throughout 2017. To satisfy our customers’ specific requirements, we have proactively expanded our service offerings with more customized solutions. We are confident that our carrier- and cloud-neutral solutions coupled with customization will enable us to capitalize on rising demand and solidify our leadership position in this blooming Chinese market.”\nMs. Sharon Liu, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, commented, “We are pleased to once again deliver better-than-expected financial and operating results in the fourth quarter. Our revenue from the core hosting and related services business increased by 8.9% to RMB765.8 million and our Adjusted EBIDTA increased by 228.9% to RMB171.0 million, both of which exceeded the upper end of our guidance. Furthermore, in December of last year, we successfully completed the divestiture of the remaining equity stake in Sichuan Aipu Network Co. Ltd (“Aipu”), as well as the elimination of the Aipu put option. As we move toward a leaner business model with an improved cost structure, we expect our financial and operating metrics to show continued improvement going forward.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nREVENUES: Total net revenues were RMB765.8 million (US$117.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB900.6 million in the same period in 2016.
