    "text": "ATMORE, Ala., March 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PCI Gaming Authority d/b/a Wind Creek Hospitality, an instrumentality of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians (the \"Tribe\"), announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement under which Wind Creek Hospitality will acquire the Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for a total enterprise value of $1.3 billion. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions.\nWind Creek Hospitality currently owns and operates nine gaming and entertainment facilities located in six jurisdictions across the United States and the Caribbean, including three leading casino resorts located on the Tribe's reservation lands in Alabama.\nThe Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem, which will be integrated into the Wind Creek Hospitality portfolio, represents a best-in-class, Las Vegas-style resort, located in the heart of the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, approximately 80 miles from New York City. Amenities include a 282-room AAA four diamond hotel, a 183,000 square foot casino floor featuring 3,000 slots and electronic table games, 200 table games, numerous food and beverage outlets, a 150,000 square foot retail mall, and a multi-purpose event center.\nThe acquisition provides a significant opportunity to diversify its holdings and offer its Wind Creek Rewards program and its online Wind Creek Casino to millions of new customers throughout the northeast. Travel perks offered by the Wind Creek Rewards program to two of the most alluring resorts in the Caribbean, Renaissance Aruba Resort and Casino and Renaissance Curacao Resort and Casino, both owned by Wind Creek Hospitality, are expected to be particularly appealing escapes for Wind Creek Bethlehem customers during the cold winter months.\nFurther communications from Wind Creek Hospitality about this transaction will be limited until it has had the opportunity to meet with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, other regulatory agencies, its new Bethlehem Team Members, and community leaders and future partners.\nFinancing\nWind Creek Hospitality expects to fund the acquisition with a combination of existing cash on its balance sheet and new debt financing. Credit Suisse has provided committed financing for the proposed transaction. Wind Creek Hospitality anticipates that the additional cash flow resulting from the acquisition will allow it to pay down debt on an accelerated basis after closing.\nApprovals and Timing\nThe transaction is subject to approval of applicable gaming authorities, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. The companies expect the transaction to close later in 2018 or early 2019.\nAdvisors\nInnovation Capital, LLC is exclusive financial advisor and Cooper Levenson P.A. is legal counsel to Wind Creek Hospitality in connection with the transaction.\nAbout Wind Creek Hospitality\nWind Creek Hospitality is an authority of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. Wind Creek Hospitality manages the Tribe's gaming facilities including: Wind Creek Atmore, Wind Creek Wetumpka, Wind Creek Montgomery, Wa She Shu Casino in Nevada, Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino, Renaissance Curacao Resort & Casino as well as racetracks in Alabama and Florida.
