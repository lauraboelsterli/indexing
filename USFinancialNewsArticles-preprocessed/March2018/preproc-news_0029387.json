The company, whose activities range from building power stations to outsourcing work for local councils, said pipeline conversion was strong in construction and services business. The construction and support services company posted an underlying operating profit of 60 million pounds ($83.86 million) in the six months ended Dec. 31, up from 57.3 million pounds a year earlier. Underlying revenue rose 7.6 percent to 2.15 billion pounds. Helped by demand in its regional building and highway services businesses, the company said its order book grew to 9.5 billion pounds in the six months to Dec. 31, from 8.9 billion at June-end. “We remain on course to deliver double-digit profit growth in 2018 and to achieve our Vision 2020 strategic targets,” the company said.
