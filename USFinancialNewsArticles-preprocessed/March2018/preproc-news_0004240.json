    "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PetroShare Corp. (OTCQB:PRHR), (“PetroShare” or the “Company”), a Colorado-based oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in the Wattenberg Field of the Denver-Julesburg Basin, announced that it has entered into an agreement to fracture stimulate 14 wells on its operated Shook Pad and that the Company has agreed to participate in new non-operated horizontal wells in the Wattenberg Field.\nOperations Update\nFrederick Witsell, President of PetroShare, commented, “We are pleased to initiate final completion activities on our operated Shook Pad. We have entered into an agreement with a major service provider to fracture treat all the wells on the Shook pad, which targeted all three benches of the Niobrara plus the Codell sandstone formations. Pressure pumping equipment is scheduled to be on location at the end of March with all completion activities and production facilities expected to be finalized by mid-May. The cost estimate is within our original budget for completions. As part of the completion activities, we have entered into gathering agreements to move both our oil and gas by pipeline, eliminating the need for a large tank farm. Subject to the completion of the pipeline by an independent third party in mid-May, we anticipate initial production to begin in late May with full production by the end of June.”\nMr. Witsell continued, “Offset well results by third parties adjacent to our Shook pad have been robust, and the increasing activity throughout the Todd Creek Farms area, where the Shook pad is located, is an indication of the excellent geological characteristics of our leasehold. In addition to our Shook wells, we are currently participating in 22 additional extended length horizontal wells as a non-operating working interest owner, of which 14 wells should be in production by the second quarter of 2018 with the additional 8 wells scheduled for completion in the third quarter. Altogether, the operated Shook Pad wells and the additional non-operated wells will add approximately 7.5 net horizontal wells to PetroShare’s asset base, a significant increase from less than three net wells in which we currently participate. We believe these activities will result in material increases in production, revenues and EBITDA for the Company in the second half of 2018. We feel that, with successful completion of the Shook wells and participation in the additional non-operated programs listed above, our production will average between 3,000 and 3,300 BOE/d in the second half of 2018.”\nFinancial Results Release Date\nThe Company will issue fourth quarter and 2017 full year financial results on March 28, 2018.\nUpcoming Investor Conferences\nPresentations provided in conjunction with these events will be available on PetroShare’s website at www.petrosharecorp.com at the time of the respective presentation.
