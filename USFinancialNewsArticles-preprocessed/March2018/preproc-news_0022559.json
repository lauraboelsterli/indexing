FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping arrive at a state dinner at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, November 9, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter “Chinese President XI XINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea. President XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. China continues to be helpful!” Trump posted on Twitter. He also spoke by phone on Friday with French President Emmanuel Macron about North Korea and new American tariffs on some metals, the White House said on Saturday.
