    "text": "CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) â€” Wyoming-based Great Lakes Airlines has suspended all flight operations in the five states it operates.\nThe Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports that the company announced that the suspension of service was effective as of midnight Monday but said it had not entered bankruptcy.\nThe website for the Cheyenne-based airline listed flights from Cheyenne; Denver; Telluride, Colorado; Los Angeles; Phoenix; Page, Arizona; Prescott, Arizona; and Salina, Kansas.\nAccording to a statement on its website, Great Lakes will continue to provide support services to Aerodynamics Inc. charter flights between Denver and the South Dakota cities of Pierre and Watertown.\nCompany officials have attributed recent struggles with providing air service to a national pilot shortage.\nGreat Lakes Founder Doug Voss and Cheyenne Regional Airport Director Tim Barth could not immediately be reached for comment.\nInformation from: Wyoming Tribune Eagle, http://www.wyomingnews.com",
