    "text": "Should non-smokers get extra vacation days to compensate for the time smokers take off during the day for smoke breaks?\nMany workers say they should. A whopping 42% of non-smokers feel they should get 3-5 extra vacation days than non-smokers and 28% of smokers agree with that amount, according to a new survey.\nTo understand how workers feel about the time their co-workers spent smoking, e-cigarette maker Halo surveyed 1,005 American adults.\nAccording to the survey, 25% of non-smokers said 1-2 days is a fair amount. However, 14% said 6 or more days was fair.\nRead more from USA Today: \nSales of bulletproof doors and windows boom as Parkland students return to school \nDick's Sporting Goods pulled assault-style rifles after Sandy Hook, too. It didn't last. \nFive years after brawl with Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman exits losing bet against Herbalife \nMore than 38% of smokers, on the other hand, didn't think that nonsmokers deserve any extra vacation days. Twenty-percent of nonsmokers agreed they did not deserve extra vacation time.\nThe survey found that more than 81% of smokers said smoke breaks were fair. Only about 25% of non-smokers agreed.\nHow severe of a work productivity issue is caused by smoking breaks?\nThe average smoker wastes around 6 days a year on work smoke breaks, according to Joe Mercurio, Halo's project manager for the study.\nOne company giving extra vacation days a try is Japan's Piala. The marketing company in Tokyo recently added six extra vacation days for its non-smoking employees after a worker complained about smoking breaks hurting productivity.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that smoking related illnesses costs more than $156 billion in lost productivity each year in the U.S. That includes $5.6 billion due to secondhand smoke exposure.\nLooking at CDC data from 2016 , about 15% of U.S. adults 18 or older smoke cigarettes, or an estimated 37.8 million people.\nIn 1965, 45% of Americans were smokers . In 1997, 25% of Americans smoked.\nCigarette smoking accounts for more than 480,000 deaths a year and is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S.\nSo, what would it take to get smokers to give up the habit at work? According to the survey, smokers said on average that they'd give up the habit at work for 11 extra vacation days each year.",
