    "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Enterprise software veteran Doug Dennerline was named BetterWorks Executive Chairman of the Board in November 2017, and now adds CEO to his title. Dennerline brings deep experience leading high-growth enterprise software companies and businesses including Alfresco, SuccessFactors, Salesforce and the Collaboration group at Cisco Systems.\n\"As soon as I joined BetterWorks as its Executive Chairman of the Board and began spending time with the team, I was immediately impressed with the depth of the team's commitment to our mission of improving how people grow and develop at work,\" said Dennerline. \" I immediately wanted to come work alongside the team to bring this vision to life.\"\nKaren Richter, who joined as BetterWorks VP of Sales in mid-2017, said, \"Happily, this will be the third time I've worked with Doug. I cannot think of a better leader to take our next-generation product to a broader market. The entire BetterWorks team was thrilled to hear he was joining as CEO.\"\nJohn Doerr, chairman of Kleiner Perkins and board member of BetterWorks adds, \"When we initiated a CEO search for BetterWorks months ago, we put together a very long list of requirements. Doug checked every one of our boxes. The way we all work is evolving as every company's talent and continuous performance management becomes more complex. BetterWorks is uniquely well-positioned, with Doug's leadership, to bring next-generation continuous performance management to forward-thinking businesses.\"\nIn October of 2017, the BetterWorks solution was named one of HR Executive Magazine's Top Products of 2017 for combining organizational goal alignment, feedback, recognition and meaningful manager-employee conversations into a unified experience that's easily adopted by managers, employees and HR leaders alike.\nSince Dennerline joined its board in November, BetterWorks has released a Recognition Module that allows users to publicly recognize peers, and updated its mobile applications (iOS and Android). BetterWorks continues to support integrations with the most popular workflow management tools including JIRA, Salesforce, Asana and Google Sheets.\n\"As we move into the year ahead, we'll remain heavily focused on building and introducing new capabilities that enable managers and HR leaders to align individual and team skill development with business goals,\" said Vipul Galal, VP Product at BetterWorks.\nFor more information, visit www.betterworks.com .\nAbout BetterWorks\nBetterWorksÂ® is the solution of choice for forward-thinking HR and organizational leaders who want to motivate and engage their employees within a positive company culture of transparency, accountability and continuous employee development.
