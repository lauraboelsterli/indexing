    "text": "Gold fell on Tuesday as the dollar firmed while traders waited to gauge the path of U.S.\nmonetary policy for the rest of the year from the two-day Federal Reserve meeting that kicks off later in the day.\nSpot gold was down 0.52 percent to $1,309.64 per ounce at 10:13 a.m. EST. In the previous session, it touched $1,307.51 an ounce, its lowest since March 1.\nU.S. gold futures for April delivery dropped 0.65 percent to $1,309.30 per ounce.\nThe dollar rose 0.4 percent to 106.55 yen inching away from a 16-month low of 105.24 yen set early March.\n\"Gold is trading in a relatively narrow range leading into the Fed meeting, continuing a period of extremely low volatility for the precious metal,\" said Jordan Eliseo, chief economist at gold trader ABC Bullion.\nPrices for the yellow metal have not dipped below the $1,300 an-ounce level since the beginning of the year and have been trading in a $23 range since March 8.\n\"A rate hike is priced in, so the bigger question for the market is the Fed's outlook for monetary policy across the rest of the year, and how much more tightening we will see.\"\nshow chapters Uncertainty from the Fed matters to the markets: Strategist 5 Hours Ago | 04:16 Powell is expected to hike interest rates and signal three more increases this year.\nThough a rate hike today has been factored into the current price, uncertainty remains as to how further tariffs in the United States will impact global trade, said Cameron Alexander, an analyst with Thomson Reuters-owned metals consultancy GFMS.\nA hike of more than 25 basis points would push prices lower, while a significant reaction from China and European countries on (U.S.) tariffs would drive prices higher, said Alexander.\nHigher interest rates tend to boost the U.S. dollar and push bond yields up, pressuring gold prices by increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while political and financial uncertainty push up safe-haven demand for the yellow metal.\nHoldings at the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, holdings rose 1.26 percent, their best one-day percentage rise since Jan. 18, to 850.84 tonnes on Monday from 840.22 tonnes on Friday.\nAmong other precious metals, silver slipped 0.74 percent to $16.182 per ounce after matching Friday's three-month low in the previous session.\nPlatinum fell 0.89 percent to $944.50 per ounce after hitting its lowest since Jan. 3 on Monday. Palladium sunk 1.21 percent to $978 per ounce.",
