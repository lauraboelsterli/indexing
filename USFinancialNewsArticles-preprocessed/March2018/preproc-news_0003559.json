REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo The SEC also halted trading for HD 360 View, a security systems company, adding that the charges stemmed in part from an undercover FBI operation. The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York has also filed related criminal charges, the agency said. Wwriting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama",
