    "text": "CLEVELAND, March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE: TDG) announced today that it has completed the acquisition of the Kirkhill elastomers business (\"Kirkhill\") from Esterline Technologies (NYSE: ESL) for a total purchase price of $50 million in cash, subject to adjustment.\nKirkhill, headquartered in Brea, California, is a leading supplier of highly engineered aerospace elastomers. Annual revenues are approximately $90 million and the business currently employs approximately 800 people. Roughly 50% of the revenues are derived from commercial transport airframes with the remainder primarily from defense aerospace applications. The products are primarily proprietary, sole source with significant aftermarket content and used in a broad variety of most major commercial transport and military platforms. The business is also well represented on newer commercial platforms such as Boeing's 787, 777X and 737MAX; Airbus's A320NEO and A350; as well as the military JSF.\nW. Nicholas Howley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TransDigm Group Incorporated, stated, \"Kirkhill products fit well with our business strategy. Although the improvements could take a little longer to develop than for some acquisitions, we see significant opportunities to improve Kirkhill's profitability. We expect the Kirkhill acquisition to create equity value well in line with our long-term private equity type return objectives.\"\nAbout TransDigm\nTransDigm Group Incorporated, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today.
