    "text": "Chris Morris Monday, March 05, 2018 Credit: Courtesy of Paramount Pictures comments \nHollywood is nursing its collective hangover this morning now that the 2018 Academy Awards are over. While an Oscar is the highest honor an actor can take home, studios are ultimately much more interested in box office receipts. And when voting with their wallets, audiences prefer Razzie-nominated films as much as Oscar-nominated ones. \nThe Razzies is Hollywood’s other just-concluded big awards ceremony. Instead of celebrating the best the industry has to offer, they focus on the worst, with this year’s highlights including The Emoji Movie as Worst Picture and a humble acceptance speech from Dwayne Johnson for Baywatch . \nThe films might be shlock, but that didn’t make them less popular with movie goers. In fact, the five Razzie Worst Picture nominees made a collective $469 million at the box office, according to Box Office Mojo . \nThe nine Best Picture nominees from the Academy took in $694 million (again, only at the box office). \nDunkirk and Get Out made the most of the Best Picture contenders, making a collective $364 million. Best Picture winner The Shape of Water only brought in $57.4 million. Baywatch , for reference, made $58 million, while The Emoji Movie took in $86 million. \nIn fact, only three Best Picture nominees made more than the worst performing Razzie nom ( The Post joins Dunkirk and Get Out in that list). Worst Picture Nominees \nTransformers: The Last Knight – $130,168,683 Fifty Shades Darker – $114,581,250",
