    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- First Team Real Estate , Southern California's largest independent real estate brokerage, is thrilled to announce a merger with South Orange County's Star Estates—a move that will empower Star Estates' 130 agents to deliver an even greater level of quality service while boosting First Team's ability to address the area's thriving luxury marketplace.\nFor 15 years, Star Estates has been owned and operated by Michelle Williams Harrington, who will now take the role of Vice President, Broker of Record for First Team Real Estate. Meanwhile, longtime Star Estates leaders Janet Montandon and Andrea Carpenter will work as office managers—in the San Clemente and Mission Viejo offices, respectively.\nAccording to Michelle Williams Harrington, now that Star Estates is part of the First Team family, it's business as usual for the company's associates and management—but now, they'll also enjoy the many distinct advantages that come with working with an organization that's dominated Southern California's competitive real estate markets for over 40 years.\n\"Having worked for national real estate franchises before opening Star Estates, I have long been passionate about the notion that an independent real estate brokerage offers a better environment for agents and a better experience for clientele,\" she remarked. \"First Team Real Estate is not only the largest independent brokerage in Southern California—it's also a client-centric, family-oriented powerhouse that demonstrates its care for the area's communities in everything it does, and that's important to me. Just as important is the manner in which First Team empowers its agents with the tools they need to take their business to the next level. I am delighted that Star Estates' 130 agents now have access to a suite of resources and amenities, enabling them to bring an additional layer of value to their beloved clients.\"\nAdds Michael Mahon, President of First Team Real Estate, just as Star Estates will reap the benefits of joining forces with his organization, First Team will now augment its ability to serve the area's luxury market.\n\"First Team Real Estate has long been the luxury leader in Southern California, and now that Star Estates is part of our family, we're stronger than ever before in that capacity,\" Mahon stated. \"Given our agents' focus on teamwork, Star Estates' presence in South Orange County's luxury market equates to a heightened level of opportunity for all our luxury clients while increasing our luxury sales volume. Most importantly, South Orange County's homebuyers and sellers now have access to our unique brand of service and care.\"\n\"At First Team Real Estate, the core principles upon which our business was founded center around care—care for our agents, care for our clients, and care for our communities,\" said Cameron Merage, First Team's Founder and CEO. \"Given that Star Estates operates according to similar philosophies, the organization fits perfectly within our culture, offering the area's buyers and sellers an experience that's truly exceptional in every regard.\"\nABOUT FIRST TEAM REAL ESTATE\nBeginning with a single office in Huntington Beach in 1976, First Team Real Estate is now Southern California's largest, full-service and trusted family-owned real estate agency with 27 offices across Southern California and over 2,000 real estate agents, service professionals, and employees. First Team is consistently recognized as Best Real Estate Company by Orange County Register, and mentioned among the nation's top 20 firms in RISMedia's Power Broker Report and the REAL Trends 500, which identify the largest volume brokerages in the United States.
