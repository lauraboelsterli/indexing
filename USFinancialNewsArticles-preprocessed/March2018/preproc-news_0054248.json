(the \"Company\" or \"Ever-Glory\") (NASDAQ-GM: EVK), a retailer of branded fashion apparel and a leading global apparel supply chain solution provider, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nMr. Yihua Kang, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ever-Glory, said, \"We are very pleased to announce the 2017 full year results with a 10.2% year-over-year increase in retail sales and a 1.1% year-over-year increase in wholesale sales. Notably, we achieved full year net income attributable to the Company of $12.5 million, representing an 84.2% year-over-year increase from 2016. In addition, we closed out the fourth quarter with an 18.2% year-over-year growth of our total sales, capping a year of sequential quarterly growth. I'm encouraged by the performance achieved in 2017 as our teams executed well across all parts of the business.\n\"Our four retail brands continue to attract new customers and retain existing customers by focusing on design, quality and value,\" Mr. Kang continued. Our inventory management strategy continually improves the balance between inventory turnover and sales growth, and our diligent cost control measures further strengthen the profitability of our business. The results we've seen this year make me very confident and very optimistic in our retail business' future growth prospects.\"\n\"Looking at our wholesale business, while total revenue remained relatively flat for 2017 compared with 2016, wholesale gross margin continued to improve on a year-over-year basis. The overall market conditions in many of our key global markets remained challenging. However, we experienced encouraging sales results from Hong Kong, Germany and the United States in 2017. Although the overall consumption market remains weak, I firmly believe in our product development and supply chain management capabilities to drive the future growth of our wholesales business,\" concluded Mr. Kang.\nMr. Jason Jiansong Wang, Chief Financial Officer of Ever-Glory, added, \"Our relentless efforts have been paying off evidenced by solid 2017 full year results and furthermore, operating efficiency continued to improve in 2017, demonstrating our ability to control costs in the weak market environment. Overall gross margin increased by 180 basis points, with retail gross margin and wholesale gross margin increasing by 110 basis points and 140 basis points respectively, compared with 2016. Looking at 2018, we look forward to further strengthening the fundamentals and increasing operating leverage to support the long-term profitability of our business.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $130.4 million, an increase of 18.2% from $110.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
