We also acquired two market-leading technology companies that provide digital solutions to automotive dealers, thereby accelerating achievement of our strategic priorities, as well as adding relevant value-added products for our national sales channel to generate significant revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We believe these investments will strengthen our value proposition and our relationships with dealer customers, drive financial and operational performance and further build shareholder value.\"\nVetter continued, \"Since becoming a publicly traded company just nine months ago, we have transformed our business by building opportunities for organic growth, pursuing transactions to facilitate early conversions of affiliate markets and integrating new solutions into our online platform. We have made strategic investments in technology and product innovation, including the introduction of Salesperson Connect and further advancement of our Lot Insights technology, both of which represent exciting steps forward in our goal of providing a more sophisticated product offering to our dealers and a more comprehensive, innovative shopping solution for consumers. As we look to 2018, Cars.com is well positioned to continue enhancing shareholder value.\"\n2017 Full Year R esults\nRevenue for 2017 was $626.3 million compared to $633.1 million in 2016 primarily attributable to a 4% decline in wholesale revenues partially offset by slight growth in retail revenues.\nTotal operating expenses for 2017 were $492.0 million compared to $456.5 million for the prior year. The majority of the $35.5 million increase in operating expenses was driven by a $21.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses which included $12.9 million of costs primarily associated with the spin-off transaction and the headquarters relocation, $8.0 million of incremental public company costs, and $2.6 million of stock based compensation expense, offset by cost efficiencies. The remaining increase in operating expenses was attributable to increases in cost of revenue and operations related to changes in revenue mix and increased marketing spend, offset in part by a decline in sales expense.\nNet income for 2017 was $224.4 million, which includes a tax benefit of $131.0 million primarily associated with the adjustment of deferred tax liabilities, compared to $176.4 million in 2016. Adjusted net income for the year was $165.7 million compared to $250.6 million in the prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $238.9 million, or 38.2% of revenue, compared to $260.0 million, or 41.1% of revenue, in the prior year period. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nCars.com continues to be focused on gaining greater share of consumer audience. Average monthly unique visitor count grew 1% in 2017. Although total traffic (visits) declined 3% year-over-year, total traffic (visits) has grown mid-single digits in January and February 2018. Cars.com remains focused on growing in the mobile leadership space, reporting 6% growth in mobile traffic year-over-year. Mobile traffic represented 59% of total traffic in 2017 compared to 54% in the prior year. Mobile app traffic in 2017 was 24% of total traffic for the year compared to 22% in 2016.\nDealer customers were 21,296 at the end of 2017, which was essentially flat compared to 21,307 at the end of the third quarter of 2017. Direct dealer customers of 14,356 were up 3% compared to the third quarter's direct dealer customers of 13,963 (up 1% excluding dealer customers transferred due to the early conversion of certain of the McClatchy markets). Affiliate dealer customers of 6,940 were down 6% compared to the third quarter's affiliate dealer customers of 7,344 (down 2% excluding dealer customers transferred to our direct sales channel due to the early conversion of certain of the McClatchy markets).\nQ4 R esults\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $156.6 million compared to $161.7 million in the prior year period. This reflects softness in the national advertising business, which declined 7% compared to the prior year primarily due to timing of advertiser spend as well as advertisers shifting spend to programmatic.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $117.7 million compared to $112.8 million for the prior year period. This increase of $4.9 million was driven by a $3.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses, reflecting $2.7 million of incremental public company costs, $0.7 million of non-recurring costs, $0.4 million of write-off of assets and $1.1 million of stock based compensation expense. The remaining increase in operating expenses was attributable to increases in cost of revenue and operations related to changes in revenue mix and increased marketing spend offset in part by a decline in sales expense.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $151.8 million compared to $48.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which includes a tax benefit of $131.0 million primarily associated with the adjustment of deferred tax liabilities. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $34.2 million compared to $68.0 million for the prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $63.5 million, or 40.6% of revenue, compared to $70.5 million, or 43.6% of revenue, for the prior year period.\nAverage monthly unique visitor count was flat in the fourth quarter of 2017, and total traffic (visits) for the fourth quarter declined 2%, compared prior year period.\nMobile traffic grew 6% year-over-year. Mobile traffic at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 was 60% of total traffic compared to 56% in the same period of the year prior. Mobile app traffic was 25% of total traffic for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 24% in the same period of the year prior.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $185.9 million for 2017 compared to $199.2 million for the prior year. Free cash flow was $153.2 million for the full year of 2017 compared to $189.5 million in 2016. Note that in 2017 the Company incurred incremental capital expenditures of $23.0 million related to the cost of its new corporate office space, $11.8 million in cash interest payments and $11.5 million in cash income tax payments, partially offset by $15.8 million in cash received from lease incentives.\nCash and cash equivalents was $20.6 million and debt outstanding was $583.8 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company made $91.3 million in debt repayments during 2017.\n\"We continue to benefit from our strong balance sheet and flexible capital structure. This was evidenced by our recent acquisition of Dealer Inspire and Launch Digital Marketing, for which we were able to utilize our existing revolving credit facility while maintaining modest leverage,\" said Becky Sheehan, Chief Financial Officer of Cars.com.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company expects to achieve approximately 10% to 11% revenue growth in 2018, consisting of approximately 3% to 4% revenue growth from its organic business, which includes the previously announced transitions of the tronc and McClatchy affiliate markets and approximately $45 million from the acquisition of Dealer Inspire and LDM, reflecting a partial year of ownership. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 34% (excluding the acquisition, adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 35%). Dealer Inspire and LDM are expected to deliver adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 15% in 2018. The Company continues to expect the acquisition of Dealer Inspire and LDM to be accretive to adjusted net income per share in 2018 and to GAAP EPS in 2019, reflecting intangible amortization.\nFourth Quarter Earnings Call\nAs previously announced, management will hold a conference call and webcast today at 7:30 a.m. CST.

These are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. These financial measures are presented as supplemental measures of operating performance because we believe they provide meaningful information regarding our performance and provide a basis to compare operating results between periods. In addition, we use adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure. These non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by our lenders, securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.\nOther companies may define or calculate these measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the tables below.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income before (1) interest income, (expense), net, (2) income tax expense (benefit), (3) depreciation, (4) amortization of intangible assets, (5) stock-based compensation, (6) write-off and impairments of assets, plus (7) certain other items, such as transaction related costs, restructuring costs and costs related to the headquarters move. Amortization of unfavorable contracts liability is not adjusted out of adjusted EBITDA.\nWe define adjusted net income as net income excluding the after-tax impact of (1) amortization of intangible assets, (2) stock-based compensation, (3) write-off and impairments of assets, and (4) certain other items, such as transaction related costs, restructuring costs and costs related to the headquarters move. Amortization of unfavorable contracts liability is not adjusted out of adjusted net income.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, including purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs.\nKey Metric Definitions\nTraffic (Visits). Traffic (visits) and our ability to generate traffic are key to our business. Tracking our traffic performance is a critical measure. Traffic to the Cars.com network of websites and mobile apps provides value to our advertisers in terms of audience, awareness, consideration and conversion. In addition to tracking traffic volume and sources, we monitor activity on our properties, allowing us to innovate and refine our consumer-facing offerings. Traffic is an internal metric representing the number of visits to Cars.com desktop and mobile properties (web browser and apps). Visits refer to the number of times visitors accessed Cars.com properties during the period, no matter how many visitors make up those visits. Traffic (visits) numbers provide an indication of our consumer reach. Although our consumer reach does not directly result in revenue, we believe our ability to reach diverse demographic audiences is attractive to our dealer customers and national advertisers.\nDealer Customers. Our value to consumers tracks to our ability to showcase the inventory of our dealer and Original Equipment Manufacturer (\"OEM\") customers. The larger the advertiser base, the more inventory and options that are available for consumers to review. Dealer Customers represents the car dealerships using our products as of the end of each reporting period. Each dealership location is counted separately, whether it is a single-location proprietorship or part of a large consolidated dealer group. Multi-franchise dealerships at a single location are counted as one dealer.\nAverage Vehicle Listings. Our value to consumers tracks to our ability to showcase the inventory of our dealer and OEM customers. The more vehicle listings that are available for consumers to review, the more traffic we attract and the higher the consumer engagement. Average Vehicle Listings represents the daily average of vehicles listed for sale on Cars.com properties. The daily average is calculated on a monthly basis and averaged for the reporting period.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \" \" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including those statements under \"Financial Objectives.\" All statements other than statements of historical facts are .
