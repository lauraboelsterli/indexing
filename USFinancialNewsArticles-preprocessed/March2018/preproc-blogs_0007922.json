    "text": "Toyota said a new venture would be investing more than $2.8 billion to develop automated-driving software â€” the latest salvo in an increasingly frenetic battle to be ahead in a sector hit by a slew of disruptive technologies.\nThe Tokyo -based venture, which will bring together some 1,000 employees including new hires, will be 90 percent held by Toyota with group suppliers Denso and Aisin Seiki each taking 5 percent.\n\"This company's mission is to accelerate software development in a more effective and disruptive way, by augmenting the Toyota Group's capability through the hiring of world-class software engineers,\" James Kuffner, who will lead the venture, said in a statement.\nThe establishment of the new venture, Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development, comes as firms such as Alphabet's Waymo and Tesla give traditional automakers a run for their money in building self-driving and electric cars.\nEnglish is set to be the main business language of the new venture, the statement said.\nToyota is also investing $1 billion in artificial intelligence and other technologies through its U.S.-based Toyota Research Institute, and has struck up technology partnerships with Microsoft Corp and Uber Technologies.\nLast month, Toyota Research Institute's venture capital unit said it was co-leading an $11.5-million seed investment in May Mobility, an Ann Arbor-based startup that is developing self-driving shuttles for college campuses, central business districts, and similar low-speed applications.",
