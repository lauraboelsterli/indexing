    "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has postponed an upcoming Arab Summit in Riyadh to April, saying the original date in late March clashed with Egyptâ€™s presidential election, the Saudi chairman of an Arab League meeting said on Wednesday.\nAt a joint press conference with Arab League Chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Ahmed al-Qattan, state minister for African affairs, also said that the Arab states will seek to prevent Israel from gaining a rotating seat on the U.N. Security Council in 2019.\nWinning a Security Council seat requires a two-thirds majority in the 193-nation General Assembly. Candidates are proposed by the five regional groups but election to the council is done by the full assembly.\nReporting by Omar Fahmy; Writing by Nadine Awadalla; Editing by Dominic Evans\n ",
