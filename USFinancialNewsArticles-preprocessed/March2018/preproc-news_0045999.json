    "text": "March 26, 2018 \nIf you’ve been hoping for a rose gold iPhone X, your dreams may be coming true. \nApple plans to introduce a rose gold version of the high-end phone, according to Japanese tech blog Mac Otakara , to go with the existing and relatively monochromatic palette of options: silver and space gray. \nThe site didn’t name a source for the rumor, but the information mirrors an identical report from last week by well-known Apple leak recipient Ben Geskin. He tweeted an image of a rose gold version of the phone and said that the device was “in production,” Mac Rumors reports . \nApple introduced the iPhone X, which starts at $999, in November of 2017 as its top-of-the-line smartphone. But some analysts say it hasn’t been as big a seller as anticipated thanks to its high price tag, and perhaps an additional color will help increase its appeal.
