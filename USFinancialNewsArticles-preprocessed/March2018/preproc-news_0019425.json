    "text": "NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the worldâ€™s largest publicly traded oil producer, said on Wednesday it expects its earnings to more than double by 2025 to $31 billion with crude prices at or above current levels.\nThe company said exploration projects in Guyana and the Permian Basin as well as refining and chemical plant expansions, should help boost earnings. The company reported an adjusted profit of $15 billion in 2017.\nExxon has come under increasing pressure from Wall Street analysts in recent years to boost returns, which have lagged its four largest publicly traded peers.\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ",
