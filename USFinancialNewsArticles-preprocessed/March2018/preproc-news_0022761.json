    "text": "(Reuters) - Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd ( AVGO.O ) said on Monday it expects to redomicile to the United States by April 3, two days before the chipmaker’s acquisition target Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) holds its annual shareholder meeting.\nA sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd, is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake Broadcom’s $117 billion offer to buy California-based Qualcomm is being reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for potential national security threats.\nBroadcom said such security concerns were not a risk to the closure of the proposed buyout as it never planned to finish the deal before completing moving its official base to the United States.\nBroadcom is incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.\nBroadcom said last week that CFIUS has ordered the company to provide it with five business days’ notice before taking any action toward moving base to the United States.\nThe requirement showed that CFIUS, an inter-agency panel led by the U.S. Treasury, was aware that its jurisdiction could be contested if Broadcom redomiciles to the United States.\nCFIUS had delayed Qualcomm’s annual meeting by a month to April 5. In that meeting, shareholders will also vote for Broadcom’s slate of six nominees for Qualcomm’s 11-member board.\nSince disclosing its first bid, worth $103 billion, for Qualcomm on Nov. 6, Broadcom has revised its bid twice, but is yet to strike a deal.\nDays before the first bid in November, U.S. President Donald Trump said Broadcom planned to redomicile to the United States from Singapore.\n(This version of the story corrects to show Broadcom is co-headquartered in Singapore and San Jose, not Irvine in paragraph four)\nReporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Savio D'Souza\n ",
