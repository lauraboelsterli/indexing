    "text": "College applicants are increasingly stressed over paying the tab March 27, 2018 \n“College costs have outpaced the rate of inflation,” said Robert Franek, The Princeton Review’s editor in chief. “But it’s good for parents and students to know the difference between the sticker price and what many families actually pay.” ( That’s the difference between the full tuition price and any need-based and merit aid that a student receives.) \nYour net price is a college’s tuition and fees minus grants, scholarships and education tax benefits, according to the College Board. \nIn fact, some schools with high sticker prices also have very deep pockets for financial aid , Franek said. \nFor this year’s crop of applicants, a whopping 99 percent of students and their parents said financial aid would be necessary to pay for college and 65 percent said it was “extremely necessary,” according to The Princeton Review. \nWhen asked which part of the application process was the toughest, the majority of college hopefuls said it was completing the application and financial aid forms, followed by college admission tests. \nStill, not too many people, it turns out, make their decision based on price . And nearly all students and parents believe college is worth the investment. \nMore from College Game Plan: ",
