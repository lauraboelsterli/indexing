    "text": "Smartwatches could detect a common heart-rhythm disorder with relatively high accuracy when people were at rest, but less so when participants were physically active, a new study found.\n\nThe study, led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, tested the use of the heart-rate sensor and step counter built into Apple Inc.â€™s Apple Watch, to try to detect atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that can cause blood clots and strokes if left untreated. Researchers used a mobile application from Cardiogram...  ",
