A Porsche logo is seen at a customers center next to the the Porsche factory in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen, Germany, January 26, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski Porsche Automobil Holding SE, which controls a 52.2 percent voting stake in Volkswagen, the world’s largest carmaker, said its board of directors would be extended from six to 10 members, allowing some fourth-generation members of the clan to gain a seat. Hans-Peter Porsche, a grandson of VW Beetle designer Ferdinand Porsche, will resign from the supervisory board, and hand control to Josef Michael Ahorner, Stefan Piëch, and Peter Daniell Porsche, the company said. Ahorner is founder and chairman of the supervisory board of the marketing platform Emarsys AG while Stefan Piëch, son of former Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech, is director of media company Your Family Entertainment AG, Munich. Peter Daniell Porsche is the owner of the holding company PDP Holding GmbH, Salzburg, the company said. The fourth generation family members will sit on the Porsche Automobil Holding board alongside Wolfgang Porsche, Hans Michel Piech, Ferdinand Oliver Porsche, and Hans-Peter Porsche. Some clan members including Luise Kiesling, Hans Michel Piech, Ferdinand Oliver Porsche, and Wolfgang Porsche also sit on the supervisory board of separately listed Volkswagen AG.
