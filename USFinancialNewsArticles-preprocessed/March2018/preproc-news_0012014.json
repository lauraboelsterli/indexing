    "text": "BATON ROUGE, La., Amedisys, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMED), one of the nation’s leading home healthcare, hospice and personal care companies, announced today that it has acquired the right to operate in 10 counties in western Kentucky from Christian Care Communities.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Amedisys acquired the right to operate in six new CON counties and four overlapping counties in the region. These counties will be serviced by established Amedisys agencies in Owensboro and Bowling Green, Kentucky. These agencies earned 4 and 4.5 Stars out of a possible five, respectively, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) for Quality of Patient Care, both above the national average.\n“This agreement is exciting because it allows already high-performing care centers to expand their reach, care for more patients and help us continue to grow our home health business,” stated Amedisys President and CEO Paul Kusserow. “I look forward to welcoming these clinicians and patients into the Amedisys family.”\nForward-Looking Statements:\nWhen included in this press release, words like “believes,” “belief,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “may,” “might,” “would,” “should” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described therein. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the following: changes in Medicare and other medical payment levels, our ability to open care centers, acquire additional care centers and integrate and operate these care centers effectively, changes in or our failure to comply with existing Federal and State laws or regulations or the inability to comply with new government regulations on a timely basis, competition in the healthcare industry, our ability to integrate our personal care segment into our business efficiently, changes in the case mix of patients and payment methodologies, changes in estimates and judgments associated with critical accounting policies, our ability to maintain or establish new patient referral sources, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, changes in payments and covered services due to the economic downturn and deficit spending by federal and state governments, future cost containment initiatives undertaken by third-party payors, our access to financing, our ability to meet debt service requirements and comply with covenants in debt agreements, business disruptions due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism, our ability to integrate, manage and keep our information systems secure, our ability to comply with requirements stipulated in our corporate integrity agreement and changes in law or developments with respect to any litigation relating to the Company, including various other matters, many of which are beyond our control.\nBecause forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction of future events. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking and we do not intend to release publicly any updates or changes in our expectations concerning the forward-looking statements or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances upon which any forward-looking statement may be based, except as required by law.\nAbout Amedisys:\nAmedisys, Inc. is a leading healthcare at home Company delivering personalized home health, hospice and personal care.
