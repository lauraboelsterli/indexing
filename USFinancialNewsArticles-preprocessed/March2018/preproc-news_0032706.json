(NYSE:ORA) today filed its 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nThe financial statements contained in the Form 10-K reflect no changes to the operational results we reported in our March 1, 2018 earnings release. That earnings release, however, did not include certain financial information affected by our tax accounts which we normally include in our year-end earnings release. That additional information is reflected in the chart below:\n($ millions, except per share amounts) Q4\n2017 Q4\n2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Revenues Electricity $ 128.5 $ 114.6 12.1 % $ 468.3 $ 436.3 7.3 % Product $ 37.9 $ 51.9 -27.0 % $ 224.5 $ 226.3 -0.8 % Total Revenues $ 166.4 $ 166.5 -0.1 % $ 692.8 $ 662.6 4.6 % Gross margin (%) Electricity ( 1 ) 41.6 % 39.7 % 41.9 % 40.0 % Product 28.7 % 40.8 % 32.2 % 42.5 % Gross margin (%) 38.7 % 40.0 % 38.7 % 40.9 % Operating income $ 48.4 $ 51.2 -5.5 % $ 205.0 $ 201.9 1.6 % Income before income taxes and equity in losses of investees $ 40.0 $ 36.7 9.1 % $ 170.7 $ 141.1 21.0 % Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders $ 66.0 $ 28.2 133.7 % $ 155.5 $ 93.9 65.5 % Diluted EPS $ 1.29 $ 0.56 $ 3.06 $ 1.87 Adjusted Net income attributable to the Company’s stockholders (2) $ 66.0 $ 28.2 133.7 % $ 151.9 $ 109.9 38.2 % Adjusted Diluted EPS $ 1.29 $ 0.56 $ 2.99 $ 2.19 Adjusted EBITDA ( 3 ) $ 87.4 $ 76.9 13.6 % $ 343.8 $ 323.8 6.2 % 1 Electricity revenues for the full year ended December 31, 2017 includes $2.7 million of revenues and $5.4 million cost of revenues from Viridity. Electricity revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes $0.5 million of revenues and $1.9 million cost of revenues from Viridity. 2 Adjusted Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the full year 2017 excludes a net of $3.6 million related to; (1) a $5.5 million of a one-time benefit related to tax restructuring recorded in the second quarter of 2017, and (2) a $1.9 million expense attributable to a one-time make whole premium paid in connection with the prepayment of OFC Senior Secured Notes and DEG loan, recorded in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders for the full year 2016 excludes $16 million related to: (1) $11.0 million of one-time settlement expenses and (2) $5.0 million of one-time prepayment fees, both recorded in the third quarter of 2016. 3 The way we compute Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below in this release. We have completed the additional review procedures related to accounting for income tax and financial reporting referenced in our March 1, 2018 press release, and the Form 10-K discloses the results of that review and the related remediation plan that we are in the process of implementing.\nYou can obtain copies of the Form 10-K, which contains our audited financial statements, as well as any of our other SEC filings from the SEC’s website ( www.sec.gov ).\nABOUT ORMAT TECHNOLOGIES\nWith over five decades of experience, Ormat Technologies, Inc. is a leading geothermal Company and the only vertically integrated company engaged in geothermal and recovered energy generation (REG), with the objective of becoming a leading global provider of renewable energy.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Additional Cash Flows Information\nFor the Three and Twelve-Month Periods Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(Unaudited)\nWe calculate EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for (i) termination fees, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets, (iii) write-off of unsuccessful exploration activities, (iv) any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, (v) merger and acquisition transaction costs, (vi) stock-based compensation, (vii) gain from extinguishment of liability, and (viii) gain on sale of subsidiary and property, plant and equipment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net earnings as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of a Company’s ability to service and/or incur debt. However, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.\nThe following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThree Months Ended December 31 Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) (in thousands) Net income $ 69,427 $ 31,232 $ 170,184 $ 101,516 Adjusted for: Interest expense, net (including amortization of deferred financing costs) 12,860 15,688 53,154 66,418 Income tax provision (29,669 ) 2,450 (1,411 ) 31,837 Adjustment to investment in unconsolidated company: — — — our proportionate share in interest, tax and depreciation and amortization (265 ) (265 ) Depreciation and amortization 31,652 25,868 108,693 99,141 EBITDA $ 84,005 $ 75,238 $ 330,355 $ 298,912 Mark-to-market on derivatives instruments (700 ) (478 ) (1,500 ) 319 Stock-based compensation 1,556 1,774 8,760 5,157 Gain on sale of subsidiary and property, plant and equipment — — — (686 ) Loss from extinguishment of liability — — 1,950 5,780 Settlement expenses — — — 11,000 Merger and acquisition transaction cost 760 100 2,460 335 Write-off of unsuccessful exploration activities 1,796 303 1,796 3,017 Adjusted EBITDA $ 87,417 $ 76,937 $ 343,821 $ 323,834\nOrmat Technologies Contact:\nSmadar Lavi\nVP Corporate Finance and Head of Investor Relations\n775-356-9029 (ext. 65726)\nslavi@ormat.com\nInvestor Relations Agency Contact:\nRob Fink\nHayden - IR\n646-415-8972\nrob@haydenir.com\nSource:Ormat Technologies, Inc.",
