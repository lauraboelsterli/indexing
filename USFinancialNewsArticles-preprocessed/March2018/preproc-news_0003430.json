    "text": "NEW YORK, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UBM Brazil announced that it has acquired Grupo CanalEnergia, the leading events and media company in the Brazilian energy sector. The acquisition furthers UBM’s strategy to expand its operations in Brazil and in Latin American renewables.\nGrupo CanalEnergia is focused on leading events, media, Canalenergia.com .br and training exclusively dedicated to the Brazilian energy sector. Their portfolio of events includes among others ENASE, Brazil Windpower, Brazil Solar Power, Energy Expo Forum and Mercado Livre’s Annual Meeting.\nUBM, an international events organizer, will use its expertise, scale and reach to grow and enhance Grupo CanalEnergia’s trade shows, conferences, and training programs. Grupo CanalEnergia’s CEO and founder Rodrigo Ferreira will remain on in a management capacity following the acquisition. Mr. Ferreira, who founded Grupo CanalEnergia nearly two decades ago, said, “The renewable industry as a whole will be strengthened by this partnership, allowing the company we founded 17 years ago to modernize and develop more quickly thanks to UBM’s scale and existing presence in the energy sector. As demand for renewable energy sources grows and the market opens up to more private investment, we expect our shows to flourish under UBM’s leadership.”\nUBM Brazil’s existing portfolio is focused on driving business-to-business connections in a variety of sectors, such as healthcare, civil construction, transportation, food & beverage and packaging. Worldwide, UBM has a growing portfolio of renewable energy events in India, South-East Asia, the USA, Mexico and Argentina. This network will provide Grupo CanalEnergia with global reach.\n“The renewable energy sector is a rapidly evolving market, and is an increasingly important part of the Brazilian energy sector. Acquiring Grupo CanalEnergia makes us the leader in this market in Brazil and throughout Latin America, where we recently made two important acquisitions in the energy sector: Mexico International Renewable Energy Congress (MIREC) and Argentina International Renewable Energy Congress (AIREC). With this acquisition, UBM strengthens its commitment to developing and growing its portfolio, and to creating connections for renewable energy experts across the globe.” says Jean-Francois Quentin, CEO of UBM Brazil.\nABOUT UBM | UBM is the largest pure-play B2B events organizer in the world.
