    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 5:17 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Brazil court blocks inclusion of choice oil blocks in March round Reuters Staff \n(Adds detail on reason for court decision) \nBy Marta Nogueira \nRIO DE JANEIRO, March 28 (Reuters) - A Brazilian court has blocked the inclusion of two top quality blocks in an oil auction this week, the mining and oil ministry said on Wednesday, adding that it plans to include the areas in future auctions this year. \nOil Secretary Marcio Felix said the government would seek to undo the decision, without providing details. But he said success was unlikely before the round on Thursday, which will grant companies concessions to explore and produce in the areas. \nThe move casts a big shadow over the concession-style auction by removing some of its most sought-after acreage. \nThe two blocks withdrawn from Thursday’s auction are located in the offshore Santos basin and boasted minimum signing bonuses of 1.65 billion reais ($494.34 million) and 1.9 billion reias each. \nBoth areas were thought to include geology from Brazil’s coveted pre-salt play, where billions of barrels of oil are buried under thousands of feet of salt beneath the ocean floor. The blocks also lie close to the Saturno block which is slated to be auctioned in June. \nBy law, blocks within the pre-salt polygon must be auctioned through so-called production-sharing agreements, where companies compete to offer the government the biggest share of so-called profit oil after costs. \nFelix said the court’s rationale was centered on the fact that the government could make more money if it auctioned off the two areas through production sharing arrangements instead of concessions. $1 = 3.34 reais Reporting by Luciano Costa; Editing by Cynthia Osterman",
