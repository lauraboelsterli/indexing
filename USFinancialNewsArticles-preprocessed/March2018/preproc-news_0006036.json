    "text": "(Reuters) - Canadian oil and gas producer Husky Energy Inc ( HSE.TO ) posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday and resumed dividend payments after more than two years as it benefits from rising oil prices.\nHusky said it would pay a C$0.075 per share dividend for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. The company scrapped dividends in 2016 as a response to falling oil prices amid a global glut.\nAn OPEC-led supply limit deal struck that year has helped oil prices improve. Average realized prices for Husky’s upstream business jumped 17 percent to C$46.69 per barrel of oil equivalent in the reported quarter.\nHusky has also been investing in its offshore business in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada to protect itself from falling prices in oil-rich Alberta due to pipeline problems.\nUpstream production came in at 320,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) compared with 327,000 boe/d a year earlier, which included 20,200 boe/d in assets that Husky has since sold.\nNet earnings rose to C$672 million ($523 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, from C$186 million a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Husky earned 23 Canadian cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ",
