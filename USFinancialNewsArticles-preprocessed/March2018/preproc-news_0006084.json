Elfrid Payton had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Suns, who avoided their first winless month in the 50-year history of the franchise, minimum five games played.\nPhoenix, which had not won since beating Dallas on Jan. 31, broke an eight-game road losing streak.\nMarc Gasol had 22 points and 13 rebounds and Andrew Harrison had 20 points for the Grizzlies, who have not won since beating the Suns at home on Jan. 29. Memphis was 0-10 in February.\nJarell Martin had 16 points and JaMychal Green had 12 points and 12 boards for the Grizzlies, who played with leading scorer Tyreke Evans for the third straight game. Evans is averaging 19.3 points a game.\nPhoenix won three of the four in the season series, with this the first road victory.\nThe Suns led by 14 with 7:28 remaining. Memphis, which shot only 37.9 percent to Phoenix’s 45.8 percent, twice got within five but never was closer.\nBooker has scored 40, 30, 27, 28 and 34 points and has 17 3-pointers in five games back after missing four with a hip injury. He made one trey Wednesday.\nJackson has 10 20-point games in his past 20 contests after having one in his first 43. His previous career high was 23.\nJackson banked in a running 3-pointer from the top of the key at the halftime buzzer for a 57-54 halftime lead. He had 17 points in the first half.\nThe Suns led by as many as seven in the third quarter and never trailed in the second half.\nForward TJ Warren, the Suns’ second-leading scorer with a 19.5 average, did not play after sustaining a bruised tailbone against New Orleans on Monday. Jackson started in his place.\nSuns center Tyson Chandler missed his fifth straight game and seventh in his past eight due to neck spasms.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
