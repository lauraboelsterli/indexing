Earlier, Trump said he was willing to strike a deal that could exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs.\n“As has been in the past, what President Trump says and what finally actually materializes are two different things,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\n“It might be just wise to sit on the sidelines before we get some more clarity.”\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 75.2 points, or 0.3 percent, to 24,726.16, the S&P 500 lost 2.68 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,724.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.99 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,394.66.\nMarkets have been roiled over the past week by Trump’s plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum that have sparked fears of a global trade war.\n“It’s a news environment where people aren’t really sure what is going to happen,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.\n“That’s the big thing that’s different this year versus last year: you’re seeing more of this volatility as people try to sort out some new regimes that are out there,” Delwiche said.\nThe U.S. healthcare sector was rattled as health insurer Cigna Corp said it would buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co for about $54 billion. Express Scripts shares jumped 8.6 percent while Cigna dropped 10.9 percent.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.8607 percent, from 2.883 percent late on Wednesday.\nOil prices fell and were setting up for a second consecutive weekly drop as the dollar strengthened and concerns over rising U.S. crude production continued to mount on signs of an inventory build at a key U.S. storage hub.\nU.S. crude fell 1.73 percent to $60.09 per barrel and Brent was at $63.50, down 1.31 percent.\nSpot gold dropped 0.3 percent to $1,321.56 an ounce.\nAdditional reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, Dhara Ranasinghe, Tommy Wilkes and Marc Jones in London; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Lisa Shumaker\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
