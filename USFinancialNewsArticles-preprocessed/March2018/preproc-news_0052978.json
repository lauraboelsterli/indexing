    "text": "DAVIS, Calif., March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc. (“MBI” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:MBII), a leading provider of bio-based pest management and plant health products for the agriculture, turf and ornamental and water treatment markets, has provided its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nGAAP revenues grew 29.4% to $18.2 million in 2017, compared to $14.0 million in 2016. GAAP revenues grew 23.3% to $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Product shipments 1 grew 16.2% to $19.0 million for 2017, compared to $16.4 million in 2016. Product shipments were $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin increased significantly to 42.0% in 2017, compared to 32.2% in 2016. Gross margin increased to 46.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 39.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016. In February 2018, the Company completed a comprehensive series of private placement financing and debt restructuring transactions, which generated approximately $27.3 million of net proceeds and converted $45.0 million of prior debt into equity.\nManagement Commentary\n“We begin 2018 healthier than ever,” said Dr. Pam Marrone, CEO of MBI. “From a capital standpoint, we have eliminated the vast majority of our debt, and we now have cash to fund operations, service our remaining indebtedness and support future development goals. The entire company is focused on accelerating revenue growth and increasing gross margins through process and scale improvements, while managing our working capital. We launched two more products in 2017 and now have seven products from six new active ingredients – unparalleled productivity.\n“We were able to grow GAAP revenues almost 30% to a record $18.2 million in 2017, while significantly increasing gross margins to 42.0%. This is despite unfavorable weather in key growing regions. We continued to grow our international business by signing four new international distribution agreements to diversify geographically, which should help smooth out lumpy quarters. Our 2017 field data from around the globe showed impressive results in key crops like bananas and coffee and in a key market, Brazil.\n“We launched two new commercial products in 2017: Haven®, a sun protectant, and Stargus TM , a biofungicide, addressing downy mildew and white mold, which complements our existing biofungicide Regalia. Both new products have performed exceptionally well in field trials and we look forward to expanding them across the NAFTA region. We believe Stargus TM and its row crop counterpart, Amplitude TM , open up important new market segments, such as eastern grapes and succulent and dry beans, peas and lentils. An additional significant 2017 milestone was first sales of another one of our active ingredients through our valued partner, Albaugh, LLC, in the fast growing row crop seed treatment market.”\nDr. Marrone concluded: “Our recent financing and comprehensive debt restructuring transaction was truly transformative, providing us the tools we need to aggressively execute upon our business plan. We are concentrating on enhancing our sales and marketing organization and capabilities, increasing product awareness and educating growers.”\n1 See notes at the end of this release for additional information related to non-GAAP financial measures.\nRecent Operational Highlights\nLaunched two new Active Ingredients: Haven® sun protectant, and Stargus TM biofungicide and our first turf product, Zelto TM bioinsecticide/nematicide. Completed the development of MBI-014 (formerly 010), an organic bioherbicide, with EPA submission planned in the near-term. Signed international distribution agreements for Central America, Morocco & North Africa, Kenya, Mexico and the Philippines. Finalized a distribution agreement with a large water treatment company, Solenis LLC, for Zequanox. Implemented a strategy and focus to address grower demand of MBI products within the cannabis market through the creation of smaller pack sizes, hiring a cannabis segment sales specialist and utilizing Amazon as a direct-to-consumer sales channel. Albaugh, LLC, a major agrichemical company, had a successful launch season with their BIO ST TM seed treatment containing a MBI microorganism, showing yield increases over the competitive standards. Seed treatment for row crops is a growth driver for MBI. As part of MBI’s collaboration with Evogene, transgenic plants carrying genes from MBI’s novel insecticidal bacteria were developed and showed promising efficacy (100% kill) against pest caterpillars. Realized exceptional results from field trials in several countries around the globe, such as key banana, citrus and coffee diseases and pests. Particularly noteworthy are results from Brazil, paving the way for registration of Grandevo, Venerate and Majestene.\nConference Call and Webcast\nManagement will host an investor conference call today at 2:00 p.m. PST (5:00 p.m. EST) to discuss Marrone Bio Innovation’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, provide a corporate update, and conclude with a Q&A from participants.

Product shipments is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, product revenues reported in accordance with GAAP. Product shipments as used in this press release is defined as product revenues, plus related party product revenues, if any, plus the incremental amount of deferred revenues accrued during the applicable period. This calculation specifically excludes changes in deferred revenue related to license revenues and customer deposits and is intended to approximate the total value of products sold and under contract for sale in a given period. Product shipments, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company’s management uses this non-GAAP financial measure in order to have comparable results to analyze sales performance from quarter to quarter. The Company has chosen to provide this supplemental information regarding its sales in a given period to investors to facilitate a meaningful evaluation of actual operating results on a comparable basis with historical results, including to track product adoption, and to assist investors in their valuation of the Company. In future periods, the calculation of product shipments may be different than in this release.\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, (In Thousands) (In Thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Product revenues $ 3,260 $ 2,632 $ 17,935 $ 13,715 Change in deferred product revenue(a) 574 2,583 1,086 2,651 Product shipments $ 3,834 $ 5,215 $ 19,021 $ 16,366 (a) Change in deferred product revenue is defined as the increase in the amount of deferred product revenues accrued during the applicable period, less prior deferred product revenues recognized during the applicable period, excluding the change in deferred revenue associated with license fees and customer deposits. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, deferred license revenues decreased $58 thousand and $58 thousand, respectively, and $232 thousand and $327 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe use of product shipments has certain limitations. The Company's presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure may be different from the presentation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. We compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our product revenues, related party revenues, deferred revenues and other items both in our reconciliations to the historical GAAP financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. Product shipments are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to product revenues, deferred revenues, total revenues, operating income, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP, nor should these measures be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Product shipments reflects an additional way of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding historical GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety, including the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nAbout Marrone Bio Innovations\nBIO WITH BITE.\nMarrone Bio Innovations, Inc.
