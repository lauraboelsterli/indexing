    "text": "MOSCOW, March 26 (Reuters) - NLMK USA, a subsidiary of Russian steel producer NLMK, has applied for an exclusion from U.S. import tariffs on steel slabs, Robert Miller, NLMK USA’s chief executive, said in emailed answers to Reuters.\n* “We requested an overall exclusion for slabs. Nothing country specific,” Miller said.\n* The United States began charging import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium from a list of countries from March 23. Russia is preparing a list of restrictions on imported products from the United States in response to U.S tariffs. (Reporting by Diana Asonova; Writing by Polina Devitt; Editing by Mark Potter)\n ",
