    "text": "GAAP Net Investment Income (NII) of $0.20 per share providing fourth quarter distribution coverage of approximately 110% Net Asset Value (NAV) per share declined 1.6% or $0.13 per share to $7.83 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis primarily due to net unrealized depreciation on legacy assets Net leverage of 0.32x was down reflecting a net reduction in investments. Total liquidity for portfolio company investments was approximately $365 million, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions Under our existing share repurchase program, we repurchased 224,889 shares of common stock via open market purchases in the fourth quarter\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (NASDAQ:BKCC) (“BCIC” or the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.18 per share, payable on April 2, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2018.\n“Our NII covered the distribution by 110% as total investment income increased $1.6 million compared to the third quarter driven by increased fee income in the quarter. Additionally, the reduction in NAV that we experienced was mainly due to a net markdown in certain legacy portfolio investments. We partially exited one such legacy investment in the quarter which settled during the first quarter of 2018. Our goal continues to be to rotate out of certain legacy investments, but we do not have visibility into additional exits at this point,” commented Michael J. Zugay, CEO of BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation.\n“Generally speaking, the loan market remains issuer friendly with tighter spreads, higher leverage levels and weaker structures, which is a continuation of market conditions over the last 12 months. As such, we continue to be highly selective in new investment opportunities and focused on opportunities with strong underlying credit metrics. Additionally, we continue to pursue exposure to first lien assets through our investments in BCIC Senior Loan Partners (“Senior Loan Partners”) and Gordon Brothers Finance Company, both of which have underlying investments in diversified pools of primarily first lien loans.\n“After the repayment in full of our remaining 5.50% convertible notes in February 2018, we have no debt maturing until 2022. Additionally, $365 million of available liquidity provides us with significant operating flexibility and deployment capacity.”\nFinancial Highlights\nQ4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 Total Per Total Per Total Per ($'s in millions, except per share data) Amount Share Amount Share Amount Share Net Investment Income/(loss) $ 14.5 $ 0.20 $ 12.1 $ 0.17 $ 17.1 $ 0.24 Net realized and unrealized gains/(losses) $ (16.4 ) $ (0.22 ) $ (19.3 ) $ (0.27 ) $ (14.6 ) $ (0.20 ) Deferred taxes $ 5.3 $ 0.07 $ (5.3 ) $ (0.07 ) — — Realized losses on extinguishment of debt — — $ (1.3 ) $ (0.02 ) — — Basic earnings/(loss) $ 3.3 $ 0.05 $ (13.8 ) $ (0.19 ) $ 2.5 $ 0.03 Distributions declared $ 13.2 $ 0.18 $ 13.1 $ 0.18 $ 15.3 $ 0.21 Net Investment Income/(loss), as adjusted 1 $ 14.5 $ 0.20 $ 12.1 $ 0.17 $ 17.1 $ 0.24 Basic earnings/(loss), as adjusted 1\n$ 3.3 $ 0.05 $ (13.8 ) $ (0.19 ) $ 2.5 $ 0.03 2017 Totals 2016 Totals Total Per Total Per ($'s in millions, except per share data) Amount Share Amount Share Net Investment Income/(loss) $ 55.1 $ 0.75 $ 54.0 $ 0.74 Net realized and unrealized gains/(losses) $ (32.9 ) $ (0.44 ) $ (138.3 ) $ (1.90 ) Realized losses on extinguishment of debt $ (1.3 ) $ (0.02 ) — — Basic earnings/(loss) $ 20.9 $ 0.29 $ (84.3 ) $ (1.16 ) Distributions declared $ 52.5 $ 0.72 $ 61.0 $ 0.84 Net Investment Income/(loss), as adjusted 1 $ 55.1 $ 0.75 $ 54.0 $ 0.74 Basic earnings/(loss), as adjusted 1 $ 20.9 $ 0.29 $ (84.3 ) $ (1.16 ) As of As of As of December 31, September 30, December 31, ($'s in millions, except per share data) 2017 2017 2016 Total assets $ 799.9 $ 855.0 $ 957.1 Investment portfolio, at fair market value $ 757.9 $ 833.9 $ 931.1 Debt outstanding $ 206.7 $ 246.1 $ 335.7 Total net assets $ 571.1 $ 581.5 $ 596.3 Net asset value per share $ 7.83 $ 7.96 $ 8.21 Net leverage ratio 2\n0.32x 0.42x 0.55x 1 Non-GAAP basis financial measure.

The cumulative repurchases since BlackRock Advisors, LLC entered into the investment management agreement with the Company totaled approximately 3.0 million shares for $25.5 million, representing 67.4% of total share repurchase activity, on a dollar basis, since inception. Since the inception of our share repurchase program through December 31, 2017, we have purchased 4.8 million shares at an average price of $7.90 per share, including brokerage commissions, for a total of $37.7 million. In May 2017, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the remaining amount of shares authorized to be repurchased to a total of 2.5 million shares effective July 1, 2017, and an extension to the plan until the earlier of June 30, 2018 or such time that all of the authorized shares have been repurchased. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 2.3 million shares authorized for repurchase. On February 15, 2018, the Company repaid the remaining $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.50% unsecured convertible senior notes due 2018 (“Convertible Notes”) upon maturity at par using borrowings under the credit facility and cash on hand. In combination with the previously announced repurchases pursuant to a tender offer in September 2017, the entire $115 million of Convertible Notes are now retired and cancelled, and are no longer outstanding under the indenture. On March 6, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted amendments to the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan (the “Plan”). A summary of the amended Plan is included in the Company's Form 8-K, filed on March 7, 2018, and a copy of the amended Plan is included as Exhibit 99.2 to such Form 8-K.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity*\n($’s in millions)\nThree months Three months ended ended Year ended Year ended December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nInvestment deployments $ 63.3 $ 107.8 $ 243.4 $ 325.4 Investment exits $ 124.3 $ 109.2 $ 386.4 $ 377.2 Number of portfolio company investments at the end of period 30 38 Weighted average yield of debt and income producing equity securities, at fair market value 10.8% 11.7% % of Portfolio invested in Secured debt, at fair market value 56% 66% % of Portfolio invested in Unsecured debt, at fair market value 17% 17% % of Portfolio invested in Equity, at fair market value 27% 17% Average investment by portfolio company, at amortized cost (excluding investments below $5.0 million) $ 33.0 $ 31.8 *balance sheet amounts above are as of period end\nWe deployed $63.3 million during the quarter while exits of investments totaled $124.3 million, resulting in a $61.0 million net decrease in our portfolio due to investment activity. Our deployments were primarily concentrated in two new portfolio company investments, a debt and equity investment to help facilitate a change of control for a legacy investment, and four investments into existing portfolio companies. $13.9 million funded and $6.1 million unfunded delayed draw L+8.00% second lien term loan to Pathway Partners Vet Management Company, LLC, which is an owner and operator of veterinary hospitals offering a range of general medical, surgical, and specialized services for pets; $7.0 million funded and $18.0 million unfunded delayed draw L+6.00% first lien term loan to VetCor Professional Practices, LLC, which is a leading consolidator (owner / operator) of veterinary hospitals, primarily in the Eastern U.S.; $15 million L+9.00% first lien term loan to MBS Opco, LLC and $500K equity investment in MBS Parent, LLC; $6.7 million of incremental equity to Senior Loan Partners; $5.2 million L+7.50% first lien term loan to Advanced Lighting Technologies, Inc. as part of the restructuring; $5.0 million of incremental L+10.00% second lien term loan to Paragon Films, Inc. to help fund growth initiatives; and $4.9 million of incremental L+11.00% unsecured debt to Gordon Brothers Finance Company to fund portfolio growth. Our repayments were primarily concentrated in four exited portfolio companies: $37.5 million repayment of Wink Holdco, Inc. second lien term loan; $36.5 million repayment of GSE Environmental, Inc. first lien term loan; $19.6 million repayment of Liberty Tire Recycling Holdco, LLC first lien term loan; and $15.0 million repayment of our second lien term loan and an equity exit of $2.3 million from Loar Group, LLC. The various prepayment premiums on these exited loans contributed to the increase in our fee income as compared to the third quarter. Our $72.4 million equity investment in Senior Loan Partners is now generating a yield of approximately 11%. Senior Loan Partners made investments into two new portfolio companies and four existing portfolio companies totaling $33.3 million of new capital deployments during the quarter, bringing committed and outstanding amounts to $226.2 million and $219.9 million, respectively, and a total of 20 borrowers. The two new investments at par were (i) a $12.5 million first lien term loan to BARBRI, Inc., a leading provider of bar review and bar exam preparation courses for law students in the U.S. and (ii) a $10.0 million first lien term loan to Edgewood Partners Insurance Center, a leading insurance, risk management, and employee benefits brokerage and consulting firm. As of December 31, 2017, two investments were in non-accrual status, which were 4.0% of our total debt investments at fair market value, and 15.5% at amortized cost, compared with 2.7% at fair market value and 8.9% at amortized cost last quarter respectively. Our average internal investment rating at fair market value at December 31, 2017 was 1.35 as compared to 1.30 as of September 30, 2017. Net unrealized depreciation on investments increased $10.3 million during the current quarter, bringing total balance sheet unrealized depreciation on investments to $72.7 million. Gross unrealized appreciation on investments of $4.2 million was offset by $18.6 million of gross unrealized depreciation on investments primarily driven by legacy positions, for a net $14.4 million of depreciation due to portfolio valuations during the quarter.\nFourth Quarter Financial Updates\nGAAP net investment income (“NII”) was $14.5 million, or $0.20 per share, and $55.1 million, or $0.75 per share, respectively, for the three months and year Relative to distributions declared of $0.18 per share, our NII distribution coverage was 110% for the quarter. For the full year 2017, relative to distributions declared of $0.72 per share, our NII distribution coverage was 104%. Fee income earned on capital structuring, prepayments, commitments and administration during the current quarter totaled $2.9 million, as compared to $0.2 million earned during the preceding quarter. As previously disclosed, our base management fee rate was reduced from an annual rate of 2.00% of total assets to 1.75% effective March 7, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, $8.0 million of incentive management fees based on income were earned by our investment adviser; however, as previously disclosed, any such fees earned until December 31, 2018 have been waived by our investment adviser. During the year, there was no accrual for incentive management fees based on gains. The Company holds certain portfolio investments through taxable subsidiaries as pass through entities. Income earned and gains realized on the investment held by the taxable subsidiary are taxable to such subsidiary. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, a reversal of a deferred tax liability of $5.3 million (originally established in third quarter 2017) was included in net realized and unrealized gain (loss), primarily due to a reduction in the unrealized gains on the portfolio investments held in certain taxable subsidiary as a result of an increase in their tax cost basis. For the year ended December 31, 2017, deferred tax had no impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Tax characteristics of all 2017 distributions were reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. Our 2017 tax distributions of $0.72 per share were comprised of ordinary income. Our return of capital distributions since inception totaled $1.96 per share. At our discretion, we may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. We will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required. There was no undistributed taxable income carried forward from 2017. For more information on our GAAP distributions, please refer to the Section 19 Notice that may be posted within the Distribution History section of our website.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $29.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $336.6 million of availability under our credit facility based upon our December 31, 2017 borrowing base calculation, subject to leverage restrictions, resulting in approximately $365.6 million of availability for portfolio company investments. Net leverage, adjusted for available cash, receivables for investments sold, payables for investments purchased and unamortized debt issuance costs, stood at 0.32x at quarter-end, and our 367% asset coverage ratio provided the Company with available debt capacity under its asset coverage requirements of $354.2 million. Further, as of quarter-end, 83% of our portfolio was invested in qualifying assets, exceeding the 70% regulatory requirement of a business development company.\nConference Call\nBlackRock Capital Investment Corporation will host a webcast/teleconference at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on Thursday, March 8, 2018, to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 financial results.

evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of the Company’s financial performance over time. The Company’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nUntil March 6, 2017, the Company recorded its liability for incentive management fees based on income as it became legally obligated to pay them, based on a hypothetical liquidation at the end of each reporting period. The Company’s obligation to pay incentive management fees with respect to any fiscal quarter until March 6, 2017 was based on a formula that reflects the Company’s results over a trailing four-fiscal quarter period ending with the pro-rated period until March 6, 2017. The Company is legally obligated to pay the amount resulting from the formula less any cash payments of incentive management fees during the prior three quarters. The formula’s requirement to reduce the incentive management fee by amounts paid with respect to such fees in the prior three quarters caused the Company’s incentive management fee expense to become concentrated in the fourth quarter of each year. Management believes that reflecting incentive management fees throughout the year, as the related investment income is earned, is an effective measure of the Company’s profitability and financial performance that facilitates comparison of current results with historical results and with those of the Company’s peers. The Company’s “as adjusted” results reflect incentive management fees based on the formula the Company utilizes for each trailing four-fiscal quarter period until March 6, 2017, with the formula applied to each quarter’s incremental earnings and without any reduction for incentive management fees paid during the prior three quarters. The resulting amount represents an upper limit of each quarter’s incremental incentive management fees that the Company may become legally obligated to pay at the end of the year. Prior year amounts are estimated in the same manner. These estimates represent upper limits because, in any calendar year, subsequent quarters’ investment underperformance could reduce the incentive management fees payable by the Company with respect to prior quarters’ operating results. After March 6, 2017, incentive management fees based on income have been calculated for each calendar quarter and are paid on a quarterly basis if certain thresholds are met. The Company records its liability for incentive management fees based on capital gains by performing a hypothetical liquidation at the end of each reporting period. The accrual of this hypothetical capital gains incentive management fee is required by GAAP, but it should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued is not due and payable until the end of the measurement period, or every June 30. The incremental incentive management fees disclosed for a given period are not necessarily indicative of actual full year results. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ and such differences could be material. For a more detailed description of the Company’s incentive management fee, please refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nComputations for the periods below are derived from the Company's financial statements as follows:\nThree months\nended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nThree months\nended\nDecember 31,\n2016\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\nGAAP Basis: Net Investment Income $ 14,517,181 $ 17,082,364 $ 55,091,692 $ 54,036,565 Net Investment Income per share 0.20 0.24 0.75 0.74 Addback: GAAP incentive management fee expense based on Gains — — — — Addback: GAAP incentive management fee expense based on Income — — — — Pre-Incentive Fee 1 : Net Investment Income $ 14,517,181 $ 17,082,364 $ 55,091,692 $ 54,036,565 Net Investment Income per share 0.20 0.24 0.75 0.74 Less: Incremental incentive management fee expense based on Income — — — — As Adjusted 2 : Net Investment Income $ 14,517,181 $ 17,082,364 $ 55,091,692 $ 54,036,565 Net Investment Income per share 0.20 0.24 0.75 0.74 Note: The Net Investment Income amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 are net of incentive management fees based on income and a corresponding incentive management fee waiver in the amounts of $2,903,436 and $7,980,098, respectively. For the periods shown, there is no difference between the GAAP and as adjusted figures; however, there may be a difference in future periods.\n1 Pre-Incentive Fee: Amounts are adjusted to remove all incentive management fees. Such fees are calculated but not necessarily due and payable at this time.\n2 As Adjusted : Amounts are adjusted to remove the incentive management fee expense based on gains, as required by GAAP, and to include only the incremental incentive management fee expense based on Income. Until March 6, 2017, the incremental incentive management fee was calculated based on the current quarter's incremental earnings, and without any reduction for incentive management fees paid during the prior calendar quarters. After March 6, 2017, incentive management fee expense based on income has been calculated for each calendar quarter and may be paid on a quarterly basis if certain thresholds are met. Amounts reflect the Company's ongoing operating results and reflect the Company's financial performance over time.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release, and other statements that BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation may make, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation’s future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations.
