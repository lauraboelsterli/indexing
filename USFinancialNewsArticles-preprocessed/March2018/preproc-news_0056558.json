Goran Dragic had 17 and Justise Winslow 13 as 11 players scored for the Heat, who have won five of their past seven and improved to 24-9 against clubs with losing records.\nMiami also has won eight straight at home and 11 of the past 12 contests in South Florida.\nDavid Nwaba and Noah Vonleh paced Chicago with 15 and 14 points, respectively. Robin Lopez, Justin Holiday and Bobby Portis each had 13.\nPortis had a career-high-tying 16 rebounds and Vonleh grabbed 13 boards.\nThe Bulls played without three of their top four scorers: Zach LaVine (knee), Kris Dunn (toe) and Lauri Markkanen (elbow) were all out with injuries. Markkanen had just returned Tuesday after missing six games with a sore back.\nIn losing its third of the four games this season against Miami, Chicago dropped its seventh straight and fell to 9-29 on the road.\nThe losing streak is currently the longest in the Eastern Conference.\nDragic scored nine points as the Heat took the lead midway through the first quarter, while Nwaba had eight for the Bulls.\nMiami used a 7-0 run over a 1:57 span to eventually take a 29-21 lead at the quarter’s end.\nDragic’s coast-to-coast layup ended a 6-0 run as the Heat stretched their lead to 45-34, the largest of the first half, before finishing the second quarter with a 51-46 edge.\nMiami guard Tyler Johnson turned his right ankle making a layup in the quarter and did not return.\nThe Heat’s defense helped extend the lead to 78-68 as Miami held Chicago to 34 percent shooting.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
