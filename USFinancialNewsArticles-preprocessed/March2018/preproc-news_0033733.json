    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel, Global mobile advertising platform Mobfox announced today its new Audience Analytics developer offering with actionable insights about publishers' app users. New features include an in-depth dashboard and optimized lookalike user acquisition capabilities.\nThe Audience Analytics dashboard draws insights from Mobfox's supply-side platform (SSP) and demand-side platform (DSP), myDSP . The insights may be used to create value for developers and publishers selling inventory across the Mobfox platform, including Mobfox mediation, the exchange, direct deals and private marketplace. For example, publishers may share anonymized audience reports with potential and existing demand partners, thus enriching media bids and generating higher revenue.\nFurthermore, the new dashboard identifies the developers' most lucrative anonymized audiences through deep analytics. Developers may choose to automatically advertise to lookalikes of their best performing users through myDSP in order to acquire more, high-value users.\n\"Our new offering provides a 360-degree perspective based on real insights at every step of the way,\" said Gil Klein, Managing Director of Mobfox. \"The Audience Analytics platform leverages Mobfox's technology to bring more value to app developers and publishers, creating a place not just for optimizing their mobile assets, but for managing their user acquisition efforts as well.\"\nAbout Mobfox\nMobfox is a world leading, data-driven, mobile supply-side platform (SSP) and exchange, providing app developers and publishers the most advanced tools to manage their media smarter.
