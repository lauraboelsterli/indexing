Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman chairs the Yisrael Beitenu faction weekly meeting at the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, in Jerusalem, March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo “The motivation of our enemies has grown in recent years, but so too the might of the IDF (Israeli Defence Forces),” he said in a statement after Israel formally acknowledged the 2007 mission to destroy the suspected Al-Kubar reactor. “Everyone in the Middle East would do well to internalise this equation.” Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore",
