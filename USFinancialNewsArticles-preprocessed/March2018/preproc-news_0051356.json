    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 6:13 AM / a few seconds ago Lured by rising SUV sales, automakers flood market with models Nick Carey 6 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Demand for sport utility vehicles in the United States is booming, but the number of new models vying for a share of that market is growing even faster, threatening the fat profits automakers have enjoyed. The 2019 Lincoln Aviator is displayed at an event on the eve of the 2018 New York International Auto Show in New York City, March 27, 2018. Picture taken March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nAt the New York Auto show this week, automakers will unveil another flock of SUVs ranging from a revamped Toyota RAV4, Toyota Motor Corp’s ( 7203.T ) top-selling model in 2017, to flashy new luxury Cadillac and Lincoln SUVs. Premium brands such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s ( FCHA.MI ) Maserati that once dealt exclusively in low-slung sports cars are getting into the game. \n“I think everyone has read the same tea leaves - right now there seems to be insatiable demand,” said General Motors Co’s ( GM.N ) Johan de Nysschen, referring to SUVs and crossovers. \nDe Nysschen, the head of GM’s Cadillac luxury division, spoke to Reuters on Wednesday while standing next to the brand’s new XT4 crossover model. “Everyone is going into these segments with compelling new entries,” he said, “and that means there are going to be winners and there are going to be losers.” \nHe added: “We aim to be amongst the winners.” \nAccording to data from automotive consultancy LMC Automotive, by the year 2023 there will be 90 mainstream SUV and crossover models on the U.S. market, as well as 90 luxury models, compared with the 2017 levels of 65 mainstream SUV and crossover models and 53 luxury models. \nPremium automakers like BMW AG ( BMWG.DE ) and Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen AG’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) Audi brand are expanding their U.S. sport utility vehicle plants. \nU.S. sales of mainstream and luxury SUVs and crossovers alike have more than doubled since 2010 and rose 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, last year - even though overall industry sales declined 2 percent in 2017. \nLMC Automotive forecasts that growth will slow for SUVs and crossovers in 2018 and every year through 2025, even as the number of models on the market is set to rise.

Just as a wide variety of niches has developed in the passenger car market, as SUV and crossover sales continue to grow there is room for automakers to roll out an assortment of sizes, limited editions and sporty models. \n“The market is not yet saturated and there are all kinds of niches that have yet to be filled,” Fiorani said. “We’re five or 10 years from even thinking about market saturation.” \nAutomakers also maintain that there is room for many more options as long as they can stand out in a crowd. \n“There are clearly a lot of entrants, but we are going to differentiate ourselves with a completely different look to our brand,” Joy Falotico, head of Ford Motor Co’s ( F.N ) luxury Lincoln division, said in an interview on Tuesday. \nFord’s new midsize SUV with three rows of seats, the Aviator, will hit the U.S. market in 2019. Rather than the aggressive or dominant forms adopted by Lincoln’s competitors, Falotico said the Aviator’s form is meant to evoke “beauty and calmness.” \nBut according to KBB’s Brauer, “Simple math suggests that you’ll have more models with lower volume.” \n“You can’t have that many SUVs on the market and have all of them grow volume,” he said. “Some of them are going to have to give.” \nBrauer points to average vehicle prices in the SUV and crossover market for an indication of what is happening in the segment. Cumulatively, prices rose just 4 percent from 2012 to 2017. \nBut the average price dipped 0.5 percent to $35,991 in 2017 from $36,163 in 2016, according to KBB data. \nFaced with more competition in a slower-growing market, automakers will likely be forced to resort to consumer discounts to boost sales, which will cut in to profit margins. \n“The idea that you’re going to make the same profit as you did three years ago is probably unlikely,” Brauer said. “The good news is that they have room to lower margins.” Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Matthew Lewis",
