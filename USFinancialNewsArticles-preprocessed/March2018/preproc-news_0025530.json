These opportunities are subject to underwriting conditions including, but not limited to, the completion of due diligence, negotiation of definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with TPC’s allocation policy. Accordingly, there is no assurance that any or all of these transactions will be completed or assigned to the Company, even though the Company is the primary vehicle through which TPC focuses its venture growth stage business.\nUnfunded Commitments:\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s unfunded commitments totaled $100.1 million, of which $18.0 million is dependent upon portfolio companies reaching certain milestones. Of the $100.1 million of unfunded commitments, $87.1 million will expire during 2018 and $13.0 million will expire during 2019, if not drawn prior to expiration. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company.\nResults of Operations:\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, total investment and other income was $11.1 million, as compared to $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in a weighted average annualized portfolio yield of 13.6% and 13.7%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s total investment and other income was $51.5 million, as compared to $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a weighted average annualized portfolio yield on its debt investments of 16.4% and 14.4%, respectively.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $6.0 million as compared to $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Net unrealized losses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $(3.5) million, or $(0.20) per share, due to the reversal of unrealized gains of $(1.8) million due to realized activity and $(1.7) million of unrealized losses from fair value adjustments.
