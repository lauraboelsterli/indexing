    "text": "610 COMMENTS The news of the last six months has served as an almost daily confirmation that many of the people who run the entertainment industry are just as nasty as one would expect from examining their products. More recent news has confirmed that during his years in show business, Donald Trump was exactly as he presented himself. But just in time for Easter, along comes a seemingly true Hollywood story one can almost share with the kids.\nIt’s also a mystery story, and part of the tale was revealed this week in a GQ magazine interview with an actress named Tiffany Hadish. The story recounts an eventful gathering of entertainers:\nLast December, Haddish met Beyoncé Knowles-Carter at a party. Beyoncé walked up and said, “I’m Beyoncé”—the understatement of the century—and the two women had a brief, pleasant exchange. So it seems that one of the most famous and successful singers in the world is rather gracious. “But that’s not the story,” writes GQ’s Caity Weaver. The real news is that, at least according to Ms. Haddish as reported by GQ, another actress at the party whom Ms. Haddish declines to name “bit Beyoncé in the face.”\nAfter the attack the Grammy-winning singer “stormed away,” according to Ms. Haddish, but later returned. When Ms. Haddish informed Ms. Knowles-Carter that she intended to retaliate on the singer’s behalf, “Beyoncé asked her not to—told her to “have fun” instead.” Ms. Haddish spoke to the pop star again when the party was nearly over:\n“Beyoncé’s at the bar, so I said to Beyoncé, ‘Did she really bite you?’ She was like, ‘Yeah.’ I was like, ‘She gonna get her a-- beat tonight.’ [sic] She was like, ‘Tiffany, no. Don’t do that... Just chill.’” Ms. Carter-Knowles opined that the alleged chomper was under the influence of drugs and normally did not act in such a manner, according to Ms. Haddish. But the singer is not addressing the issue publicly, according to GQ:\n“I absolutely cannot comment on any of this, as I have no knowledge,” said Beyoncé’s representative, Yvette Noel-Schure, when GQ sought confirmation from the singer. This hasn’t stopped various entertainment-industry personages and social-media users from trying to guess the identity of Hollywood’s most hungry. Billboard magazine says that fans of the singer are determined to find the alleged assailant:\nThe Beyhive is determined to solve the whodunit mystery of the now-infamous Beyonce biter... Model-turned-90210-star Sara Foster was one of the names in question. Foster quickly denied the accusations via her Instagram, on which she captioned a screenshot of an email requesting comment on the matter: “Flattering that anyone thinks I could get this close to Beyonce.” Another suspect was Sanaa Lathan, best known for her role in Love & Basketball. She also shot down the rumors on her social media, tweeting that if she ever felt compelled to lay a tooth on Beyonce, “it wouldv’e been a love bite.” Meanwhile US magazine Quote: s filmmaker Tyler Perry saying that he knows the identity of the biter but won’t tell.\nAssuming for the moment that the story is true, some readers may be tempted to think that Hollywood culture is in even worse shape than they thought if such predation can be expected at social gatherings. But on the other hand it’s hard to imagine anyone at any social gathering anywhere being as forgiving as Ms. Carter-Knowles is in the GQ story.\nOn Easter week, perhaps the practitioners of political warfare who seem to dominate our current debates will follow her example and turn the other cheek.\n***\nIn other news at the intersection of entertainment and politics, the incomparable Kyle Smith recounts a story from the Reagan years which serves as a reminder that even the greatest of Presidents can struggle to find outstanding employees to staff the White House:\nSylvester Stallone tried to enlist the president in his publicity campaign for Rocky IV , which Reagan screened and liked. But when Stallone’s team suggested that the actor visit Washington to present the president with the gloves and robe Rocky wears in the film, a young White House lawyer — associate counsel John Roberts — nixed the plan. “With the Rambo comments and the White House dinner invitation, the president has already given Stallone more than his share of free publicity,” Roberts wrote, alluding to an approving quip that Reagan had made about the same year’s Rambo: First Blood Part II . ***\nBottom Story of the Day\nTough Competition\n“‘Chappaquiddick’ explores one of Sen. Ted Kennedy’s darkest hours,” CNN, March 27\n***\nFollow James Freeman on Twitter.\nSubscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.\nTo suggest items, please email best@wsj.com .\n(Carol Muller and Lisa Rossi help compile Best of the Web.
