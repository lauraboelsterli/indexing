OSE-172 (SIRPa-antagonist, myeloid checkpoint inhibitor): Initiation of clinical phase expected in 2018 in immuno-oncology; €9.2 million in new funding received in July 2017 from Bpifrance. OSE-127 (IL-7R antagonist): Initiation of clinical phase expected in 2018 in autoimmune diseases; €2.6 million milestone payment received from Bpifrance. FR104 (CD28-antagonist): Phase 2 clinical initiation expected in 2018 in rheumatoid arthritis by licensee Janssen Biotech. €6.7 million turnover recorded due to the spread of the €10.25 million Servier upfront fees for OSE-127 option license. Cash available as of December 31, 2017 of €12.5 million (included current financial assets), not including t he 2016 & 2017 research tax credits of €5.5 million planned S1 2018.\nNANTES, France, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OSE Immunotherapeutics SA (ISIN:FR0012127173) (Mnémo:OSE) today reports its consolidated annual financial results as of December 31, 2017 and provides an update on the key achievements as well as the company’s outlook for its agonist and antagonist immunotherapies.\n\"Throughout 2017, in close collaboration with Janssen Biotech and Servier, we have continued the development of our breakthrough immunotherapies in autoimmune diseases, including preparation for the start of clinical phase of OSE-127 in ulcerative colitis by the end of 2018,” said Dominique Costantini, CEO of OSE Immunotherapeutics . “We have also advanced our programs in immuno-oncology and within the next few months expect to start clinical phase with OSE-172, as well as an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial in pancreatic cancer with Tedopi® in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, after redefining the recruitment strategy in our Phase 3 trial of Tedopi® in advanced lung cancer, we are very happy to be able to redep loy the trial internationally in early 2018. Clinical advances of four of our products, two of which being partnered with leading pharmaceutical partners, are the next steps of the Company's growth, supported by our partnerships with international pharmaceutical groups and by the grants obtained from Bpifrance.\n2017 KEY MILESTONES AND 2018 OUTLOOK\nIMMUNO-ONCOLOGY : FOLLOWING CLINICAL AND PRECLINICAL ADVANCES IN 2017\nTEDOPI®: REDEPLOYMENT OF THE PHASE 3 CLINICAL PHASE AND A NEW CANCER INDICATION IN PHASE 2 –\nOSE-172: ENTRY INTO CLINICAL PHASE PLANNED IN 2018\nTedopi®, an innovative proprietary combination of neoepitopes\nInternational Phase 3 in advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Trial redeployed in the U.S., seven European countries and Israel, based on a revised protocol in patients who have failed previous treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors\nAfter temporary pause of new patient accrual end of June 2017, following the recommendation of the trial’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee, a new recruitment strategy was defined, based on a review of mature clinical data assessing the treated patients’ profiles in relation to the potential benefit of Tedopi®. The revised protocol focuses on a subgroup of patients who have failed previous treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Based on this revised protocol, in Q1 2018, competents authorities in the U.S. and Europe approved resume of patient accrual. In addition, the approval from Israeli competent authorities to initiate the trial adds Israel to the U.S. and to seven European countries for the redeployment of the international Phase 3 Tedopi® trial.\nPhase 2 trial in pancreatic cancer, in clinical collaboration with the GERCOR group, an independent French non-profit network of cancer specialists\nIn September 2017, a collaboration was concluded with the GERCOR oncology cooperative group involved in digestive cancer to evaluate Tedopi® in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. This is a Phase 2 trial of maintenance therapy with Tedopi® alone or in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor versus Folfiri*, in patients with stable disease after four months of standard chemotherapy with Folforinox**. Initiation of this Phase 2 is expected in 2018.\n* Folfiri: combination chemotherapy with folinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotecan\n** Folfirinox: combination chemotherapy with folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin\nOSE-172, a new generation checkpoint inhibitor targeting myeloid cells via the SIRPa receptor – A focus on clinical development in tumor microenvironment : Clinical program planned end of 2018\nNew preclinical data were presented at international immuno-oncology and immunology conferences that show the strong impact of OSE-172 on the tumor micro-environment by targeting suppressive myeloid cells through a specific blockade of SIRPa. OSE-172 has a unique and beneficial pharmacologic profile, and is highly selective for promoting T-lymphocytes that destroy cancer cells. In July, the company received a €9.2 million grant from Bpifrance as part of a collaborative program (EFFI-CLIN) to support the development of OSE-172, planned to enter clinical Phase in 2018. This program will include product manufacturing, translational studies and a clinical program planned through Phase 2.\nOSE-703, a cytotoxic monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha-chain of the receptor for\ninterleukin-7\nIn June 2017, the company entered into a research collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York. The goal of this collaboration is to explore the efficacy profile and the development potential of immunotherapy with OSE-703 in solid tumors. The research is being conducted by\nPrasad S. Adusumilli, M.D., an expert in tumor immunology and in the development of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) immunotherapy.\nAUTOIMMUNE DISEASES: PROGRAMS DEVELOPED THROUGH STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AND CLINICAL MILESTONES EXPECTED IN 2018\nOSE-127, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CD127 receptor, the alpha chain of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) – License option with Servier (December 2016) to develop and commercialize the product in autoimmune diseases\nNew positive clinical results and translational data, presented in June at the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies conference, have shown a differentiated mechanism of action for OSE-127 able to fight pathologic local homing of inflammatory T lymphocytes, key players in the chronicity of inflammatory bowel disease. In June 2017, the company received a €2.597 million payment from Bpifrance, after achieving a milestone in the collaborative EFFIMab project developing OSE-127 in ulcerative colitis.\nFR104, CD28-antagonist: Phase 1 completed – License agreement with Janssen Biotech (July 2016) to pursue the product’s clinical development in autoimmune diseases\nFollowing positive Phase 1 results, the product’s development is being pursued in partnership with Janssen Biotech to prepare its entry into Phase 2 trial in rheumatoid arthritis planned for the end of 2018.\nThe Company will pursue the research of new collaborative or license agreements, which can be initiated at different stages of product development, with players involved in the field of activation and regulation immunology and in therapeutic combinations of high clinical interest.\n2017 ANNUAL RESULTS\nMeeting of Board of Directors of OSE Immunotherapeutics was held on March 28, 2018. Following the opinion of the Audit Committee, the Board approved the annual and consolidated financial statements prepared under IFRS at 31 December 2017.\nThe key figures of the 2017 consolidated annual results are reported below (and presented in the attached tables):\nIn k€ 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 Current operating result -12 626 -8 236 Operating result -12 626 17 499 Net result -10 503 20 666 Available cash* 12 528 17 766 Consolidated balance sheet 77 353 89 547 As of December 31, 2017, available cash* amounted to €12.528 million, excluded 2016 and 2017 research tax credits totaling €5.585 million.\nThis available cash will enable the Company to finance its 2018 development costs including the Phase 3 clinical trial with Tedopi®, the preclinical and Phase 1 clinical development of OSE-127 and of OSE-172, and R&D costs on earlier stage products. In addition, the company should reach a new milestone this year in the development of OSE-127 as part of its contract with Servier, that could generate a cash inflow of €12 million.\nMoreover, completion of the next key milestone related to the company’s collaborative program on OSE-172 (EFFI-CLIN), if validated, will trigger a payment of €5.5 million from Bpifrance in 2018.\nAs of today, the Company has funds to pursue its activities during the next 12 months following the publication of the accounts closed on December 31, 2017.\nAs a reminder, the 2016 operating result was positively impacted, both due to the license option exercise by Janssen Biotech for FR104 and to a badwill due to the merger operation of May 2016.\nMoreover, due to the merger between OSE Pharma and Effimune, 2016 annual results include only 7 months of Effimune operational expenses.\n* Cash and cash equivalents and Current financial assets\nABOUT OSE Immunotherapeutics\nOur ambition is to become a world leader in activation and regulation immunotherapies:\nOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on the development of innovative immunotherapies for immune activation and regulation in the fields of immuno-oncology, autoimmune diseases and transplantation. The company has several scientific and technological platforms: neoepitopes, agonist or antagonist monoclonal antibodies, ideally positioned to fight cancer and autoimmune diseases. Its first-in-class clinical portfolio offers a diversified risk profile.\nIn immuno-oncology:\nTedopi® , 10 combined neo-epitopes to induce a specific T lymphocyte activation. Phase III trial in advanced NSCLC: after temporary pause of new patient accrual end of June 2017, new recruitment strategy in December 2017, following the recommendation of the trial’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee, to focus the trial on patients who failed a previous treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. In Q1 2018, after approvals from the competent authorities, resume of patient accrual in the US, in Europe, and initiation of the trial in Israel.\nPhase II with Tedopi® in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor planned in advanced pancreatic cancer, in collaboration with GERCOR, a cooperative group of clinical research. OSE-172 , new generation checkpoint inhibitor targeting myeloid cells via the SIRP-α receptor - In preclinical development for several cancer models. Clinical program planned end of 2018. OSE-703 , cytotoxic monoclonal antibody against the alpha chain of IL-7R - Under a research collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York.\nIn auto-immune diseases and transplantation:\nFR104 , CD28-antagonist in immunotherapy - Phase 1 trial completed – For the treatment of autoimmune diseases and for use with transplantation - Licensed to Janssen Biotech Inc. to pursue clinical development. OSE-127 , interleukin receptor-7 antagonist - In preclinical development for inflammatory bowel diseases and other autoimmune diseases. Clinical Phase planned end of 2018. License option agreement with Servier for the development and commercialization.\nThe portfolio’s blockbuster potential gives OSE Immunotherapeutics the ability to enter global agreements at different stages of development with major pharmaceutical players.\nImmunotherapy is a highly promising and growing market. By 2023 Immunotherapy of cancer could represent nearly 60% of treatments against less than 3% at present * and the projected market is estimated at $67 billion in 2018 **. There are more than 80 autoimmune diseases that represent a significant market including major players in the pharmaceutical industry with sales towards $10 billion for the main products. The medical need is largely unmet and requires the provision of new innovative products involved in the regulation of the immune system.\n* Citi Research Equity\n**BCC Research\nClick and follow us on Twitter and Linkedln\nhttps://twitter.com/OSEIMMUNO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/ose-immunotherapeutics\nContacts\nOSE Immunotherapeutics\nU.S. Media: LifeSci Public Relations\nSylvie Détry Matt Middleman, M.D. Sylvie.detry@ose-immuno.com\nmatt@lifescipublicrelations.com\n+33 143 297 857 +1 646 627 8384 French Media: FP2COM\nU.S. and European Investors\nFlorence Portejoie Chris Maggos fportejoie@fp2com.fr chris@lifesciadvisors.com +33 607 768 283\n+41 79 367 6254\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains express or implied information and statements that might be deemed forward-looking information and statements in respect of OSE Immunotherapeutics.
