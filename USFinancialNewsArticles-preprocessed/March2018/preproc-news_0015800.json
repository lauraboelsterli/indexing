    "text": "Fed's Kaplan says too soon to change forecasts to reflect tariff impact The central banker said that hurting U.S. relationships with trading partners would be against its own interest. Asked if he would change his forecast to reflect any expected impact from the tariffs, Kaplan said it is too soon to comment on what policies are going to be implemented. Published 6 Hours Ago Mary Catherine Wellons | CNBC Robert Kaplan, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \nAnything that would hurt U.S. relationships with trading partners such as Mexico and Canada would be against the interest of the United States, a U.S. central banker said on Tuesday. \n\"My sensitivity would be, any actions we could take as a country to jeopardize those relationships are not in our interest,\" Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said in Houston, even as he declined to directly comment on President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. \nAsked if he would change his forecast to reflect any expected impact from the tariffs, Kaplan said no. \n\"It's still too soon to say what policies are going to be implemented â€” my job is not to analyze or overly comment on hypotheticals,\" he said.",
