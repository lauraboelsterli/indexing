    "text": "Papa John’s and the NFL ended their league sponsorship deal last week , describing it as a “mutual decision.” There had been tension between the two businesses, who first partnered in 2010, after former Papa John’s CEO John Schnatter blamed national-anthem protests in the NFL for the pizza chain’s declining sales . \nSchnatter’s replacement, Steve Ritchie, said on an earnings call last week that Papa John’s still has team partnerships with more than 20 NFL franchises, but it will not be able to use team or league logos in its promotions. Pizza Hut was announced as the new official pizza chain of the NFL the following day.",
