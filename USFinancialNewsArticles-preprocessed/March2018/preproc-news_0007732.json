    "text": "Conference Call and Webcast Today, February 28 th , at 5:00 p.m. ET\nDURHAM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AERI), an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye, today reported financial results and full year ended December 31, 2017, along with a general business update and 2018 guidance.\nAerie Highlights and Guidance\nRhopressa ® (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% commercial launch planned for mid-second quarter 2018. All regional sales directors and district managers have been hired, as well as over 30 of an expected 100 territory managers. Aerie expects to gain preferred formulary coverage for the majority of commercial payers for Rhopressa ® by late 2018, with most of the Medicare Part D coverage expected to commence in 2019. Adequate Rhopressa ® commercial product and sample inventory currently on hand to cover more than one full year of expected demand. Preparation of the Roclatan TM (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005% NDA (New Drug Application) is progressing on schedule with an expected submission to the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) in the second quarter of 2018. International expansion activities remain on track with the commencement of the Roclatan TM Phase 3 trial named Mercury 3 in the third quarter of 2017 to prepare for regulatory submission in Europe, and the initiation of the Rhopressa ® Phase 2 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2017 to prepare for a potential regulatory submission in Japan. Pre-IND activities are well underway for the development of Aerie’s retina program, including AR-13503 (Rho kinase inhibitor implant) and AR-1105 (dexamethasone steroid implant). As of December 31, 2017, Aerie had approximately $250 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. In January 2018, Aerie raised an additional approximately $136 million in equity offering net proceeds from the issuance of 2,313,824 shares, resulting in a pro forma cash, cash equivalents and investment balance of approximately $386 million and a pro forma number of shares outstanding of 39,261,461. Cash burn for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was nearly $120 million, in line with previous guidance. Aerie expects full year 2018 Rhopressa ® net revenues in the range of $20 million to $30 million, on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. Additionally, Aerie expects cash burn for the full year 2018 in the range of $200 million to $210 million, which includes adjusted total operating expenses in the range of $155 million to $160 million, and capital and inventory build expenditures in the range of $45 million to $50 million. Aerie’s 2018 guidance reflects investments in the sales force and other Rhopressa ® commercial launch activities, ongoing clinical activities for Europe and Japan markets, continued build-out of the manufacturing plant in Ireland, and preclinical activities in support of Aerie’s pipeline, including development of its retina program. Aerie’s adjusted total operating expense guidance excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is expected to be approximately $45 million for the full year 2018.\n“We are all very proud of our 2017 accomplishments, especially the early FDA approval of Rhopressa ® . Our energy is now focused on managing a successful Rhopressa ® launch. With that, we are delighted to provide our net revenue guidance for full-year 2018, which reflects the tremendous efforts we have made thus far in preparing for commercialization, including excellent progress regarding market access. We expect to have our sales force of 100 territory managers in place and fully trained for our anticipated mid-second quarter 2018 launch of Rhopressa ® ,” said Vicente Anido, Jr., Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are entering the year very well financed, allowing us to continue to build this company into what we believe will become a major ophthalmic pharmaceutical company with global reach.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nAs of December 31, 2017, Aerie had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $249.7 million. For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, Aerie reported a GAAP net loss of $58.5 million, or $1.60 loss per share, compared to a net loss of $29.3 million and $0.87 loss per share of 2016. The weighted average number of shares outstanding utilized in the calculation of net loss per share was 36,487,669 and 33,613,375 s of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017 were 36,947,637.\nThe $58.5 million net loss of 2017 is comprised of $60.3 million in total operating expenses, including $38.1 million in research and development expenses, which reflects $24.8 million of expense resulting from the acquisition of assets from Envisia Therapeutics Inc. (Envisia) in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $22.2 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. Excluding $8.0 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, adjusted total operating expenses of 2017 were $52.3 million, with adjusted research and development expenses of $36.0 million and adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses of $16.3 million. Total adjusted net loss of 2017 was $50.5 million, and adjusted net loss per share was $1.38.\nThe $29.3 million net loss of 2016 is comprised of $28.8 million in total operating expenses, including $14.1 million in research and development expenses and $14.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. Excluding $5.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, adjusted total operating expenses of 2016 were $23.5 million, with adjusted research and development expenses of $12.5 million and adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses of $10.9 million. Total adjusted net loss of 2016 was $24.0 million, and adjusted net loss per share was $0.72.\nThe higher operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter 2016 primarily reflect increased activities associated with the expansion of our employee base to support the growth of our operations, and preparatory activities associated with our Rhopressa ® commercialization efforts, as well as $24.8 million of research and development expense related to the Envisia asset acquisition.\nConference Call / Webcast Information\nAerie management will host a live conference call and webcast at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today to discuss Aerie’s financial results and provide a general business update and 2018 guidance.\nThe live webcast and a replay may be accessed by visiting the Company's website at http://investors.aeriepharma.com .

We may, in some cases, use terms such as “predicts,” “believes,” “potential,” “proposed,” “continue,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “plans,” “intends,” “may,” “could,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “exploring,” “pursuing” or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, projections, outlook, analyses or current expectations concerning, among other things: our expectations regarding the commercialization and manufacturing of Rhopressa ® and Roclatan TM or any future product candidates, including the timing, cost or other aspects of the commercial launch of Rhopressa ® and Roclatan TM or any future product candidates; our commercialization, marketing, manufacturing and supply management capabilities and strategies; the success, timing and cost of our ongoing and anticipated preclinical studies and clinical trials for Rhopressa ® , with respect to regulatory approval outside of the United States or additional indications, and Roclatan TM or any future product candidates, including statements regarding the timing of initiation and completion of the studies and trials; our guidance for full year 2018; our expectations regarding the effectiveness of Rhopressa ® , Roclatan TM or any future product candidates and results of our clinical trials; the timing of and our ability to request, obtain and maintain FDA or other regulatory authority approval of, or other action with respect to, as applicable, Rhopressa ® and Roclatan TM or any future product candidates, including the expected timing of, and timing of regulatory and/or other review of, filings for, as applicable, Rhopressa ® and Roclatan TM or any future product candidates; the potential advantages of Rhopressa ® and Roclatan TM or any future product candidates; our plans to pursue development of additional product candidates and technologies within and beyond ophthalmology, including development of Rhopressa ® and Roclatan TM for additional indications and other therapeutic opportunities; our plans to explore possible uses of our existing proprietary compounds beyond glaucoma, including development of our retina program; our ability to protect our proprietary technology and enforce our intellectual property rights; and our expectations regarding strategic operations, including our ability to in-license or acquire additional ophthalmic products, product candidates or technologies. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, competitive dynamics, industry change and other factors beyond our control, and depend on regulatory approvals and economic and other environmental circumstances that may or may not occur in the future or may occur on longer or shorter timelines than anticipated. We discuss many of these risks in greater detail under the heading “Risk Factors” in the quarterly and annual reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In particular, FDA approval of Rhopressa ® does not constitute FDA approval of Roclatan TM , and there can be no assurance that we will receive FDA approval for Roclatan TM or any future product candidates. FDA approval of Rhopressa ® also does not constitute regulatory approval of Rhopressa ® in jurisdictions outside the United States and there can be no assurance that we will receive regulatory approval for Rhopressa ® in jurisdictions outside the United States. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Any forward-looking statements that we make in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures, some of which are discussed above: adjusted net loss, adjusted total operating expenses, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted selling, general and administrative expense, and adjusted net loss per share. For reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss Per Share to Adjusted Net Loss Per Share” tables in this press release.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nThe presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nAERIE PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nDECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 2017 2016 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 197,569 $ 197,945 Short-term investments 52,086 35,717 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 4,487 4,028 Total current assets 254,142 237,690 Property, plant and equipment, net 31,932 7,857 Other assets 4,202 2,707 Total assets $ 290,276 $ 248,254 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 6,245 $ 5,610 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 18,939 13,761 Total current liabilities 25,184 19,371 Convertible notes, net 123,845 123,539 Other non-current liabilities 5,648 — Total liabilities 154,677 142,910 Stockholders' equity Common stock 37 33 Additional paid-in capital 597,318 422,002 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (28 ) (68 ) Accumulated deficit (461,728 ) (316,623 ) Total stockholders’ equity 135,599 105,344 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 290,276 $ 248,254 AERIE PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative $ 22,213 $ 14,664 $ 73,615 $ 44,478 Research and development 38,101 14,093 72,078 52,394 Total operating expenses 60,314 28,757 145,693 96,872 Loss from operations (60,314 ) (28,757 ) (145,693 ) (96,872 ) Other income (expense), net (99 ) (504 ) (1,170 ) (1,994 ) Net loss before income taxes (60,413 ) (29,261 ) (146,863 ) (98,866 ) Income tax (benefit) expense (1,900 ) 61 (1,758 ) 193 Net loss $ (58,513 ) $ (29,322 ) $ (145,105 ) $ (99,059 ) Net loss per common share—basic and diluted $ (1.60 ) $ (0.87 ) $ (4.11 ) $ (3.40 ) Weighted average number of common shares outstanding—basic and diluted 36,487,669 33,613,375 35,324,472 29,135,583 AERIE PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net loss (GAAP) $ (58,513 ) $ (29,322 ) $ (145,105 ) $ (99,059 ) Add-back: non-cash stock-based compensation expense 8,006 5,280 26,078 16,794 Adjusted Net loss $ (50,507 ) $ (24,042 ) $ (119,027 ) $ (82,265 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (GAAP) $ 22,213 $ 14,664 $ 73,615 $ 44,478 Less: non-cash stock-based compensation expense (5,940 ) (3,718 ) (19,972 ) (13,013 ) Adjusted selling, general and administrative expense $ 16,273 $ 10,946 $ 53,643 $ 31,465 Research and development expense (GAAP) $ 38,101 $ 14,093 $ 72,078 $ 52,394 Less: non-cash stock-based compensation expense (2,066 ) (1,562 ) (6,106 ) (3,781 ) Adjusted research and development expense $ 36,035 $ 12,531 $ 65,972 $ 48,613 Total operating expenses (GAAP) $ 60,314 $ 28,757 $ 145,693 $ 96,872 Less: non-cash stock-based compensation expense (8,006 ) (5,280 ) (26,078 ) (16,794 ) Adjusted total operating expenses $ 52,308 $ 23,477 $ 119,615 $ 80,078 AERIE PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Loss Per Share to Adjusted Net Loss Per Share\n(Unaudited)\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net loss per common share—basic and diluted (GAAP) $ (1.60 ) $ (0.87 ) $ (4.11 ) $ (3.40 ) Non-cash stock-based compensation expense 0.22 0.15 0.74 0.58 Adjusted Net loss per share—basic and diluted $ (1.38 ) $ (0.72 ) $ (3.37 ) $ (2.82 ) Weighted average number of common shares outstanding—basic and diluted 36,487,669 33,613,375 35,324,472 29,135,583\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228005904/en/\nAerie Pharmaceuticals\nMedia:\nTad Heitmann, 949-526-8747\ntheitmann@aeriepharma.com\nor\nInvestors:\nRichard Rubino 908-947-3540\nrrubino@aeriepharma.com\nor\nBurns McClellan, Inc., on behalf of Aerie Pharmaceuticals\nMedia:\nJustin Jackson, 212-213-0006\njjackson@burnsmc.com\nor\nInvestors:\nAmi Bavishi, 212-213-0006\nabavishi@burnsmc.com\nSource: Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
