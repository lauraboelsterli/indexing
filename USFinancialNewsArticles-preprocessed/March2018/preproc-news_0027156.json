    "text": "ATLANTA, March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- After 15 years as an independent firm based in Atlanta, CO&P Integrated Marketing is excited to announce that DRUM Agency has acquired the company. The firm's team will lead DRUM Agency's public relations division to serve clients nationally and internationally. With offices in New York, Chicago and Atlanta, DRUM Agency will now have more than 160 employees with the addition of CO&P.\n\"We were attracted to CO&P because they developed and delivered unified marketing solutions with the lead service as public relations,\" said COO Ken Lomasney. \"With their reputation for creating innovative PR solutions for companies that ranged from small to large, they were the perfect compliment to DRUM Agency.\"\nThe CO&P team has successfully represented multiple industries - including consumer goods, technology, financial services, education, sports & entertainment, healthcare and others - with client's spanning both industry segments and geographic regions.\n\"It's a testament to my entire team that we have not only survived, but thrived, during the turbulent times faced throughout our industry these past 15 years,\" said CO&P Founder Amy Woodward Parrish. \"The timing was perfect for our agency to become part of a larger network, so that we could offer additional services and provide deeper resources to our beloved clients.\"\nAt DRUM Agency, everything revolves around getting consumers to move in sync with the goals of clients. Formerly known as Unified Marketing, DRUM Agency was renamed because, 'Rhythm Drives Results.' To do that, they focus on establishing rhythm between creative content, technology, data and media so they can exceed clients' goals. They set the tone with a wide range of services from social media and content strategy to paid search and SEO; from marketing automation and eCRM to traditional media, public relations and direct marketing; from customer insights and strategic planning to campaign analysis and tech consulting.\nWith more than three billion banner impressions, 6 million keywords, 31 million pieces of direct mail and 328 million emails sent each year, there isn't much the DRUM team of experts can't handle.\nEGL Holdings facilitated the transaction for the acquisition. For more information about DRUM Agency, please visit www.DRUMAgency.com .\nAbout DRUM Agency:\nCreative content, paid and earned media, technology and analytics: At DRUM, they do more than coexist. They move in perfect synchronization â€” not only with each other, but with the goals of our clients. There's an irresistible beat that gets brands noticed, gets people talking and, above all, gets results.
