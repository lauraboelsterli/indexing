I’ll therefore refrain here from doing any speculation...,” government spokesman Steffen Seibert said during a news conference. \nTwo people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that Deutsche Bank’s chairman of the board, Paul Achleitner, is looking for a new CEO to replace John Cryan as investors grow frustrated with the slow turnaround of the loss-making German lender.
