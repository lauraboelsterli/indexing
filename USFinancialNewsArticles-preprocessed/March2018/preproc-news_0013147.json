volumes per day for the year ended December 31, 2016 are calculated based on the 171-day period for which we owned Wyoming Refining in 2016. As such, the 2016 amounts for the total refining segment represent the sum of the Hawaii refinery's throughput or sales volumes averaged over the year plus the Wyoming refinery's throughput or sales volumes averaged over the period from July 14, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The amounts for the total refining segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for the year ended December 31, 2017, represent the sum of the Hawaii and Wyoming refineries' throughput or sales volumes averaged over the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\n(2)\nThe profitability of our Hawaii business is heavily influenced by crack spreads in both the Singapore and U.S. West Coast markets. These markets reflect the closest liquid market alternatives to source refined products for Hawaii. We believe the Singapore and Mid Pacific crack spreads (or four barrels of Brent crude converted into one barrel of gasoline, two barrels of distillate (diesel and jet fuel) and one barrel of fuel oil) best reflect a market indicator for our Hawaii refinery operations. The Mid Pacific crack spread is calculated using a ratio of 80% Singapore and 20% San Francisco indices.\n(3)\nWeighted-average differentials, excluding shipping costs, of a blend of crudes with an API of 31.98 and sulfur weight percentage of 0.65% that is indicative of our typical crude oil mix quality compared to Brent crude.\n(4)\nPlease see discussion of Adjusted Gross Margin below. We calculate Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel by dividing Adjusted Gross Margin by total refining throughput.\n(5)\nManagement uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate production costs per barrel; different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways. We calculate production costs per barrel by dividing all direct production costs, which include the costs to run the refineries including personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs, insurance, utilities and other miscellaneous costs, by total refining throughput. Our production costs are included in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) on our consolidated statement of operations, which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations.\n(6)\nThe profitability of our Wyoming refinery is heavily influenced by crack spreads in nearby markets. We believe the Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is the best market indicator for our operations in Wyoming. The Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is computed by taking two parts gasoline and one part distillate (ultra-low sulfur diesel) as created from three barrels of West Texas Intermediate Crude. Pricing is based 50% on applicable product pricing in Rapid City, South Dakota, and 50% on applicable product pricing in Denver, Colorado.\n(7)\nThe throughput for the total logistics segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents the sum of the pipeline throughput in Hawaii averaged over the year plus the pipeline throughput in Wyoming averaged over the period from July 14, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The amounts for the total logistics segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for the year ended December 31, 2017, represent the sum of the Hawaii and Wyoming pipelines' throughput averaged over the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\nManagement uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted Gross Margin is defined as (i) operating income (loss) plus operating expense (excluding depreciation), depreciation, depletion, and amortization (\"DD&A\"), inventory valuation adjustment (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase obligation, and purchase price allocation adjustments), and unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives or (ii) revenues less cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) plus inventory valuation adjustments and unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives. We define cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) as the hydrocarbon-related costs of inventory sold, transportation costs of delivering product to customers, crude oil consumed in the refining process, costs to satisfy our Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\") obligations, and certain hydrocarbon fees and taxes. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) also includes the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and inventory valuation adjustments that we exclude from Adjusted Gross Margin.\nManagement believes Adjusted Gross Margin is an important measure of operating performance and uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. Management believes Adjusted Gross Margin provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing agreement and lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) and Depreciation, depletion, and amortization.\nAdjusted Gross Margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss), net cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross Margin presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation since each company may define this term differently as they may include other manufacturing costs and depreciation expense in cost of revenues.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss), on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree months ended December 31, 2017\nRefining\nLogistics\nRetail\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n23,624\n$\n6,807\n$\n4,111\nOperating expense (excluding depreciation)\n33,831\n2,335\n12,112\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization\n7,510\n1,553\n1,961\nInventory valuation adjustment\n528\n—\n—\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n(702)\n—\n—\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n$\n64,791\n$\n10,695\n$\n18,184\nThree months ended December 31, 2016\nRefining\nLogistics\nRetail\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n27,427\n$\n8,465\n$\n5,062\nOperating expense (excluding depreciation)\n27,671\n2,333\n10,232\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization\n7,916\n1,563\n1,442\nInventory valuation adjustment\n516\n—\n—\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n(5,399)\n—\n—\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n$\n58,131\n$\n12,361\n$\n16,736\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nRefining\nLogistics\nRetail\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n86,013\n$\n33,993\n$\n24,700\nOperating expense (excluding depreciation)\n141,068\n15,010\n45,941\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization\n29,753\n6,166\n6,338\nInventory valuation adjustment\n(1,461)\n—\n—\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n(623)\n—\n—\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n$\n254,750\n$\n55,169\n$\n76,979\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nRefining\nLogistics\nRetail\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n(7,840)\n$\n21,422\n$\n22,194\nOperating expense (excluding depreciation)\n112,724\n11,239\n41,291\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization\n17,565\n4,679\n6,372\nInventory valuation adjustment\n29,056\n—\n—\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n(12,438)\n—\n—\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n$\n139,067\n$\n37,340\n$\n69,857\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding changes in the value of contingent consideration and common stock warrants, acquisition and integration expense, unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, inventory valuation adjustment, loss on termination of financing agreements, and release of tax valuation allowance. Effective in the first quarter of 2017, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) also excludes severance costs. We have recast the non-GAAP information for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 to conform to the current period presentation.\nAdjusted EBITDA is Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excluding interest expense and financing costs, income tax expense (benefit), DD&A, and equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess:\nThe financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; The ability of our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness; and Our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows provided by operating, investing, and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation as other companies may define these terms differently.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), on a historical basis for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss)\n$\n19,005\n$\n13,687\n$\n72,621\n$\n(45,835)\nInventory valuation adjustment\n528\n516\n(1,461)\n25,101\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n(702)\n(5,737)\n(623)\n(12,034)\nAcquisition and integration expense\n142\n1,731\n395\n5,294\nLoss on termination of financing agreements\n6,829\n—\n8,633\n—\nIncrease in (release of) tax valuation allowance (1)\n—\n—\n—\n(8,573)\nChange in value of common stock warrants\n(537)\n515\n1,674\n(2,962)\nChange in value of contingent consideration\n—\n(17)\n—\n(10,770)\nSeverance costs\n—\n—\n1,595\n105\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\n25,265\n10,695\n82,834\n(49,674)\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization\n12,141\n11,778\n45,989\n31,617\nInterest expense and financing costs, net\n6,132\n6,555\n31,632\n28,506\nEquity losses (earnings) from Laramie Energy, LLC\n(6,718)\n7,222\n(18,369)\n22,381\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(3,081)\n205\n(1,319)\n661\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n33,739\n$\n36,455\n$\n140,767\n$\n33,491\n(1)\nIncluded in Income tax benefit (expense) on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\n$\n25,265\n$\n10,695\n$\n82,834\n$\n(49,674)\nUndistributed Adjusted Net Income allocated to participating securities (1)\n300\n105\n1,001\n—\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\n24,965\n10,590\n81,833\n(49,674)\nPlus: Net income effect of convertible securities\n2,595\n—\n10,207\n—\nNumerator for diluted income (loss) per common share\n$\n27,560\n$\n10,590\n$\n92,040\n$\n(49,674)\nBasic weighted-average common stock shares outstanding\n45,596\n45,396\n45,543\n42,349\nAdd dilutive effects of common stock equivalents (2)\n6,482\n30\n6,429\n—\nDiluted weighted-average common stock shares outstanding\n52,078\n45,426\n51,972\n42,349\nBasic Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per common share\n$\n0.55\n$\n0.23\n$\n1.80\n$\n(1.17)\nDiluted Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per common share\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.23\n$\n1.77\n$\n(1.17)",
