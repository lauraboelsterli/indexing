    "text": "(Reuters) - Kobe Steel Ltd ( 5406.T ) Chief Executive Officer Hiroya Kawasaki will step down in connection with a quality lapse scandal that shook the Japanese manufacturing industry last year, the Nikkei reported on Tuesday.\nFILE PHOTO: Kobe Steel President and CEO Hiroya Kawasaki attends a news conference in Tokyo, Japan, November 10, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai The report comes hours before results of a 4-month-long external investigation into the scandal are expected to be released.\nKawasaki will vacate his position in June, the Nikkei reported, adding that Kobe will announce the personnel changes on Tuesday.\nThe head of Kobe's aluminum and copper division, Akira Kaneko, will also resign along with other executive changes, according to the Nikkei report. ( s.nikkei.com/2H6e2tU )\nThe company did not respond to requests for comment outside business hours.\nJapan’s No.3 steelmaker, which supplies manufacturers of cars, planes and trains across the world, said last year that it had supplied roughly 500 customers products with falsified specifications, throwing global supply chains into turmoil.\nKobe also admitted that its executives were aware of the cheating and that the scandal was likely to reduce its recurring profit by 10 billion yen ($94.14 million) this year.\nShares of the company, which nearly halved after news of the scandal broke in October, has recouped some of the losses, partly helped by Japanese automakers vouching for the safety of the company’s aluminum parts.\nHigher prices of steel products and sales of construction machinery have also helped Kobe find its feet, with the company returning to a net profit for the April-December period.\nLast month, Kobe forecast 45 billion yen of profit for the year through March and also raised its sales prediction, suggesting customers had not abandoned the company after the scandal.\n(This version of the story has been refiled to correct dateline to March 6)\nAdditional reporting by Indranil Sarkar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Sayantani Ghosh\n ",
