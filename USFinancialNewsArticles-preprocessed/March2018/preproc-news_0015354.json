    "text": "Raises Dividend and Provides 2018 Earnings Guidance\nHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- U.S. Physical Therapy, Inc. (\"USPH\" or the “Company”) (NYSE: USPH), a national operator of outpatient physical therapy clinics, today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, USPH’s Operating Results increased 16.9% to $6.2 million as compared to $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating Results, a non-generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”) measure, is defined as net income attributable to common shareholders prior to interest expense – mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests – change in redemption value and costs related to restatement of financials, both net of tax, and the tax benefit of revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). Diluted earnings per share from Operating Results was $0.49 in the 2017 fourth quarter and $0.42 in the 2016 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Operating Results increased 7.7% to $26.2 million as compared to $24.3 million in 2016. Diluted earnings per share from Operating Results was $2.08 in 2017 as compared to $1.94 in 2016.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, USPH’s net income attributable to its shareholders, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), was $7.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, as compared to $5.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the 2016 period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, USPH’s net income attributable to its shareholders, in accordance with GAAP, was $22.3 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, as compared to $20.6 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, for the 2016 year. Included in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 is a tax benefit of $4.3 million related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the TCJA. See schedule on page 12 for a computation of diluted earnings per share and a reconciliation of net income attributable to USPH shareholders to Operating Results.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nNet revenues increased $18.3 million or 20.2% from $90.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $109.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to a 14.3% increase in net patient revenues from the physical therapy operations and the revenue from the workforce performance solutions business acquired in March 2017. Net patient revenues from physical therapy operations increased approximately $12.7 million, or 14.3%, to $101.6 million in the 2017 period from $88.9 million in the 2016 period due to an increase in total patient visits of 15.3% from 846,000 to 975,400 offset by a decrease in average net patient revenue per visit to $104.21 from $105.14. Of the $12.7 million increase, $7.8 million related to clinics opened or acquired in 2017 and an increase of $4.0 million in net patient revenues related to clinics opened or acquired in 2016. Revenue from management contracts was $2.2 million as compared to $1.3 million for the 2016 period. The revenue from the workforce performance solutions business was $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Other revenue was $0.7 million in both the 2017 and the 2016 periods. Total operating costs were $85.1 million, or 77.9% of net revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to $72.1 million, or 79.3% of net revenues, in the 2016 period. The $13.0 million increase was attributable to $6.9 million in operating costs related to new clinics opened or acquired in 2017, $4.2 million related to the addition of the workforce performance solutions business, $1.0 million related to management contracts opened or acquired in 2017, an increase of $0.4 million related to clinics opened or acquired prior to January 1, 2017 and an increase of $0.5 million in closure costs primarily due to the write-off of goodwill of $0.4 million related to the closure of a single clinic acquired partnership which management decided to close due to the loss of a significant management contract. Total salaries and related costs, including those from new clinics, were 56.9% of net revenue in the recent quarter versus 57.2% for the 2016 comparable period. Rent, supplies, contract labor and other costs as a percentage of net revenue were 19.6% for the recent quarter versus 20.8% for the 2016 comparable period. The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue was 0.9% for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to 1.2% in the 2016 comparable period. The gross profit, including closure costs, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $24.1 million, or 22.1% of revenue, as compared to $18.8 million, or 20.7% of revenue, for the 2016 quarter. The gross profit percentage for the Company’s physical therapy clinics was 22.6% in the recent quarter as compared to 20.8% a year earlier. The gross profit percentage on management contracts was 18.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to a negative margin in the comparable period of 2016 attributable to a collection issue. The gross profit percentage for the recently acquired workforce performance solutions business was 10.6%. Corporate office costs were $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $7.8 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. Corporate office costs were 9.3% of net revenues for the 2017 quarter compared to 8.6% for the 2016 period. Operating income for the recent quarter increased 27.5% to $14.0 million as compared to $11.0 million in the fourth quarter 2016. Interest expense – mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest – change in redemption value increased to $5.1 million in the fourth quarter 2017 from $0.1 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. The change in redemption value for acquired partnerships is based on the redemption amount (which is derived from a formula based on a specified multiple times the underlying business’ trailing twelve months of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and our internal management fee) at the end of the reporting period compared to the end of the previous period. The redemption value increase is directly related to an increase in the profitability and underlying value of the Company’s partnerships as compared to the prior period. Interest expense – mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest – earnings allocable, which represent the portion of earnings allocable to the holders of mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest, increased to $1.7 million in the 2017 fourth quarter from $0.9 million in the 2016 period. Interest expense – debt and other was $0.5 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and $0.3 million in the 2016 period. The income tax benefit for the 2017 fourth quarter was $2.0 million. The provision for the 2016 fourth quarter was $3.2 million. Included in the fourth quarter of 2017 is a tax benefit of $4.3 million due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the TCJA which was passed by Congress on December 20, 2017 and signed into law by the President on December 22, 2017. The provision for income taxes, prior to the $4.3 million tax benefit, as a percentage of income before taxes less net income attributable to non-controlling interest was 43.5% in the 2017 fourth quarter and 37.5% in the 2016 fourth quarter. Included in the fourth quarter of 2017 was a charge of $0.3 million related to a detailed reconciliation of the federal and state taxes payable and receivable accounts along with federal and state deferred tax assets and liability accounts at December 31, 2016. Without this reconciliation charge, the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes less net income attributable to non-controlling interest was 37.7%. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (permanent equity) was $1.2 million in the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to $1.3 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests (temporary equity) was $0.2 million in the 2017 fourth quarter. Operating Results, a non-GAAP measure, attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased 16.9% to $6.2 million as compared to $5.3 million for the 2016 period. Diluted earnings per share from Operating Results were $0.49 for the 2017 period and $0.42 for the 2016 period. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, USPH’s net income attributable to its shareholders, in accordance with GAAP, was $7.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, as compared to $5.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the 2016 period. See schedule on page 12 for a computation of reported earnings per share and a reconciliation of net income attributable to USPH shareholders to Operating Results. Same store revenues for de novo and acquired clinics open for one year or more increased 4.6%. Visits increased 3.8% for de novo and acquired clinics open for one year or more and the same store net rate increased by approximately 0.8%.\nYear 2017 Compared to Year 2016\nNet revenues increased 16.1% from $356.5 million in 2016 to $414.1 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in total patient visits of 11.7% from 3,317,000 to 3,705,000, higher revenues from management contracts due to an increase in the number of facilities managed by the Company and revenues from the workforce performance solutions business acquired in March 2017. Net patient revenues from physical therapy operations increased approximately $40.4 million, or 11.6%, to $389.2 million in 2017 from $348.8 million in 2016 due to an increase in total patient visits of 11.7% from 3,317,000 to 3,705,000 offset by a slight decrease in average net patient revenue per visit to $105.05 from $105.18. Of the $40.4 million increase, $19.3 million related to clinics opened or acquired in 2017 coupled with an increase of $21.1 million in net patient revenues related to clinics opened or acquired prior to 2017. For the year 2017, revenues from management contracts were $7.4 million as compared to $5.5 million for 2016.

Interest expense – mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest – change in redemption value increased to $12.9 million in 2017 from $6.2 million in 2016.

This change is directly related to an increase in the profitability and underlying value of the Company’s partnerships compared to the respective prior year end. Interest expense – mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest – earnings allocable, which represent the portion of earnings allocable to the holders of mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest, increased to $6.1 million in 2017 from $4.1 million in 2016. Interest expense – debt and other was $2.1 million in 2017 and $1.3 million in 2016. The provision for income taxes for 2017 was $6.0 million and for 2016 was $11.9 million.

Same store revenues for de novo and acquired clinics open for one year or more increased 3.6%. Same store visits increased 4.0% while the net rate declined slightly.\nOther Financial Measures\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company's Adjusted EBITDA increased by 19.2% to $15.0 million from $12.6 million in the comparable 2016 quarter. For the year 2017, the Company's Adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.3% to $57.9 million from $53.5 million in 2016. See definition and explanation of Adjusted EBITDA in the schedule on pages 12 and 13.\nBalance Sheet Change - Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests\nEffective December 31, 2017, the Company entered into amendments to its acquired limited partnership agreements replacing the mandatory redemption feature. No monetary consideration was paid to the partners to amend the agreements. The amended Partnership Agreements provide that, upon certain events, the Company has a call right (the “Call Right”) and the selling entity has a put right (the “Put Right”) for the purchase and sale of the limited partnership interest held by the partner. Once triggered, the Put Right and the Call Right do not expire, even upon an individual partner’s death, and contain no mandatory redemption feature. The purchase price of the partner’s limited partnership interest upon the exercise of either the Put Right or the Call Right is calculated per the original terms of the respective agreements. The Company accounted for the amendment of its Partnership Agreements as an extinguishment of the outstanding Seller Entity Interests classified as liabilities through the issuance of new Seller Entity Interests classified in temporary equity. Pursuant to ASC 470-50-40-2, the Company removed the outstanding liability-classified Seller Entity Interests at their carrying amounts, recognized the new temporary-equity-classified Seller Entity Interests at their fair value, and recorded no gain or loss on extinguishment, as management believes the redemption value (i.e. the carrying amount) and fair value are the same. In summary, the redemption values of the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest (previously classified as liabilities) were reclassified as redeemable non-controlling interest (temporary equity) at fair value on the December 31, 2017 consolidated balance sheet. The remaining balance of $327,000 in the line item – Mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests – relates to one partnership agreement that was not amended as the non-controlling interest was purchased by the Company in January 2018.\nManagement’s Comments\nChris Reading, Chief Executive Officer, said, “I am proud of our entire team for their focus and persistence allowing us to finish the year on a nice up-note in a variety of key areas. Revenue, patient visits, and same store growth were strong in the final quarter, while we made continued progress on our cost and operational realignment initiatives. Finally and importantly, we produced another very good year from a development perspective, organically within some of our strongest partnerships, and through acquisition in great states and new markets where we see continued opportunity for growth and expansion.”\nLarry McAfee, Chief Financial Officer, noted, “Despite making five acquisitions in 2017 for total consideration of $41.3 million and paying $10.1 million in dividends to shareholders, U.S. Physical Therapy’s net debt increased by only $7.1 million as net cash flow from operations was strong. Net debt, that is debt less cash, as of year-end 2017 was $38.8 million as compared to $57.9 million in adjusted EBITDA for the past 12 months.“\nU.S. Physical Therapy Declares Quarterly Dividend\nU.S. Physical Therapy is increasing its quarterly dividend by 15%. The Company’s first quarterly dividend of this year for $0.23 per share will be paid on April 13, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 21, 2018. U.S. Physical Therapy began paying quarterly dividends in 2011 and has increased the dividend amount every year since.\nManagement Provides 2018 Earnings Guidance\nManagement currently expects the Company’s earnings from Operating Results for the year 2017 to be in the range of $29.5 million to $30.9 million or $2.34 to $2.44 in diluted earnings per share. This earnings range is based on an assumed annual corporate tax rate of approximately 28%. Please note that management’s guidance range represents projected earnings from existing operations excluding potential future acquisitions. The annual guidance figures will not be updated unless there is a material development that causes management to believe that earnings will be significantly outside the given range.\nFourth Quarter and Year End 2017 Conference Call\nU.S. Physical Therapy's Management will host a conference call at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time, 9:30 a.m. Central Time, on Thursday, March 8, 2018 to discuss the Company's Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2017 results.

S. PHYSICAL THERAPY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOPERATING RESULTS AND ADJUSTED EBITDA\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\nThe following tables reconcile net income attributable to USPH shareholders calculated in accordance with GAAP to Operating Results and Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes providing Operating Results and Adjusted EBITDA to investors is useful information for comparing the Company's period-to-period results.\nOperating Results is defined as USPH’s net income attributable to common shareholders prior to interest expense – mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests – change in redemption value and costs related to the restatement of financial statements, both net of tax, and the tax benefit of revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the TCJA,. Management uses Operating Results, which eliminates this current non-cash item that can be subject to volatility and unusual costs, as one of the principal measures to evaluate and monitor financial performance period over period. Management believes that Operating Results is useful information for investors to use in comparing the Company's period-to-period results as well as for comparing with other similar businesses since most do not have mandatorily redeemable instruments and therefore have different liability and equity structures.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest income, interest expense – mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests – change in redemption value, interest expense – debt and other, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity-based awards compensation expense. Management believes reporting Adjusted EBITDA is useful information for investors in comparing the Company’s period-to-period results as well as comparing with similar businesses which report adjusted EBITDA as defined by their company.\nOperating Results and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income attributable to USPH shareholders presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Computation of earnings per share - USPH shareholders: Net income attributable to USPH shareholders $ 7,349 $ 5,247 $ 22,256 $ 20,551 Charges to additional paid-in capital: Revaluation of redeemable non-controlling interest (206 ) - (206 ) - Tax effect at statutory rate (federal and state) of 39.25% 80 - 80 - $ 7,223 $ 5,247 $ 22,130 $ 20,551 Basic and diluted net income attributable to USPH shareholders per share $ 0.57 $ 0.42 $ 1.76 $ 1.64 Adjustments: Tax benefit - revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities (4,325 ) - (4,325 ) - Interest expense MRNCI * - change in redemption value 5,055 113 12,894 6,169 Costs related to restatement of financials - legal and accounting 200 - 670 - Revaluation of redeemable non-controlling interest 206 - 206 - Tax effect at statutory rate (federal and state) of 39.25% (2,143 ) (44 ) (5,405 ) (2,421 ) Operating results $ 6,216 $ 5,316 $ 26,170 $ 24,299 Basic and diluted operating results per share $ 0.49 $ 0.42 $ 2.08 $ 1.94 Shares used in computation: Basic and diluted 12,593 12,519 12,570 12,500 * Mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income attributable to USPH shareholders $ 7,349 $ 5,247 $ 22,256 $ 20,551 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 2,441 2,570 9,710 8,779 Interest income (30 ) (31 ) (88 ) (93 ) Interest expense MRNCI * - change in redemption value 5,055 113 12,894 6,169 Interest expense - debt and other 539 298 2,111 1,252 Provision for income taxes (1,997 ) 3,153 6,032 11,880 Equity-based awards compensation expense 1,622 1,214 5,032 4,962 Adjusted EBITDA $ 14,979 $ 12,564 $ 57,947 $ 53,500 * Mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest\nU.S. PHYSICAL THERAPY, INC.
