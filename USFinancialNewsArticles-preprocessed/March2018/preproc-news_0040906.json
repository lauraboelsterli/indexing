    "text": "5 Hours Ago | 01:02 \nPolice in Tempe, Arizona, released footage of a deadly accident on March 18 involving an autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian. \nThe vehicle was operated by Uber, and the video shows the vehicle's safety driver apparently looking down in the moments before the collision. An investigation is ongoing. \nHere's the video from the Tempe police: the details of this incident that occurred on March 18th. We will provide updated information regarding the investigation once it is available. \nTempe police said they responded to the scene of the accident at around 10 p.m. on Sunday, and the 49-year-old victim died after being transported to a local hospital. \n\"Our hearts go out to the victim's family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\" Uber said in a statement. \nUber said this week that it would temporarily halt self-driving car tests in all locations after the accident — what is likely the first pedestrian death caused by a self-driving car. \nA year ago, Uber suspended the same program after a different Arizona crash which did not result in serious injuries . \n—CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan and Deirdre Bosa contributed to this report.
