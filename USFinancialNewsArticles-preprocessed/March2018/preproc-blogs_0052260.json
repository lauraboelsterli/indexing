    "text": "If you're hoping to make a fortune on the sale of your home, prepare to lose about $20,000 in last-minute expenses.\nA study from Zillow, a real estate website, showed that the average homeowner spends $18,342 in additional costs associated with selling a home.\nThis includes closing costs — transfer taxes and commissions for real estate agents. These expenses are $13,357 for the median-valued U.S. home.\nThe median sales price for a home in the U.S. is $232,300 , Zillow said.\nZillow's analysis excluded the other expenses you can expect to see at closing, including filing fees and the cost of title insurance.\n\"If you're planning to sell this year, try to take some time to research what costs you may be responsible for and how they could affect your profit,\" said Jeremy Wacksman, chief marketing officer at Zillow.\nHere's a breakdown of the expenses you can expect to encounter as you sell your house.\nReal estate commissions Getty Images A real estate agent, left, talks with a client during an open house in San Francisco. The payout to the agents representing you and your buyer makes up the lion's share of the additional costs related to selling your home.\nGenerally, sellers pay about 6 percent of the sales price in commissions. This amount is split between the agents representing the buyer and the homeowner.\nThis is also where you'll see the greatest variation across the country.\nA typical seller in San Jose, Calif., will cough up $73,578 in agent commissions, bringing the total cost of selling a house to $81,507. That's because the median sales price of a home there is $1.04 million, Zillow found .\nSee below for an example of closing costs across the country. Click to enlarge.\nAim to get the most service out of your agent.\nSellers ranked \"finding interested buyers\" as the most valued service an agent can provide, followed by \"guiding me through the overall selling process\" and \"leading contract negotiations,\" according to Zillow .\nLeast valued services include creating print ads of the home and promoting the listing on social networking sites.\nTransfer taxes Avosb | iStock / Getty Images Plus | Getty Images Real estate transfer taxes, which are imposed by states and counties, account for a portion of closing expenses and are often covered by the seller.\nThese levies aren't always applicable. Indiana, for instance, has no transfer taxes. However, homeowners in Seattle can expect to spend $8,487 on these expenses.\nForget about trying to deduct transfer taxes when you file your tax return. These aren't deductible to the seller, but they do reduce the amount realized on the sale of the home.\nIf the buyer winds up paying the transfer tax, it's included in the cost basis of the property.\nOverall, the calculus behind the tax benefits of homeownership is changing this year.\nAs of 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act placed a $10,000 cap on homeowners to claim state and local taxes , including property taxes.\nOther changing tax breaks include the deduction for mortgage interest, which is now limited to loans of up to $750,000. That's down from $1 million.\nFurther, under the new law, you can only deduct the interest on a home equity loan or home equity line of credit if you're using the proceeds toward buying, building or substantially improving your home.\nPreviously, you were able to deduct the interest paid on loans of up to $100,000, regardless of how you used the money.\nSprucing up Paul Bradbury | Getty Images Sometimes a fresh coat of paint, carpet cleaning and landscaping might be enough to attract the right buyer.\nIn addition to closing costs, sellers seeking professionals to help them prepare the home for sale spend an average of $4,985, Zillow found.\nThe cost of labor will vary sharply across the country: Homeowners in San Jose, Calif., pay an average of $6,580, while those in Dallas pay $3,720.\nMore from Personal Finance\nBanking bill clears Senate, could make mortgages easier to get at local banks\nHere are the lowest and highest state and local tax rates\nYour property taxes just jumped by more than 50 percent.
