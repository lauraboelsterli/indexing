    "text": "MUMBAI, March 1 (Reuters) - India’s government will consolidate 35 overseas branches of state-run lenders, with 69 more under review, the financial services secretary Rajeev Kumar said in a tweet on Thursday.\nThe government will also examine and shut down all non-viable offshore operations of state banks to cut costs, he said in the tweet, adding the government will also consolidate equity stakes in joint ventures having multiple state-run bank partners.\nIndian banking system has come under renewed scrutiny after a recent $2 billion fraud in Punjab National Bank, the country’s second biggest state lender.
