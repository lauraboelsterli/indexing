    "text": "0 COMMENTS The U.S. dollar fell Wednesday ahead of the conclusion of a Federal Reserve meeting where investors believe the central bank will raise interest rates.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of 16 others, declined 0.3% to 83.88.\nThe Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates Wednesday for the fifth time since December 2016. Investors are also looking ahead to the central bank’s forecasts on the path of growth and the pace of future interest-rate increases.\nTighter monetary policy often attracts investors to a currency by offering higher rates of return. The dollar has weakened against the euro and yen to start the year as the economic outlook for the Europe and Japan has been surprisingly strong, suggesting that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan could end their extraordinary monetary easing.\nThe U.S. dollar fell Wednesday ahead of the conclusion of a Federal Reserve meeting.

President Donald Trump’s administration plans to release on Thursday a package of proposed punitive measures aimed at China that include tariffs on imports worth at least $30 billion. Tariffs are bound to cause China to retaliate , said Clement Leung, Hong Kong’s representative in the U.S.\nThe dollar fell against both the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso after a report by the Toronto Globe and Mail that the U.S. is dropping a contentious demand to boost the amount of U.S. and North American parts needed for a car to be exempt from tariffs under the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n“The U.S. might be more flexible than the market had priced in,” said Brian Daingerfield, a macro strategist at NatWest Markets.\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com",
