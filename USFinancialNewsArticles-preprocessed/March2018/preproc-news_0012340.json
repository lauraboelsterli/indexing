    "text": "HOLON, Israel, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sapiens International Corporation , (NASDAQ: SPNS) (TASE: SPNS), a leading global provider of software solutions for the insurance industry, with a growing presence in the financial services sector, and a member of the Formula Group (NASDAQ: FORTY and TASE: FORT), today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nRevenue increases 25.4% to $71.6 million. Non-GAAP revenue increased 26.9% from the same period in the prior year to $72.4 million. Operating income totaled $1.1 million, down 79.8% compared to last year. Non-GAAP operating income totaled $9.1 million, up 20.9% compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating margin of 1.6%, compared to 9.8% last year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 12.5%, compared to 13.1% last year. Net income attributable to Sapiens' shareholders totaled $3.2 million. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Sapiens' shareholders totaled $6.1 million, compared to $6.0 in the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.07 per diluted share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.12 per diluted share, flat compared to the same period in the prior year.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights:\nRevenue increases 24.5% to $269.2 million. Non-GAAP revenue increased 25.8% from the same period in the prior year to $272.0 million. Operating income totaled $1.0 million, down 96.0% from the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP operating profit totaled $23.1 million, a decrease of 22.0% from last year. Operating margin of 0.4%, compared to 11.5% in the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 8.5%, compared to 13.7% last year. Net income attributable to Sapiens' shareholders totaled $0.4 million. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Sapiens' shareholders totaled $15.5 million, a decrease of 35.8% from the same period in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.01 per diluted share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.31 per diluted share.\n\"We made progress in 2017 executing to our long-term strategy of becoming a leading global provider of insurance software solutions and services. We invested in acquisitions to gain rapid entrance into the US market where we acquired products and solutions, clients, personnel and resources, and strong brands in focused geographies and market segments, as well as R&D to improve our competitive advantages through internal development of products and solutions,\" said Roni Al-Dor, president and CEO, Sapiens. \"From a growth and profitability perspective 2017 was a mixed year. We reported full year Non-GAAP revenue of $272 million, near the top of our revised 2017 guidance range, a year-over-year increase of 25.8%, primarily due to the acquisition of StoneRiver. However, we did not fully meet our 2017 expectations for profitability, with adjusted non-GAAP operating margin for the year of 8.5%.\"\nAl-Dor concluded: \"Sapiens is reiterating prior guidance for 2018 full-year revenues in the range of $280-$285 million (on a non-GAAP basis), an increase of approximately 3% to 5%. Growth is anticipated to be below prior year levels due to the elimination of certain non-core revenue, extension of the rollout time-line for a large client, certain projects that came through an acquisition that will not renew, and the loss of some revenue due to product duplication between StoneRiver and Adaptik. We are also maintaining expectations for adjusted operating margin a range of 12% to 13% (on a non-GAAP basis), based on integration, restructuring benefits, and maximizing our acquired talent.\"\nQuarterly Results Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call and webcast today, March 8 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (4:00 p.m. in Israel) to review and discuss Sapiens' results.\nPlease call the following numbers (at least 10 minutes before the scheduled time) to participate:\nNorth America (toll-free): + 1-888-668-9141; International: +972-3-918-0609; UK: 0-800-917-5108\nThe live webcast of the call can be viewed on Sapiens' website at: http://www.sapiens.com/investors/presentations-and-webcast/\nIf you are unable to join live, a replay of the call will be accessible until March 18, 2017, as follows:\nNorth America: 1-888-782-4291; International: +972-3-925-5918\nA recorded version of the webcast will also be available via the Sapiens website, for three months at the same location.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income attributed to Sapiens shareholders, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share.\nSapiens believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Sapiens' financial condition and results of operations. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. These measures are used in financial reports prepared for management and in quarterly financial reports presented to the Company's board of directors. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends, and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures consist of GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude: Valuation adjustment on acquired deferred revenue, amortization of intangible assets, capitalization of software development, stock-based compensation, compensation related to acquisition, acquisition-related costs, restructuring and cost reduction costs, loss on sales of Marketable Securities and tax adjustment regarding non-GAAP adjustments, as well as the impact of one-time adjustment to our deferred taxes as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job act 2017.\nManagement of the Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation, or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations, as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.\nTo compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. Sapiens urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.\nReconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables of this release.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net profit, adjusted for valuation adjustment on acquired deferred revenue, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, capitalized of software development costs, compensation expenses related to acquisition, acquisition-related costs, restructuring and cost reduction costs, financial expense (income), provision for income taxes and other income (expenses). These amounts are often excluded by other companies to help investors understand the operational performance of their business.\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measurement of its operating performance, because it assists in comparing the operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain non-cash and non-operating items. Adjusted EBITDA reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the operations that the Company believes, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.\nAbout Sapiens\nSapiens International Corporation (NASDAQ and TASE: SPNS) is a leading global provider of software solutions for the insurance industry, with a growing presence in the financial services sector.
