    "text": "WAUKEGAN, Ill., March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- US HealthVest announced the acquisition of Vista Medical Center West from Quorum Health Corporation (NYSE: QHC). Located in Waukegan, Illinois, Vista Medical Center West, previously Provena Saint Therese Medical Center, has provided behavioral health services to the community for over 50 years.\nThe hospital will be renamed Lake Behavioral Hospital and carries a certificate of need for 46 inpatient psychiatric beds. In response to the urgent need for psychiatric services, US Healthvest has been granted a certificate of need to add 100 inpatient psychiatric beds to the campus. US HealthVest will transform the medical office building on campus into a new 146-bed psychiatric hospital that will offer a full continuum of care to patients of all ages.\n\"As a leading provider of behavioral health services in Chicago, we look forward to strengthening our existing presence,\" said Richard Kresch, M.D., President and CEO of US HealthVest. \"This key acquisition gives us the opportunity to expand specialized behavioral health service offerings to all patients, regardless of ability to pay.\"\nLocated in the heart of Waukegan, Lake Behavioral Hospital will continue to provide behavioral health services to patients during the construction of the new hospital.

The hospital will be designed to provide open spaces with daylight, enabling for a safe and therapeutic environment. Shared amenities include activity rooms, therapy spaces and a dining area, along with recreational activity spaces. The hospital, expected to open in the fall of 2019, will create over 150 additional jobs and revitalize the surrounding Waukegan area.\nChicago is a core market for US HealthVest. US HealthVest operates Chicago Behavioral Hospital, a 138-bed psychiatric hospital in Des Plaines, and is developing Silver Oaks Behavioral Hospital, a 100-bed psychiatric hospital, in a joint venture with Silver Cross Hospital in New Lenox.
