    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Police are investigating a suspicious substance at the British parliament in Westminster, with two people taken to hospital as a precaution.\nPolice said they were investigating reports of a suspicious package at the Norman Shaw Buildings, where many lawmakers have their offices, on the parliamentary estate.\n“We are aware of a potential situation involving a suspicious substance which the Met Police are investigating,” a spokeswoman for parliament said in a statement.\n“There has been no evacuation, but the affected area has been cordoned off.”\nLast month, police investigated white powder sent to an office in parliament, which was later found to be harmless.\nPolice said specialist officers were assessing the suspicious package on Monday.\n“London Ambulance Service attended and two people, a man and a woman, have been taken to hospital as a precaution,” they said.\nReporting by William James; writing by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
