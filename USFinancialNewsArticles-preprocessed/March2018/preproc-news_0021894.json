    "text": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Britain and Saudi Arabia signed commercial deals worth more than $2 billion during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmanâ€™s visit to London which ended on Friday, a joint statement said, without providing details.\nAt the start of the trip, the countries set themselves a 65 billion pound ($90 billion) trade and investment target for the coming years, with London looking for new post-Brexit markets for its services sector, and Prince Mohammed seeking to convince wary investors his country is a tolerant and modernizing place.\nReporting by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ",
