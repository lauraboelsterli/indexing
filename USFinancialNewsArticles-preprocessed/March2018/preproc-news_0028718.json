    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aevi Genomic Medicine, Inc. (NASDAQ: GNMX) (the Company) announced today financial and operational results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Year-End Corporate Highlights\nContinued advancing and strengthening the Company's pipeline through a combination of internal programs and external collaborations: AEVI-001: The Company continues screening and recruitment efforts for its Phase 2 (\"ASCEND\") clinical trial in the mGluR mutation positive genetic subset of pediatric and adolescent patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) to confirm genetic responders to AEVI-001. Patient enrollment is ongoing, with data expected by mid-2018. AEVI-002: The Company initiated a Phase 1b proof-of-concept (POC) study in mid-2017. The open-label, signal-finding study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and short-term efficacy of the Anti-Light Monoclonal Antibody AEVI-002 in patients diagnosed with pediatric Crohn's Disease who previously failed treatment with an Anti-TNFÎ± inhibitor. The endpoints of the study include endoscopic evaluation, Crohn's Disease Activity Index ratings, and safety. Patient recruitment is ongoing, and the Company is initiating three additional sites in an effort to enhance enrollment. Data are expected by year-end 2018. AEVI-005: Broadened relationship with Kyowa Hakko Kirin (KHK) with an option agreement for the development of an early stage, first-in-class monoclonal antibody (AEVI-005) program targeting an undisclosed ultra-orphan pediatric rare disease. This is the second monoclonal antibody signed in collaboration with KHK and reflects Aevi Genomic Medicine's unique ability to leverage its genetic expertise in rare and orphan pediatric diseases. The Company intends to initiate a preclinical research program during second quarter 2018. Financial terms were not disclosed. Expanded its unique genomic research collaboration with Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Granted an option for long-term exclusive access to certain data and samples from the Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) biobank and certain discoveries in rare and orphan diseases to accelerate the identification of disease targets and development of potential therapies in areas of unmet need. Renewed the Sponsored Research Agreement (SRA) with CHOP, which marks the third renewal of sponsored research. Strengthened the balance sheet with the completion of a private placement of shares for aggregate proceeds of $28.0 million, before expenses, which provides the resources to continue the development of the Company's two lead clinical programs, AEVI-001 and AEVI-002, and initiate preclinical work on AEVI-005. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Foundation (the \"CHOP Foundation\") was the lead investor, with additional participation by other blue-chip investors. The CHOP Foundation has committed to provide up to an additional $5.0 million of equity financing through June 30, 2018, subject to certain terms and conditions. Announced the addition of Matthew D. Bayley, MD, MBA to the Company's Board of Directors. Dr. Bayley serves as Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer at CHOP where he leads strategic planning and business development working to advance CHOP's mission. His industry experience and business insights will expand the Company's perspective and strategic insights.\n\"2017 enabled us to further refine our approach to genomic medicine and focus our efforts on genomically-targeted indications that could increase the speed and probability of bringing therapies to market for those with pediatric onset, life-altering diseases,\" said Mike Cola, CEO of Aevi Genomic Medicine. \"We continue to advance our pipeline and are pleased to have broadened our relationships with both CHOP and KHK, providing us with the resources to identify new targets and develop potential therapies. We remain committed to our goals of delivering clinical results in our lead programs in ADHD and Crohn's Disease in 2018.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $33.73 million at December 31, 2017. The Company expects the current cash balance to fund operations into early 2019.\nNet research and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $5.26 million, increasing slightly from $5.14 million for the same period in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $1.90 million, decreasing from $3.35 million for the same period in 2016 mainly due to the closure of operations in Israel.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017 the Company reported a net loss of $7.16 million or $0.13 per share, compared with a net loss of $8.48 million or $0.23 per share for the comparative quarter in 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet research and development expenses for year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $25.18 million from $28.36 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by the closure of the Company's operations in Israel of $3.40 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $9.52 million, decreasing from $13.52 million in 2016 primarily due to severance benefits recorded in 2016 related to termination of an officer of $0.97 million, decreased stock compensation expense related to options which have fully vested of $2.00 million, and closure of the Company's operations in Israel of $0.84 million.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nAevi Genomic Medicine will hold a conference call Tuesday, March 13, 2018 at 8:30 am ET to provide a corporate update.
