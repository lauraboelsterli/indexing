    "text": "ZURICH, March 26 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Rocheâ€™s immunotherapy Tecentriq combined with other medicines helped people with advanced lung cancer live longer, compared to patients receiving an older drug combination, the company said in a statement on Monday.\nTreatment mixing Tecentriq with Avastin and chemotherapies carboplatin and paclitaxel boosted overall survival in first-line treatment, compared to patients who received Avastin plus carboplatin and paclitaxel. Roche said it would submit the data to authorities and hopes for a quick approval. (Reporting by John Miller; editing by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi)\n ",
