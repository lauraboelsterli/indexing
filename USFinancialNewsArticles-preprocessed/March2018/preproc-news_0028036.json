    "text": "The Pentagon on Thursday confirmed that there was a hacking attempt this past weekend against an online financial services portal that Citigroup manages for Defense Department credit card holders.\nThe confirmation comes a day after Citigroup told CNBC that a \" malicious actor\" attempted to gain access to information for Pentagon-linked credit card accounts . \nThe bank had responded to CNBC's inquiry regarding an attempted hack this past weekend. The Pentagon, citing information from Citigroup, confirmed to CNBC on Thursday that there was an attack over the weekend of March 10. \nThe bank told the Defense Department that the attack came from a computer system that was randomly guessing cardholder account usernames and passwords. \nThe program hit Citigroup's Pentagon online account application more than 1.3 million times. The hackers did successfully guess 318 Pentagon card holder's usernames and passwords, but they did not get past a secondary layer of account authentication. \n\"No data compromise occurred,\" Citi told the Pentagon.\nCiti provides financial services for the Government Travel Charge Card, or GTCC, which is used by Department of Defense personnel to pay for authorized expenses when on official travel.\nCitiManager is the online portal used by the Defense Department to view statements online, make payments and confirm account balances.\nThe Pentagon's Defense Travel Management Office oversees the processing of the GTCC.",
