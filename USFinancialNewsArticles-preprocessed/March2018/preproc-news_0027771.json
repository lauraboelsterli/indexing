    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SEARCH Group Partners, Inc. announces the sale of its Westlake Village, CA office to Partners Personnel.\nSEARCH Group Partners, Inc. expanded to Southern California in 2015 and built its business there from the ground up. The Westlake Village office experienced such rapid growth that a former mentor of Ema Ostarcevic's, Founder and CEO of SEARCH Group Partners, Inc, developed an interest in acquiring it.\n\"The fact that Partners Personnel took notice of the Southern California office is a testament to what Debby Loesch and our team built there,\" Ostarcevic says. \"I'm having a hard time saying goodbye. I've known Debby for years, but also when you start a business together, it truly feels like a family.\"\nConsidering how familiar everyone is with each other, the transaction really does seem like a family affair -- a reunion even. The acquiring firm, Partners Personnel, was founded by Steve Sorensen, and both Ostarcevic and Loesch worked for Sorensen previously in their careers.\n\"It's all very serendipitous when you think about it,\" Ostarcevic says. \"Steve gave me my first job in the staffing industry. And now, he's acquiring an office that I started with Debby, who worked for him for over 20 years.\"\nSorensen agrees that the way the whole deal worked out felt like kismet.\n\"It's funny how things come together in life sometimes,\" Sorensen says. \"I'm thrilled to work with Debby again and have her team as an integral part of Partners Personnel.\"\nPartners Personnel is rapidly growing its presence in Southern California and this acquisition is part of the expansion plan.\n\"I really admire Steve and I'm excited to see what he does with the foundation we built,\" Ostarcevic says. \"It's a great move for him and a great move for us -- that gives us the opportunity to fully focus on the Utah market, which experienced over 80% revenue growth for us last year.\"\nSEARCH Group Partners, Inc. will continue to focus and execute on its strategic expansion plans for the Utah market.\nAbout Partners Personnel\nPartners Personnel is a new leading staffing agency created by the founder of Select Staffing, Steve Sorensen. Mr. Sorensen was able to grow Select Staffing into a multibillion dollar corporation. The merger of Select Staffing with EmployBridge (a one Billion dollar \"niche\" temporary employment agency) changed the direction of Select—the emphasis moved to \"higher margins\" and \"better profits\" – essentially abandoning the virtues of Select's \"full value\" and \"strong volume\" historic strategies. Mr. Sorensen gracefully stepped away from Select Staffing and fulfilled his three year non-compete obligation. This non-compete expired in May 2017. So, in response to overwhelming support and demand from Mr. Sorensen's long-time customers and employees, he is partnering with key staffing professionals to fill the void and re-establish a \"strong volume\" \"cost competitive\" \"best value\" service organization.\nAbout SEARCH Group Partners, Inc.\nSEARCH Group Partners, Inc.
