    "text": "March 6, 2018 / 3:31 PM / Updated an hour ago Putin sends condolences to relatives of Russians killed in Syria plane crash - RIA Reuters Staff 1 Min Read MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin has sent his condolences to relatives of the 32 Russians killed on Tuesday when a Russian military transport plane crashed in Syria, the RIA news agency cited the Kremlin as saying. Putin had also received a report on the crash from Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, RIA said. His ministry had earlier said that the An-26 had crashed at Russiaâ€™s Hmeymim air base in Latakia Province and that initial information suggested the crash may have been caused by a technical fault.
