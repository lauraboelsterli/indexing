    "text": "REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) today announced fiscal 2018 Q3 results. Total Revenues were up 6% to $9.8 billion, compared to Q3 last year. Cloud and On-Premise Software Revenues were up 8% to $8.0 billion. Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS) revenues were up 33% to $1.2 billion. Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) plus Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) revenues were up 28% to $415 million. Total Cloud Revenues were up 32% to $1.6 billion.\nGAAP Operating Income was up 15% to $3.4 billion and GAAP Operating Margin was 35%. Non-GAAP Operating Income was up 9% to $4.3 billion and non-GAAP Operating Margin was 44%. GAAP Net Loss was $4.0 billion and GAAP Loss Per Share was $0.98 due to a one-time net charge totaling $6.9 billion related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Non-GAAP Net Income was up 21% to $3.5 billion and non-GAAP Earnings Per Share was up 20% to $0.83.\nShort-term deferred revenues were up 8% to $8.0 billion. Operating cash flow on a trailing twelve-month basis was up 13% to $15.2 billion.\n\"During FY17, I forecast double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth for FY18,\" said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. \"With non-GAAP earnings per share up 20% in Q3, our year-to-date earnings per share growth is now up to 16%. At this point, I feel quite confident that we will comfortably deliver on my original forecast of double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth for FY18.\"\n\"Our Fusion ERP and HCM SaaS applications suite revenues grew 65% in the quarter,\" said Oracle CEO, Mark Hurd. \"Our Cloud SaaS applications business is rapidly approaching $5 billionâ€¦and it's still early days. Less than 15% of our on-premise applications customers have begun to migrate their applications to the cloud. As the other 85% of our applications customers start to move their applications to the Cloud, we have a huge opportunity in front of us. We expect to more than double the size of our SaaS business very quickly.\"\n\"The Oracle autonomous database is now fully available in the Oracle Cloud,\" said Oracle CTO, Larry Ellison. \"And there are more autonomous cloud services to come. During this calendar year we expect to deliver Autonomous Analytics, Autonomous Mobility, Autonomous Application Development and Autonomous Integration services. Oracle's new suite of Autonomous PaaS services delivers an unprecedented level of automation and cost savings to our customers.\"\nThe Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 17, 2018, with a payment date of May 1, 2018.\nQ3 Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast\nOracle will hold a conference call and webcast today to discuss these results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific.

Many factors could affect our current expectations and our actual results, and could cause actual results to differ materially. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations: (1) Our cloud computing strategy, including our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and data as a service offerings, may not be successful. (2) If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, or to enhance and improve our products and support services in a timely manner or to position and/or price our products and services to meet market demand, customers may not buy new software licenses, cloud software subscriptions or hardware systems products or purchase or renew support contracts. (3) If the security measures for our products and services are compromised or if our products and services contain significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors, we may experience reputational harm, legal claims and reduced sales. (4) We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to such factors as delays or size reductions in transactions, fewer large transactions in a particular quarter, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for support contracts. (5) Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results, including risks relating to foreign currency gains and losses. (6) Economic, geopolitical and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. (7) We have an active acquisition program and our acquisitions may not be successful, may involve unanticipated costs or other integration issues or may disrupt our existing operations. A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business is contained in our U.S. Commission (SEC) filings, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, particularly under the heading \"Risk Factors.\" Copies of these filings are available online from the SEC or by contacting Oracle Corporation's Investor Relations Department at (650) 506-4073 or by clicking on SEC Filings on Oracle's Investor Relations website at http://www.oracle.com/investor .

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects related to each of the below items except for the impact of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:\nCloud software as a service, cloud platform as a service and infrastructure as a service, software license updates and product support and hardware support deferred revenues: Business combination accounting rules require us to account for the fair values of cloud-based service contracts, software license updates and product support contracts and hardware support contracts assumed in connection with our acquisitions. The non-GAAP adjustments to our cloud software as a service revenues, cloud platform as a service and infrastructure as a service revenues, software license updates and product support revenues and hardware support revenues are intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of such revenues. We believe the adjustments to these revenues are useful to investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business. We have historically experienced high renewal rates on our software license updates and product support and hardware support contracts and our objective is to increase the renewal rates on acquired and new cloud-based service contracts; however, we cannot be certain that our customers will renew our cloud-based contracts or software license updates and product support and hardware support contracts.\nDeferred sales commissions amortization: Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms. Business combination accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our post-combination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these deferred sales commissions balances. The non-GAAP adjustment to increase our sales and marketing expenses is intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented. We believe this adjustment to sales and marketing expenses is useful to investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business. The presentation of this non-GAAP adjustment commenced in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of our acquisition of NetSuite. Such adjustment was not material in prior periods.\nStock-based compensation expenses: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.\nAmortization of intangible assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.\nAcquisition related and other expenses; and restructuring expenses: We have excluded the effect of acquisition related and other expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. We incurred significant expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation expenses for transitional and certain other employees, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance and other exit costs. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. Although acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses generally diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives, we generally will incur these expenses in connection with any future acquisitions and/or strategic initiatives.\nImpact of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: The U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law on December 22, 2017. We recorded a net charge of $6.9 billion during the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018 related to our preliminary assessment of the one-time effects of the Act, including the one-time transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings and the remeasurement of net deferred income tax balances affected by the Act. We have excluded the impact of this charge from our non-GAAP income taxes and net income measures for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018. We believe making these adjustments provides insight to our operating performance and comparability to past operating results.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/q3-fy18-cloud-revenues-up-32-to-16-billion-and-total-revenues-up-6-to-98-billion-300616171.html\nSOURCE Oracle Corporation",
