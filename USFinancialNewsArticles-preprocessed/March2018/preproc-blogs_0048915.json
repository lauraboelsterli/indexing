    "text": "The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline shot up 7 cents a gallon over the past two weeks to $2.66.\nIndustry analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday the increase was driven primarily by rising crude oil prices.\nLundberg says she expects prices to continue to rise over the next few weeks.\nThe increase brings the price of gas to 32 cents a gallon higher than it was at this time last year.\nThe highest average price in the contiguous 48 states was $3.54 in the San Francisco Bay area. The lowest was $2.22 in St. Louis.\nThe average price for diesel fuel rose a penny, to $3.01.",
