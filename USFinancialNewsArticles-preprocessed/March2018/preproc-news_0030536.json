Total number of learning centers increased by eleven during the fourth quarter, including three new learning centers as part of the Company’s acquisition of The Edge Learning Centers Limited (“The Edge”), to 270 as of December 31, 2017, comprising 64 self-owned and 206 franchised learning centers.

Student retention rate at self-owned learning centers remained stable at 70% in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\n“We are pleased to have concluded fiscal year 2017 with solid financial and operational performance in the fourth quarter. This reflects our commitment to quality education and to delivering the best English learning experience to our students,” stated Mr. Yiding Sun, Chief Executive Officer of RISE. “In the year 2017, we are delighted that total student enrollment has gone up 37.9% to 49,894, driven by our continuous center expansion. During 2017, we added a net of ten self-owned learning centers and 39 franchised learning centers, bringing the total number of learning centers in our network to 270 at the year’s end. Looking ahead into 2018, we remain committed to our expansion plans in both new centers and teachers, based on market demand, and to closely monitoring the operation of newly opened centers. At the same time, we will continue our unwavering focus on providing uniformly high quality education services across our entire education network. In 2017, we upgraded our Rise Up courseware, extending our service offerings to the entire K-12 student group, covering students aged three to 18, both online and offline. With our leading service quality, our premium branding power, and effective development strategies, we are confident that we will continue to solidify our leading position in the junior ELT market in China.”\nMs. Chelsea Wang, Chief Financial Officer of RISE, stated, “We are delighted with the financial results that we achieved in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. Our total revenues increased year-over-year by 40.8% and 36.3% in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively. These were driven by a 34.4% year-over-year increase in revenues from our educational programs, a 36.7% year-over-year increase in student enrollments, and a high student retention rate, which remained stable at 70% in 2017. Non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 were RMB 28.6 million and RMB 122.3 million, up by 403.8% and 140.6%, respectively, comparing to the same period of the prior year. In addition, deferred revenue and customer advances increased by 35.2% year-over-year by the end of 2017. These numbers show our confidence that with our constantly improving economies of scale and the efficiency of our network expansion, we are well positioned to capitalize on new opportunities in 2018.”\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenues\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by RMB 78.9 million, or 40.8%, to RMB 272.2 million (US$ 41.8 million) from RMB 193.3 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of RMB 66.7 million in revenues from educational programs.\nRevenues from educational programs for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 36.4% to RMB 249.7 million (US$ 38.4 million) from RMB 183.0 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase in student enrollment at self-owned learning centers in the fourth quarter. The increase in the Company’s student enrollment was attributable to (i) higher student enrollment at existing learning centers as they matured and achieved a higher retention rate, which was partially driven by the Company’s established brand and growing offerings of reputable products; and (ii) the increase in the number of self-owned learning centers to 64 as of December 31, 2017, from 54 as of December 31, 2016; and (iii) higher course fees due to our annual price increase.\nFranchise revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 69.9% to RMB 17.0 million (US$ 2.6 million) from RMB 10.0 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily due to an increase in recurring franchise fees from the Company’s existing franchised learning centers, as well as an increase in initial and renewal franchise fees in the fourth quarter of 2017 for franchised learning centers that were either new or renewed their franchise agreements with the Company. The number of franchised learning centers increased to 206 as of December 31, 2017, from 167 as of December 31, 2016.\nOther revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB 5.4 million (US$ 0.8 million) compared to RMB 0.2 million in the same period of the prior year.

Rental costs increased as the Company expanded its operations. The increase in personnel costs was primarily attributable to an increase in teaching hours at self-owned learning centers and share-based compensation of RMB 17.1 million (US$ 2.6 million) as a result of the Company’s initial public offering in the fourth quarter 2017.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by RMB 42.0 million, or 41.7%, to RMB 142.8 million (US$ 22.0 million) from RMB 100.8 million in the same period of the prior year.

Excluding the impact of share-based compensation included on cost of revenues, non-GAAP gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB 159.9 million (US$ 24.6 million) and non-GAAP gross margin was 58.8%.\nOperating Expenses and Operating Income / ( Loss )\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by RMB 184.6 million, or 211.8%, to RMB 271.7 million (US$ 41.8 million), compared to RMB 87.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Excluding the impact of IPO-related expenses, one-off expenses and share-based compensation, non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB 111.6 million (US$ 17.2 million). As a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased to 41.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 45.1% in the same period of the prior year.\nSelling and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to RMB 61.7 million (US$ 9.5 million), including RMB 9.0 million (US$ 1.4 million) of share-based compensation, from RMB 44.3 million in the same period of the prior year.

The Company drew down a US$ 55.0 million long-term loan facility from CTBC Bank Co. Ltd. on September 12, 2016, and this loan facility was further expanded to US$ 110.0 million in September 2017.

This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of RMB 212.8 million in revenues from educational programs.\nRevenues from educational programs for the full year of 2017 increased by 34.4% to RMB 831.1 million (US$ 127.7 million) from RMB 618.3 million in the full year of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the same factors that led to the quarterly increase.\nFranchise revenues for the full year of 2017 increased by 57.4% to RMB 100.0 million (US$ 15.4 million) from RMB 63.5 million in the full year of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the same factors that led to the quarterly increase.\nOther revenues for the full year of 2017 increased by 31.0% to RMB 38.2 million (US$ 5.9 million) from RMB 29.1 million in the full year of 2016.

Rental costs increased as the Company expanded its operations. The increase in personnel costs was primarily attributable to an increase in teaching hours at self-owned learning centers. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of the Company’s business by its current holding company in 2013, of which the Company recorded RMB 13.9 million (US$ 2.1 million) for the full year of 2017 compared with RMB 34.2 million for the full year of 2016.

Gross margin increased to 53.3% for the full year of 2017 from 48.9% in the prior year.

The Company plans to repay the loan by installments over the next 5 years.\nIncome / (Loss) before Income Tax Expense\nLoss before income tax expense for the full year of 2017 was RMB 0.7 million (US$ 0.1 million) as compared with an income before income tax expense of RMB 83.0 million in the prior year.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense for the full year of 2017 was RMB 52.9 million (US$ 8.1 million), as compared with RMB 32.2 million in the prior year.\nNet Income / (L oss )\nNet loss for the full year of 2017 was 53.6 million (US$ 8.2 million), compared with a net income of RMB 50.8 million in the full year of 2016.

Deferred revenue and customer advances mainly consisted of upfront tuition fee payments from students and initial franchise fees from the Company’s franchise partners.\nBUSINESS OUTLOOK\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects its total revenues to be in the range between RMB 255 million and RMB 265 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 21% to 26%.

Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to USD were made at the rate of RMB 6.5063 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on December 31, 2017 in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or USD amounts referred could be converted into USD or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all. For analytical presentation, all percentages are calculated using the numbers presented in the financial statements contained in this earnings release.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement RISE’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted from results based on U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are set forth in the table at the end of this earnings release titled “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results,” which provides more details on the non-GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses, including non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain transaction-related expenses that do not reflect the ordinary operating expenses of our operations and share-based compensation. These expenses include (i) expenses relating to our IPO, which are expenses that we paid on behalf of our largest shareholder for selling a portion of its shares during the IPO and which we cannot capitalize; (ii) one-off expenses for terminating the consulting agreement between us and an affiliate of our largest shareholder as a result of the IPO and for other non-recurring professional expenses; and (iii) share-based compensation, including all share-based compensation that vested during the fourth quarter as a result of the IPO.\nAdjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income provide us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain transaction-related expenses that do not reflect the ordinary EBITDA and net income of our operations.\nWe use non-GAAP operating expenses, including non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because our management believes these provide a more comparable measure of our continuing business as it adjusts for transaction-related expenses that are not reflective of the normal earnings of our business. These measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business, and to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the historical and current financial performance of the Company’s continuing operations and prospects for the future.\nNon-GAAP financial information should not be considered a substitute for or superior to U.S. GAAP results. In addition, calculations of this non-GAAP financial information may be different from calculations used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.\nAbout RISE Education\nRISE Education Cayman Ltd is a leading junior English Language Training (“ELT”) provider based in Beijing.
