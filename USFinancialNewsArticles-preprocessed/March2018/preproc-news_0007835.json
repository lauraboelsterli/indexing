    "text": "(Reuters) - Newell Brands Inc said on Thursday Kevin Conroy has resigned from the company’s board, amid a proxy fight between hedge fund Starboard Value LP and the Sharpie maker.\nStarboard has said the company has underperformed peers and mismanaged the integration of Jarden Corp, which it bought in 2016.\nThe hedge fund nominated 12 directors to replace Newell’s board including its chief executive officer.\nConroy has resigned from the board for personal reasons, Newell said in a statement on Thursday.\nEarlier in March, Newell said Ros L’Esperance, a former Jarden director, had resigned from the board.\nReporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
