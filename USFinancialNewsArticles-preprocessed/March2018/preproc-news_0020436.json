FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - FIFA Under 17 World Cup Final - England vs Spain - Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan, Kolkata, India - October 28, 2017 England’s Rhian Brewster wins the Golden Boot for the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui Brewster, 17, alleged that he was racially abused by Mironov during Liverpool’s 2-0 UEFA Youth League win against the Russian side in December and UEFA appointed an Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector to conduct a thorough independent probe. “The inspector took statements from five players from both teams, as well as from two match officials, who were in the vicinity of the alleged incident. None of these heard any discriminatory words,” UEFA said in a statement. “Mironov was also interviewed by the inspector and stated that he indeed swore at Brewster, but he unreservedly denied using any discriminatory language.” UEFA said that the inspector believed England under-17 international Brewster’s allegations were made in good faith before closing the disciplinary proceedings. Liverpool acknowledged UEFA’s findings and said they had accepted their decision. “We would like to place on record our admiration for the courage shown by Rhian Brewster throughout this process and commend his exemplary conduct,” a Liverpool spokesperson said. “The club is very proud of the maturity, dignity and leadership Rhian has displayed in bringing focus to this issue and he will continue to receive our full support.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge",
