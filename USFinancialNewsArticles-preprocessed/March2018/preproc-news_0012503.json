    "text": "Wolters Kluwer Health to Acquire Firecracker\nMarch 5, 2018 - Wolters Kluwer Health announces today that it has signed an agreement to acquire Firecracker, an adaptive learning, assessment, and study-planning solution used by more than 20 percent of U.S. medical students.\nFirecracker will become part of the Health Learning, Research & Practice group, which produces high quality medical education and practice content under the Lippincott imprint.\nFounded in 2009, Firecracker uses a technology- and data-driven approach to improve medical student learning in preparation for high stakes exams, including the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). The platform, in which more than 85 million questions are answered annually, is powered by an adaptive algorithm that delivers personalized learning and remediation to ensure ongoing retention of content and preparedness for medical school finals and certification exams.\n\"We're excited to expand our portfolio of online evidence-based learning tools with Firecracker's proven technology,\" said Diana Nole, CEO, Wolters Kluwer Health . \"Combined with Lippincott premium content and solutions, Firecracker enhances our position in the medical education market and helps us further leverage machine learning and advanced technologies to help clinicians deliver the best quality care to patients.\"\nFirecracker has 16 employees and is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.
