    "text": "0 COMMENTS Mozambique Finance Minister Adriano Maleiane met with creditors in London Tuesday to unveil a restructuring proposal he said the country needs to end fiscal deficits in the next five years.\nThe proposal asks holders of about $2 billion in loans and bonds to accept debt reductions and to delay repayment until as late as 2034. Bondholders, who have been waiting for an offer since the country defaulted in January 2017, said they were disappointed.\n“It’s a total nonstarter for bondholders,” said Thomas Laryea, a lawyer representing a committee of mutual fund and hedge-fund managers who own 60% of Mozambique’s $726 million bond.\nMozambique needs to resolve its debt crisis to resume borrowing from the International Monetary Fund and, potentially, from commercial lenders.\nEconomic growth has fallen by half to about 3% in 2017 since the country lost access to international capital in 2016 after The Wall Street Journal reported the existence of $1.2 billion in previously undisclosed loans to companies partially owned by Mozambique’s intelligence service. Low growth will likely continue until 2023 when exports from Mozambique’s large natural gas fields is expected to start, according to a restructuring presentation Mozambique published Tuesday.\nThe restructuring proposed by Mozambique would treat holders of the bonds on equal footing with owners of the loans, which were originally made by Swiss lender Credit Suisse AG , Russian bank VTB Group and French bank BNP Paribas SA . The bondholder group has long opposed such an arrangement because the loans were borrowed with government guarantees the Mozambican Parliament determined were illegal and because Mozambique has already restructured the bonds once with the help of Credit Suisse. Members of the bondholder committee include Franklin Resources Inc., Greylock Capital Management LLC and NWI Management LP.\nMozambique offered creditors the choice to exchange existing debt into three different types of new debt due in eight, 12 or 16 years. Those accepting bonds due 2034 would be repaid in full and earn higher interest rates while those opting for faster repayment would accept write-downs as high as 20% and be paid less interest. The country, which is being advised by Lazard, also requested forgiveness of half of the $249 million past-due interest it owes.\nRaymond Zucaro, chief investment officer at RVX Asset Management , said the potential deals outlined by the Mozambican government would garner between 50 and 65 cents on the dollar for investors, a far cry from the price of 84 cents on the dollar the government’s euro bond was Quote: d by traders on Tuesday. RVX has invested in Mozambican bonds but doesn’t hold them now, he said.\nSome investors went to the meeting hoping the government would sweeten its offer with warrants that would pay out if economic growth cleared certain thresholds in the future and left disappointed. Without such an option, creditors have little incentive to accept debt that ties them to Mozambique for more than a decade, one bondholder said.\n“We’re not considering it,” Mr. Maleiane said, because Mozambique is very poor and needs any excess revenues to invest in infrastructure like hospitals. “I ask creditors to support these programs.”\nMozambique suffers from chronic food shortages but the IMF and donor countries have stopped lending to the country because much of the money raised in the bond and loan deals is missing. The U.S. Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating the debt deals .\nMozambique’s attorney general and a governmental tribunal are investigating in the country and abroad to determine where the funds went and who might be responsible, Mr. Maleiane said.\nThe Finance Minister also said he hasn’t reached any settlement on any of the defaulted debt. Mozambique’s foreign minister Jose Pacheco said earlier this month that the country had agreed on a restructuring of the loans made by VTB with officials of the bank owned by the Russian government. Mr. Maleiane said he would continue negotiations with creditors Wednesday in one-on-one meetings.\nWrite to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com and Julie Wernau at Julie.Wernau@wsj.com",
