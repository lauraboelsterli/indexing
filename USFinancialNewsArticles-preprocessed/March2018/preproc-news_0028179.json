    "text": "TORONTO, March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scythian Biosciences Corp. (the \" Company \" or “ Scythian ”) (TSXV:SCYB) (Frankfurt:9SB) (OTC – Nasdaq Intl:SCCYF) announces that, further to its press release on March 9, 2018 whereby the Company announced shareholder approval of an up to eight for one (8-for-1) stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares (the “ Stock Split ”), the Company’s Board of Directors has determined that the Stock Split will be effected on a 4-for-1 basis, to ensure the Company continues to meet Nasdaq minimum pricing for its pending listing. Accordingly, each holder of common shares will receive 4 common shares in exchange for every common share currently held. The Stock Split will increase the number of issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from 7,083,397 to 28,333,588. The Stock Split is subject to regulatory approval from the TSX Venture Exchange and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).\nJonathan Gilbert, CEO of the Company, commented, “We believe that the stock split and the resulting increase in the number of shares outstanding will encourage greater market liquidity and wider distribution of our shares among a broader investor base.”\nScythian is also pleased to announce the appointment of Vic Neufeld as the Company’s new Chairman of the Board of Directors, replacing Jonathan Gilbert, who will remain as Chief Executive Officer and as a Director. George Scorsis was also appointed Lead Director of the Company.\nMr. Neufeld has been a director of the Company since January 15, 2018. He brings over twenty years of management experience and expertise in the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Neufeld previously served as the Chief Executive Officer of Jamieson Laboratories, Canada’s largest manufacturer and distributor of natural vitamins, herbs and botanical medicines. He is currently the Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Aphria Inc. (TSX:APH).\n“On behalf of Scythian, I would like to thank Jonathan Gilbert for his tremendous leadership as Chairman of the Board of Directors,” said Mr. Neufeld. “I look forward to continuing to serve the shareholders of Scythian as its new Chairman,” he added.\nAbout Scythian Biosciences Corp.\nScythian is a research and development company committed to finding a solution for the prevention and treatment of concussions and traumatic brain injury with its proprietary Cannabinoid combination.\nScythian’s mission is to be the first accepted drug regimen for concussive treatment.
