    "text": "TOKYO, March 12 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose over 1 percent on Monday, with technology stocks posting strong gains after February’s U.S. jobs report eased fears of inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes.\nThe Nikkei was up 1.76 percent at 21,846.22 points as of 0153 GMT. The index rose to as much as 21,971.16 in early trade, its highest since Feb. 28.\nThe stock market showed little reaction as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came under renewed fire over suspicions of cronysim involving sale of state-owned land.\n“From past experience, investors know that scandals facing the current administration tends to go unanswered and eventually forgotten,” said global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\nChip-related technology stocks advanced following gains on Friday on the Nasdaq, with Tokyo Electron up 3.3 percent, SUMCO advancing 3.9 percent and Screen Holdings adding 1.7 percent.\nNikon Corp rose 2.2 percent and Canon Inc gained 2.1 percent.\nExporters were also supported after the dollar made large gains against the yen following Friday’s U.S. employment report.\nPanasonic Corp climbed 2.6 percent, Bridgestone Corp added 3.2 percent and Nissan Motor Co rose 1.7 percent.\nAll of Tokyo’s 33 sub-indexes rose, led by rubber products and mining.\nThe broader Topix was up 1.4 percent at 1,739.82.
