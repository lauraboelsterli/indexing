    "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australiaâ€™s central bank is seen as all but certain to keep its cash rate at a record low 1.5 percent at its monthly policy meeting next week, a Reuters poll of economists showed.\nA man smokes next to the Reserve Bank of Australia headquarters in central Sydney, Australia February 6, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Munoz Of 27 economists surveyed, 26 forecast the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would stand pat at its policy meeting on March 6.\nThe RBA eased twice in 2016 but has since held steady as it awaits a pick up in wage growth and inflation amid a jobs boom.\nWhile the majority predicted the central bank would keep rates steady until the third quarter this year, 14 of 27 respondents forecast that it would tighten at least once by December of 2018.\nThe cash rate is seen at 2.0 percent by mid-2019, according to the median of 24 economists.\nReporting by Swati Pandey; Polling by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ",
