    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 12:01 PM / Updated 8 hours ago Wales captain Jones commits future to Ospreys Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones has committed his future to the Ospreys by agreeing a new national dual contract (NDC) with the region and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU).

Jones, who has completed three tours with the British and Irish Lions, signed his first NDC in March 2015 and re-signed in 2016. “Alun Wyn committing his future to the game here in Wales is another huge boost for Welsh rugby,” WRU group chief executive Martyn Phillips said. “He is renowned and respected as a player and leader and his commitment to the Ospreys and to Wales is hugely significant and it is fantastic that another world-class player will remain in Wales. “This announcement will also help drive our long-term focus on retaining young Welsh talent as young players will learn and benefit from Alun Wyn’s experience within our environment and that will help shape the next generation of Wales’ players.” Jones will lead Wales in their final Six Nations match against France on Saturday, with Warren Gatland’s side aiming to finish second in the standings.
