    "text": "HYDERABAD, March 8 (Reuters) - Indian airlines Jet Airways , SpiceJet Ltd and AirAsia India are planning to add new jets to their fleets as they look to expand in the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, the carriers said on Thursday.\nDomestic Indian passenger traffic increased by 17.9 percent in January from a year earlier, marking the 41st consecutive month of double-digit growth, the International Air Transport Association said in a monthly update released on Thursday.\nCivil Aviation Secretary Rajiv Nayan Choubey said as long as oil prices remained below $80 per barrel, he expected the Indian aviation market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15 percent for the next 20 years or so.\n“We are committed to ensure that new airports are built, better air space management services are provided, so that there is no congestion in the skies,” Choubey said at the Wings India airshow.\nIndian airlines are scrambling to add more jets to meet demand for more domestic and international flights, making it one of the most targeted sales markets for jet manufacturers Airbus SE and Boeing Co.\n“The growth of the domestic Indian (aviation) market is the highest in the world,” Boeing Senior Vice President Asia Pacific and India Sales Dinesh Keskar said. “Every segment of traffic in and out of India is going to grow for the next 20 years.”\nBoeing said in July it expected Indian airlines to order up to 2,100 new aircraft worth $290 billion over the next 20 years, calling it the highest-ever forecast for Asia’s third-largest economy.\nJet Airways hopes to close a deal to buy another 75 narrowbody jets by the end of March, its CEO Vinay Dube told reporters on the sidelines of the airshow.\nThe airline last year finalised a deal to buy a separate 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and said it was in “serious talks” for 75 more.\nDube said it would finalise the deal with one of the plane manufacturers, alluding to Boeing or Airbus.\nAirAsia India is looking to expand its fleet to 60 jets from the current 14 over the next five years, a spokeswoman said. The airline’s parent, AirAsia Bhd, said in January it was considering an IPO of the Indian arm.\nIndian low-cost carrier SpiceJet said in July it had signed a provisional deal to buy 40 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets.
