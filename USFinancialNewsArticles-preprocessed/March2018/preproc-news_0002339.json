    "text": "RADNOR, Pa., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Safeguard Scientifics, Inc. (NYSE: SFE) (\"Safeguard\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial results for the three months and 12 months ended December 31, 2017 and provided a business update regarding the achievement of developmental milestones for its 25 Partner Companies. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, Safeguard's net loss was $18.7 million, or $0.91 per share, compared with net loss of $21.7 million, or $1.07 per share, for the same period in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's net loss was $88.6 million, or $4.34 per share, compared with net loss of $22.3 million, or $1.09 per share, in 2016.\n\"In the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal 2017, Safeguard's portfolio of growth-stage, technology-driven businesses demonstrated positive momentum as they achieved critical operational and strategic milestones,\" said Stephen T. Zarrilli , Safeguard's President and CEO. \"With revenue growth of 23% over the prior year, our Partner Companies continued to drive strong momentum. As these companies near maturation, we are well-positioned to capitalize on exit opportunities that will enhance value for our shareholders.\"\n2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nRealized $15.5 million from the sale of Safeguard's interest in Nexxt, Inc., formerly known as Beyond.com . Subsequent to the close of 2017, Spongecell agreed to merge into privately held Flashtalking, a global platform for digital advertising management and analysis. Safeguard now holds a 10% equity position in Flashtalking. Deployed $36.8 million in follow-on funding to support 18 existing Partner Companies. Repurchased $14 million principal amount of Safeguard's 5.25% convertible senior debentures due May 2018, reducing the outstanding balance to $41.0 million. Entered into a new $75 million secured, revolving credit facility with HPS Investment Partners, LLC. At closing, Safeguard drew $50 million under the credit facility.\nAGGREGATE PARTNER COMPANY REVENUE\nAggregate Partner Company revenue for 2018 is projected to be between $475 million and $500 million, which includes revenue for all Partner Companies in which Safeguard had an interest at January 1, 2018. Aggregate revenue for the same Partner Companies was $410 million and $344 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Figures for all years reflect the pro forma combined revenue of Flashtalking and Spongecell due to their recent merger. Aggregate revenue for all years reflects revenue on a net basis. Safeguard reports the revenue of its equity and cost-method Partner Companies on a one-quarter lag basis.\nCORPORATE EXPENSES AND COST SAVINGS PLAN\nAs announced in January 2018, the Company has initiatives underway that are expected to generate annualized cost savings of $5 million to $6 million, reflecting changes in personnel and operating requirements under its new strategy, discussed below. Corporate expenses, excluding interest, depreciation, severance and stock-based compensation were approximately $15.1 million in 2017.\nCHANGE IN STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS\nOn January 17, 2018, Safeguard announced a change in its business strategy and operations. Under the new strategy, Safeguard will not deploy any capital into new Partner Company opportunities. It will focus on managing and financially supporting its existing Partner Companies to exit events and deliver net proceeds to shareholders. The Company will consider initiatives including, among others: the sale of individual Partner Companies, the sale of certain Partner Company interests in secondary market transactions, or a combination thereof, as well as other opportunities to maximize shareholder value.\n\"We began 2018 by implementing changes to our business strategy and operations with a focus on managing and supporting our existing Partner Company interests towards exits that maximize our risk-adjusted return on those interests, generating substantial cost savings, and returning net proceeds to shareholders,\" added Mr. Zarrilli. \"While we will no longer deploy capital into new opportunities, we remain committed to supporting the needs of our existing Partner Companies and continue to maintain a deep belief in their underlying value proposition. Since announcing our shift in strategy in January, we have been encouraged by the positive feedback and increased market interest we have received. We are confident that these actions are in the best interest of Safeguard and will maximize value for all its shareholders.\"\nPARTNER COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS\nThis section summarizes significant accomplishments by Safeguard's partner companies during 2017.
