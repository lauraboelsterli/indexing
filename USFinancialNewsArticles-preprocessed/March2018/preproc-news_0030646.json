    "text": "LOS ANGELES, March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: LYV) (the \"company\") today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $500 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2023 (the \"Convertible Notes\") and $300 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 (the \"Senior Notes\"). The company intends to use the net proceeds from these offerings to repurchase its 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2019 from time to time, to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nIn connection with the Convertible Notes offering, the company expects to grant the initial purchasers a 30-day option to purchase an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of such Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, if any. The completion of the Convertible Notes offering is not contingent on the completion of the Senior Notes offering, and the completion of the Senior Notes offering is not contingent on the completion of the Convertible Notes offering.\nThe Convertible Notes will mature on March 15, 2023, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2022, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods; thereafter, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, holders of the Convertible Notes will receive shares of the company's common stock, cash or a combination thereof, at the company's election. Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at 100% of their principal, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of certain corporate events constituting a \"fundamental change\" as defined in the indenture for the Convertible Notes.\nThe Senior Notes will be guaranteed by certain of the company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries and will be senior unsecured obligations of the company. The Senior Notes will mature on March 15, 2026.\nEach of the Convertible Notes and Senior Notes will be offered through a private placement and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws. As a result, the Convertible Notes, the Senior Notes and any common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States or to any \"U.S. persons\" except pursuant to an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Convertible Notes and Senior Notes will be offered only to \"qualified institutional buyers\" under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and, in the case of the Senior Notes, outside the United States, to persons other than \"U.S. persons\" in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. This news release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Convertible Notes, any common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes or the Senior Notes, nor shall there be any sale of any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the offerings and the expected use of the net proceeds, which are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, risks related to whether the company will consummate the offerings of the Convertible Notes and Senior Notes on the expected terms, or at all, market and other general economic conditions, and the fact that the company's management will have discretion in the use of the proceeds from any sale of the Convertible Notes and Senior Notes. The company refers you to the documents it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, specifically the section titled \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which contains and identifies important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the company's projections or forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.\nInformation found on Live Nation Entertainment's website is not incorporated by reference.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/live-nation-entertainment-announces-launch-of-private-notes-offerings-300614517.html\nSOURCE Live Nation Entertainment",
