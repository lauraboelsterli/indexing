His comments came two weeks after reports that guidelines for China Depositary Receipts (CDRs), similar to American Depositary Receipts, were likely to be finalised in the second half of this year by Chinaâ€™s securities regulator. Earlier on Wednesday, Tencent reported a 98 percent rise in quarterly net profit, beating expectations as it deepens monetisation of the growing traffic on its social networks.
