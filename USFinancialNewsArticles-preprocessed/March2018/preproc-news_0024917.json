Sale of two 2005-built suezmax tankers through a sale and leaseback transaction generating $15.6 million of free cash. Fleet of 65 vessels, totaling 7.2 million dwt, consisting of 47 tankers that trade in the crude space, three shuttle tankers, 13 tankers carrying products and two LNG vessels. Dividend of $0.05 per common share paid in December 2017 and new dividend of $0.05 per common share declared for payment on May 10, 2018.\nATHENS, Greece, March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TEN, Ltd (TEN) (NYSE:TNP) (the “Company”) today reported results (unaudited) for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nYEAR-END 2017 RESULTS\nGross revenue amounted to $529.2 million, a 9.8% increase over 2016, due to the increase of the fleet by seven new vessels on long term attractive contracts.\nEBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) totaled $216.3 million adjusted, while operating income amounted to $76.3 million before non-cash impairment charges and the loss on the sale of two suezmax vessels through a sale and leaseback transaction. The daily time charter equivalent (TCE) for the fleet (voyage revenue less voyage expenses) averaged $18,931 for the year, well above the spot market average for 2017, in all categories of vessels we operate.\nNet income, excluding the above non-cash items, reached $20.4 million.\nContinuous proactive vessel management together with the scale of our technical managers assisted in reducing daily vessel operating expenses to $7,688 from $7,763 in 2016, despite the impact of a weaker US dollar. Efficient cost management also contributed to lower average daily overheads (G&A, management fees) per vessel which experienced a significant drop by 13.4%.\nDepreciation and dry-docking amortization costs were $139.0 million due to fleet growth.\nInterest and finance costs reached $56.8 million due to increased loan expenses and interest on the loans drawn down for the newly delivered vessels to the fleet.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nTEN generated gross revenues of $134.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 2.9% increase over the $130.7 million revenue earned in the fourth quarter of 2016, the increase being mainly due to the addition of 7.4 modern vessels, on average, between the two fourth quarters.\nRevenues net of voyage expenses (bunker, port expenses and commissions) for the same period were $106.6 million, a 7.6% increase from the same quarter of 2016 while total voyage expenses declined by 11.8% as more of the fleet’s vessels were placed under time-charters.\nNet income for the quarter was at $2.7 million before the non-cash items mentioned above.\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the vessels on time charter contracts generated $90.5 million gross revenue, enough to cover all the operating, overhead and finance costs of the whole fleet. Vessels on spot charters, despite the softness in that market, contributed an additional $21 million of revenue after bunker and port expenses, indicating that the expected improvement in spot rates, after the majority of the current orderbook delivers, will have a significantly positive impact on TEN’s bottom line.\nDespite a difficult tanker market due to a temporary surplus vessel capacity and production cuts by leading suppliers, which resulted in market spot rates in several sectors falling to exceptionally low levels, TEN’s vessels, which primarily operate under secured contracts, achieved an average daily net revenue per vessel of $18,343, a comparatively high rate compared to the spot market. During the quarter, the fleet achieved a notable 98% utilization rate.\nOperating income before non-cash items came in at $15.9 million and daily operating expenses per vessel remained at economic levels at $7,823 despite a 9.3% weakening of the US dollar against the Euro, which affected crew costs and repair costs. Average daily overheads per vessel (G&A, management fees) fell by 2.9%.\nIn October 2017, TEN took delivery of the aframax newbuilding Bergen TS , bringing to completion the newbuilding program of 15 vessels. The Bergen TS immediately started its pre-arranged long-term charter, as with all the preceding newbuildings joining the fleet.\nInterest and finance costs in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $13.7 million, an increase over the 2016 fourth quarter partly due to the new financing obtained for the new building program and market increases in the applicable LIBOR rate. This was offset by gains achieved from bunker hedges.\nTEN’s balance sheet remained strong with cash balances at $202.7 million as of December 31, 2017. Net debt to capital at December 31, 2017 was at a healthy 50.9%. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter amounted to $52.9 million.\nOther Developments\nOn December 21, 2017 TEN sold the 2005-built suezmax tankers, Euronike and Eurochampion 2004 to third-party entities, for $65.2 million and chartered them back on a bareboat basis for five years as part of a sale and leaseback deal. The sale resulted in a non-cash loss of $3.9 million, but related debt of $36.0 million was prepaid leaving $15.6 million of free cash immediately available.\nFollowing internal impairment tests, our oldest vessels, the 1998-built VLCC Millennium and the 2002-built suezmax Silia T, were determined to have carrying values in excess of fair value as assessed by independent brokers. Consequently, an impairment charge of $8.9 million was incurred.\nDividend – Common Shares\nThe Company will pay a dividend of $0.05 per common share on May 10, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 3, 2018. Inclusive of this payment, TEN will have distributed a total of $10.65 per share in uninterrupted dividends to its common shareholders since the Company’s listing on the NYSE in March 2002.\nCorporate Strategy\n2018 started with TEN operating the largest fleet in its 25 year history, 77% of which in secured contracts averaging 2.7 years with minimum secured revenues of $1.3 billion. Of the vessels under those fixed contracts, 40% have the ability to capture market upswings through pre-agreed profit sharing provisions which together with the vessels operating in pure spot contracts, empower the Company with significant cash generating muscle when rates firm, expected in mid to late 2018.\nTEN continues to position its fleet to safeguard cashflows to meet all 65 vessels’ costs and expenses, while having a large enough complement of spot and profit-share chartered vessels have the flexibility to take advantage of rate changes and evolving trading patterns. Management will continue to adapt its chartering policy to conform to these norms and adjust the fleet’s employment profile accordingly, but always cognizant of its stated strategy of smoothing market cyclicality while offering visibility to its investors.\nIn terms of fleet management, growth opportunities will continue to be explored and assessed provided they do not add undue burden on TEN’s balance sheet. Conversely, vessel divestments, particularly relating to our first-generation tankers, will become more important as asset prices recover, as expected, when the current schedule of newbuilding deliveries, mostly ordered on speculation, begins to decline.\n“As we enter our 25 th year, we are proud to report profits in such a challenging environment. TEN’s tried and tested strategy of providing downside protection while allowing for the flexibility to capture rate hikes, has proved effective once again. The markets are gradually positioning for an upturn and TEN is well placed to reap those rewards as they will occur,” Mr. Nikolas P. Tsakos, President and CEO of TEN commented. “I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our associates and partners for their support and continuous efforts these 25 years and especially our men and women that serve on our vessels together with our onshore colleagues, the Board of Directors and management of TEN,” Mr. Tsakos concluded.\nConference Call:\nAs previously announced, today, Monday, March 12, 2018 at 10:00 a.m Eastern Time, TEN will host a conference call to review the results as well as management's outlook for the business.

However, management believes that certain non-GAAP measures used within the financial community may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods as well as comparisons between the performance of us and other shipping companies. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance. We are using the following Non-GAAP measures: (i) TCE which represents voyage revenues less voyage expenses divided by the number of operating days. (ii) Vessel overhead costs are General & Administrative expenses, which also include Management fees, Stock compensation expense and Management incentive award. (iii) Operating expenses per ship per day which exclude Management fees, General & Administrative expenses, Stock compensation expense and Management incentive award. (iv) Adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA. See above for reconciliation to net (loss) income and earnings per share, respectively. Our presentation of adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA should not be contrued as an influence that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not incur corporation tax.\nSource:Tsakos Energy Navigation",
