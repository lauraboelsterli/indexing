YES! further announced the promotion of Karen E. Hamilton to the position of Chief Operating Officer, replacing Mr. Schaub.\nSteve Schaub was a co-founder of YES! and has been the company's Chief Operating Officer since its inception in January 2008. Mr. Schaub is a recognized industry leader, with over 25 years of experience in the acquisition, management and development of manufactured home communities. Prior to the formation of YES!, Mr. Schaub served for eight years in senior positions with Chateau Communities and its predecessor, ROC Communities, both publicly-traded manufactured home community REITs.\nKaren Hamilton has played key roles at YES! since its inception, most recently as Vice President of Operations since 2012.

I look forward to working with Steve and the other members of the YES! team in an advisory capacity going forward. \"\nSteve Schaub said, \"Gary McDaniel has been a visionary leader in our industry for decades and, in a very real sense, YES! is a reflection of his foresight and vision. As I assume the responsibilities of CEO, I look forward to the benefit of Gary's advice and counsel in the years ahead.\"\nMr. Schaub added, \"I am also extremely pleased that Karen Hamilton will be taking on the role of COO. Karen has been a key partner in building out our operations over the last ten years, during which time YES! has nearly tripled in size.
