    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KMG (NYSE:KMG), a global provider of specialty chemicals and performance materials, today announced financial results for the fiscal 2018 second quarter ended January 31, 2018.\n2018 Second Quarter Financial Highlights\nSales increased 44% from the second quarter of last year to a record $113.9 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 200% to $1.59 from $0.53 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 were a record $1.04 compared to $0.57 per share reported in the second quarter of last year. Among other items, adjusted EPS exclude an $11.0 million benefit from recent U.S. tax reform. GAAP net income increased to a record $25.3 million, compared to $6.5 million in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA 2 was a record $29.4 million, up 124% from $13.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\n“KMG’s record second quarter results reflect broad-based growth across our businesses, significant contributions from recent acquisitions and our disciplined focus on execution,” said Chris Fraser, KMG chairman and CEO. “Supported by our continued strong financial performance and reduction in leverage from our recent equity offering, we successfully repriced our outstanding debt during the second quarter, generating substantial interest expense savings.”\nMr. Fraser continued, “Second quarter sales in our electronic chemicals segment increased 6% year-over-year to a record $73.9 million, driven by growth in each of our major geographic regions. Segment operating income and margins also reached record levels in the second quarter, reflecting a favorable product mix and gains in operational efficiency.\n“Our performance materials segment generated record sales and operating income in the second quarter, fueled by contributions from Flowchem and Sealweld, as well as growth in our industrial lubricants and wood treating chemicals businesses. Addressing key growth opportunities in the pipeline and energy markets, our pipeline performance business benefited from growing demand for our value-added products and services that enhance pipeline integrity and safety, as well as optimize pipeline throughput and performance. Our wood treating chemicals business also performed well, aided in part by the need to replace storm-damaged utility poles.”\nMr. Fraser concluded, “Considering our solid financial performance in the first half of fiscal 2018, as well as our expectations for continued growth in the second half of the year, we are increasing our fiscal 2018 sales forecast to $445-455 million, from $435-450 million previously, and increasing our fiscal 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $114-118 million, from $110-115 million.”\nConsolidated results\nSecond quarter\nDollars in thousands, except EPS Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 As Reported Adjusted As Reported Adjusted (GAAP) (non-GAAP) 3 (GAAP) (non-GAAP) 4 Net sales $ 113,851 $ 113,851 $ 79,071 $ 79,071 Operating income 21,730 25,635 9,040 9,857 Operating margin 19.1 % 22.5 % 11.4 % 12.5 % Net income 25,337 16,618 6,486 7,017 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.59 $ 1.04 $ 0.53 $ 0.57\nSix months ended January 31\nDollars in thousands, except EPS Fiscal 2018 YTD Fiscal 2017 YTD As Reported Adjusted As Reported Adjusted (GAAP) (non-GAAP) 5 (GAAP) (non-GAAP) 6 Net sales $ 224,515 $ 224,515 $ 155,566 $ 155,566 Operating income 41,810 49,126 17,720 18,670 Operating margin 18.6 % 21.9 % 11.4 % 12.0 % Net income 31,187 27,746 12,227 12,844 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.18 $ 1.94 $ 1.00 $ 1.05 Business segment results\nElectronic Chemicals Second Quarter Second Quarter First Half First Half Dollars in thousands Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 As Reported As Reported As Reported As Reported (GAAP) (GAAP) (GAAP) (GAAP) Net sales $ 73,924 $ 69,766 $ 147,732 $ 136,688 Operating income 12,730 9,583 23,988 17,644 Operating margin 17.2 % 13.7 % 16.2 % 12.9 % For the second fiscal quarter, the Electronic Chemicals segment reported:\nSales of $73.9 million, up 6% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Sales grew in each geographic region. Operating income of $12.7 million, up 32.8% from $9.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2017. Operating income increased due to higher sales, product mix and operational efficiencies. Operating margin improved to 17.2% compared to 13.7% in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA 7 of $15.0 million compared to $12.2 million last year.\nPerformance Materials\nThe Performance Materials segment consists of the pipeline performance business and the wood treating chemicals business.\nPerformance Materials Second Quarter Second Quarter First Half First Half Dollars in thousands Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 As Reported As Reported As Reported As Reported (GAAP) (GAAP) (GAAP) (GAAP) Net sales $ 39,927 $ 9,305 $ 76,783 $ 18,878 Operating income 12,810 3,023 24,394 6,704 Operating margin 32.1 % 32.5 % 31.8 % 35.5 % For the second fiscal quarter, the Performance Materials segment reported:\nSales of $39.9 million versus $9.3 million in the same period a year ago. Sales growth reflected contributions from Flowchem and Sealweld, as well as product volume growth in both industrial lubricants and wood treating chemicals. Operating income of $12.8 million compared to $3.0 million last year. The increase in operating income reflected contributions from Flowchem and Sealweld, as well as product volume growth in both industrial lubricants and wood treating chemicals. Segment operating margins were 32.1%, compared to 32.5% in the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense related to the acquisitions of Flowchem and Sealweld. Adjusted EBITDA 8 of $17.1 million versus $3.2 million last year.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nSales: We increase our fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales forecast to $445-455 million, from our prior guidance of $435-450 million. Adjusted EBITDA: We increase our adjusted EBITDA forecast to $114-118 million, from our prior guidance of $110-115 million, reflecting stronger growth expectations in both our electronic chemicals and performance materials segments. Our revised fiscal 2018 adjusted EBITDA forecast includes approximately $8.0 million in stock-based compensation expense, compared to our prior estimate of approximately $6.5 million. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense is forecast to be approximately $31 million. Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures are forecast to be approximately $29 million, in line with our prior estimate, and include a portion of our planned capital investment in Singapore.\nWith respect to the Company’s full year guidance of Adjusted EBITDA, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of these fiscal 2018 non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts; certain items that are included have not yet occurred and cannot be reasonably predicted, and, accordingly, the probable significance of such items cannot be determined at this time. The most comparable GAAP measure and reconciling information that is unavailable, or not reasonably predictable, would include restructuring and realignment charges and acquisition and integration-related expenses.\nConference call\nDate: Thursday March 8, 2018\nTime: 5:00 p.m. ET\nDial in: 844-316-8066 or 703-736-7353\nConference ID: 1178959\nThe conference call will be webcast live via the “Investors” section of the Company’s website at http://kmgchemicals.com .\nIf you are unable to listen live, the conference call will be archived on the KMG website.

As required by SEC rules, the tables below present a reconciliation of our presented non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
