    "text": "LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks fell to two-week lows on Friday, with steelmakers taking a pounding after President Donald Trump said he would impose hefty tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminium, reviving fears of a trade war.\nTrump said the duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium would be formally announced next week, risking retaliation from key trading partners. Among emerging market exporters, Brazil, South Korea and China are considered the most exposed to the new tariffs.\nThe news triggered a broad-based sell-off across developed and emerging markets, with MSCI’s emerging stocks index down 0.7 percent in a fourth straight day of losses and set to end the week down 2.6 percent.\n“I assume there will be some retaliatory measures,” said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB.\n“Countries might go through the WTO (World Trade Organisation) first to see if they can get a ruling in their favour, but it’s unlikely to make a big difference as Trump is unlikely to abide by any of their rulings. So it will be up to the individual countries to decide on their response.”\nA possible course would be for countries to target specific U.S. products that would have an impact on a par with the steel and aluminium tariffs, he suggested.\nSouth Korea - the third-largest steel exporter to the United States after Canada and Brazil - said it would keep talking to U.S. officials until Washington’s plans are finalised.\nShares in Seoul fell over 1 percent to a three-week low with Dongkuk Steel tumbling over 5 percent, while Posco and Hyundai Steel dropped some 3 percent.\nHong Kong shares slid 1.5 percent while Chinese mainland shares fell 0.8 percent, with steelmaker Baoshan Iron & Steel and Aluminium Corp of China suffering.\nAlthough China accounts for only 2 percent of U.S. steel imports, its massive industrial expansion has helped produce a global glut of steel that has driven down prices.\nTrade tensions between the world’s top two economies have already hotted up in recent weeks: China launched an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation of imports of U.S. sorghum after Trump slapped steep tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines.\nThe sell-off spread widely through emerging markets. South African stocks fell 1 percent, dragged down by steelmaker ArcelorMittal tumbling 5.5 percent.\nMoscow shares fell 0.3 percent, with Russian steel producer NLMK shedding 1.9 percent, and coal and steel producer Mechel 1.3 percent. Polish stocks slipped 0.8 percent to their lowest since July 2017.\nEarlier, Brazil’s industry ministry said it would consider taking action on its own over the tariffs, or in concert with other countries. Two of its largest steelmakers, Cia Siderurgica Nacional and Usiminas, closed down more than 4 percent on Thursday.\nHowever, the weaker dollar helped shelter emerging currencies. Russia’s rouble, South Korea’s won and China’s yuan firmed around 0.2 percent, though all three currencies were on track for weekly losses.\nThe rand was treading water after data showed South Africa’s budget deficit widened year-on-year in January. However, the currency was on track for a 2.6 percent weekly fall, its biggest weekly drop since October.\nIn emerging Europe, the Polish zloty remained under pressure, extending losses against the euro to trade at three-week lows. European Union lawmakers are supporting the European Commission’s plans to take unprecedented punitive steps against Poland over reforms of its judiciary and state media that they say threaten the rule of law in the ex-communist country.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1183.53 -8.72 -0.73 +2.16\nCzech Rep 1113.95 -3.78 -0.34 +3.32\nPoland 2314.29 -20.67 -0.89 -5.97\nHungary 37454.03 -313.82 -0.83 -4.88\nRomania 8374.99 -36.69 -0.44 +8.01\nGreece 824.63 -6.37 -0.77 +2.77\nRussia 1270.16 -4.02 -0.32 +10.02\nSouth Africa 50546.74 -464.28 -0.91 -3.78\nTurkey 17068.01 -564.06 -0.48 +1.50\nChina 3254.58 -19.18 -0.59 -1.59\nIndia 34046.94 -137.10 -0.40 -0.03\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.39 25.43 +0.17 +0.55\nPoland 4.19 4.19 -0.16 -0.46\nHungary 313.55 313.41 -0.04 -0.96\nRomania 4.66 4.66 -0.05 +0.42\nSerbia 117.84 117.78 -0.05 +0.48\nRussia 56.72 56.81 +0.17 +1.66\nKazakhstan 322.30 321.83 -0.15 +3.26\nUkraine 26.54 26.66 +0.47 +6.07\nSouth Africa 11.85 11.84 -0.08 +4.25\nKenya 101.20 101.20 +0.00 +1.88\nIsrael 3.45 3.47 +0.43 +0.75\nTurkey 3.81 3.80 -0.10 -0.51\nChina 6.35 6.36 +0.17 +2.54\nIndia 65.20 65.22 +0.03 -2.10\nBrazil 3.25 3.25 +0.00 +1.88\nMexico 18.85 18.83 -0.09 +4.25\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 317 0 .02 7 90.15 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ",
