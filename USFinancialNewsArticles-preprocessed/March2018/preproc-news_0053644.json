    "text": "Published: Mar 28, 2018 5:08 p.m. ET Share \nWere warrants from nation’s secret spy court to surveil Carter Page legal? \nBy Getty Images Carter Page, a one-time adviser to the presidential election campaign of Donald Trump \nWASHINGTON—The Justice Department’s internal watchdog unit will investigate how the FBI and federal prosecutors obtained warrants from the nation’s secret spy court to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser, the inspector general’s office said Wednesday. \nThe statement confirms an investigation that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had requested and disclosed last month. \nThe inspector general will examine the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s compliance with legal requirements in its application for warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, said in the statement. \nRepublican lawmakers have alleged abuses in how top law-enforcement officials sought in 2016 to monitor the former campaign adviser, Carter Page. They have alleged that officials didn’t properly disclose to the court the partisan motivations of information they received from an ex-British spy, whose work in gathering the information was being funded by Democratic Party intermediaries.",
