Core SG&A, defined as total SG&A adjusted for stock-based compensation, transaction costs, severance, restructuring and other costs, and marketing leads and advertising expense, for the year was $43.0 million (17.2% of revenues) in 2017, compared to $34.1 million (18.5% of revenues) in 2016.\nNet income was $26.5 million in 2017, compared to $13.1 million in 2016, an increase of 102.3%. Net income included a reduction of $0.8 million due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”). The decrease in maximum corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% resulted in a one-time increase in income of $11.8 million due to a reduction in the Tax Receivable Agreement Liability. Additionally, we recognized a one-time, $12.6 million charge to income tax expense due to a reduction of our Deferred Tax Asset. EBITDA was $47.3 million in 2017, compared to $11.7 million in 2016, an increase of 304.3%. 2017 EBITDA included an $11.8 million increase due to the reduction in the Tax Receivable Agreement Liability.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $45.5 million in 2017, an increase of 63.7% over $27.8 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 18.2% in 2017, compared to 15.1% in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for items that are not part of regular operating activities, including tax receivable adjustments, severance, restructuring costs, and other non-cash items such as stock-based compensation. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 and 2016 fiscal year is included within this press release.\nGAAP diluted EPS for 2017 was $1.50, compared to $0.57 in 2016. Current year diluted EPS was negatively impacted by a one-time net charge of approximately $0.06 related to the Tax Act.\nAdjusted EPS for 2017 was $1.65, compared to $1.12 in 2016. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income per share is included within this press release.\nThe Company makes short-term advances to distributors based on actual sales. These advanced commissions assist distributors with working capital. The Company recovers advances on an ongoing basis from future commissions on premiums, which are collected over the period in which policies renew. In 2017 the year-end net advanced commission balance was $39.5 million, a $2.5 million increase from the 2016 year-end balance of $37.0 million, and up $12.5 million sequentially.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $39.3 million as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $27.1 million from December 31, 2016. The Company repurchased 222,184 shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2017 for $4.9 million as part of its previously announced share repurchase program.\nFourth Quarter Financial Discussion\nFourth quarter revenues of $69.5 million increased 35.2%, compared to fourth quarter revenues in 2016, driven primarily by an increase in policies in force during the Open Enrollment Period which ended December 15, 2017, favorable commission margins and improved discount benefit plan offerings.\nTotal SG&A was $19.0 million (27.3% of revenues) in the fourth quarter, compared to $16.0 million (31.1% of revenues) in the same period in 2016. Core SG&A was $11.7 million (16.8% of revenues) in the fourth quarter, compared to $8.5 million (16.5% of revenues) in the same period of 2016. A reconciliation of SG&A to core SG&A for each quarter in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 is included within this press release.\nNet income was $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.4 million in the same period in 2016, an increase of 257.1%. Net income included a reduction of $0.8 million due to the Tax Act. The change in maximum corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% resulted in a one-time increase in income of $11.8 million due to a reduction in the Tax Receivable Agreement Liability. Additionally, we recognized a one-time charge of $12.6 million to income tax expense due to a reduction of our Deferred Tax Asset. EBITDA was $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to negative $4.9 million in the same period in 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 EBITDA included an $11.8 million increase due to the reduction in the Tax Receivable Agreement Liability.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $10.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 18.0% over $8.9 million in the same period in 2016.

Fourth quarter diluted EPS was negatively impacted by approximately $0.06 related to the Tax Act.\nAdjusted EPS for the fourth quarter in 2017 was $0.37, compared to $0.35 in the same period in 2016, an increase of 5.7%.\nRegulatory Update\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation granted the Company a third-party administrator's license, subject to certain conditions, most of which are considered to be standard for such a license.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company is the subject of a multistate examination.

These non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined below, should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.\nHIIQ is presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing HIIQ’s operating results through the eyes of management and because HIIQ’s believes that these measures provide a useful tool for investors to use in assessing HIIQ’s operating performance against prior period operating results and against business objectives. HIIQ uses the non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.\nThe accompanying tables provide more detail on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures described above and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. HIIQ has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance or adjusted EPS guidance to GAAP net income or GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, because HIIQ does not provide guidance for the reconciling items between these measures and GAAP net income or GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. As certain of the items that impact GAAP net income and/or GAAP net income per diluted share cannot be reasonably predicted at this time, HIIQ is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income is not available without unreasonable effort.\nHEALTH INSURANCE INNOVATIONS, INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n($ in thousands, except share and per share data)\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 39,345 $ 12,214 Restricted cash 14,920 11,938 Accounts receivable, net, prepaid expenses and other current assets 3,789 2,815 Advanced commissions, net 39,549 37,001 Total current assets 97,603 63,968 Property and equipment, net 5,408 4,022 Goodwill 41,076 41,076 Intangible assets, net 5,942 7,907 Deferred tax assets, net 14,960 8,181 Other assets 96 193 Total assets $ 165,085 $ 125,347 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 39,725 $ 29,680 Deferred revenue 662 430 Income taxes payable 787 2,121 Due to member 1,775 3,282 Other current liabilities 5 126 Total current liabilities 42,954 35,639 Due to member 15,096 9,460 Other liabilities 34 170 Total liabilities 58,084 45,269 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Class A common stock (par value $0.001 per share, 100,000,000 shares authorized; 12,731,758 and 8,156,249 shares issued as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively; 12,350,981 and 8,036,705 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) 13 8 Class B common stock (par value $0.001 per share, 20,000,000 shares authorized; 3,841,667 and 6,841,667 shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) 4 7 Preferred stock (par value $0.001 per share, 5,000,000 shares authorized; no shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) — — Additional paid-in capital 71,770 47,849 Treasury stock, at cost (380,777 and 119,544 shares as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) (6,887 ) (1,122 ) Retained earnings 19,305 1,420 Total Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. stockholders’ equity 84,205 48,162 Noncontrolling interests 22,796 31,916 Total stockholders’ equity 107,001 80,078 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 165,085 $ 125,347 HEALTH INSURANCE INNOVATIONS, INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income\n($ in thousands, except share and per share data)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited) Revenues (premium equivalents of $106,309 and $85,325 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $395,552 and $311,590 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) $ 69,490 $ 51,424 $ 250,476 $ 184,516 Operating expenses: Third-party commissions 42,154 29,954 145,300 107,663 Credit card and ACH fees 1,423 1,182 5,127 3,960 Selling, general and administrative 18,989 16,007 64,446 51,527 Depreciation and amortization 1,086 882 4,044 3,249 Total operating expenses 63,652 48,025 218,917 166,399 Income from operations 5,838 3,399 31,559 18,117 Other (income) expense: Interest (income) expense (17 ) 8 (19 ) 61 Fair value adjustment to contingent acquisition consideration — — — 15 TRA (income) expense (11,835 ) 9,220 (11,835 ) 9,678 Other expense 77 4 104 5 Net income before income taxes 17,613 (5,833 ) 43,309 8,358 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 12,598 (7,252 ) 16,818 (4,751 ) Net income 5,015 1,419 26,491 13,109 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 1,232 1,607 8,606 8,596 Net income attributable to Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. $ 3,783 $ (188 ) $ 17,885 $ 4,513 Per share data: Net income per share attributable to Health Insurance Innovations, Inc.

EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We have included EBITDA in this report because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. However, EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, each as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently than we do. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nTo calculate adjusted EBITDA, we calculate EBITDA, which is then further adjusted for items that are not part of regular operating activities, including acquisition costs, and other non-cash items such as non-cash stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. We have presented adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe that it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nTo calculate adjusted net income, we calculate net income then add back amortization (but not depreciation), interest, tax expense and other items that are not part of regular operating activities, including acquisition costs, restructuring costs, contract termination costs, tax receivable agreement liability adjustments, and other non-cash items such as non-cash stock-based compensation and fair value adjustment to contingent consideration. From adjusted pre-tax net income we apply a pro forma tax expense calculated at an assumed rate of 38.8%. We believe that when measuring Company and executive performance against the adjusted net income measure, applying a pro forma tax rate better reflects the performance of the Company without regard to the Company’s organizational tax structure. We have included adjusted net income in this report because it is a key performance measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of our company. Other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do. Adjusted net income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or substitution for earnings per share as reported under GAAP.\nAdjusted net income per share is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the total number of diluted Class A and Class B shares of our common stock for each period. We have included adjusted net income per share in this report because it is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. Other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do. Adjusted net income per share has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for earnings per share as reported under GAAP.\nReconciliation of Premium Equivalents to Revenues\n(unaudited)\n($ in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Premium equivalents $ 106,309 $ 85,325 $ 395,552 $ 311,590 Less risk premium 35,335 32,556 138,880 121,436 Less amounts earned by third party obligors 1,484 1,345 6,196 5,638 Revenues $ 69,490 $ 51,424 $ 250,476 $ 184,516 Premium equivalents is defined as our total collections, including the combination of premiums, fees for discount benefit plans, enrollment fees, and third-party commissions and referral fees. All amounts not paid out as risk premium to carriers or paid out to other third-party obligors are considered to be revenues for financial reporting purposes. We have included premium equivalents in this report because it is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the inclusion of premium equivalents can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. This financial measurement is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and is not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be used as, and is not an alternative to, revenues as a measure of our operating performance.\nSummary of Selected Metrics\n(unaudited)\n($ in thousands)\nSubmitted Applications during the Three Months Ended December 31, Submitted Applications during the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change (%) 2017 2016 Change (%) IFP 125,800 85,300 47 % 431,900 312,500 38 % Supplemental products 104,600 93,600 12 % 320,600 312,500 3 % Total 230,400 178,900 29 % 752,500 625,000 20 %\nPolicies in Force\nAs of December 31, 2017 2016 Change (%) IFP 179,300 133,600 34 % Supplemental products 196,800 156,500 26 % Total 376,100 290,100 30 %\nSubmitted IFP Applications by Channel Q4’16 Q1’17 Q2’17 Q3’17 Q4’17 eCommerce 22,400 31,800 13,500 20,600 27,200 All Others 62,900 85,300 82,400 72,500 98,600 Total 85,300 117,100 95,900 93,100 125,800\nCore SG&A as a Percentage of Revenue Q4’16 Q1’17 Q2’17 Q3’17 Q4’17 Total SG&A $ 16,007 $ 15,257 $ 14,697 $ 15,503 $ 18,989 Less: Stock-based compensation 2,430 821 934 2,682 2,967 Less (add): Transaction costs — 306 450 5 (16 ) Less: Severance, restructuring and other charges 2,163 533 363 238 672 Less: Marketing and Advertising 2,912 3,787 1,800 2,249 3,657 Core SG&A (1) $ 8,502 $ 9,810 $ 11,150 $ 10,329 $ 11,709 % of Revenue 16.5 % 17.6 % 18 % 16.3 % 16.8 % (1) Core SG&A is defined as total SG&A adjusted for stock-based compensation, transaction costs, severance, restructuring and other costs, and marketing leads and advertising expense.\nContacts:\nHealth Insurance Innovations, Inc.:\nMichael Hershberger\nChief Financial Officer\n(813) 397-1187\nmhershberger@hiiQuote: .com\nInvestor Contact:\nJohn Evans\nPIR Communications\n(415) 309-0230\nIR@hiiQuote: .com\nMedia Contact for AgileHealthInsurance.com & HealthPocket.com :\nKevin McVicker\nKmvicker@sbpublicaffairs.com\nMedia Contact for HealthPocket.com :\nCassandre Durocher\nCdurocher@sbpublicaffairs.com\nSource:Health Insurance Innovations, Inc.",
