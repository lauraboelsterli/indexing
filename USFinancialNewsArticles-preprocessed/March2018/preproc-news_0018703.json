Cucina Italiana and BRIO Tuscan Grille restaurant concepts, GP Investments, Ltd. (“GP”), a leading private equity and alternative investment firm, and its controlled company Spice Private Equity Ltd. (“Spice”), a Swiss investment company focused on private equity investments, today announced a merger agreement under which an affiliate of Spice will acquire the Company for a total enterprise value of approximately $100 million. The transaction proceeds will be funded by Spice, along with certain third party financing sources.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, BBRG’s shareholders will receive $4.05 per share in cash.

We are pleased to be partnering with the Company and its leadership to build an even stronger foundation for value creation and profitable growth,” said Antonio Bonchristiano, Chief Executive Officer of GP Investments, Ltd. “As a private entity, we will have greater flexibility to take a long-term view as we invest in Bravo Brio’s future growth and expansion, which will drive rewards for the Company and our investors.”\nUpon closing of the transaction, BBRG will continue to be operated as an independent company and remain based in Columbus, Ohio.\nDechert LLP served as legal advisor and Piper Jaffray & Co. served as financial advisor to BBRG.
