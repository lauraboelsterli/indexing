    "text": "Conference Call and Webcast @ 8:30am ET Today\nTEL AVIV, Israel, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VBL Therapeutics (Nasdaq:VBLT), today reported top-line results from its pivotal Phase 3 GLOBE study in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) which was designed to evaluate VB-111 in combination with bevacizumab (Avastin ® ), compared to the bevacizumab control arm. The study did not meet its pre-specified primary endpoint of overall survival (OS).\nDror Harats, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of VBL Therapeutics, said \"We are disappointed that our encouraging Phase 2 data were not replicated in the GLOBE Phase 3 study, and once we receive the full and final data we will be analyzing them carefully to better understand the outcome of the study. We are grateful to the trial investigators, site personnel, patients and caregivers who participated in GLOBE. We believe that VB-111 may still hold promise for other indications we currently or may study in the future.”\nConference Call Thursday, March 8 at 8:30am Eastern Time US Investors: 800-239-9838 International Investors: 323-794-2551 Conference ID: 3511679 Webcast: https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/f7whg6sk About the GLOBE study\nThe GLOBE pivotal Phase 3 trial is a randomized, controlled, double-arm, open-label study of VB-111 dosed every two months in combination with bevacizumab dosed every two weeks, compared to bevacizumab monotherapy. Key inclusion criteria include first or second progression of glioblastoma following standard of care treatment with temozolomide and radiation, a histologically confirmed diagnosis of glioblastoma and measurable disease by RANO criteria at progression.\nThe study is conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) granted by the FDA, with full endorsement by the Canadian Brain Tumor Consortium (CBTC). VB-111 has received orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe and was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for promising and meaningful long-term survival in patients with glioblastoma that has recurred following treatment with standard chemotherapy and radiation.\nAbout Glioblastoma (GBM)\nGBM is the most common and most aggressive form of primary brain tumors. In 2017, it is estimated there were approximately 12,000-13,000 new cases diagnosed in the United States. Median OS from diagnosis averages 12 to 15 months with patients treated usually with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Progression occurs within approximately 6 months in virtually all patients, and upon progression median OS is about 6-8 months. Although significant research and clinical efforts have focused on improving treatments for recurrent GBM, no systemic therapy has shown an OS benefit, resulting in a significant unmet medical need.\nAbout VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec)\nVB-111, a potential first-in-class anticancer therapeutic candidate, is the Company’s lead oncology product currently being studied in a Phase 3 trial for ovarian cancer. VB-111 has demonstrated statistically significant OS and PFS in a Phase 2 trial in patients with rGBM, versus current standard of care. VB-111 has received orphan drug designation in both the US and Europe, and fast track designation in the US for prolongation of survival in patients with rGBM. In addition, VB-111 successfully demonstrated proof-of-concept and survival benefit in Phase 2 clinical trials in radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer and recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer. VB-111 has received an Orphan Designation for the treatment of ovarian cancer by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\nAbout VBL\nVascular Biogenics Ltd., operating as VBL Therapeutics, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class treatments for cancer. The Company’s lead oncology product candidate, ofranergene obadenovec (VB-111), is a first-in-class, targeted anti-cancer gene-therapy agent that is positioned to treat a wide range of solid tumors. It is conveniently administered as an IV infusion once every two months. It has been observed to be well-tolerated in >300 cancer patients and demonstrated efficacy signals in an “all comers” Phase 1 trial as well as in three tumor-specific Phase 2 studies. Ofranergene obadenovec is currently being studied in a Phase 3 trial for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains .
