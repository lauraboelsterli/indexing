    "text": "NEW YORK, March 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Walden Macht & Haran LLP ( www.wmhlaw.com ), a leading law firm for white collar defense, commercial litigation, and government investigations, today announced that Georgia K. Winston has joined the firm as a partner. A former partner in the award-winning litigation practice group of a preeminent global law firm, Winston will deepen Walden Macht & Haran's white collar and commercial litigation bench.\nOver her years in private practice, Winston has gained extensive experience representing corporate and individual clients in sophisticated white collar matters and investigations. She represents clients in contract, fraud, and business tort cases in state and federal courts, as well as in internal investigations and regulatory matters. She also has significant experience in matters involving New York City operations, including challenges to agency determinations and other government action. Her recent experience includes representing a national financial services company in connection with a multi-state attorneys general investigation into allegedly unfair business practices and in related civil litigation, representing a national retailer in a series of tax-related litigations across the country, and representing a financing company in a suit alleging fraud, conspiracy, and breach of contract and conducting an internal investigation in connection with those claims.\n\"Georgia has honed her skills as a litigator on several high-stakes matters,\" remarked WMH partner Jim Walden. \"She is a skilled advocate who has a distinct ability to simplify complex legal issues. Not only will she deepen our white collar defense and commercial litigation bench; she will also be a leader at our firm.\"\nNew WMH partner Winston said: \"I am thrilled to join Walden Macht & Haran and look forward to working with an expanding group of talented attorneys focused on delivering the very best service and advocacy to its clients. Since it was founded in 2015, the firm has gathered superlative legal talent and developed a roster of marquee clients and high-profile matters; I am very excited to be a part of its future.\"\nWinston began her career as a law clerk to the Honorable Raymond A. Jackson in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and also served in the Staff Attorneys' Office of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. She received her J.D. in 1999 from New York University School of Law, where she served as Executive Editor of the Review of Law and Social Change. She earned her undergraduate degree in 1993 from Wesleyan University, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She is currently a member of the Federal Bar Council's American Inn of Court.\nAbout Walden Macht & Haran LLP\nWalden Macht & Haran LLP ( www.wmhlaw.com ) is a New York-based law firm challenging the notion that only the largest firms can handle bet-the-company matters.
