    "text": "TORONTO and TAMPA, FL, March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Cott Corporation (\"Cott\") (NYSE:COT; TSX:BCB) today announced the completion of the cash tender offer by its wholly owned subsidiary, CR Merger Sub, Inc. (\"Purchaser\"), for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Crystal Rock Holdings, Inc. (NYSE MTK:CRVP) (\"Crystal Rock\") at an offer price of $0.97 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest but subject to any required withholding taxes. Crystal Rock is a 100 year old direct-to-consumer home and office water, coffee, filtration and office supply service delivery business serving customers throughout New York and New England.\nThe depositary and paying agent for the tender offer has advised that, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 20, 2018, the expiration of the tender offer, 16,055,804 shares of common stock of Crystal Rock were tendered pursuant to the tender offer, representing approximately 75.17% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Crystal Rock on a fully-diluted basis (as determined pursuant to the merger agreement). In addition, the depositary has received commitments to tender approximately 82,636 shares of common stock of Crystal Rock in accordance with guaranteed delivery procedures, which, when combined with the shares tendered and not properly withdrawn from the tender offer, equal approximately 75.56% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Crystal Rock on a fully-diluted basis. The condition to the tender offer that at least one share more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of Crystal Rock (calculated on a fully-diluted basis (as determined pursuant to the merger agreement)) be validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and all other conditions to the tender offer have been satisfied. Accordingly, Purchaser has accepted for payment and will promptly pay the depositary for all validly tendered shares.\nCott expects to complete the acquisition of Crystal Rock as promptly as practicable on March 23, 2018 through a merger under Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \"DGCL\"). All remaining shares of Crystal Rock common stock not tendered pursuant to the tender offer (other than shares of Crystal Rock common stock (a) held in the treasury of Crystal Rock or owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Crystal Rock, (b) owned by Purchaser, Cott or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cott, and (c) in respect of which appraisal rights are perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) will be canceled in the merger and converted into the right to receive $0.97 per share in cash, without interest but subject to any required withholding taxes, which is the same price that was paid in the tender offer. Following completion of the merger, shares of Crystal Rock common stock will no longer be listed on the NYSE MKT. Financial expectations and modelling information regarding the transaction will be provided in Cott's first quarter 2018 earnings release and conference call.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR INVESTORS\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell securities.
