    "text": "ADVANCED TWO PROGRAMS INTO PIVOTAL TRIALS IN 2017\nCARDINAL PHASE 2 RETAINED BENEFIT DATA EXPECTED 3Q18\nDATA FROM FIRST PHOENIX COHORT EXPECTED 2H18\nIRVING, Texas, March 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:RETA) (Reata or Company), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, and provided an update on the Company's business and product development programs.\n“In 2017, Reata made significant strides towards our goal of building a deep pipeline of late-stage therapeutics for rare and life-threatening diseases,” said Warren Huff, Chief Executive Officer. “We entered 2017 with one pivotal trial in pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease and a broad portfolio of exploratory Phase 2 studies from which we produced meaningful clinical data and launched pivotal trials in two additional rare diseases, Alport syndrome and Friedreich’s ataxia. We begin 2018 with these three pivotal programs in the clinic and a highly focused Phase 2 program in four rare forms of CKD underway.”\nPipeline Highlights\nIn 2017, we launched and completed the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 2/3 CARDINAL study for bardoxolone methyl in patients with CKD caused by Alport syndrome. In the Phase 2 clinical trial, bardoxolone methyl demonstrated a statistically significant, mean increase from baseline in kidney function, as assessed by eGFR, at the 12 week endpoint. On the basis of the Phase 2 results, we initiated the Phase 3 portion of the CARDINAL trial, which will enroll approximately 150 patients with Alport syndrome. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided guidance that one year data from the ongoing Phase 3 portion of the trial demonstrating an improvement in retained eGFR, which is the increase in eGFR versus placebo after the patients have been taken off drug for four weeks, may support accelerated approval for bardoxolone methyl.\nWe began the Phase 2 PHOENIX study in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, IgA nephropathy, type 1 diabetic CKD, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Each cohort will enroll approximately 25 patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl treatment for each rare form of CKD. Enrollment has begun in the trial for each of the four rare forms of CKD.\nWe reported positive proof-of-concept data in the MOXIe trial of omaveloxolone in Friedreich’s ataxia, and we began the registrational portion of MOXIe in 2017. Omaveloxolone demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in modified Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) scores of 3.8 points (p=0.0001) at the optimal dose level versus baseline, and a placebo-corrected improvement in mFARS scores of 2.3 points (p=0.06) in Part 1 of the MOXIe trial. The FDA has confirmed that mFARS is acceptable as the primary endpoint for part 2 of MOXIe and that it may consider either accelerated or full approval based upon the overall results of the trial and strength of the data.\nAnticipated Clinical Milestones in 2018 and 2019\nOne year retained eGFR benefit data for CARDINAL Phase 2 patients in the third quarter of 2018 12 week eGFR data from one or more cohorts of PHOENIX in the second half of 2018 CATALYST Phase 3 data in the second half of 2018, pending a sample size re-calculation in the second quarter of 2018 that could change expected timing CARDINAL Phase 3 data in the second half of 2019 Data from the registrational part 2 of MOXIe in the second half of 2019\nFourth Quarter Results\nThe Company incurred operating expenses of $26.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, with research and development accounting for $20.4 million. This compares to operating expenses of $16.7 million for the same period of the year prior, when research and development accounted for $11.8 million. A net loss of $16.7 million was reported by the Company for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, equating to a loss of $0.64 per share, compared to net loss of $4.1 million or $0.19 per share in the same period of the year prior.\n2017 Financial Results\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $129.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, in combination with available debt and an expected milestone from Kyowa Hakko Kirin, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements, assuming the CATALYST sample size re-calculation does not result in a sample size at the high end of the range, through registrational data from CATALYST in 2018, and both CARDINAL and MOXIe in the second half of 2019.\nThe Company incurred operating expenses of $95.0 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, with research and development accounting for $71.3 million. This compares to operating expenses of $56.7 million for the same period of the year prior, when research and development accounted for $39.5 million. The 67% increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an 81% research and development expense increase consisting of $23.9 million in expanded clinical and manufacturing activities, primarily for CARDINAL, CATALYST, MOXIe, the extension trial for CATALYST and LARIAT and PHOENIX as well as increased costs in other clinical and preclinical programs. A net loss of $47.7 million was reported by the Company for the 12 month period ended December 31, 2017, equating to a loss of $1.99 per share, compared to net loss of $6.2 million or $0.31 per share in the year prior. The increased net loss was primarily due to the increased operating expenses and a decrease in the amount of deferred revenue recognized in 2017.\nAbout Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nReata is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops novel therapeutics for patients with serious or life-threatening diseases by targeting molecular pathways involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism and inflammation.
