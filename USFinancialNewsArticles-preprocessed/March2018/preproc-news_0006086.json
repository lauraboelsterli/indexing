Official data published this month showed retail sales barely rose in January.\nThe Bank of England expects the consumer squeeze to ease in 2018 as inflation cools and wage growth ticks higher, although surveys published on Wednesday suggest sentiment remains subdued.\nTravis Perkins, whose roots trace back to Georgian times, when its forerunner set up shop in 1797, made adjusted operating profit of 380 million pounds ($528 million) in 2017 - below analysts’ consensus forecast of 384.8 million pounds and the 409 million pounds made in 2016.\nThe decline reflected higher operating costs in the general merchanting and consumer divisions and lower profits in plumbing and heating.\nPrior to Wednesday’s update analysts’ average forecast for 2018 adjusted operating profit was 395.3 million pounds.\nRevenue in 2017 was up 3.5 percent to 6.43 billion pounds and the dividend was increased 2.2 percent to 46 pence a share.\nShares in Travis Perkins, down 8 percent so far this year, were 128.5 pence lower at 1,306.5 pence at 0910 GMT, valuing the business at about 3.4 billion pounds.\n$1 = 0.7192 pounds Reporting by James Davey Editing by Kate Holton and Mark Potter\n ",
