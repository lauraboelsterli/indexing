    "text": "TORONTO, March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scythian Biosciences Corp. (the \" Company \" or “ Scythian ”) (TSXV:SCYB) (Frankfurt:9SB) (OTC Pink:SCCYF) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a non-binding letter of intent dated March 11, 2018 (the “ Letter of Intent ”) with MMJ International Investments Inc. (“ MMJ ”) to acquire MMJ, a company pursuing medical cannabis opportunities in South America (the “ Proposed Acquisition ”). MMJ is the owner of an Argentina-based corporation, ABP S.A. (“ ABP ”). ABP is a pharmaceutical import and distribution company, which is licensed to import, sell and distribute medical products and derivatives in Argentina.\n“Scythian is expanding its reach into Argentina under the auspices of one of the nation’s leading importers and distributors of pharmaceuticals,” said Vic Neufeld, a director of Scythian and current CEO of global cannabis leader Aphria Inc. (“ Aphria ”). “This is an exciting opportunity for Scythian as it continues to evaluate a number of other strategic initiatives intended to grow the Company’s business.”\nThe Proposed Acquisition complements Scythian’s existing cannabinoid-based drug development program and aligns with the Company’s long-term strategy to enhance the medical applications of cannabis. It will give Scythian access to Argentina’s network of hospitals, doctors, retail pharmacies, private health providers and public health system and will advance the Company’s objective to provide patients with access to safe, pharmaceutical-grade medical cannabis.\nScythian also announces that Gary Leong, Aphria’s Chief Science Officer, will provide scientific consulting services for the Company’s ongoing international research projects, focusing on countries that are advancing in-country cannabis research with an objective of commercializing medical cannabis.\nThe Letter of Intent provides that Scythian and MMJ will negotiate and enter into a binding definitive agreement relating to the Proposed Acquisition on or before March 31, 2018 (the “ Definitive Agreement ”).\nThe Proposed Acquisition is subject to regulatory approval by the TSX Venture Exchange (“ TSXV ”).\nAbout Scythian Biosciences Corp.\nScythian is a research and development company committed to finding a solution for the prevention and treatment of concussions and traumatic brain injury with its proprietary Cannabinoid combination.\nScythian’s mission is to be the first accepted drug regimen for concussive treatment. Scythian has recently formed a collaboration with the University of Miami and its world renowned neuroscientific team to conduct pre-clinical and clinical trials of its drug regimen. The University of Miami believes that Scythian’s scientific approach shows significant promise and differs from previous approaches to treat this growing problem.
