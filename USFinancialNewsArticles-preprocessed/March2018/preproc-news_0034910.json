    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif., March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Matheson Trucking, Inc. has appointed Tamrya Ford as its Chief Financial Officer, and Mark Olszewski as Director of Postal Operations of this diversified nationwide transportation carrier that has served the U.S. Postal Service since 1964.\n\"Tammy has worked with Fortune 100 clients as well as startups as a CFO, Vice President, Controller and in other financial capacities for over 20 years,\" said CEO Mark Matheson. \"Her experience in M&A negotiations, forecasting, P&L business analysis, cost control and database management is exceptional. Tammy's high tech background, knowledge of computer technology, modern software tools and systems is an asset to our business.\"\nFord came to Matheson after serving as CFO of Technical Sales International, Inc., where she established worldwide controls and reporting procedures for quicker results and visibility. In addition to her CFO responsibilities, she increased resell division revenues by 10% and profit margins by 2% after taking over operations of this division as CEO.\nPrior to that, she was Controller at Lumens Light+Living where she provided financial leadership to the company's ownership of a start-up $15M e-commerce retailer, realizing over 25% annual growth, while also reducing inventory losses by 13%.\nAs Finance Director with TYSY Acquiring Solutions, Ford handled budgets and variances analyses for this $17M terminal distribution division of a $1.6B publicly traded credit card issuance and processing company. While there, she was instrumental in collecting over $400K in past due receivables and reducing inventory levels to less than 60% of historical levels.\nFord held two positions with Computer Associates of California (formerly Sterling Software), first as a Financial Analyst and later as Vice President, Finance and Administration where she managed a $240M budget and staff of 140, as well as seven other company departments in the West Region for this $3B software development industry leader. During her tenure, she cut approval times for capturing new business contracts by 50%, and helped grow revenue by $4M.\n\"I see my role as helping to upgrade, improve and streamline accounting systems while focusing on efficient reporting processes so management can have consistent and timely data for decision making,\" Ford said.\nExternally, she places emphasis on building relationships with financial institutions and local community groups. Within Matheson, Ford is an advocate for a customer service approach when working with other departments.\n\"Mark Olszewski has also worked with a number of global market leaders as a C-suite executive specializing in supply chain management, operations, logistics and distribution. He has a strong track record for implementing process improvements, rapid turnarounds and lean strategies,\" according to Charles Mellor, COO and general counsel with Matheson.\nBefore joining Matheson, Olszewski was president of Shadows Consulting, LLC, the firm he founded focused on change management strategies designed to improve bottom line performance by creating environments that allow processes for business transformation.\nPreviously he was president of New Century Transportation, a $250 million portfolio company of private equity investment firm Jefferies Capital Partners, where he optimized sales and marketing functions, while reducing the cost of sales by 18% and creating 12% more revenue through new sales channels.\nWhile with Yellow Roadway Corporation, a holding company started through the merger of Roadway Express and Yellow Freight, Olszewski was vice president of operations instituting innovative transportation, logistics and distribution solutions. During this assignment, he designed and implemented a complete lean production platform for transferring LTL (Less Than Truckload) freight -- enhancing productivity by 15%.\nAs vice president-operations for the Western Division of Roadway Express, he was responsible for $1 billion in gross sales, while leading operations in 13 Western states involving 9,000 employees at 110 facilities. He enhanced on-time service by 2% after reengineering area delivery processes, while increasing sales and operations retention by 18%.\n\"My responsibility involves establishing processes and procedures for Matheson's Postal Operations Division that includes seven major U.S. terminals and hundreds of employees,\" Olszewski said. \"Matheson's Control Center (MCC) is the hub of this business unit monitoring every trip, stop and driver activity each minute of the day. My goal is to optimize on-time performance and take Postal Operations to a new level of excellence.\"\nAbout Matheson Trucking, Inc.\nMatheson ( www.mathesoninc.com ) is a privately-held, family owned and operated company with headquarters in Sacramento, California.
