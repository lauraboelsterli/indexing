    "text": "Xi Jinping is re-elected as China's president China's parliament on Saturday unanimously re-elected Xi Jinping as the country's president. On Sunday parliament voted to amend the constitution to remove presidential term limits, meaning Xi can stay indefinitely. Former top graft-buster Wang Qishan, a key ally of President Xi Jinping, was also chosen as vice president. Published 14 Hours Ago Reuters Lintao Zhang | Pool | Getty Images Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks at the Great Hall of the People on October 25, 2017 in Beijing, China. \nChina's largely rubber-stamp parliament on Saturday unanimously re-elected Xi Jinping as the country's president. \nThe vote was witnessed by journalists inside central Beijing's Great Hall of the People. \nThe legislature is packed with delegates loyal to the ruling Communist Party meaning Xi's re-election was never in doubt. On Sunday parliament voted to amend the constitution to remove presidential term limits, meaning Xi can stay indefinitely. \nFormer top graft-buster Wang Qishan, a key ally of President Xi Jinping, was also chosen as vice president on Saturday, a widely-expected move that nonetheless breaks with convention and underlines Xi's dominant authority. \nWang bowed twice and then walked over to Xi to shake his hand after the vote was announced inside Beijing's Great Hall of the People. Only one person voted against Wang out of the 2,970 votes cast. \nKnown as \"the firefighter\" for his central role in tackling issues like corruption and domestic financial problems over the years, Wang also has experience dealing with the United States in his former role as a vice premier who led annual economic talks with Washington. \nHe was a major player in Xi's battle against corruption, with dozens of senior officials jailed during his tenure as the top graft-fighter, including the fearsome domestic security chief Zhou Yongkang, now serving life in jail. \nWang's appointment has the potential to reshape what has traditionally been a ceremonial role. \nChina's relationship with the United States is likely to be a key part of his remit, according to diplomats and sources with ties to the leadership.",
