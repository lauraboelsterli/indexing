    "text": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Decentralized IT security marketplace PolySwarm ( www.polyswarm.io ) today announced the addition of Dinesh Dhamija to its advisory board. Dhamija is the Deputy Treasurer of the United Kingdom’s Liberal Democratic party, and is the founder and former CEO and Chairman of ebookers.com , one of Europe’s most successful online travel companies. He was named ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ by Management Today magazine in 2003.\n“As an entrepreneur dating back to the early days of the internet, I can see that blockchain technology has the same disruptive potential,” said Dinesh Dhamija. “PolySwarm is leading the way when it comes to blockchain’s real world use cases, and I am happy to support their growth.”\nEducated at the University of Cambridge and Harvard Business School, Dhamija worked at IBM before going on to launch ebookers.com . He is a trustee of TiE, an entrepreneur organization, and a member of the fundraising committee at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. Dhamija is also a philanthropist, having founded charities to provide education and access to medicine.\nToday’s antivirus and IT security market is dominated by single vendor offerings that often miss emerging threats. PolySwarm incentivizes a global community of information security experts to disrupt the $8.5 billion cyber threat intelligence industry, providing enterprises and consumers with unprecedented speed and accuracy in threat detection. By introducing a platform that encourages innovation and competition, the market will reward experts who are best able to protect users.\nPolySwarm’s founders built the company out of Narf Industries, LLC, an information security firm that recently completed a blockchain-based identity management project for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as cutting-edge information security projects for DARPA and other government agencies. PolySwarm’s advisory board includes former McAfee CIO Mark Tonnesen, alongside renowned information security experts Dan Guido, Chris Eagle, Dr. Sergey Bratus, and Carl Hoffman.\nThe PolySwarm market runs on Nectar (“NCT”), an ERC20-compatible utility token that makes it easy to submit and classify potential threats on the PolySwarm market. Nectar replaces traditional, outdated antivirus and threat-scanning subscription payments. The Nectar token sale is currently in progress.\nABOUT POLYSWARM\nPolySwarm is the first decentralized marketplace allowing security experts to build anti-malware engines that compete to protect you.
