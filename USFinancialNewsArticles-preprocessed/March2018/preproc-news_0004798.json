    "text": "1 COMMENTS New York Republican leaders Friday rallied around a young, suburban county executive, Marcus Molinaro, as their pick to take on Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the fall, touting his bipartisan appeal.\nThe only problem is Mr. Molinaro—who at 18 was the mayor of a small upstate hamlet—hasn’t declared a run for governor.\nThe endorsements Friday came at a party convention of New York Republican county chairpersons and other party leaders in Saratoga Springs. For weeks, several have been pushing Mr. Molinaro to jump in.\n“He has a better path to victory than any other individual in this race,” said Suffolk County GOP chairman John Jay LaValle, an influential figure in the New York GOP. He said he expects Mr. Molinaro will run and has his support. “He is truly a bipartisan guy.”\nThe 42-year-old Dutchess County executive chairman hasn’t entered the race and has been coy about his plans. “Marc is deeply grateful and humbled by the support,” his spokesman said Friday. “There will be no formal announcement today.”\nParty leaders say Mr. Molinaro has indicated that he plans to run.\nMr. Molinaro’s entree into the race would be a blow to state Sen. John DeFrancisco, the 71-year-old Syracuse Republican who has been building support for the nomination . Some Republicans have questioned if the upstate legislator can be a fresh face for the party after serving in Albany for more than two decades .\n“Sen. DeFrancisco is running full steam ahead,” his spokesman said Friday. “We were happy to be at the event in Saratoga, but it has no bearing on the race. Our job is to keep taking the fight to Andrew Cuomo.”\nThe GOP primary is in September, but Republicans are hoping to avoid a race and decide on a candidate at their nominating convention later this year.\nRelated Can Cuomo’s New Pup Curb His Alpha-Dog Image? (Feb. 14) Candidate for Governor Gathers GOP Support to Take on Cuomo (Feb. 11) GOP Latches Onto Corruption Trial to Take Aim at Cuomo in Election Year (Feb. 8) Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, is running for a third term . The front-runner in the race, he has a $30 million campaign account . Democrats hold a roughly two-to-one registration advantage in New York, and the Cuomo campaign has sought to tie the GOP candidates to Republican President Donald Trump.\n“I’m not surprised to hear they are exploring other alternatives,” to Mr. DeFrancisco, a Cuomo campaign spokesman said. “Unfortunately for them, Molinaro is more of the same.”\nMr. Molinaro’s appeal to Republicans is partially his past as a political wunderkind and his careful stance on Mr. Trump, who is popular among New York GOP primary voters but unpopular statewide.\nMr. Molinaro became the mayor of Tivoli at age 18, before serving in the state Assembly. He has served since 2011 as the Republican executive of Dutchess County, an area with a slight Democratic registration advantage.\nWhile he hasn’t been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, his spokesman said Mr. Molinaro wrote in Chris Gibson, a former Republican New York congressman, for president in the 2016 election instead of backing the GOP nominee.\nMore recently, Mr. Molinaro has been turning to social media to criticize the Cuomo administration but also call for more civility in politics, tweeting the hashtag #PurposeOverPolitics.",
