    "text": "TORONTO, March 28 (Reuters) - Ontario said on Wednesday it would boost spending on healthcare and child care in a pre-election budget that sees the Canadian province make a swift return to running deficits and projects a long road back to balance.\nThe Liberal party government of Canadaâ€™s most populous province said it would run a C$6.7 billion ($5.2 billion) deficit in the fiscal year 2018-19.\nIt forecast further deficits of C$6.6 billion and C$6.5 billion respectively in the two subsequent years and a return to balance in 2024-25.\nThe projections include a C$700 million reserve each year, meaning the province could run smaller deficits if not used.
