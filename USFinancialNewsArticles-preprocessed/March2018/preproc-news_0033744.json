REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo “The proposal we have made to the trustees of up to 1 billion pounds of contributions under our ownership is a clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders,” Melrose said in a statement on Monday.
