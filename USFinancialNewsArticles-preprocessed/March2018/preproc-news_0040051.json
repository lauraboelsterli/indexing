    "text": "  8:56 a.m. ET Share \nSome top managers have bristled at reporting to younger executives Getty Images This week, executives invited top suppliers to Whole Foods’ Austin headquarters to discuss their frustration with operational changes, including fee increases that predate the merger. Some suppliers said the additional cost could force them to raise prices or defect to other retailers. \nBy Heather Haddon Laura Stevens \nAn executive exodus is under way at Whole Foods, as Amazon.com Inc. integrates the pioneering natural grocer into its retail empire. \nMore than a dozen executives and senior managers have left since Amazon AMZN, -0.29% acquired Whole Foods last year, according to former employees and recruiters steering them to new jobs. People who have left include leaders of the bakery, produce, sustainability and local-foods divisions. \nSome veterans have left even though higher-ups asked them to stay. Others say they were pushed out after the deal was announced but before it closed, as Whole Foods sought to tighten command. ‘Culturally it’s been a rough start.’ Procurement veteran who left Whole Foods earlier this year after nearly a decade \nExecutives from Amazon and Whole Foods said that the two companies share a customer focus, are fitting together well and have made great strides in the merger in a short time. But the exodus has raised concerns among employees and suppliers that the distinctive approach that made Whole Foods a natural and organic powerhouse won’t endure under Amazon’s ownership. \nWhole Foods chief executive and co-founder John Mackey and Steve Kessel, an Amazon senior vice president who oversees the grocer, said in separate statements that Whole Foods has thrived in the seven months since the e-commerce giant bought it for roughly $13.5 billion.",
