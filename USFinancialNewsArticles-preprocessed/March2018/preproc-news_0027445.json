    "text": "March 14, 2018 / 9:07 PM / in 27 minutes U.S. Senate moves toward passing bill easing bank rules   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to limit debate on a bill that would ease bank rules for the first time since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, setting the stage for its final passage later this week. Senators approved the bill, which would limit the strictest rules to just a handful of the nationâ€™s largest banks while easing several rules for smaller lenders, by a vote of 67 to 31. The bill now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives, which must pass it before it can signed into law. Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Sandra Maler",
