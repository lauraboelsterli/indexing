    "text": "CHICAGO, March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Financial Poise™ is pleased to congratulate several of its Faculty Members on the recent publication of the 2018 Edition of Strategic Alternatives For And Against Distressed Businesses.\nStrategic Alternatives, one of Thomson Reuters' best selling titles, is the definitive guide for restructuring and insolvency professionals when comparing assignments for the benefit of creditors, receiverships, bankruptcy, and other options to deal with financially distressed companies.\nWhen the first edition was published in 2008, James H.M. Sprayregen described Strategic Alternatives to be \"as timely as it is comprehensive\" and American Bankruptcy Executive Director Sam Gerdano lauded it as \"featuring contributions from some of the top professionals in the restructuring world.\"\nStrategic Alternatives was the brainchild of Jonathan Friedland, a partner with (and executive committee member of) Sugar Felsenthal Grais & Helsinger and the founder of Financial Poise. Friedland continues to serve as the principal author and editor-in-chief of the 1,500+ page book, which now has dozens of contributors including senior partners at such firms as Adams & Reese, Ballard Spahr, Day Pitney, Dentons, Crowe Horwath, Deloitte, Development Specialists, Inc., Husch Blackwell, Latham & Watkins, Lewis Roc, McGuireWoods, Pepper Hamilton, Thompson & Knight, Skadden, Venable, and Snell & Wilmer. Friedland also serves as the principal author and editor-in-chief of Commercial Bankruptcy Litigation, another top seller published by Thomson/Reuters.\nFor more information on the text, please visit Thomson's website here.\nAbout Financial Poise™\nFinancial Poise™ has one mission: to provide reliable plain English business, financial and legal education to investors, private business owners and executives, and their respective trusted advisors.
