    "text": "12 COMMENTS U.S. stocks were set to open higher and European shares pared losses Wednesday, following steep falls in technology stocks that rattled investors around the world on fears of increased regulatory oversight.\nTech companies, including Tencent Holdings and Samsung Electronics, fell in Asia and Europe and some analysts have been downgrading a sector they often believed was overvalued after a long period of gains.\nFutures pointed to an opening gain of 0.3% for the S&P 500 while the tech-heavy the Nasdaq Composite was set to open broadly flat.\nIn Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 was recently down 0.3%, after falling by more than 1% in earlier trade. In Asia, tech shares led markets from Tokyo to Seoul lower.\nTech stocks, until recently the darlings of many investors, have been selling off in recent days, dragging the broader market down. Investors have worried about the potential ramifications of new, costly regulations on tech giants such as Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc.\n“Regulatory risk is increasing and that is pressuring the tech giants ,” said James Athey, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “And that leads to jittery markets overall.”\nSome analysts were already worried the sector looked expensive, even without the concerns of increased regulation.\nUniCredit told its clients Wednesday that tech shares suffered from stretched valuations.\n“We see this [selloff] continuing, either with U.S. tech stocks underperforming a rising equity market or weakening materially if risk aversion remains high,” the bank said in a research note.\nJ.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management has reduced its “significant overweight” position in tech stocks and shifted into financials, said Ayaz Ebrahim, portfolio manager for emerging markets in Asia-Pacific.\nWith riskier investment falling, some investors put money into bonds. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 2.761% from 2.790%, reaching levels last seen in early February. Yields on the 10-year German bund fell to 0.493%. Yields move inversely to prices.\nThe tech sector’s woes have further unnerved investors at a time of increase volatility in markets.\nStocks hit record highs in late January, but have since been dragged down by concerns over rising inflation, the prospect of tightening monetary policy by major central banks and the possibility of a global trade war. The S&P 500 is down 9.1% from its January high. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 has fallen by around 9%, while the Nikkei is down more than 12% from its highs.\nThe declines in tech stocks deepened a selloff in a sector that was until recently a darling of many investors.

Meanwhile, a survey showed that consumer sentiment in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, was set to rise in April.\n“We’re still pretty bullish on the economic front and earnings are solid enough to justify equity prices being supported going forward,” Mr. Athey said. “I worry about markets more than I worry about the economy.”\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, was up 0.2%.\nIn Asia, Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average finished down 1.3%, erasing much of Tuesday’s 2.7% gain, while the tech-heavy South Korean benchmark was down 1.3%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell by 2.5%.\nIn commodities markets, Brent oil futures fell 0.4% to near session lows, following industry data indicating a rise in U.S. inventories. Gold was down 0.4%.\n—Gregor Stuart Hunter contributed to this article.\nWrite to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com",
