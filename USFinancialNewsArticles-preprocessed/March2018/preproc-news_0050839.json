    "text": "MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Italian state lender CDP is willing to sit down with a potential buyer of loss-making airline Alitalia to discuss a possible financial partnership, but only within the company’s limits, CDP Chairman Claudio Costamagna said on Wednesday.\nGermany’s Lufthansa, British low-cost carrier easyJet and U.S. private equity fund Cerberus are among parties that have expressed interest in Alitalia, which was put under special administration last year after staff rejected a plan to cut jobs and salaries.\nSeparately, CDP’s CEO Fabio Gallia said the state lender was ready, if necessary, to take a stake in Italian steel plant Ilva, which is the target of a 1.8 billion euro bid by the world’s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal.\nReporting by Paola Arosio and Luca Trogni, writing by Agnieszka Flak, editing by Valentina Za\n ",
