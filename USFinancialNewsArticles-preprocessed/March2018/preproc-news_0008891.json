The dish, a riff on surf and turf, has a hefty $1,000 price tag.\nKim Kardashian West's best friend, Jonathan Cheban — aka, food influencer Foodgōd — tried out America's most expensive surf and turf for an upcoming episode of CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich .\"\nGetty Images | Dimitrios Kambouris Kim Kardashian West and Jonathan Cheban in Miami in 2014. For the starter, Executive Chef Jesus Nunez pairs raw waygu beef tartare with tuna tartare, and tops the plate with foie gras, edible gold, white truffles and Osetra caviar.\nSource: CNBC $1,000 surf and turf appetizer The truffles alone cost $3,800 a pound, and the caviar is $100 per ounce. \nSource: CNBC Jonathan Cheban (right) and a friend eat a $1,000 appetizer \"There are a lot of big, over-the-top price tag things in here,\" Cheban, who eats the most expensive food he can find and shares it on Instagram, says of the dish on \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich .\"\n\"This is decadence at the highest level.\"\nSource: CNBC Indeed, the cost of the dish is almost equivalent to the median rent for a one bedroom apartment in Chicago . \nWhile Cheban pronounced the meal, \"amazing,\" one element he wasn't impressed with was the edible gold. \"There's no flavor, it just makes it sound more exciting,\" he says.\nDuring the taste test, Cheban was wearing a $100,000 necklace that reads, \"Foodgōd,\" encrusted with over 30 carats of diamonds.\nSource: CNBC But for Cheban, food takes the top spot as his greatest indulgence.\n\"People like to spend money on food,\" he says. \"They see these amazing pictures on Instagram, and they really want to try these over-the-top, decadent foods.
