Advanced Energy segment sales, nearly all of which are from sales of J-Plasma products, increased approximately $2.1 million, or 218.6% year-over-year, to $3.1 million, compared to approximately $1.0 million last year. Core segment sales increased approximately $0.1 million, or 1.9% year-over-year, to $7.7 million, compared to approximately $7.5 million last year.

The largest product line contributor to total revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 was a 35.8% increase in sales of electrosurgical products, driven primarily by Advanced Energy sales.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nIncrease/Decrease Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nIncrease/Decrease (In thousands) 2017 2016 $\nChange\n%\nChange\n2017 2016 $\nChange\n%\nChange\nDomestic $ 9,469 $ 8,948 $ 521 5.8 % $ 33,147 $ 32,050 $ 1,097 3.4 % International 1,879 546 1,333 244.1 % 5,736 4,577 1,159 25.3 % Total $ 11,348 $ 9,494 $ 1,854 19.5 % $ 38,883 $ 36,627 $ 2,256 6.2 % Revenue in the United States increased $0.5 million, or 5.8% year-over-year, to $9.5 million, and international revenue increased approximately $1.3 million, or 244.1% year-over-year, to $1.9 million. Our international sales growth in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by strong demand from distributors in our Core business, fueled in part by additional registrations in international countries that were obtained during the course of 2017. We also saw strong international sales during the quarter in our Advanced Energy business.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $1.1 million, or 22.1% year-over-year, to $5.9 million, compared to $4.8 million for fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin increased approximately 110 basis points year-over-year to 52.0% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 50.9% last year. The increase in gross margins was primarily due to higher margins in the Advanced Energy segment, driven by higher volume and pricing mix on generator sales.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased approximately $1.1 million, or 18.9% year-over-year, to $7.0 million, compared to $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in operating expenses was driven by $1.5 million of non-recurring severance and related expense due to the departures of former members of our executive team and the related closure of the corporate office in Purchase, New York. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased $1.2 million driven by selling, general and administrative expenses, which were partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in salaries and related costs.\nLoss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.1 million, compared to a loss from operations of $1.0 million for the comparable period last year.\nNet loss attributed to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and equivalents of $10.7 million as compared to $15.2 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company had working capital of $16.6 million as of December 31, 2017 as compared to $21.3 million as of December 31, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Results :\nTotal revenue for the full year 2017 increased $2.3 million, or 6.2%, to $38.9 million, compared to $36.6 million in 2016. Total revenue growth was driven by an 118.7% increase in Advance Energy sales and a 3.0% increase in Core sales, and was partially offset by a 51.2% decrease in OEM sales.\nGross profit for 2017 increased $1.8 million, or 10.3% year-over-year, to $19.8 million, compared to $17.9 million for 2016. Gross margin for 2017 increased approximately 190 basis points year-over-year to 50.8%, compared to 48.9% last year. The increase in gross margin was driven by higher margins in the Company’s Advanced Energy and Core segments. The overall increase in margins was partially offset by reduced revenue and orders of lower margin product in the Company’s OEM segment.\nOperating expenses for 2017 increased $3.3 million, or 15.3% year-over-year, to $25.0 million, compared to $21.7 million for 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a $2.8 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses over the prior year.\nLoss from operations for 2017 was $5.3 million, compared to a loss from operations of $3.8 million for 2016.\nNet loss attributed to common shareholders for 2017 was $5.1 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $4.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for 2016.\n2018 Outlook :\nThe Company expects total revenue in the range of $41.0 million to $42.5 million, representing growth of 5% to 9% year-over-year. The Company expects total revenue growth to be driven by Advanced Energy sales growth in the range of approximately 40% to 45% year-over-year. The Company expects adjusted EBITDA in a range of $1.0 million to $1.5 million.\nConference Call Details :\nManagement will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on March 12, 2018 to discuss the results of the quarter and to host a question and answer session.
