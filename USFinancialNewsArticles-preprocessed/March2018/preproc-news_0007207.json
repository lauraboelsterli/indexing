It said it expected growth in all its markets in 2018, keeping its investment spending at 700 million euros to 750 million euros ($854 mln to $915 mln) this year.\nFourth quarter net profit totalled 100 million euros while sales rose to 4.35 billion euros.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 7.6 percent to 253 million euros, also coming in below the market consensus. Analysts in a Reuters survey had forecast, on average, a net profit of 125 million euros and EBITDA of 266 million.\nThe pace of store openings in Colombia, a market the retailer entered four years ago, more than doubled from the previous year, putting higher than expected pressure on earnings, it said.\nFor all of last year, net profit fell 35 percent due to a one-off gain in 2016 from the sale of its industrial unit Monterroio, but excluding one-offs Jeronimo Martins said its net profit rose 7 percent from a year earlier.\nThe company said that EBITDA margin - a key measure of profitability - at its Polish Biedronka chain edged higher to 7.3 percent last year from 7.2 percent in 2016, while same-store sales there increased 8.6 percent.
