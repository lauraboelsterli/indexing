But outside of that sector, growth opportunities remain, he told CNBC at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. \nOne of those areas was in the mining sector, which Tevfik said was “probably the highest-quality area” in the Australian market. Mining companies are “exceptionally” well-managed and have balance sheets verging on net cash, Tevfik said, adding that the reason for that was due to China’s relatively strong growth rate. \nChina is Australia’s largest export destination, with close to 30 percent of Australian exports sold to China in financial year 2017, according to data from the Australian Trade and Investment Commission.
