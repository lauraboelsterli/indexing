FILE PHOTO: Governor Philip R. Lane looks on at the publication of the Central Bank of Ireland's review of residential mortgage lending requirements in Dublin, Ireland November 23, 2016. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne “Obviously in the coming meetings we’ll have more information. We are getting closer to the limit of our current policy so we will be communicating more about what happens next,” Lane, who is also governor of the Irish Central Bank, told journalists in Dublin on Friday. Asked whether there had been any dissenting voices at Thursday’s governing council meeting or whether there was any indication about when the ECB would make its next significant move, Lane said the council was a “disciplined” body.
