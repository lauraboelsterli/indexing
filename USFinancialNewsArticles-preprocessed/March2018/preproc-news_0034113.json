    "text": "665 COMMENTS ROUND ROCK, Texas—A man who police believe carried out a string of package bombings in Austin is dead, putting an end to a weekslong hunt to track down and stop the bomber who left the Texas capital and its residents on edge .\nLaw enforcement officials, who identified the suspect as 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt, said they traced the white male to a hotel in this Austin suburb, about 20 miles north of the city. In a confrontation with the police, the suspect detonated a device and died, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said. Shots were fired during the encounter with police.\n“We believe that this individual is responsible for all incidents that have taken place in Austin, starting on March 2nd and those that have occurred since then as well,” Chief Manley said, referring to the wave of bombings that killed two people and wounded several more .\nOfficials said they hadn’t yet identified a motive, and they would be investigating whether any accomplices had helped the suspect. Earlier reports incorrectly said the suspect was 24 years old.\nBombings in Texas Suspected bomber\ndies in encounter\nwith police\n10 miles\n10 km\nMarch 2\nAustin\ntexas\nMarch 18\nMarch 12\nFedEx facility where\npolice believe Tuesday’s\npackages were mailed\nUnexploded bomb\nfound Tuesday\nmorning in package\na FedEx facility\nNew\nBraunfels\nTuesday’s\nexplosion\nSan\nAntonio\nSource: staff reports\nAuthorities cautioned area residents to remain vigilant in case Mr. Conditt was able to send or place any more explosives in the past day.\nFred Milanowski, the special agent in charge of Houston Field Division for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told The Wall Street Journal that investigators were able to identify the suspect in the Austin serial bomber case through basic police work.\n“There were several small pieces that all came together,” he said Wednesday morning. “It was purchases. It was some video. It was witness statements that all came together.”\nAfter the second bombing, on March 12, the ATF identified a “signature” in the explosive devices. “Forensically they were very similar,” Mr. Milanowski said. “Same explosive filler was used in all of them.” He added that all the devices that detonated appeared to be the work of a single bomb maker , with nails and screws as shrapnel.\nA home address most recently associated with Mr. Conditt, according to records, was located on a dead-end street in the historic downtown of Pflugerville, a small town on the outskirts of Austin that has been absorbed by the sprawling suburbs.\nInvestigators closed down parts of a highway after the suspect in the serial bombings detonated an explosive in his car.

Law enforcement officers—Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and ATF agents—blocked off access to the house. Roosters crowed on the edge of downtown as the sun rose.\nA couple of blocks from the home, a stream of cars drove by—early morning commuters on their way to work. Business owners were opening their stores.\nAnthony Williams, owner of the First the Blade Barber Shop, said he was surprised. Most of the people who live in the neighborhood, he said, are older residents who live here to be away from the bustle of nearby Austin. “I just wouldn’t figure it was anyone from out here,” he said, “But I guess he could come from anywhere.”\nPolice Chief Manley said authorities first identified the suspect as a person of interest about 24 hours to 36 hours ago. By late Tuesday night, he said authorities felt confident that the suspect was responsible for the bombings and tracked his vehicle to the parking lot of a hotel.\nWhile law enforcement took up positions around the hotel and waited for the arrival of tactical teams, the suspect drove away, Chief Manley said. Police followed the vehicle but it stopped in a ditch nearby.\nRelated\nHomemade Bombs Are Easy to Make, Hard to Trace As Bomber Stirred Fear, Austin Tried to Stick to Routine Different Austin Neighborhoods Were Targeted For FedEx and UPS, Policing Is a Tall Order As members of the Austin SWAT team approached, the suspect detonated a bomb inside his vehicle, knocking one of the officers back, and another officer fired at the suspect, he said. Chief Manley said the suspect died during the exchange with police and suffered significant injuries from the blast.\n“I couldn’t believe yesterday—a bomb here, a bomb there,” said Mona Henson, a Round Rock resident who works as a server at the IHOP off the portion of I-35 shut down by authorities. “I’m glad it’s over.”\nShe questioned who the bomber might be and whether she might have met him at some point. “You wonder, did I wait on him? Did I see him? Do I know this person?” she said.\nThe string of bombings started in early March and picked up pace in recent days. On Tuesday, law enforcement found two more explosive devices at FedEx Corp. facilities in Austin and outside of San Antonio .\nChief Manley said witnesses and “video sources” had helped them zero in on the suspect during the course of the investigation.\n“We became very interested in him over the last couple days,” he said.\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley, center, said the bombing suspect was killed in an encounter with police. Photo: JULIA ROBINSON FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL The investigation drew hundreds of law enforcement from federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and ATF bureau.\nThe bombings began March 2, when a package explosion went off in northeast Austin, killing a 39-year-old man. A pair of package bombs detonated 10 days later in another neighborhood, leaving a 17-year-old dead and two other people wounded. On Sunday night, two men were seriously injured by an explosion in a wealthy enclave near the city limits.\nPolice initially speculated the attacks might be racially motivated, because the two deceased victims came from prominent African-American families, while one of the wounded people is Hispanic. But Sunday’s bombing was different, rigged with a tripwire, and police say the injured victims—two white men—appear to be random.\nThe area around hotel, where the suspect had parked his vehicle, buzzed with police activity early Wednesday as law enforcement pressed ahead with their investigation. Bleary eyed guests emerged from their rooms to find the area alit with flashing lights from police cars and other emergency vehicles. Word of what had happened quickly circulated among them.\nThe bomber was dead.\n—Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article.\nWrite to Russell Gold at russell.gold@wsj.com and Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com",
