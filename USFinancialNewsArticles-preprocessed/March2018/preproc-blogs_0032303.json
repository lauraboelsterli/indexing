    "text": "Brazil sees solution for ban on BRF poultry exports to EU Published 12 Hours Ago Reuters \nSAO PAULO, March 16 (Reuters) - Brazil's Agriculture Ministry expects to resolve a temporary ban on poultry exports by food processor BRF SA to the European Union in about 30 days, the head of Brazil's food safety service, Luiz Eduardo Rangel, said on Friday. \nThe Brazilian government temporarily stopped production and certification of BRF's poultry exports to the EU on Friday. The company is being investigated due to suspicions it engaged in fraud to evade food safety checks. \n(Reporting by Gabriela Mello Writing by Marcelo Teixeira Editing by Paul Simao)",
