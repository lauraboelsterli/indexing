    "text": "The Dow , S&P 500 and Nasdaq are pacing for their worst week in 1½ months as concerns about the Trump administration's tariffs and the prospect of a trade war emerging weigh on the market.\nCraig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray, is highlighting several key levels to watch on the S&P 500 and Dow as both indexes on Thursday posted their worst days since early February. Here are his reasons why.\n• On the S&P 500, 2,700 is the key \"resistance\" level to watch, while 2,650 is the key \"support\" level to watch.\n• The 2,700 mark is just points above the S&P 500's 100-day moving average. The S&P broke below 2,650 heading into the market close, trading as low as 2,641.73. It was even lower in Friday's premarket.\n• This break suggest we could see a retest of the S&P's 200-day moving average, at 2,584, in the coming weeks.\n• Examining a chart of the Dow, the blue chips have failed to trade above its 50-day moving average in over 1½ weeks; if the index closes below its lows touched on March 2, at 24,217, then the next stop is its 200-day moving average, just below 23,500. It was at 23,840 in Friday's premarket.\nBottom line: The markets are having a volatile week, and Piper Jaffray's chief market technician is laying out key levels investors should watch in the Dow and S&P 500.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
