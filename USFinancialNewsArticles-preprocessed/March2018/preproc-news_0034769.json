Noren will lead the product management, product marketing and engineering areas. She will drive key product initiatives for the continued expansion of the CloudBees product portfolio and next-generation DevOps innovation in the cloud. Noren comes to CloudBees from Interana, where she held the position of chief product officer.\nNoren brings more than 20 years of experience in product, services and operations at successful, venture-backed companies, such as Splunk, Zuora, Portal and Sonic Solutions. Noren has a particular strength in identifying and refining product offerings in evolving markets.\n“Christina has a strong background in product management and strategy, particularly in disruptive markets. She is a powerful addition to the CloudBees executive team,” Labourey said. “We entered 2018 with strong momentum . Christina will be an integral part of our next phase of growth, helping to ensure our product roadmap maintains our market leadership and accelerates enterprise DevOps transformation.”\nNoren started her career at Sonic Solutions, then went on to Portal Software and Microsoft. At Microsoft, she was a group program manager, managing a team responsible for engineering, program management and QA for all of MSN’s datacenter tools.\nMost recently, at Splunk, Noren served as senior vice president of solutions and vice president of product management, beginning as employee #12 in 2005 and remaining on the senior leadership team through its 2012 IPO. She played a critical role in bringing Splunk’s 1.0 product to market, overseeing requirements definition, product delivery and the beta program. She went on to guide key technical innovations, including search-time knowledge and the Splunk search language. She is a co-inventor on the Splunk patent for “Machine Data Web.” Finally, she defined and championed a revolutionary pricing model that scaled from $5K ASP to $100 million+ enterprise licensing deals.\n“During my career, I have had the opportunity to drive product strategy and revenue for innovative tech companies,” said Noren. “I am eager to join CloudBees at such an exciting time in the industry, as we see the convergence of cloud, container technology and DevOps. I look forward to working with the management team to ensure product innovation and strategy that supports our continued growth and success.”\nAbout CloudBees\nCloudBees is the hub of enterprise Jenkins and DevOps, providing companies with smarter solutions for accelerating software development and the fastest path from great ideas to impactful software.
