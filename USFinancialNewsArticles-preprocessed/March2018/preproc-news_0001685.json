This excludes the value of shares issuable upon exercise of existing outstanding options. The offer price represents a 44.8% premium to UMS' closing share price on 13 February 2018 and a 48.1% and 46.2% premium to the 90 day and 180-day volume weighted average stock price on 13 February 2018, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Offer, respectively.\nThe Board of Directors of UMS has recommended that the shareholders accept the Offer. The recommendation by the Board of Directors of UMS is included in the Offer document.

In addition, Everbridge has entered into conditional purchase agreements with holders of 2,285,000 share options whereby Everbridge will purchase these options at a price equal to the difference between the Offer price and the exercise price for the share options, subject to closing of the Offer.\nThe closing of the Offer is subject to satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions set out in the Offer document, including a minimum acceptance of at least 90% of the shares on a fully diluted basis or such lower percentage (not being less than 50%) of the issued shares as Everbridge determines. The Offer is not subject to any financing conditions or regulatory approvals. Subject to satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions, settlement of the Offer is expected to take place during the first quarter of 2018.

Further, upon such acquisition, Everbridge intends to propose to the general meeting of UMS that an application is filed with the Oslo Stock Exchange to de-list the shares of UMS.\nThe Offer document, containing the complete terms and conditions of the Offer, was published today by Everbridge.
