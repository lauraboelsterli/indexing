    "text": "PHOENIX, March 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Water Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:GWRS), (TSX:GWR), a pure-play water resource management company, reported results for the year ended December 31, 2017. All annual comparisons are to the previous year unless otherwise noted.\nQ4 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenues increased 8.1% to $7.8 million from $7.2 million. The increase was driven by growth in active connections, increased consumption, and approved rate increases.\nNet income totaled $2.7 million, or $0.14 per share. As a percentage of revenues, net income was 35.1%. Adjusting net income for the impact of one-time items, net income totaled $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, as defined below, increased 42.1%, to $4.0 million. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 51.7%.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenues increased 4.7% to $31.2 million from $29.8 million. The increase was driven by growth in active connections, increased consumption, and approved rate increases. Excluding Willow Valley water revenue, revenues increased $1.7 million, or 5.8%.\nTotal active connections increased 4.3% to 38,997 at December 31, 2017, as compared to 37,387 at December 31, 2016.\nNet income totaled $4.6 million, or $0.23 per share. As a percentage of revenues, net income was 14.6%. Adjusting net income for the impact of one-time items, net income totaled $2.3 million, or $0.12 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, as defined below, increased 18.2%, to $16.4 million. As a percentage of revenues, Adjusted EBITDA was 52.5%.\nIncreased dividend by 5% over the course of the year, resulting in a current monthly dividend of $0.023625, or $0.2835 on an annualized basis.\n2017 Operational Highlights\nAcquired Eagletail Water Company, a water utility located west of the Phoenix Metropolitan area.\nInvested $20.9 million in the water and wastewater facilities improvement program.\nManagement Commentary\n“In 2017, we achieved solid year-over-year growth, which helped return a healthy bottom line,” said Global Water Resources' president and CEO, Ron Fleming. “We have substantially completed our accelerated facility improvements in the year, having made significant capital investments that will enhance the services we provide and support the growth of the communities we have the privilege to serve. We now look to deploy capital by making acquisitions in 2018 and beyond.\n“In 2018, we expect to see continued top-line and bottom-line expansion, driven by organic growth in new connections, as well as increased consumption, and pre-approved rate increases. We also see the potential for growth from our acquisition strategy, as we continue to pursue accretive acquisitions with consolidation benefits.”\n2017 Financial Summary\nRevenues\nRevenues in 2017 increased by $1.4 million, or 4.7%, to $31.2 million compared to $29.8 million in 2016. Adjusted Revenues increased $1.7 million, or 5.8%, to $31.2 million as compared to $29.5 million in 2016 (see definition and reconciliation to GAAP, below). The increase in Adjusted Revenues was primarily attributed to a 4.3% increase in active connections, increased consumption, and the approved increase in rates.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.5%, to $23.9 million in 2017 compared to $24.0 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in operations and maintenance-related party costs and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in depreciation.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTotal other expense decreased by $6.2 million, or 64.7%, to $3.4 million compared to $9.6 million in 2016. The improvement was primarily attributed to one-time expenses related to the capital raising initiatives completed in 2016, combined with a $0.3 million increase in the Valencia earn-out and a $0.2 million decrease in loss on equity method investment. The decrease in other expense was partially offset by a decrease in other income primarily related to a $1.0 million one-time gain recorded in 2016 for the early payoff of the Sonoran acquisition liability.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income increased by $7.1 million to $4.6 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to net loss of $2.5 million in 2016. The improvement was primarily attributed to one-time expenses related to the capital raising initiatives completed in 2016. In addition, operating income increased $1.5 million, and there was an increase in the Valencia earnout of $0.3 million, which were partially offset by a decrease in income tax benefit of $0.7 million. The improvement in net income was also partially offset by the $1.0 million one-time gain recorded in 2016 for the settlement of the Sonoran acquisition liability.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $2.5 million, or 18.2%, to $16.4 million, compared to $13.9 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to organic connection growth, increased consumption, higher rates, reduced contract costs, reduced deferred compensation, and increased growth premium receipts related to the Valencia condemnation. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by an increase in professional fees, U.S. public company expense, and franchise taxes. (See definition of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, and its reconciliation to GAAP, below).\nDividend Policy\nThe company declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.023625 per common share (or $0.2835 per share on an annualized basis), which will be payable on March 29, 2018 to holders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2018.\nBusiness Outlook\nGlobal Water's near-term growth strategy for its regulated water, wastewater, and recycled water business is driven by increased service connections, continued operating efficiencies, and utility rate increases approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission. The company will also focus more on its original mission of aggregating water and wastewater utilities, allowing the company and its customers to realize the benefits of consolidation, regionalization, and environmental stewardship.\nConnection Rates\nAs of December 31, 2017, active service connections increased by 1,610, or 4.3%, to 38,997, compared to 37,387 at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the vacancy rate was at 1.6% down from the peak of 11.2% in February 2009.\nArizona’s Growth Corridor: Positive Population Trends\nThe Metropolitan Phoenix area is steadily growing due to low-cost housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base, and low taxes. The area population has increased throughout 2017 and 2016, and it continues to grow. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that Phoenix Metro will have a population of 4.9 million by 2020, up 15% from 2016 census estimates, and reach 6.8 million by 2040.\nAccording to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip real estate consensus panel (\"Greater Phoenix Blue Chip\"), most sectors of real estate are expected to experience improved occupancy and growth. For Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, the Homebuilders Association of Central Arizona, reported that single family housing permits grew 12% to 19,863 units in 2017. Permits are forecasted by the Greater Phoenix Blue Chip to increase to nearly 24,000 permits in 2018 and to 27,000 permits in 2019. In the City of Maricopa, where Global Water has its largest water and wastewater permitted utility service area, the Home Builders Association of Central Arizona reports that permits are up 59% year over year.\nThe company believes this growth outlook, combined with four additional years of rate increase phase-ins, creates an opportunity for it to significantly increase its active connections and grow revenues.\nConference Call\nGlobal Water Resources will hold a conference call to discuss its 2017 results later today, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Friday, March 9, 2018\nTime: 1:00 p.m. Eastern time (10:00 a.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-855-327-6837\nInternational dial-in number: 1-778-331-2160\nThe conference call will be webcast live and available for replay here as well as via a link in the Investors section of the company’s website at www.gwresources.com .\nPlease call the conference telephone number five minutes prior to the start time.

EBITDA is defined for the purposes of this press release as net income or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the gain or loss related to (i) nonrecurring events; (ii) option expense related to awards made to the board of directors; and (iii) equity method investment. Adjusted Revenue is defined as Revenue excluding Willow Valley water revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures of our operating performance and provide our investors meaningful measures of overall corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method and timing of expenditures associated with building and placing our systems. EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it is frequently used by investment analysts, investors, and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Revenue are also presented because management believes that they provide our investors measures of our recurring core business. However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Revenue are not recognized measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Revenue may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that non-GAAP measures, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Revenue should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss or other income statement data (which are determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity and cash flows. Management's method of calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ materially from the method used by other companies and accordingly, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Revenue to revenue, the most comparable GAAP measures, are included in the schedules attached to this press release.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain forward-looking statements which reflect the Company's expectations regarding future events. The forward-looking statements involve a number of assumptions, risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning, future net income growth, our strategy, acquisition plans, our dividend policy, trends relating to population growth, active connections, regulated revenue, housing permit projections, and other statements that are not historical facts as well as statements identified by words such as \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"intends\", \"plans\", \"believes\", \"seeks\", \"estimates\", or the negative of these terms, or other words of similar meaning. These statements are based on our current beliefs or expectations and are inherently subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in political, economic, business, market, regulatory, and other factors. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s views as of the date hereof. Factors that may affect future results are disclosed under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which are available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . This includes, but is not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 which was filed with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, except as required by law, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nCompany Contact:\nMichael J.
