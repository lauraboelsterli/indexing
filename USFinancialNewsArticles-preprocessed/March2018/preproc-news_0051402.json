    "text": "NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp’s chief executive said on Tuesday he has signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia to create the world’s biggest solar power generation company in the kingdom.\nSpeaking in New York, Masayoshi Son said he expected the solar project to have the capacity to produce up to 200 gigawatts by 2030.\nLast May, SoftBank announced it raised over $93 billion for the Vision Fund, the world’s largest private equity fund with backers including Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, Apple and Foxconn.\nSon is pursuing his vision of a future powered by interconnected devices and artificial intelligence. He established the Vision Fund, which, in conjunction with the Delta Fund set up to invest in Chinese ride-sharing firm Didi Chuxing, has funnelled $27.5 billion into 20 tech firms as at the end of December.
