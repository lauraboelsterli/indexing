    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass., March 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Proteon Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:PRTO), a company developing novel, first-in-class therapeutics to address the medical needs of patients with kidney and vascular diseases, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017, and recent business highlights.\n“With enrollment completed on schedule in PATENCY-2, our second Phase 3 clinical trial of investigational vonapanitase, we are now focused on study follow-up and preparing for a potential BLA filing in the fourth quarter of 2019,” said Timothy Noyes, President and Chief Executive Officer of Proteon. “Also, with sufficient capital to fund the Company’s operations into the fourth quarter of 2019, we continue devoting resources to developing our market access strategy and preparing for commercialization of vonapanitase.”\n2017 Highlights and Recent Events\nEnrollment completed in PATENCY-2, the second Phase 3 clinical trial of investigational vonapanitase. PATENCY-2 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that treated 603 patients in the United States and Canada with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. The study’s co-primary endpoints are fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency (i.e., time to fistula abandonment), each of which demonstrated improvements in PATENCY-1 using the same definitions as in PATENCY-2. The Company expects to report top-line data from PATENCY-2 in April 2019. Additionally, if PATENCY-2 is successful in showing statistical significance (p≤0.05) on each of the co-primary endpoints, Proteon expects to file a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nIn the second quarter of 2017, vonapanitase received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for increasing arteriovenous fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency in patients on or expected to initiate hemodialysis. The FDA awards Breakthrough Therapy designations to expedite the development and review of investigational drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and have demonstrated preliminary clinical evidence that the treatment may offer a substantial improvement over currently available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, completed $22.0 million financing transaction. The transaction was led by an affiliate of Deerfield Management and included participation by Abingworth, Fairmount Funds, Perceptive Advisors, Pharmstandard, RA Capital, Skyline Ventures and TVM Capital. The financing extends the Company’s cash runway into the fourth quarter of 2019, which allows the Company to operate for more than six months beyond the expected release of top-line data from the PATENCY-2 trial based on the Company’s current operating plan.\nBoard of Directors Strengthened with leadership and industry expertise. Proteon strengthened its Board of Directors with the appointment of Jonathan Leff, a Partner at Deerfield Management, to the Board of Directors. Mr. Leff brings extensive industry experience to the board room having been a director at multiple publicly-traded biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. He is also active in public policy discussions related to healthcare and medical innovations.\nEnrollment continues in a Phase 1 clinical trial of vonapanitase in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 dose escalation trial is expected to enroll 24 symptomatic PAD patients being treated with balloon angioplasty of an artery below the knee and to follow each patient for up to seven months. Immediately following successful angioplasty, vonapanitase or placebo is delivered to the arterial wall using the Mercator MedSystems Bullfrog® Micro-Infusion Catheter. The primary outcome measure of the trial is safety and the secondary outcome measure is technical feasibility of study drug delivery via the catheter.\nKey Milestones\nCompleted enrollment of 603 treated patients in PATENCY-2 in March 2018.\nComplete enrollment of 24 patients in the PAD Phase 1 trial by the fourth quarter of 2018.\nRelease top-line data from PATENCY-2 in March 2019.\nUpcoming Events\nPresentation at the Cowen 38 th Annual Health Care Conference March 12 th in Boston, MA.\nPresentation at the Oppenheimer’s 28 th Annual Healthcare Conference March 21 st in New York, NY.\n2017 Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments totaled $42.1 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $41.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the $22.0 million preferred stock financing closed in August 2017 and offset by operational costs for 2017.\nR&D expenses: Research and development expenses for 2017 were $21.7 million as compared to $18.9 million for 2016. The increase in R&D expenses was due primarily to higher manufacturing pre-validation and validation expenses in 2017.\nMG&A expenses: Marketing, general and administrative expenses for 2017 were $8.7 million as compared to $9.8 million for 2016. The decrease in MG&A expenses was due primarily to decreased overhead and personnel expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nNet loss: Net loss for 2017 was $30.0 million as compared to $28.5 million for 2016. Net loss included stock-based compensation expense of $3.2 million for 2017 and $3.3 million for 2016.\nFinancial guidance: The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments will be sufficient to fund its operations into the fourth quarter of 2019, based on the Company’s current operating plan.\nAbout Vonapanitase\nVonapanitase is an investigational drug intended to improve hemodialysis vascular access outcomes. Vonapanitase is applied in a single administration and is currently being studied in a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. Vonapanitase has received Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA, and Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European Commission, for hemodialysis vascular access indications. In addition, vonapanitase may have other surgical and endovascular applications in diseases or conditions in which vessel injury leads to blockages in blood vessels and reduced blood flow. Proteon is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of vonapanitase in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).\nAbout Proteon Therapeutics\nProteon Therapeutics is committed to improving the health of patients with kidney and vascular diseases through the development of novel, first-in-class therapeutics. Proteon's lead product candidate, vonapanitase, is an investigational drug intended to improve hemodialysis vascular access outcomes. Proteon is evaluating vonapanitase in patients with CKD undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula. Proteon is also evaluating vonapanitase in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with PAD.
