    "text": "NEW YORK, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Life On Earth, Inc. (OTCQB:LFER) (or the “Company”) releases the following shareholder letter:\nShareholders of Life On Earth, Inc.\nCc: Board of Directors\nDear Fellow Shareholders,\nOn February 20, 2018, we made an announcement regarding our recent name change from Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. to Life On Earth, Inc. (the “Company”). We changed our name because our Board of Directors, management, and major stakeholders believe that our new name better reflects our business, and what we have been for over the past year and where we are heading.\nThe Company has long been focused on the research and development of its own Victoria’s Kitchen, Gran Nevada, and Life On Earth Tea brands. Based on these developments, we have determined that the deployment of a line of alternative beverages that are more natural, healthier and more satisfying to our consumers and that have a greater revenue potential was in the best interest of the company. We had long moved past our history of being an “ethnic” or just a beverage company for the Hispanic consumer market. The Company’s new focus is geared towards a broader health conscious consumer group, which is reflected in our name change to Life On Earth, Inc. ( http://www.lifeonearthinc.com ).\nWe are currently working with several strategic partners to accelerate new products under our own brands. Though we have distribution centers that sell and distribute other third-party brands, the Company is making the quarterly shift away from that model towards the distribution of its own brands that it either develops internally or purchases from third parties. The intrinsic value of scalability of our own brands is always on the forefront of our business. We are now in the latter stages of these developments to foster revenue growth and better margins to propel us to the next level.\nIn the February 20 th Press Release, there may have been some confusion regarding the mention of the cannabis market. Please, allow me to be clear, that we view the use of value added ingredients, supplements, and additives as just that -- value added to benefit our consumers by attaining a healthier life style-- this will also help the Company increase its overall gross margins. We also understand that there may be some of our shareholders asking what \"cannabis\" is and how it relates to our brands and our products. Please see the following link to help better understand the differences among the usages of certain components of the cannabis and hemp related products: https://www.projectcbd.org/guidance/cbd-misconceptions\nWe are in the business of selling everywhere and potentially to anyone that view our brands and their products in the same fashion. That clearly means that we must be able to sell in every state in the country . We will not purchase or distribute any products that are prohibited to be marketed and sold in all fifty states. We are not in the business of selling selective products that are only legal in a handful of states.\nWe are a health conscious, environmentally friendly, and consumer conscience company. The company also holds dearly the values of all our shareholders. There are plenty of opportunities in our own brands, as well as future brands, that we can bring to our portfolio and can dramatically increase shareholder value once they reach a certain threshold in revenues. Anyone of these brands can be the next super success story in their own right. Life On Earth, Inc. already has a collection of these potential super star brands under one banner and one company.\nHere are our new brands and the products that we are accelerating to launch:\nLife On Earth Teas – Hibiscus, Jasmine, Yerba Mate, Mango Tea, Sour Hawberry Tea, Tamarind Tea\nVictoria Kitchens – Almond Water, Almond Coconut Water, Lemon Ginger, and Blood Orange, both Distilled and Sparkling versions\nGran Nevada Juices – Tamarind, Guava, Mango, Hibiscus, Horchata, Horchata De Morro\nExclusive Distribution Agreements : Hemp2O\nOur goal is to launch our new line of products through our own Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”) systems from the West Coast (ESD operations out of Northern CA) and East Coast Operations (Giant operations out of New York City). We will also enhance our National Sales Team to help us increase distribution to other DSD businesses outside of our home markets. The goal is to get our brands in enough retailers in key markets and then expand directly to regional and national retailers. As these developments unfold, we will share with our shareholders.\nAgain, I want to personally thank each of you for your continued interest and for being a shareholder of our company. Kindly share the news of our upcoming and exiting developments as we continue to grow into a company that truly values Life On Earth!\nWarm regards,\nFernando Oswaldo Leonzo\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nLife On Earth, Inc.\n575 Lexington Avenue, 4 th Floor, NY, NY 10022\nTel 866-928-5070 Fax 516-223-2894\ninfo@lifeonearthinc.com\nwww.lifeonearthinc.com\nSource:Life On Earth, Inc.",
