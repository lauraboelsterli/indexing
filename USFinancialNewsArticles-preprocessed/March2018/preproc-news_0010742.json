(the “Company” or “PogoTec”), an innovator in wearable devices, today announced Svetlana Samoilova will join the Company as Vice President of Augmented Reality (AR), effective immediately. Mrs. Samoilova brings more than 20 years of software and hardware development and engineering experience to PogoTec and will lead the AR team in the development of the first ever augmented reality system attachable to eyewear and designed specifically for the consumer market. This AR system will utilize the proprietary platform that PogoTec has developed and patent protected enabling wearables to attach and detach magnetically to virtually all glasses.\n“Svetlana has significant experience bringing consumer products to life – from idea to concept, prototype, execution and delivery – which will be critical to PogoTec as we continue to innovate and develop new offerings,” said Brendan Sheil, Chief Executive Officer and President of PogoTec. “We are thrilled to welcome Svetlana to our growing team of talented experts with experience from top companies. She is passionate about creating and building great products and we look forward to leveraging her many talents as we expand PogoTec.”\nPrior to joining PogoTec, Samoilova served as Senior Director of Engineering of HoloLens at Microsoft from August 2013 through September 2016 where she was responsible for system integration of HoloLens, engineering of advanced and new technologies, early prototyping, HoloLens peripherals, firmware development and hardware design verification.

Samoilova spent more than eight years at Apple Inc. as Director of Mobile Devices (iPod/iPhone) and Senior Manager of the iPod/iPhone division. She also previously served as Senior Engineering Manager of Access Softek and began her career as a Research Scientist and Software Developer at the Prokhorov General Physics Institute.\n“I was drawn to PogoTec because of the Company’s focus on bringing Augmented Reality, an innovative technology that was previously only geared toward enterprise customers, to consumers,” said Samoilova. “Augmented Reality is changing the way we see our world and the market for AR is growing significantly. I’m excited to join this strong team and create the first consumer friendly, lightweight and economical AR system that is attachable to nearly all eyewear.”\nPogoTec is transforming the way consumers capture and share images and videos from their surroundings, by innovating interactive, sophisticated and accessible technology solutions that unobtrusively enhance consumers’ daily lives.
