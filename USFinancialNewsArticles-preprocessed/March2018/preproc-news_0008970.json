    "text": "March 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is in talks to create a checking-account-like product with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe process is still in its early stages and may not be completed, the report said. ( on.wsj.com/2H6LDE5 )\nAmazonâ€™s talks with financial firms is an attempt to create a product to attract younger consumers, mainly those without bank accounts.\nWhatever its final form, the initiative would not see the online retailer become a bank, the report said.\nThe e-commerce giant has been contemplating getting into the finance sector for years.\nThe company is trying to bring Amazon Pay to brick-and-mortar stores, the WSJ report said, adding that it is likely to begin with Whole Foods, which Amazon bought last year.
