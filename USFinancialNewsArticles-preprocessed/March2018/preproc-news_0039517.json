    "text": "Flexible Office Space Provider Expands Marketing Muscle as Global Expansion Accelerates\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Knotel , the flexible workspace provider that creates custom offices for growing businesses, announced today that Rachel Meranus joins the executive team as Chief Marketing Officer. In this role, Rachel will lead the marketing effort to change the way in which modern companies work and think about workspaces.\nRachel is a seasoned industry veteran who brings 20 years of marketing and communications experience from the startup and B2B worlds to Knotel. She has led tech companies to acquisition, spearheaded company rebrands, and driven significant revenue growth and business expansions. Rachel joins Knotel from Olapic, a visual marketing technology platform that raised $21 million in funding, where she served as CMO and led the company to a $130 million acquisition by Monotype in June 2016, after doubling year-over-year revenue. Before that, she was CMO at MediaMath, a digital ad-buying platform that raised more than $175 million and acquired three companies during her tenure. Prior to that, Rachel served as VP of Marketing and Communications at PR Newswire.\n“I’m delighted to welcome Rachel as Knotel prepares for the next phase in its skyrocketing growth,” said Amol Sarva, co-founder and CEO of Knotel. “Knotel is on a faster trajectory than the market has ever seen, and as forward-thinking companies realize the power of agile workspaces and contracts, Rachel will give us firepower to reach new markets and customers faster. She is an exceptional thinker and brand builder, and we’re lucky to have her on the team.”\n“Knotel is knocking down the walls of an age-old industry and solving a real problem for businesses, which is exciting to be a part of,” said Rachel Meranus, CMO of Knotel. “I’m also motivated by Knotel’s commitment to effecting positive change in the communities it serves. From raising awareness around immigrant rights, to employing formerly incarcerated individuals, Knotel’s focus on inclusion and activism is inspiring, and I’m grateful to help move these causes forward.”\nIn the past year, Knotel has moved with lightning speed, becoming the third largest player in the flexible office market in New York City. After raising a $25 million Series A in February of 2017, Knotel tripled the size of its real estate portfolio to over 800,000 square feet across 45 locations, and expanded into SF and London. Its member list includes Starbucks, The Body Shop, and Activision Blizzard.\nAbout Knotel\nKnotel is a flexible workspace provider that is redefining how companies access and manage their office space. With its \"Headquarters as a service\" model, Knotel offers made-to-measure spaces, services, and terms for growing businesses. Named a Business Insider Top 50 Startup for 2018 and New York's Hottest New Workspace Model in 2017, Knotel has raised $25 million in funding and operates over 800,000 square feet of space across NYC, SF and London.
