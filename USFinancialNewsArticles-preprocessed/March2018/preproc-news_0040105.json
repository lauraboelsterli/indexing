    "text": "March 22, 2018 / 6:30 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Deutsche Bank asset management arm DWS sets IPO price at 32.50 euros Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - DWS, the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank, said on Thursday the price for its initial public offering was set at 32.50 euros per share, giving the business a market capitalisation of 6.5 billion euros (£5.7 billion). The headquarters of the Deutsche Bank's DWS Asset Management is pictured in Frankfurt, Germany, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski The proceeds and valuation are less than the bank had originally hoped for, but the start of trading, scheduled for Friday on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, will mark the most tangible milestone yet in Chief Executive Officer John Cryan’s struggle to restructure the flagship German bank.
