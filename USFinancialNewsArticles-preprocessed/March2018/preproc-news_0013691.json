Credit covenant calculations strengthening. 8,700 new customers, growth of more than 1 percent over the prior year. Midstream operations stabilized, focused on growth.\nLIBERTY, Mo., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (NYSE:FGP) (“Ferrellgas” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018. The Company reported a net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. of $1.8 million, or $0.02 per common unit, which includes non-cash charges of approximately $49 million largely associated with its de-leveraging efforts. This is compared to net earnings attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. of $38.1 million, or $0.39 per common unit, for the prior year period.\nThe Company reported that total gallons sold in the second quarter increased 42.3 million gallons over the same period in the prior year, with slightly lower margins as it aggressively competes for and wins new customers. Total gallon growth of 16 percent over the same period in the prior year helped the company report adjusted EBITDA of $120.6 million, compared to $105.0 million in the prior year period, a 15 percent increase.\nAt the end of this second quarter of the Company’s fiscal year, its leverage ratio was 6.96x, down from 7.57x at the end of the first quarter reflecting successful efforts to de-lever, as well as increased adjusted EBITDA. This level was lower than the 7.75x limit allowed under its secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facilities, as amended in April 2017. Based on the Company’s current forecast, the leverage ratio is expected to continue to strengthen and decrease throughout the fiscal year.\n“Our company has momentum and the future continues to look bright on all fronts,” continued Mr. Ferrell. “We’ve closed on a number of accretive, bolt-on acquisitions that complement our strategic footprint and plan to stay aggressive in pursuit of well-run businesses that fit our model. We are expanding the number and capacity of our Blue Rhino-owned production facilities in order to reduce freight costs and streamline production – initiatives that are increasingly important as we added more than 3,000 new Blue Rhino selling locations since the prior year period. Our Midstream operations have stabilized and are now keenly focused on growth with recent expectations of more drilling activity in basins where we operate. We have also executed on sales of non-core assets that has streamlined our business, reduced our debt and positively enhanced our key credit metrics.”\n“These initiatives are the product of a leaner, more agile organization with a flatter management structure,” Ferrell added. “I like our seasoned management team. We are working together better than ever to grow the business and serve our customers. All of our employees are focused and working hard. Morale is high. We are well positioned for fiscal 2018 and building a foundation for the long-term success of our Company.”\nAbout Ferrellgas\nFerrellgas Partners, L.P., through its operating partnership, Ferrellgas, L.P., and subsidiaries, serves propane customers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and provides midstream services to major energy companies in the United States.

Management believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful, because it allows investors to view the partnership's performance in a manner similar to the method management uses, adjusted for items management believes makes it easier to compare its results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures. This method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with that of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. (d) Net cash interest expense is the sum of interest expense less non-cash interest expense and other expense, net. This amount includes interest expense related to the accounts receivable securitization facility. (e) Maintenance capital expenditures include capitalized expenditures for betterment and replacement of property, plant and equipment. (f) Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA minus net cash interest expense, maintenance capital expenditures and cash paid for taxes plus proceeds from asset sales. Management considers distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors a meaningful measure of the partnership’s ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to equity investors. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, as management defines it, may not be comparable to distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors or similarly titled measurements used by other corporations and partnerships. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors may not be consistent with that of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. (g) Distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors minus distributable cash flow attributable to general partner and noncontrolling interest. Management considers distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders a meaningful measure of the partnership’s ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to common unitholders. Distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders, as management defines it, may not be comparable to distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders or similarly titled measurements used by other corporations and partnerships. Items added to our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to common unit holders that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders may not be consistent with that of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP .\nSource:Ferrellgas Partners, L.P.",
