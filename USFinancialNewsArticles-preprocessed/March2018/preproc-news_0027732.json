    "text": "836 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The Trump administration Thursday issued for the first time sanctions against Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections and for cyberattacks, targeting the Kremlin’s intelligence agencies and individuals indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for their alleged roles in election interference.\nNewsletter Sign-up In sanctioning five entities and 19 individuals, the U.S. Treasury and senior national-security officials also accused the Russian government of ongoing attacks against the U.S. energy grid, water, aviation and manufacturing facilities.\nThe U.S. also cited a cyberattack last year known as NotPetya that crippled computer networks at multinational firms world-wide and pointed to a nerve-agent attack earlier this month in the U.K. that left a former Russia spy and his daughter in critical condition.\nIn concert with its sanctions Thursday, the White House also issued a joint statement with France, Germany and the U.K. condemning Russia for the attack against the former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter.\nRelated Video The Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency, a.k.a. the Troll Factory, ​used fake social media accounts before and after the 2016 U.S. election to collect sensitive personal information on Americans, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found. Shelby Holliday explains how the Russian schemes worked.​ The administration said it backs London’s assessment that Russia was involved in the attempted murder using a military-grade nerve agent. Calling it an assault on the U.K.’s sovereignty and violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the joint statement said the attack “threatens the security of us all.”\nTaken together the actions represented a heating up of diplomatic warfare between Russia and the West. Earlier this week, the U.K. expelled 23 Russian diplomats and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov fired back, “it is all nonsense.”\nThursday’s U.S. sanctions targeted Russia firms and individuals indicted by special counsel Mueller last month, including the so-called Internet Research Agency and its owner Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin.\nMr. Prigozhin and two of his other businesses were previously sanctioned for their role in supporting Russia’s involvement in the Ukraine war.\nSimilarly, two Russian intelligence agencies, the Federal Security Service and the Main Intelligence Directorate, and four intelligence officials listed in Wednesday’s action previously had been sanctioned by Treasury. But the administration added two more Russian intelligence officials to its blacklist and added Mr. Prigozhin’s Internet Research Agency and people associated with his businesses.\nThe sanctions, which ban financial dealings with the individuals and firms named, are unlikely to have much of a practical impact, in large part because the latest list hits many entities and individuals already blacklisted and the newly added people aren’t important to Russia’s economy or politics. Rather, their relevance is symbolic in the Trump administration officially calling out Russia and a diplomatic challenge to the Kremlin, holding Russia to account for its election meddling and cyber provocations.\nThe Trump administration has come under heavy criticism for its response to Russia’s alleged election meddling, with critics saying the administration hasn’t taken on Moscow aggressively. Mr. Mueller is investigating Moscow’s involvement in election interference and whether there was collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign, a charge Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied.\n“The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyber activity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyberattacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement. “These targeted sanctions are a part of a broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.”\nRelated Coverage U.K. Allies Condemn Russia for Ex-Spy’s Poisoning Russia Vows Retaliatory Measures Against U.K. Penalties The Real Drama in Russia’s Election: How Many Voters Will Show Up? Sign Up: Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter The sanctions are the administration’s first punitive actions under a new law passed last year to force the White House to punish Russia for election interference. A senior administration official said more sanctions against Russia would be coming. Mr. Mnuchin has said in recent weeks Treasury would soon also target corrupt Russian officials and oligarchs within the Kremlin power circle.\n“This is just one of a series of ongoing actions we’re taking to counter Russian aggression” the administration official said. Another senior official added, “By no means will this constitute the end of our ongoing campaign to instruct Mr. Putin to change his behavior.”\nThe administration points to several rounds of sanctions it already has taken against Moscow over the last year, including a decision to close Russia’s San Francisco consulate last August and sanctions against an important ally of President Vladimir Putin, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov.\nMr. Trump has fueled criticism about his administration’s Russia policy by questioning U.S. intelligence charges of Kremlin interference in the U.S. elections and for his campaign’s outreach to Russian officials.\n“The fact that the administration has issued sanctions against individuals and entities indicted by Special Counsel Mueller proves that his investigation isn’t a ‘witch hunt’ as the president and his allies have claimed,” Senate Minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, (D. New York), said in a statement.\nWrite to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com",
