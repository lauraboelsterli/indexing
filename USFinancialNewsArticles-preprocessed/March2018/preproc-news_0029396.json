    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 10:26 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Canada's De Grasse pulls out of Commonwealth Games Reuters Staff 2   Canadian triple Olympic sprint medalist Andre De Grasse has withdrawn from next month’s Commonwealth Games to concentrate on his fitness for the outdoor season, he said on Friday. Feb 16, 2018; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Canadian sprinter Andre De Grasse reacts during the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports “The Commonwealth Games was going to be a great opportunity to display my talents to a passionate fan base in Australia,” De Grasse said in a statement. “I wouldn’t want to go in there at any less than my best and for that reason we have made the difficult decision to withdraw from the games.” The multi-sport games are scheduled for the Gold Coast of Australia from April 4-15, which is typically earlier than most sprinters start their seasons. De Grasse, 23, was silver medalist in the 200 meters at the 2016 Rio Olympics and won bronze in the 100 meters and 4x100 meters relay. He missed the 2017 world championships after suffering a hamstring injury in training. The injury has healed and De Grasse is 100 percent healthy, but he is not where he wants to be from a fitness standpoint. “My team and I feel like this is the best decision for the long term,” De Grasse said. “I will now train hard through the spring to be ready for a strong and full outdoor season.” He plans to run a 100 meters race at the Drake Relays in late April.
