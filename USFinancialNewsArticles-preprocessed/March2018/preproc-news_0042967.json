    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing achieved the biggest reduction in average pollution levels among 28 cities in northern China over October-February, in a sign that winter curbs on industry significantly improved air quality in the capital, official data showed on Friday.\nFILE PHOTO: The super blue moon rises over Central Business District in Beijing, China, January 31, 2018. REUTERS/Natalie Thomas Concentrations of small, breathable particles known as PM2.5 fell by 54.5 percent year-on-year in Beijing to an average of 46 micrograms per cubic meter for the five-month period, the newly formed Ministry of Ecology and Environment said on its official Weibo account.\nBeijing, whose PM2.5 average over October-February was also the lowest listed, easily beat its target of a 25 percent year-on-year cut and scored a 29.6 percent year-on-year reduction in February alone, the third-best performance for the month.\nShijiazhuang, the smog-prone capital of the northern Hebei province that surrounds Beijing, came second in the list for October-February, cutting its average PM2.5 level by 48.6 percent to 93 micrograms.\nThe 28 cities have been selected by the Chinese government for targeted anti-pollution measures, especially during the peak winter heating season in northern China that ran from mid-November to mid-March.\nEnvironment minister Li Ganjie said last week China would set more stringent targets for improving air quality under a new three-year plan. [nB9N1P700W]\nTwo other Hebei cities, Langfang and Baoding, were placed third and fourth, respectively, for October-February reductions, with Baoding the top performer in February alone.\nTianjin was fifth and Tangshan, Chinaâ€™s heavily polluted steel capital, also in Hebei, was sixth, cutting its average PM2.5 reading by 38.5 percent to 67 microgams.\nJincheng, in Shanxi province, placed 28th, registering only a 10.7 percent cut and a posting a 7.1 percent increase in PM2.5 levels in February.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Mark Potter\n ",
