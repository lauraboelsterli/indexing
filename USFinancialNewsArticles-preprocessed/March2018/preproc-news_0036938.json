    "text": "Canadian marijuana producer Cronos Group announced a cross-border partnership with California-based cannabis retailer MedMen on Monday, sending shares skyrocketing.\nCronos Group Shares closed up more than 11 percent on-the-day.\n\"We want to change the perception of cannabis worldwide, and bring it to the mainstream,\" Cronos Group CEO Mike Gorenstein said. \"We looked around the world for the best partner, and we found MedMen.\"\nMedMen Canada, as the joint venture will be called, is a new jointly managed company that will develop branded products and open stores across Canada. \n\nThe venture will leverage Cronos Group's Canadian expertise and product and MedMen's branding, technology and retail experience. \n\"MedMen Canada will give us entry into an important emerging market for adult use and broaden our exposure worldwide,\" MedMen CEO and Co-founder Adam Bierman said in a statement.\nFurthermore, Gorenstein looks at the partnership with MedMen as one that could potentially prepare Cronos Group for a future in the U.S. market.\n\"This is the beginning â€“ we look at this as a long term relationship,\" Gorenstein said.\nMedMen, one of the largest cannabis retailers in California, has facilities in California, Nevada and New York. MedMen in January announced plans to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange as soon as April 15. \nCronos Group has a global reach, serving markets in Canada, Israel and Germany, and in February became the first \"pure play\" cannabis company to list on a major U.S. exchange. \nCronos Group shares are up 13.2 percent year-to-date and more than 300 percent in the past 12 months.",
