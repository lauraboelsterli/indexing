    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (“Gran Tierra”) (NYSE American:GTE) (NYSE MKT:GTE) (TSX:GTE), a company focused on oil and gas exploration and production in Colombia today announces that it has received approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (“ TSX ”) to implement its previously announced normal course issuer bid (the “ Bid ”) through the facilities of the TSX. Pursuant to the Bid, Gran Tierra is able to purchase for cancellation up to 5% of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “ Shares ”) for a one year period at prevailing market prices. The brokerage firm conducting the Bid on behalf of Gran Tierra is Eight Capital.\nUnder the Bid, Gran Tierra may repurchase for cancellation up to 19,269,732 Shares. This represents approximately 5% of its 385,394,642 issued and outstanding Shares as of March 8, 2018. These purchases will be made in accordance with applicable regulations over a maximum period of one year beginning on March 12, 2018 and ending on March 11, 2019. The average daily trading volume of the Shares over the six calendar months prior to the date hereof was 610,816. Accordingly, Gran Tierra is entitled to purchase, on any trading day, up to 152,704 Shares. The consideration that Gran Tierra will pay for any Shares acquired by it under the Bid will be paid in cash at the market price of such Shares at the time of acquisition.\nManagement of Gran Tierra believes that the Shares, at times, have been trading in a price range which does not adequately reflect their value in relation to Gran Tierra’s current operations, growth prospects and financial position. At such times, the purchase of Shares for cancellation or to satisfy awards granted under Gran Tierra’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan may be advantageous to stockholders by increasing the value of the Shares.\nWithin the past twelve months, Gran Tierra purchased 7,704,377 Shares at a volume weighted average price of C$3.07 under a previously approved normal course issuer bid through the facilities of the TSX and NYSE American (February 8, 2017 to February 7, 2018) permitting the purchase of up to 19,540,359 Shares.\nAbout Gran Tierra Energy Inc.\nGran Tierra Energy Inc. is an independent international energy company focused on oil and natural gas exploration and production in Colombia.
