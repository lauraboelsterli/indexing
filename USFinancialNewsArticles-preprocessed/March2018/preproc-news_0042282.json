    "text": "VICTORIA, British Columbia, March 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carmanah Technologies Corporation (TSX:CMH) (“the Company” or “Carmanah”) today reported its fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 financial results for the periods ended December 31, 2017. Currency amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.\nAll figures below, unless otherwise stated, are for Carmanah’s continuing operations and exclude the operating results from the Company’s Power business segment. The company completed the sale of the On-Grid division on April 3, 2017 and the sale of the Off-Grid division on August 1, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Revenues and Profitability\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we generated revenues of USD $14.1 million, up USD $3.4 million or 31.6% over the fourth quarter of 2016 revenues of USD $10.7 million. The increase in revenues was attributed to exceptionally strong performance from most of our Signals verticals, which generated revenues of USD $13.3 million, up USD $4.5 million or 50.9% over the fourth quarter of 2016 revenues of USD $8.8 million. The Marine vertical now includes the revenue of Vega. Excluding the Vega and EKTA revenue contribution, the Signals vertical’s organic growth was USD $2.9 million, up 32.3% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Conversely, the Illumination segment generated revenues of USD $0.8 million, down USD $1.1 million or 59.1% over the fourth quarter of 2016 revenues of USD $1.9 million, as we continued the transition to our next generation EverGen product.\nGross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 42.3% up 0.7%, over the same period in 2016.\nCore operating expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017 were USD $5.8 million, up from US$3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was due to higher product development activities, the amortization of acquired intangible assets from Vega and EKTA and the overall increase in G&A expenses associated with the acquisition of Vega.\nNet income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was USD $(0.05) million down from USD $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter of 2017 net income was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of USD $0.5 million, also principally associated with the Vega acquisition, as well as the increase in core operating expenses noted above. Carmanah has an aggressive integration plan for Vega in 2018 that is expected to deliver targeted cost savings.\nCarmanah management relies on Adjusted EBITDA 1 (a non-IFRS measure) to gauge financial performance. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company generated Adjusted EBITDA of USD $1.2 million, down 7.1% from USD $1.3 million in the same period in 2016. A table reconciling net income and Adjusted EBITDA is included in this release.\nFiscal 2017 Revenues and Profitability\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated revenues of USD $51.9 million, up USD $4.2 million or 8.8% over 2016 revenues of USD $47.7 million. The Signals segment generated revenues of USD $48.0 million, up USD $8.1 million or 20.3% over 2016 revenues of USD $39.9 million. This growth included USD $5.1 million or 12.7% from organic growth. The Illumination segment generated revenues of USD $3.9 million, down USD $3.9 million or 49.7% over 2016 revenues of USD $7.8 million.\nGross margin percentage for the year was 41.6%, down 1.4%, over the same period in 2016.\nOur total core operating expenses for the year were USD $18.6 million, up from USD $16.5 million in 2016. A majority of this increase was due to the same factors apparent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income for the year was USD $1.4 million, down from $2.9 million in fiscal 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $7.1 million or 13.6% of revenue, roughly comparable to the $7.0 million, or 14.7% of revenue, reported in the same period in 2016.\n“2017 was a very active year for Carmanah during which we made significant progress towards our plan to increase focus and enhance our Signals segment leadership. We acquired two marine aids-to-navigation businesses that we are in the process of consolidating into our global marine business to expand our product platform and deliver targeted cost savings. These acquisitions, together with solid organic growth, helped to solidify our aids-to-navigation market leadership,” said John Simmons, CEO . “And while we are pleased with our Signals business progress in 2017, our Illumination business remained challenging. During 2017, we streamlined our Illumination product offering and revamped our approach to the market. We are hopeful that these investments will help us reverse recent revenue declines and return this business to both growth and profitability. Early signs are encouraging, as our Illumination backlog entering 2018 stood at USD $1.3 million, up from USD $0.6 million a year earlier and USD $0.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2017.”\nHighlights for the quarter are provided below:\nThree months ended December 31, Twelve months ended December 31, (US$ thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue 14,103 10,714 51,939 47,742 Gross margin % 42.3 % 41.6 % 41.6 % 43.0 % Core operating expenditures (5,753 ) (3,802 ) (18,643 ) (16,531 ) Net (loss)/income (44 ) 80 1,392 2,917 Adjusted EBITDA 1 1,222 1,316 7,084 7,020 Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016\nCash and cash equivalents of USD $11.8 million, down USD $10.1 million from USD $21.9 million, primarily due to the acquisitions of EKTA and Vega, and our Substantial Issuer Bid.
