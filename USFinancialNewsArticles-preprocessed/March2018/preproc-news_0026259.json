    "text": "Published: Mar 14, 2018 5:29 p.m. ET Share \nUnclear if president is changing his demands on immigration Reuters President Donald Trump inspected border wall prototypes Tuesday in San Diego. \nBy Kristina Peterson Laura Meckler \nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has floated to congressional Republicans the idea of extending a program shielding young undocumented immigrants from deportation as part of an upcoming spending bill, according to GOP aides. \nTrump has signaled he might be open to extending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program in exchange for securing some funding to build a border wall, GOP aides said Wednesday. \nAmid the talk of a new proposal, both the White House and the Homeland Security Department issued statements saying they oppose any short-term agreement and continued to insist on a longer-term deal. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen wants a “permanent fix to DACA and lasting border security,” said DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton. “The secretary has been very clear that any legislation must reflect these two tenets,” Houlton said. \nIt wasn’t clear Wednesday if Trump was changing the demands he had set previously in the immigration debate. Trump has insisted on four policy pillars, and the DHS statement notably made no mention of two of them: cuts to family-based migration, and an end to the diversity-visa lottery, which admits 50,000 people chosen at random from countries that are underrepresented.",
