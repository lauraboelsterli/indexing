The Anglo-Australian mining company made a strategic decision in 2017 to exit coal and focus on growth in iron ore, copper and its aluminium division. The deal to sell the underground coal mine in Queensland, Australia, is subject to regulatory approvals and expected to complete in the second half of 2018.
