    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund (NYSE: JRS) has declared its regular quarterly distribution. This fund represents just one of several Nuveen investment strategies designed for investors seeking diversified sources of cash flow to prepare for and sustain their retirement income and other cash flow needs. Information regarding the fund’s last 19(a) Quarterly Distribution Notice (as of November 30, 2017) is also included below. This informational notice provides further details on the sources of the fund’s distribution. The full text of this notice is also available on the Nuveen website via Distribution Source Estimates . For further information regarding fund distributions including earnings, undistributed net investment income, and notices please visit www.nuveen.com/cef .\nThe following dates apply to today's declaration for the Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund:\nRecord Date March 15, 2018 Ex-Dividend Date March 14, 2018 Payable Date April 2, 2018 Quarterly Distribution Per Share\nChange From Ticker\nExchange\nFund Name\nAmount Previous Quarter JRS NYSE Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund $.2300 -$.0200\nQuarterly Managed Distributions\nThe goal of the fund’s managed distribution program is to provide shareholders relatively consistent and predictable cash flow by systematically converting its expected long-term return potential into regular distributions. Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at www.nuveen.com/CEFdistributions . These estimates may not match the final tax characterization contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.\nUnder a Managed Distribution policy, Nuveen closed-end funds seek to maintain a stable regular distribution amount that, over the long term, matches the fund’s total distributions paid to its total return. Investors should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate or from the terms of its Managed Distribution Policy.\nActual returns likely will differ from projected long-term returns, (and therefore a fund’s distribution rate, also), at least over shorter time periods. Over a specific timeframe, a fund’s net asset value will increase (if returns exceed distributions), or decrease (if distributions exceed returns), by the difference between actual returns and total distributions. A return of capital is a non-taxable distribution of a portion of the fund’s capital. When fund returns exceed distributions, return of capital may represent portfolio gains earned, but not realized as a taxable capital gain. In periods when fund returns fall short of distributions, it will represent a portion of the investors’ original principal unless the shortfall is offset during other time periods over the life of the investment (previous or subsequent) when the fund’s total return exceeds distributions. For additional information about managed distributions, please see Understanding Managed Distributions .\nThe following table provides estimates of the Fund’s distribution sources, reflecting year-to-date cumulative experience through the month-end prior to the latest distribution. The Fund attributes these estimates equally to each regular distribution throughout the year. Consequently, the estimated information as of the specified month-end shown below is for the current distribution, and also represents an updated estimate for all prior months in the year. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be (and is shown below as being estimated to be) a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.”\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. More details about the Fund’s distributions and the basis for these estimates are available on www.nuveen.com/cef .\nData as of 11/30/2017 Estimated Per Share Sources of Distribution 1 Estimated Percentage of the Distribution Per Share Long-Term Short-Term Return of Long-Term Short-Term Return of JRS (FYE 12/31)\nDistribution\nNII\nGains\nGains\nCapital\nNII\nGains\nGains\nCapital\nCurrent Quarter .2500 .1076 .0824 .0000 .0600 43.0% 33.0% 0.0% 24.0% Fiscal YTD 1.0000 .4302 .3297 .0000 .2401 43.0% 33.0% 0.0% 24.0% 1 Net investment income (NII) is a projection through the end of the current calendar quarter using actual data through the stated month-end date above.

The NII estimates above are based on prior year attributions which can be expected to differ from the actual final attributions for the current year.\nThe following table provides information regarding JRS’ distributions and total return performance over various time periods.
