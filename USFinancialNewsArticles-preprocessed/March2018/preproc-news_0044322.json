Specifically, it showed where I was on December 23, including at my previous apartment in Jersey City, in Times Square and in Chelsea, Manhattan, right down to the specific part of the street I was standing on. \nFacebook says only I can see this history, but that’s not entirely true. Facebook has an option to share your location with friends so they can see who’s nearby, and it offers tools to developers that allow (with your permission) them to access your location. ",
