    "text": "The rare BR-X1 wristwatch costs $386,000, a price tag higher than the average cost of new homes sold in the US in 2017, according to the US Census Bureau . \nSource: CNBC When Bell & Ross conceived of the timepiece, it was looking to create the next game-changer in the ultra-luxurious watch category. So the designers took inspiration from the cockpit of a fighter jet.\nGetty Images | Christopher Furlong A US Air Force F-15 fighter jet Designers made the casing on the watch see-through, reminiscent of the jet's cockpit.\nCNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich \" got a look at the translucent bling for an upcoming episode.\nSource: CNBC \"This case is made completely out of sapphire,\" says Greg Simonian of Westime, a luxury watch retailer based out of Southern California. \"Nine pieces of sapphire assembled together. That's very difficult to do in watch-making.\"\nThe sapphire used in the BR-X1 is pure to 99.997 percent (which means it's free of other elements), making it is colorless.\nSource: CNBC Behind the luminous crystal sits the watch's \"skeleton,\" the intricate timekeeping mechanisms of the watch, crafted from titanium and stainless steel.\nSource: CNBC Bell & Ross created only eight of these high-end timepieces in late 2017. But if you're thinking about snatching one up, think again. The BR-X1 completely sold out with jet-like speed.\nCatch the season premiere of CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich \" Wednesday, March 7 at 10P/ET. \nDon't miss: Take a look inside the most expensive home in America: a $500 million California mansion \nLike this story?
