The Europa League is Arsenal’s only chance to win a trophy this season and with a top-four league finish looking unlikely, it could also be the club’s only route to the Champions League next season. “These players want to win, but in life you forget quickly how good you are,” Wenger told reporters. “When we have a bad week players change their mind about their qualities.

We are a bit affected by what happened. “This is an opportunity we have to take. There is increased pressure on this competition even more. It’s certainly difficult when we go through a patch like this.” Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny echoed his manager’s sentiments. “When you have bad results, it’s always bad for the team,” Koscielny said. “We are disappointed with how we have played. “We are in a negative spiral and it’s difficult to go out of this. We have to be positive to have a good result and step by step we will come back stronger.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru",
