    "text": "Jeff Bezos kicked off Amazon 's annual robotics conference with a scene straight out of a science-fiction movie.\nAmazon began its annual invite-only MARS conference on Monday. The conference is dedicated to machine learning, home automation, robotics and space exploration.\nBezos posted a photo on Twitter posing with the dog-like Boston Dynamics robot, and wrote, \"Taking my new dog for a walk at the #MARS2018 conference.\"\ntweet\nThe robot, named SpotMini, has become popular on the internet after unsettling videos of it learning how to open doors went viral on YouTube. Some viewers tweeted their fear that the robot would end all humans.\nIn addition to hanging out with SpotMini, Bezos has also been playing beer pong with another robot at the conference, according to videos that have surfaced on Twitter.\nTweet\nLast year, Bezos pulled a bigger robot stunt at MARS. He piloted a 13-foot-tall mechanical robot built by a South Korean company named Hankook Mirae. While he looked a bit like a real-life Transformer, the robot was more for show than function.",
