O1 Properties, one of Russia’s largest commercial property owners, was in talks with Vanke Group about a potential stake sale, a person close to the talks told Reuters in September. O1 Properties owns 15 business centres in Moscow worth more than $4 billion, according to the company. China Vanke on Monday reported a 30.3 percent rise in 2017 core annual profit reaching a record high, in line with market estimates. Reporting by Clare Jim; Editing by Christopher Cushing",
