    "text": "March 8 (Reuters) -\n* A U.S. government weather forecaster on Thursday said a transition from La Niña to ENSO-neutral conditions was most likely, and neutral conditions were expected to continue into the second half of the year.\n* The National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) in its monthly forecast pegged the chance of ENSO-neutral conditions at about 55 percent during the March-May season.\n* ENSO-neutral refers to those periods when neither El Niño nor La Niña is present, according to CPC.
