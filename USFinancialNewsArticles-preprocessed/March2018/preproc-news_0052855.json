    "text": "LOS ANGELES, March 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Hilco Industrial, in a joint venture with Tiger Group, announced today that they are selling the assets formerly owned by Clairmont Camera and Keslow Camera. In 2017, Keslow Camera - the largest privately held motion picture camera equipment rental house in North America - announced the acquisition of Clairmont Camera and its Vancouver and Toronto operations. The move more than quadrupled Keslow Camera's anamorphic and vintage lens inventory and added a substantial range of custom camera equipment to the company's extensive portfolio. The acquisition also resulted in some unnecessary redundancies and, therefore, one of the finest offerings of excess equipment ever available in the market which Hilco and Tiger will sell through a series of privately negotiated sales and online auction sales. All available equipment has been subjected to the same high-caliber quality control standards that Keslow is known for.\nThe offering will feature vintage lenses, camera equipment, monitors and media storage devices. This is an excellent opportunity for camera rental houses, production companies, television companies, educational institutions and individuals to purchase this high-caliber, meticulously maintained equipment.\nAll the equipment is located in Los Angeles, CA and is available for immediate inspection and sale. Complete details and photos, as well as information about the sales process can be viewed at https://www.hilcoind.com/sale/clairmont-camera .\nPlease contact Brent Bonham at bbonham@hilcoglobal.com or +1 616.328.6890 for more info or to schedule an inspection.\nAbout Hilco Industrial: Hilco Industrial ( www.hilcoind.com ) provides industrial asset acquisition and disposition services, specializing in machinery, equipment and inventory auctions and negotiated sales.
