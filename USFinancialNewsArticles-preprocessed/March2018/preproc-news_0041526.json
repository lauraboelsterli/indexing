The logo of GM Korea is seen at its Bupyeong plant in Incheon, South Korea March 12, 2018. Picture taken March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji “My understanding is that there is tension (in the due diligence,” Vice Finance Minister Ko Hyoung-kwon told reporters after a meeting in Seoul. “In order to carry out due diligence, which is a difficult process, we need company information but I think (GM Korea) finds it difficult to share information about global strategies (with the KDB),” Ko said. The KDB, a major shareholder of GM Korea with a 17 percent stake, began due diligence on the automaker last week to decide whether to extend financial support to the loss-making operations of General Motors. This came after the company announced a restructuring of the unit and a closure of one of its plants. Reporting by Cynthia Kim; Editing by Paul Tait",
