    "text": "Tomas Jurco scored twice, and Collin Delia made 25 saves to win his abbreviated NHL debut as the Chicago Blackhawks rolled to a 6-2 victory over the visiting Winnipeg Jets on Thursday night at the United Center.\nPatrick Kane, Erik Gustafsson and Alex DeBrincat each had a goal and an assist, and Brandon Saad also scored for last-place Chicago, which won for the second time in the past three games.\nBryan Little and Mark Scheifele scored for the Jets, who already have clinched a spot in the playoffs. Winnipeg’s six-game winning streak ended.\nDelia filled in on short notice for Blackhawks goaltender Anton Forsberg, who was hurt while warming up before the game. Minus Forsberg, the team lined up amateur Scott Foster as an emergency backup.\nThe move to call up Foster proved necessary. Delia was forced to leave the game with an apparent leg injury with 14:01 left.\nThat meant Foster — a 36-year-old who played at Western Michigan more than a decade ago — stepped in to make his NHL debut. The Ontario native stopped all seven shots he faced and was swarmed by grinning teammates after the final horn sounded.\nJets goaltender Eric Comrie turned aside 36 shots in the loss.\nKane started the scoring 3:44 after the opening faceoff. He streaked down the ice on a three-on-two break and snapped a wrist shot for his 27th goal.\nChicago increased its lead to 2-0 when Saad scored with 2:43 to go in the first period.\nJurco scored back-to-back goals in the second period to put the Blackhawks on top 4-0. Artem Anisimov earned an assist on Jurco’s first goal, and Gustafsson set up the next goal with a rush from the blue line.\nWinnipeg snapped the shutout with 5:36 left in the second period. Dustin Byfuglien blasted a slap shot that Little redirected past Delia.\nGustafsson scored to make it 5-1 with 2:33 to go in the second period.\nLess than 90 seconds later, Scheifele buried a one-timer to pull the Jets within three goals.\nDeBrincat matched Kane for best on the Blackhawks with 27 goals to make it 6-2 early in the third period.\nBlackhawks defenseman Brent Seabrook played in his 1,000th career game. He is one of only five players to appear in 1,000 games for the team, joining Stan Mikita (1,394), Bobby Hull (1,036), Eric Nesterenko (1,013) and Bob Murray (1,008).\n—Field Level Media\n ",
