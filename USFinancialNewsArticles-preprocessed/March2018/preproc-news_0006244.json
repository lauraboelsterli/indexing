    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder rights law firm Johnson Fistel, LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLCM) (\"Bellicum\") on behalf of all purchasers of common stock during the period between May 8, 2017 and January 30, 2018, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Bellicum focuses on discovering and developing novel cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of hematological cancers, solid tumors, and orphan inherited blood disorders.\nIf you wish to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 9, 2018. If you wish to discuss this action, have any questions concerning this notice, or your rights or interests, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471. If you email, please include your phone number. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.\nThe complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse information. Specifically, defendants made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) a substantial undisclosed risk of encephalopathy was associated with the Company's lead product candidate BPX-501; and (2) as a result, Bellicum's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn January 30, 2018, after the market closed, Bellicum issued a press release announcing that it had ''received notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that U.S. studies of BPX-501 have been placed on a clinical hold following three cases of encephalopathy deemed as possibly related to BPX-501.''\nOn this news, the price of Bellicum stock declined nearly 26%, on January 31, 2018.\nPlaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Bellicum common stock during the Class Period.\nAbout Johnson Fistel, LLP:\nJohnson Fistel, LLP is a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm with offices in California, New York and Georgia.
