    "text": "IRVINE, California, March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nShiftPixy, Inc. (NASDAQ: PIXY), ShiftPixy's highly disruptive self-delivery proposition for QSR restaurant operators is a big opportunity in the rapidly expanding third-party delivery boom. Scott Absher, ShiftPixy's Co-Founder and CEO, commented that \"when we asked our QSR operator clients why they would surrender their brand, their customer experience and their customer data to a third party and give up their hard-earned revenue the stories tumbled out.\" ShiftPixy's cutting-edge technology and approach to human capital management allows the company a unique window into the daily demands of QSR operators and the ability to extend its technology and engagement to enable this unique self-delivery proposition.\nShiftPixy's new driver management layer for operators in the ShiftPixy ecosystem will now allow clients to use their own team members to deliver a brand intended customer experience. ShiftPixy has taken the compliance, management and insurance issues related to the support of a delivery option and created a turn key self-delivery opportunity. This first ever approach allows ShiftPixy clients to enjoy the income growth from delivery and preserve their customer experience and their brand. \"This changes the game in a big way.\" Scott W. Absher, ShiftPixy's Co-Founder and CEO, stated that \"we listened to the pain our operator clients described and saw we could leverage our ecosystem to make it simple for our clients to take on the growth opportunity that self-delivery represents for their business and not give up 30% of their sale to a third-party delivery operator.\"\nLearn More\nTo discover the power of ShiftPixy's self-delivery platform for your restaurant please select one of our convenient webinar timeslots at: https://www.shiftpixy.com/webinars/\nOr call us at 888-798-9200 to register.\nAbout ShiftPixy\nShiftPixy (NASDAQ: PIXY) is a disruptive human capital management platform, revolutionizing employment in the Gig Economy by delivering a next-gen mobile engagement technology to help businesses with shift-based employees navigate regulatory mandates, minimize administrative burdens and better connect with a ready-for-hire workforce.
