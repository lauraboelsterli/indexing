    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 2:14 AM / Updated 10 hours ago Australia's Stannard out of Games after 'one-punch' assault Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s rugby sevens captain James Stannard was ruled out of the Commonwealth Games with a fractured skull following a ‘one-punch’ attack in Sydney early on Friday after a farewell dinner for departing coach Andy Friend. \nNew South Wales Police said in a statement that a 22-year-old man had been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm after a 35-year-old man had been punched in an alleged “unprovoked” attack. \nRugby Australia (RA) later identified Stannard as the victim of the attack and said he was in hospital with a fractured skull. \n“He’s not available for the Commonwealth Games and that’s obviously a massive disappointment for all of us and James and his family,” RA high performance manager Ben Whitaker told reporters in Sydney. \n“We know that right now he needs some time to heal ... and then once that’s sorted, we’ll look at how he can return to play.” \nRA said Stannard and a group of players and team management had been at a fast-food outlet following the dinner for Friend when the alleged attack occurred. \nTwo players in the squad, including regular captain Lewis Holland, and Friend detained the man shortly afterwards and held him until police arrived, RA said. \nFriend was told earlier this month that his contract with the team would not be renewed in July, but RA said they hoped he would remain with the wider organisation. \nAustralia’s women’s Olympic gold-medal winning coach Tim Walsh will replace Friend after next month’s Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. \n“We had an organised function to celebrate and recognise the role Andy Friend has played with the team,” Whitaker added. \n“Family and friends, players, staff all gathered for dinner and went out afterwards. \n“They were all together and there was management involved the whole night, so it was a very civilised, organised event.” \nStannard had replaced the injured Holland as captain for the tournament. \nThe men’s tournament will be held on the final two days of the April 4-15 Games, with Australia drawn in Pool B with Samoa, Jamaica and England.
