    "text": "0 COMMENTS Cracks are forming in the industrial metals resurgence that sent copper prices 31% higher last year —a sign that investor conviction in the rosy economic outlook that has underpinned gains in risky assets is weakening.\nA booming metals rally has partly reversed in 2018. Copper futures have fallen 4.3% to $3.14 a pound. That’s after prices hit a near four-year high in December following a historic 16-day winning streak.\nSome worry that an economic slowdown in China could spread to other countries, cooling demand for a number of raw materials. Prices for zinc and lead have also fallen lately. These metals tend to be sensitive to risk appetite and sentiment in markets because they are used to build everything from automobiles to smartphones.\n“There’s cracks in this metals rally. That’s definitely a concern for our macro view,” said Tyler Richey, co-editor of investment research publication the Sevens Report.\nHedge funds and other speculative investors also have turned more cautious on copper, considered a barometer for industrial metals broadly because it is the most widely traded.\nThey recently pushed net bets on higher prices to their lowest level since May, after wagers hit an all-time high in the fall, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.\nDane Davis, a commodities analyst at Barclays, projects copper prices will fall to roughly $2.90 in the second half of the year.\n“While [global growth] does argue for a higher copper price, not as high as we’ve seen,” he said.\nAdding to concerns are the potential repercussions from President Donald Trump’s planned steel and aluminum tariffs, which have stoked fears of a trade war.\nSome investors worry that higher input costs will lead to slower economic growth as it becomes more expensive to manufacture goods. A trade war could also hurt China, the world’s largest consumer of industrial metals.\n“Investors are right to think commodities…can track the temperature of the protectionist risk,” said Jorge Mariscal, emerging-markets chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management. “The prospect that [a trade war] becomes a reality is certainly one of the major risks to the global recovery.”\nGlobal steel and aluminum prices have actually fallen this year, even as U.S. prices for the metals have climbed on the back of Mr. Trump’s pledge—signaling to some analysts that concerns about demand growth and supply disruptions will likely continue dictating prices.\nThe global benchmark for steel futures—steel-rebar contracts traded in Shanghai—has fallen 6.2% in 2018. Meanwhile, the price for U.S. hot-rolled coil steel has climbed to the highest level in almost seven years.\nAluminum futures contracts on the London Metal Exchange are down about 4.3%. The U.S. Midwest Aluminum Premium, which measures the cost to get immediate delivery of the metal from warehouses, has risen to its highest level since April 2015.\nWhen metals prices jumped last year, investors may have inflated the role of global growth as the reason, while underestimating the influence of supply disruptions and other market forces, some analysts say.\nChinese environmental regulations and mining labor disputes have affected prices, said Nicholas Johnson, a portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. who helps manage about $15 billion in commodities investments.\n“You just need to be wary of equating an increase in commodity prices to a strong global demand story, because it can also be a supply story,” Mr. Johnson said.\nInvestors chasing higher yields have also wagered on base metals. Now, with borrowing costs and bond yields potentially rising, they could pull money out of those investments.\nRecent data have shown the pace of growth in China’s manufacturing activity slowed sharply in February, as demand for Chinese exports waned. The country’s official manufacturing purchasing managers index dropped to its lowest level in 19 months , though a private gauge showed activity in China’s factories expanded at a slightly faster rate .\nThe driver behind Chinese slowdown fears is that “you’re going to get a contagion effect,” Mr. Richey said. “It’s going to start slowing other major economies.”\nWrite to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com",
