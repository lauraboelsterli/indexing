    "text": "LE BOURGET, France, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Dassault Aviation launched a new luxury jet on Wednesday, replacing a cancelled project as the global business jet market starts to recover from a prolonged recession.\nThe Falcon 6X will be able to fly from London to Los Angeles, Chief Executive Eric Trappier told journalists at a business aerodrome outside Paris.\nDassault launched the plane two months after scrapping its large-cabin Falcon 5X model, citing problems over a three-year delay in the Silvercrest engine developed by Safran.\nThe aircraft announced on Wednesday will instead be powered by PW800 engines from Pratt & Whitney Canada.
