    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 9:46 AM / Updated an hour ago More than 150,000 people in Syria's Afrin displaced - Kurdish official, monitor Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BEIRUT (Reuters) - More than 150,000 people have been displaced in the last few days from Syriaâ€™s Afrin town, a senior Kurdish official and a monitoring group said on Saturday. People sit in a truck with their belongings in the north east of Afrin, Syria March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi Hevi Mustafa, a top member of the civil authority governing the Afrin region, said people were fleeing the main town to other Kurdish-held parts of the region and to government territory. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said Turkish warplanes and artillery struck the town overnight, and at least 150,000 had fled since Wednesday.
