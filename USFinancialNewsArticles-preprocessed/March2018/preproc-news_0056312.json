    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 5:14 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago Rusty Staub, a fan favourite for two decades in baseball, dies at 73 Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Rusty Staub, a beloved slugger dubbed “Le Grand Orange” by fans of the Montreal Expos and later embraced as a team leader of the New York Mets, died on Thursday at age 73 after a 23-year Major League Baseball career and a retirement devoted to charity.

REUTERS/Ray Stubblebine \nHis death at a Florida hospital, which came on baseball’s opening day for the 2018 season, was confirmed by the Mets, with whom the left-handed-hitting outfielder did two tours of duty in the 1970s and 1980s. \nStaub, who had been in failing health in recent years, was awarded spots on six All-Star teams over a career with five teams in which he compiled a solid .279 batting average, with 2,716 base hits, 292 home runs and 1,466 runs batted in. \nBut it is the quirky distinctions that devoted baseball fans remember most.

REUTERS/Ray Stubblebine \nAt 6 foot 2 inches (188 cm) and 200 pounds (91 kilograms) during his playing days, Staub had some of his best years as a member of the Montreal Expos, who later became the Washington Nationals. In homage to his size, big bat and ginger hair, French-speaking Montreal fans affectionately called him “Le Grand Orange.” \nHe was one of only three players to hit home runs in the big leagues before turning 20 and after turning 40 (Ty Cobb and Gary Sheffield were the others). He also tied a record set by Dave Philley in 1958 by getting eight consecutive base hits as a pinch hitter while playing with the Mets in 1983.

He played in Houston for six seasons. \nBesides the Expos, Astros and Mets, Staub also spent four seasons with the Detroit Tigers and one with the Texas Rangers.
