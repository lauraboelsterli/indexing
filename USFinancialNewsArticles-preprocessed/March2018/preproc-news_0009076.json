    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- VOXX International Corporation (NASDAQ: VOXX), a leading manufacturer and distributor of automotive and consumer technologies for global markets, today appointed Edward D. Mas President of VOXX Automotive, the business unit responsible for developing and distributing innovative solutions for many of the world's largest automotive OEMs and to the automotive aftermarket.\n\"Ed is a seasoned industry veteran with a proven record of success in product development, manufacturing, financial management, operations and bringing out the best in people,\" said Patrick Lavelle, President and CEO of VOXX International. \"This well-deserved promotion reflects our faith in Ed to take VOXX Automotive to the next level in terms of innovation, market leadership and overall business performance. It also serves as a clear signal to the automotive market and our customers, of our heightened commitment to deliver brand-enhancing products and systems.\"\nHeadquartered in Orlando, Florida, VOXX Automotive is the combination of the automotive OEM assets of Invision Automotive Systems, Inc. and Code Systems, Inc., as well as VOXX Electronics Corporation, along with certain assets of VOXX International (which includes company-owned brands and products, together with third-party solutions distributed through the Company's extensive 12-volt and retail distribution networks). Within the OEM segment, the Company provides next-generation rear seat infotainment systems, ultra-range remote start and security solutions, and seamless vehicle access products. OEM customers include Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, KIA, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, and Toyota, among others. Automotive aftermarket products distributed by VOXX include similar solutions to its OEM offerings as well as satellite radio, car audio, smart phone telematics, automotive security, power accessories, rear observation and collision avoidance systems, e-fob-type remote start/security systems, and power lift gates, among others.\nMas has worked in the automotive arena for two decades and has enjoyed a 30-year career; four years at VOXX Automotive as Executive Vice President, 11 years with Invision Automotive Systems, and 16 years at Panasonic Automotive Systems. While with Panasonic, he served as head of manufacturing where, among other successes, he improved production efficiency and quality, and boosted performance of a complex, global supply chain.\n\"It is with honor and humility that I assume the full leadership of VOXX Automotive,\" Mas said. \"I look forward to drawing on my 20 years of experience across the spectrum of automotive electronics in product, quality, financial, operational and supply chain management to advance VOXX Automotive to preferred OEM status and a greater share of the auto aftermarket.\n\"In my view, I would not be getting this promotion were it not for the truly great leadership team working with me. They are solid pros with broad and deep automotive experience, including Tier 1 OEMs, able to effectively pursue emerging markets and create disruptive technologies.\"\nOne of Mas' first tasks in his new role will be to discover and design, operational and sales synergies to drive growth and enhance efficiencies throughout VOXX Automotive operations. Along with its top position in rear seat infotainment, the Company is a leader in remote start products, wireless entry systems and other advanced products. Mas added, \"I look forward to identifying and maximizing opportunities in areas like electric vehicles and autonomous cars, to name just two, that can come about through collaboration between our OEM and aftermarket teams.\"\nThe latest example of VOXX Automotive's ability to create market-altering technologies and products is its Evolution Series (EVO) Rear Seat Infotainment Solution. EVO was recently honored at the 2018 North American International Auto Show as the winner of the Connected Car category of the prestigious Planet M Awards, a program that recognizes innovations in mobility platforms and technologies. EVO brings a smart home television experience into the car, requiring only power/ground connections. It is enjoyed by drivers and passengers of Ford's 2018 Explorer and Lincoln Navigator as well as General Motors' 2018 Chevrolet Transverse and Equinox and its GMC Terrain with other OEMs launching over the next year.\nMas will continue to be based at VOXX International's Orlando, Florida headquarters and will report to Pat Lavelle.\nAbout VOXX International Corporation\nVOXX International Corporation (NASDAQ: VOXX) has grown into a worldwide leader in the Automotive, Consumer Electronics, Consumer Accessories and Premium Audio industries.
