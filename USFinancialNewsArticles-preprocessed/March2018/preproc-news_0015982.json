    "text": "COLUMBIA, Md., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Mexico Fund, Inc. (NYSE:MXF) announced that the Board of Directors (Board) changed the quarterly distribution from $0.13 per share to $0.15 per share, representing an increase of 15.4%. Accordingly, the Board declared a distribution of $0.15 per share to stockholders of record on April 19, 2018, which is payable in cash on April 27, 2018.\nUnder the Fund’s Managed Distribution Plan (MDP), the Fund pays quarterly distributions of $0.15 per share. The Board has ratified the continuation of the Fund’s MDP during 2018. The Board may amend or terminate the MDP at any time without prior notice to stockholders. Since the implementation of the MDP in September 2008, the Fund has paid a total of $22.30 per share in cash distributions to stockholders.\nThe amount of distributable income for each fiscal period depends on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Fund during the entire year. Distributions may consist of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital, but the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the Fund’s fiscal year.\nHowever, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Fund is required to indicate the source of each distribution to stockholders. The following table sets forth (A) an estimate of the source of the April 2018 distribution and (B) an estimate of the source of distributions for the current fiscal year:\nDistribution Estimates April 2018 Fiscal Year-to-date ( YTD) 1 Source Per Share\nAmount Percent of\nCurrent\nDistribution Per Share\nAmount Percent of Fiscal\nYear Distributions Net Investment Income - - - - Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains - - - - Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains - - - - Return of Capital $0.1500 100.00% $0.2800 100.00% Total Distribution $ 0.1500 100.00 % $ 0.2800 100.00 % Information regarding the Fund’s performance and distribution rates is set forth below:\nAverage Annual Total Return for the 5-year period ended on February 28, 2018 2 (3.15 )% Current Annualized Distribution Rate (current fiscal year) 3 2.16 % Current Fiscal Year Cumulative Total Return 4 2.36 % Cumulative Distribution Rate (current fiscal year) 5 0.71 % 1 The Fund’s current fiscal year began on November 1, 2017.\n2 Average Annual Total Return represents the simple arithmetic average of the Annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the last five years. Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV over a year including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions.\n3 The Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Cumulative Distribution Rate as of February 28, 2018, annualized as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV at the same date.\n4 Current Fiscal Year Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV from November 1, 2017, through February 28, 2018, including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions.\n5 Cumulative Distribution Rate for the Fund’s current fiscal period (November 1, 2017, through February 28, 2018) measured on the dollar value of distributions in the period as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV as of February 28, 2018.\nYou should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s MDP.\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported above are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report the distribution for federal income tax purposes.\nFor further information, contact the Fund’s Investor Relations office at +52-55-9138-3350, or by email at investor-relations@themexicofund.com .\nThe Mexico Fund, Inc. is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company with the investment objective of long-term capital appreciation through investments in securities, primarily equity, listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange.
