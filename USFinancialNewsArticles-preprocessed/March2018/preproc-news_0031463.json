    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 4:51 PM / Updated an hour ago First relegation looms ever closer as Hamburg lose again Reuters Staff 2 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - A first ever Bundesliga relegation for league ever-presents Hamburg SV edged a bit closer on Saturday after they lost 2-1 at home against Hertha Berlin to stay anchored in 17th place. Soccer Football - Bundesliga - Hamburger SV vs Hertha BSC - Volksparkstadion, Hamburg, Germany - March 17, 2018 Hertha Berlin fans REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer Hamburg, the only club to have played in the Bundesliga every season since the league’s creation in 1963, are seven points away from the relegation playoff spot occupied by Mainz 05, with just seven games left. They have won only four Bundesliga games all season. Slideshow (8 Images) Everything looked to be going well for the former European champions and their new coach Christian Titz when Douglas Santos put them ahead in the 25th minute. But Hertha struck twice in the space of seven minutes in the second half, with goals from Valentino Lazaro and Salomon Kalou, to snatch the three points. Eintracht Frankfurt boosted their chances of a top-four finish — and Champions League action next season — with a 3-0 victory over Mainz to climb to fourth on 45 points. League leaders Bayern Munich could seal their sixth straight title on Sunday with a win at RB Leipzig but they need Schalke 04, in second, to drop points against VfL Wolfsburg later on Saturday and for third-placed Borussia Dortmund to draw or lose against Hanover 96 on Sunday.
