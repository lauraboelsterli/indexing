(NASDAQ:PFIE), a technology company (the “Company”) which designs, installs and services burner and chemical management solutions in the oil and gas industry, today reported financial results for fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. A conference call will be held on Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 1:00 p.m. EST to discuss the results.\nFiscal 2017 Highlights\nRevenues Increased 86% Year-Over-Year to $38.2 Million Net Income of $4.4 Million or $0.09 Per Share Gross Profit Increased to just over $20 Million or 53% of Total Revenues Cash and Liquid Investments at Year End Were in Excess of $24 Million Remained Debt-Free\nFiscal Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenues increased to $38.2 million for the year which is an 86% increase from the previous 12-month period. Total revenues for 2017 mark Profire’s second-best revenue year in Company history.\nIn the year Profire maintained its cost management strategy and total operating expenses were up only 18% to $13.4 million, over the previous 12-month period.\nGross profit increased to roughly $20 million or 53% of total revenues, as compared to $10.4 million or 51% of total revenues in the prior 12-month period.\nCompared with the same 12-month period in the previous year, operating expenses for general and administrative increased 16%, R&D increased 72%, and depreciation decreased 16%.\nNet income was $4.4 million or a gain of $0.09 per share, compared to a net loss of $686,000 or a loss of $0.01 per share in the previous 12-month period.\nCash and liquid investments totaled over $24 million at the end of the year and the Company continues to operate debt-free.\nManagement Commentary\n“Many factors contributed to the increase in revenue, including the growing customer base and our focus on providing superior products and solutions to our customers” stated Ryan Oviatt, CFO of Profire. “This significant net income increase is attributable to our staff’s hard work to grow revenue while keeping cost growth under control. However, we believe our ongoing committed investment in R&D will ensure we remain a market leader for technology and automation in the oil and gas industry.”\n“Throughout the year we were able to outpace the industry recovery by almost four times. In 2017 the average oil price per barrel rose 18% compared to our increased revenues of 86%,” said Brenton Hatch, President and CEO of Profire Energy. “With input from our customers we are constantly developing new technologies to bring to the market place and expand automation in the oil field. We will continue to leverage our growing customer base to increase revenues. We remain optimistic for 2018.”\nConference Call\nProfire Energy’s President and CEO Brenton Hatch and CFO Ryan Oviatt will host the presentation, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Thursday, March 8, 2018 Time: 1:00 p.m. EST (11:00 a.m. MST) Toll-free dial-in number: 1-877-705-6003 International dial-in number: 1-201-493-6725 The conference call will be webcast live and available for replay via this link: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=128636.
