The final determination of taxable income for each year, as well as the tax attributes for dividends in such year, will be made after the close of the tax year.\nCapital Southwest maintains a dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") that provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of its registered stockholders who hold their shares with Capital Southwest’s transfer agent and registrar, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company. Under the DRIP, if the Company declares a dividend, registered stockholders who have opted in to the DRIP by the dividend record date will have their dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of Capital Southwest common stock.\nAbout Capital Southwest\nCapital Southwest Corporation (Nasdaq:CSWC) is a Dallas, Texas-based, internally managed Business Development Company with approximately $299 million in net assets as of December 31, 2017.
