Specifically, our development activities with various biotechnology and medical device companies continued to move forward, as planned. Of note, during the fourth quarter of 2017 and through the first quarter of 2018, we were pleased to have supplied both first and repeat orders of our rhCollagen-based BioInk to a leading, multinational biotechnology company, for the development of organs bioprinting technology. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we also initiated development of a 3D‑bioprinted orthopedic implant prototype, leveraging our rhCollagen‑based BioInk, for a leading medical device company,\" said Yehiel Tal, CollPlant's Chief Executive Officer.\n\"During the first quarter of 2018, we were honored to announce that CollPlant is part of the Regenerative Medicine Development Organization's (ReMDO) advanced biomanufacturing initiative for the development of a universal BioInk with tunable properties for 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs. This important bioink initiative includes 18 leading research and industry organizations, as well as thought leaders in the field of 3D bioprinting, specializing in printing technologies, biomaterials and application research,\" noted Mr. Tal.\n\"During the past year, CollPlant expanded its activities within the aesthetic field with the development of a next generation of dermal fillers based on our rhCollagen. We are now actively pursuing collaborations with key companies in this field,\" added Mr. Tal.\n\"Additionally, during 2017, we continued to penetrate the European market with sales of our two first products, Vergenix™STR for the treatment of tendinopathy, and Vergenix™FG, a wound filler, for treatment of acute and chronic wounds. Over time, we have received positive feedback from physicians who have treated patients with both of these products and we are working to continue to penetrate the market. We are pleased to note, that, recently, Arthrex GmbH, which distributes our Vergenix™ STR product in combination with its ACP-Tendo, presented promising treatment results based on a European case series, including patients with injuries involving the rotator cuff, Achilles tendon, Perneal tendon, Tibialis tendon and Common extensor tendon,\" concluded Mr. Tal.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were NIS 952,000 ($275,000), an increase of 375% compared to NIS 200,000 ($58,000) for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was NIS 900,000 ($260,000), an increase of 348% compared to NIS 200,000 ($58,000) in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nResearch and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017, net of participations, were NIS 2.98 million ($859,000), an increase of 42% compared to NIS 2.11 million ($608,000) for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGeneral, administrative and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were NIS 4.11 million ($1.19 million), a decrease of 19% compared to NIS 5.04 million ($1.45 million) for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was NIS 6.19 million ($1.78), an increase of 11% compared to NIS 6.95 million ($2.00 million) for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company posted a comprehensive loss of NIS 5.91 million ($1.70 million), or NIS 0.04 ($0.01) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of NIS 7.05 million ($2.03 million), or NIS 0.07 ($0.02) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues from sale of VergenixFG, VergenixSTR, and our Bioink in the year ended December 31, 2017 were NIS 1.67 million ($481,000), an increase of 472%, compared to NIS 292,000 ($84,000) in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGross profit for the year 2017 was NIS 1.62 million ($466,000), an increase of 455% compared to NIS 292,000 ($84,000) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expenses for year 2017, net of participations, were NIS 14.07 million ($4.06 million), a decrease of 16% compared to NIS 16.79 million ($4.84 million) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral, administrative and marketing expenses for the year 2017 were NIS 8.30 million ($2.39 million), a decrease of 25% compared to NIS 11.05 million ($3.19 million) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating loss for the year 2017 was NIS 20.75 million ($5.99 million), a decrease of 25% compared to NIS 27.54 million ($7.94 million) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nComprehensive loss was NIS 20.88 million ($6.02 million), or NIS 0.16 ($0.05) per share, for the year 2017 compared to a net loss of NIS 27.89 million ($8.04 million), or NIS 0.28 ($0.08) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of NIS 17.82 million ($5.14 million), compared to NIS 3.80 million ($1.10 million) as of December 31, 2016.
