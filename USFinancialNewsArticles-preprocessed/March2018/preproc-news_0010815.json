    "text": "SAO PAULO, March 5 (Reuters) - Ilan Goldfajn, chief of Brazil’s central bank, said on Monday that inflation was slower than expected, but a decision on whether to continue cutting interest rates will only come at the next meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee later this month.\nGoldfajn said in a morning radio interview he has not been tapped to replace Henrique Meirelles as finance minister if the incumbent leaves his post to run in the October elections.
