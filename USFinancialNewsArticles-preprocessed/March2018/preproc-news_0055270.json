    "text": "- Revenue for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2018 Increased to $340 Million -\n- GAAP EPS for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2018 was $0.08 and Adjusted EPS was ($0.10) -\n- Company Announces Modeling Assumptions for Fiscal 2019 -\nWEST FARGO, N.D., March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Titan Machinery Inc. (Nasdaq:TITN), a leading network of full-service agricultural and construction equipment stores, today reported financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year ended January 31, 2018.\nDavid Meyer, Titan Machinery’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We were well positioned to capture the anticipated fiscal fourth quarter acceleration in Agriculture sales activity due to better than anticipated crop yields in our footprint and the resulting improvement in grower sentiment. As a result of our improved inventory position, we continue to experience increased equipment margins compared to the prior year. In addition, fiscal full year 2018 performance was highlighted by reduced operating expenses and a more efficient operating structure due to the completion of our restructuring efforts. We are pleased with the overall business improvements we achieved in fiscal 2018 and believe these enhancements set the foundation for stronger top and bottom line results in fiscal 2019.\"\nFiscal 2018 Fourth Quarter Results\nConsolidated Results\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue was $339.6 million, compared to revenue of $317.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. Equipment sales were $252.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $226.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Parts sales were $45.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $48.7 million in the fourth quarter last year. Revenue generated from service was $26.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $28.0 million in the fourth quarter last year. Revenue from rental and other was $15.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $14.0 million in the fourth quarter last year.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 increased to $52.1 million compared to $48.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. The Company's gross profit margin was relatively flat at 15.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to 15.4% in the fourth quarter last year. Gross profit margin remained relatively flat as the impact of higher equipment margins was offset by a change in our gross profit mix, which was the result of additional equipment revenue as compared to higher margin parts and service revenue.\nOperating expenses were $50.3 million or 14.8% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $52.2 million or 16.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter last year. Restructuring efforts that were completed in fiscal 2018 are expected to continue to reduce operating expenses on a going forward basis.\nFloorplan interest expense decreased to $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $2.7 million for the same period last year. The decrease in floorplan interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in the level of interest-bearing inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, net income including noncontrolling interest was $1.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a net loss including noncontrolling interest of $8.2 million, or $0.38 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOn an adjusted basis, net loss including noncontrolling interest for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss including noncontrolling interest of $6.6 million, or $0.31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The adjusted amount for fourth quarter of 2018 excludes a gain of $1.8 million that occurred as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") enacted on December 22, 2017 and a $2.4 million net benefit related to income tax valuation allowance adjustments.\nThe Company generated $6.1 million in adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nSegment Results\nAgriculture Segment - Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $205.3 million, compared to $201.1 million in the fourth quarter last year. Pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.2 million, compared to pre-tax loss of $5.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.0 million, compared to an adjusted pre-tax loss of $4.8 million in the fourth quarter last year.\nConstruction Segment - Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $85.8 million, compared to $81.7 million in the fourth quarter last year. Pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $3.2 million, compared to a pre-tax loss of $4.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.6 million, compared to $3.0 million in the fourth quarter last year.\nInternational Segment - Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $48.5 million, compared to $34.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. Pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.1 million, compared to pre-tax loss of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.1 million, compared to $0.1 million in the fourth quarter last year.\nFiscal 2018 Full Year Results\nRevenue was flat at $1.2 billion for fiscal 2018 and the prior year. Net loss including noncontrolling interest for fiscal 2018 was $7.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to net loss including noncontrolling interest of $14.5 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the prior year. Adjusted net loss including noncontrolling interest for fiscal 2018 was $2.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $14.2 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the prior year. The adjusted figure for fiscal 2018 excludes $10.5 million of restructuring expenses associated with our fiscal 2018 restructuring plan, which is partially offset by the aforementioned tax benefits related to the Tax Act and income tax valuation allowance adjustments that were recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company generated adjusted EBITDA of $30.8 million in fiscal 2018, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $11.7 million in fiscal 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nThe Company ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 with $53.4 million of cash. The Company’s equipment inventory level increased to $400.0 million as of January 31, 2018, compared to $395.7 million as of January 31, 2017. As of January 31, 2018, the Company had $247.4 million outstanding floorplan payables, on $728.1 million total discretionary floorplan lines of credit, which represents an increase of $14.2 million over the balance of $233.2 million in floorplan payables as of January 31, 2017. The Company had other indebtedness consisting of senior convertible notes and other long-term debt of $99.0 million as of January 31, 2018, which was a decrease of $29.1 million compared to the balance of $128.1 million as of January 31, 2017. The Company's ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth was 1.4 as of January 31, 2018.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company repurchased $30.1 million in face value amount of its senior convertible notes with $29.5 million in cash. The Company has retired $84.4 million, or approximately 56%, of the original face value amount of its senior convertible notes during fiscal 2017 and 2018 with $75.1 million in cash.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities was $95.8 million. The Company evaluates its cash flow from operating activities net of all floorplan payable activity and maintaining a constant level of equity in its equipment inventory. Taking these adjustments into account, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $45.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, compared to $88.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017.\nMr. Meyer concluded, \"The stabilization we are experiencing in the Agriculture market both domestically and internationally, combined with our improved inventory condition and recently completed restructuring plan, have our Company well positioned for long-term profitable growth. I’m pleased to introduce a fiscal 2019 forecast that expects revenue growth across all segments, margin expansion, and positive diluted earnings per share.\"\nFiscal 2019 Modeling Assumptions\nThe following are the Company’s current expectations for certain fiscal 2019 modeling assumptions:\nAssumptions Segment Revenue Agriculture Up 0-5% Construction Up 3-8% International Up 0-5% Equipment Margin 7.8 - 8.3% Diluted EPS $0.35 - $0.55 Conference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 7:30 a.m. Central time (8:30 a.m. Eastern time).

The Ukrainian hryvnia remained relatively stable subsequent to April 30, 2016 and therefore did not significantly impact our consolidated statement of operations during this period. Absent any future significant hryvnia volatility and resulting financial statement impact, we will not include Ukraine remeasurement losses in our adjusted amounts in future periods. (2) The tax effect of adjustments was calculated using a 33.8% tax rate for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 and a 35.0% tax rate for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 for all U.S. related items, which was determined based on the federal statutory rate applicable to the respective fiscal year and no impact for state taxes given our valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets. No tax effect was recognized for foreign related items as all adjustments occurred in foreign jurisdictions that have full valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. (3) For all fiscal years, amounts reflect the initial valuation allowance recognized for all deferred tax assets for which no previous valuation allowance existed. In addition, for fiscal 2018, the amount includes the benefit recognized from the release of the valuation allowance on our Ukrainian deferred tax assets, net of the incremental valuation allowance recognized as a result of restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2018.\n(4) Adjustments are net of the impact of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests and allocated to participating securities.\nSource:Titan Machinery Inc.",
