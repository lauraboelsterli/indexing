If we layer that on top of the U.S. story, there is a contrast,” she added.\nThe dollar index climbed to 90.868, with Powell’s optimism on the economy in public testimony to Congress suggesting the U.S. central bank is going to raise interest rates one more time than the three hikes markets had expected.\n“Hawkish comments from Powell have fuelled market speculation of the Federal Reserve raising U.S. interest rates four times this year — ultimately supporting the dollar,” said Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM.\n“Market expectations of higher U.S. rates could intensify further if the new Fed head doubles down on hawkish comments.”\nPowell will continue his testimony later in the day.\nThe dollar index is still down 1.5 percent this year, dogged by suspicions that the Trump administration prefers a weaker dollar to mend its bulging trade deficit. Worries that Trump’s big tax cuts and spending plans may boost fiscal deficits to the extent that they undermine confidence in U.S. debt have also dragged on the greenback.\nThe Australian dollar hit a two-month trough versus the dollar and a nine-month low versus the yen after data on Australian business investment missed forecasts.\nThe Aussie traded 0.5 percent down at $0.7725, having briefly fallen to as low as $0.7717.
