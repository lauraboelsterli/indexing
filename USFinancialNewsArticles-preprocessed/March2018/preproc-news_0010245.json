(OTC Pink: PCLB), today announced Pinnacle’s results of operations for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017:\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Pinnacle reported net income of $597,000, compared to $512,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net interest income before the provision for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $1,819,000, compared with $1,791,000 in the same period last year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $2,296,000, compared with net income of $2,284,000 in the prior year. Net interest income before the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $7,258,000, compared with $7,060,000 in the prior year. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, basic and diluted earnings were each $0.57 per share. For the same period in 2016, basic and diluted earnings were each $0.45 per share. Basic and diluted earnings were each $2.20 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. For 2016, basic and diluted earnings were each $1.99 per share.\nThe Company’s net interest margin was 3.63% and 3.55% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to 3.54% and 3.46% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2017, Pinnacle’s allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.68%, compared to 1.77% at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of nonperforming loans was 670.42%, compared to 471.72% at December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs were $10,000 in 2017, compared to net recoveries of $35,000 in the prior year. Nonperforming assets were $281,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to $344,000 at December 31, 2016. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans was .29% at December 31, 2017, compared to .38% at December 31, 2016.\nTotal deposits, excluding brokered certificate of deposits, increased 7.3% during 2017 as compared to 2.3% during 2016.

At December 31, 2017, total risk-based capital was 19.39% for the subsidiary bank. Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios for the subsidiary bank were 18.28% and 12.04%, respectively. All capital ratios are significantly higher than the requirements for a well-capitalized institution.\nDividends of $.11 and $.44 per share were paid to shareholders during the three months and year ended for December 31, 2017, and 2016.\nDespite the Company’s good financial performance during the last several years, Mr. Nolen cautioned investors that any negative changes to economic conditions could have an adverse effect on Pinnacle’s borrowers and their customers, which could adversely affect Pinnacle’s financial condition and results of operations.\nMr. Nolen stated: “Pinnacle continues to maintain strong regulatory capital. We are pleased with our net income and credit quality improvements which reflect the continued efforts of our Board and associates. We remain focused on our current strategies which are intended to provide superior services to customers in our market and enhance shareholder value. We also note that the current financial results during 2017 were minimally affected by the new tax law and that lower tax rates in future years should benefit the Company’s financial performance.”\nInformation contained in this press release, other than historical information, may be considered forward-looking in nature and is subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
