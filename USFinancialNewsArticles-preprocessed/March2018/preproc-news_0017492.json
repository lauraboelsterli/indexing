Output hit a record 10.057 million bpd in November, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\nBMI Research said in a note to clients on Tuesday that it had revised its 2018 Brent crude price forecast upward to $67 a barrel due to \"accelerated market rebalancing and strong sentiment-driven support\".\n\"We maintain that firming global demand and weaker supply growth will support crude prices over 2018,\" the note added.\nMeanwhile, Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said traders were waiting for U.S. crude inventories data. \"Expectations are for a further build - with an estimate of a build of around 2-1/2 million barrels ... so if anything, that would expect to add pressure on oil prices,\" McCarthy said.\nU.S. crude inventories were expected to rise by 3 million barrels in the week to March 2, marking a second straight week increase, according to a Reuters poll. Industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) is set to release its inventory data at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT) on Tuesday, and the U.S. Energy Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) is scheduled to report its data at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday.
