    "text": "6 COMMENTS Japanese billionaire Katsumi Tada has sold his apartment at Trump International Hotel & Tower in New York for $25 million, after almost two years on the market, according to people with knowledge of the deal.\nThe sale represents a small loss for Mr. Tada, a real-estate developer who bought the property for $26.022 million in 2008, property records show. He first listed it for $40 million in May 2016 but reduced the price several times, most recently to $27.5 million, according to listings website StreetEasy.com.\nThe listing agents, Howard Margolis, Marie Espinal and Jeff Adler of Douglas Elliman, declined to comment on the sale, but Elliman’s website showed the property was no longer available and a spokesman for the firm confirmed that it had closed.\nMr. Tada could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe unit measures approximately 6,360 square feet, with six bedrooms and six bathrooms, according to the listing. Features include a marble-floored foyer, black-lacquered and gold-leaf gilded doors and custom moldings and overhead lighting.\nMore Private Properties\nL.A.
