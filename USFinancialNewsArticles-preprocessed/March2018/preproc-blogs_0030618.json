The Democrats also released a 22-page status report on the investigation, listing lines of inquiry they feel should be pursued and more than 30 witnesses that have not been interviewed. Published 14 Hours Ago Reuters Mikhail Klimentyev | AFP | Getty Images US President Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin at the APEC leaders' summit on November 11, 2017. \nDemocratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee said on Tuesday they would keep investigating Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, despite a decision by Republicans on the panel to shut down the probe. \n\"We are going to do our best to continue our work. There are individuals who want to cooperate with our committee and share information, and will continue to do so,\" said representative Adam Schiff, the committee's top Democrat. \n\"We will be putting together a report that will set out for the country what evidence we have seen to date,\" he said. \nSchiff and other committee Democrats held a news conference a day after Republicans, who control Congress, said the full panel's investigation was over and they had found no evidence of collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign and Moscow's efforts to influence the vote. \nTrump has repeatedly denied collusion with Russia. Moscow denies meddling in the 2016 U.S. campaign. Schiff said he could say \"with confidence\" that there was significant evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. \nWhat I cannot say because I do not know what (U.S. Special Counsel) Bob Mueller knows is whether that evidence rises to the level beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy to violate U.S. election laws,\" Schiff said. \nMueller is conducting a criminal probe of Russia, the Trump campaign and the U.S. vote. \nThe Democrats also released a 22-page status report on the investigation, listing lines of inquiry they feel should be pursued and more than 30 witnesses the committee has still not interviewed. \nThey included Reince Priebus , a former Trump White House chief of staff, and former White House spokesman Sean Spicer, as well as Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who participated in a June 2016 meeting with Trump's son Donald Jr. and other close Trump associates. \nAmong the concerns in the status report were \"credible allegations as to the use of Trump properties to launder money by Russian oligarchs, criminals, and regime cronies.\" \nIt also questioned whether \"candidate Trump's financial exposure via Deutsche Bank or other private loans constituted a point of leverage that Russia may have exploited and may still be using?\" \nThe report said the committee should request related documents and hear testimony from Deutsche Bank, \"via subpoena if necessary,\" to evaluate such allegations. \nRepublican Representative Mike Conaway, who led the committee probe, seemed to walk back the Republicans' assertion that they had seen no evidence the Russians sought to help Trump and hurt his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. \nThe Republicans' statement on Monday contradicted the findings of the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation that the Russian effort sought to boost Trump. \nConaway told reporters the Russians had tried to hurt Clinton, but it was a matter of interpretation. \"Glass half full, glass half empty. You can pitch that either way,\" he said.",
