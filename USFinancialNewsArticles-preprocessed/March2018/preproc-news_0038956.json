FILE PHOTO: Former soccer player Rene Houseman, who played in the 1978 World Cup, shows a jersey next his former team mate Daniel Passarella (L) at the River Plate stadium in Buenos Aires June 25, 2013. REUTERS/Enrique Marcarian/File Photo Houseman, who was known as El Loco (The Madman) for his brilliant skills and rebellious nature, was diagnosed with tongue cancer last year. He spent most of his career at Huracan, winning a league title in 1973. He also enjoyed spells at River Plate, Colo Colo in Chile, and Independiente, amongst others. Houseman won 55 caps for Argentina, playing at both the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. “Extraordinary player,” former team mate Osvaldo Ardiles wrote on Twitter. “Unique. All the skill in the world. Brave. Fast. Off and on the field. Humble. Privilege to have played so many games alongside him.” Reporting by Andrew Downie, editing by Pritha Sarkar",
