    "text": "LANGLEY, U.K., March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Travelport Worldwide Limited (\"Travelport\") (NYSE: TVPT) announced today that its subsidiary, Travelport Corporate Finance PLC (the \"Issuer\"), priced its previously announced offering and upsized the offering from $650 million in aggregate principal amount to $745 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the \"Senior Secured Notes\"). The Senior Secured Notes will have a maturity date of March 15, 2026. The offering of the Senior Secured Notes is expected to close on or about March 16, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. The Senior Secured Notes were priced at 100%.\nThe Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed fully and unconditionally on a senior secured basis by Travelport Limited, the Issuer's immediate parent entity, and certain of Travelport Limited's existing and future wholly-owned subsidiaries that also guarantee Travelport's proposed new senior secured credit agreement (the \"New Senior Secured Credit Facilities\").\nAs previously announced, Travelport expects to use the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, together with borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and cash on hand, to repay borrowings under its existing credit agreement in full and pay fees and expenses related to the offering.\nThe Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nMajid Nazir\nHead of Investor Relations\nTel: +44 (0)1753 288 857\nmajid.nazir@travelport.com\nMedia:\nJulian Eccles\nVice President, PR and Corporate Communications\nTel: +44 (0)7720 409 374\njulian.eccles@travelport.com\nAbout Travelport\nTravelport (NYSE: TVPT) is the technology company that makes the experience of buying and managing travel continually better.
