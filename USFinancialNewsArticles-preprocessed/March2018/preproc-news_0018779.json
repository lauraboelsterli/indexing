    "text": "BURBANK, Calif., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Burbank, March 8, 2018: Imaging3, Inc. (OTCQB:IGNG), a development stage company targeting disruptive technologies in the medical imaging industry is pleased to announce the addition of Joe Biehl to serve as CFO.\n“Joe brings extensive C-level financial management experience working with companies at our stage of development, including the challenges that face rapidly growing companies, which we hope to test,” said CEO John Hollister.\nMr. Biehl is a seasoned, C-level, strategic, operations and finance executive with 20 years of experience in leading private, public, and nonprofit companies through growth, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs. He currently serves as CEO of CxCTeams, a provider of finance and accounting services exclusively to small businesses. Prior to implementing his current practice, Biehl served as an executive finance and operations officer of several larger public and private companies. He was the COO and CFO of Integrated Information Systems, a $100 million public IT consultancy corporation specializing in Microsoft custom application development solutions in Tempe, Arizona. He served as EVP and CFO for Sunstone Hotel Investors, a $300 million real estate investment trust, investing in and operating lodging assets, headquartered in San Clemente, California. He also served as the corporate controller for Starwood Lodging during its rapidly emerging growth phase. He has served as a director on a number of nonprofit boards including Native American Connections in Phoenix, Arizona. Joe is a graduate from the Brigham Young, Marriott School of Accountancy.\n“I look forward to supporting Imaging3 during this critical phase of their re-emergence from the past few years, ” said Mr. Biehl.\nAbout Imaging3 Inc.\nImaging3, Inc., founded in 1993, has developed a patented medical imaging technology, called the Dominion SmartScan™, which can produce real-time 3D x-ray images. The SmartScan technology has the potential to allow healthcare professionals to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures more quickly and accurately, resulting in higher throughput for the clinicians and fewer safety risks for the patient. In addition, Imaging3’s technology exposes patients to significantly less harmful radiation than current imaging technologies such as CT scans, which the company believes will allow scans to be used in many settings where there are concerns about radiation exposure. The technology also allows for greater portability, easier installation, and a significantly reduced cost burden for the healthcare system overall. Imaging3 is planning to submit a 510K application to the FDA during 2018 in order to gain marketing authorization for the SmartScan technology.\nVisit the company’s website at http://www.imaging3.com for detailed information about the company’s technology.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nImaging3 cautions you that any statement included in this press release that is not a description of historical facts is a forward-looking statement.
