    "text": "12 Hours Ago | 02:53 \nThe Chinese government's policies toward electric vehicles are becoming more selective recently, signaling a push for higher performing models and potentially accelerate industry development, noted an analyst at Wood Mackenzie. \nSo while there have been reports that state subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) could be cut soon , this isn't likely to slow down the momentum of the market there too much, Wood Mackenzie analyst Yujiao Lei told CNBC on Wednesday. \nShe explained: \"That could potentially slow a little bit, but not by a lot because what we are seeing in recent months is that while earlier policies are promoting all the EVs, recently, policies have become more selective.\" \n\"So, like the latest subsidies in 2018, it actually favors higher performing EVs rather than the lower end models,\" Lei explained. \nShe added that the dual subsidy scheme due to kick in later this year, will actually favor higher performing electric vehicles as well, and potentially accelerate the industry. \nThe dual credit scheme for EVs, slated to be implemented in April, is a credit-based policy that rewards or penalizes carmakers based on fuel consumption and driving range. Credits can be bought or sold within the market to meet the government's targets.

China has also overtaken the U.S. to become the world's largest EV market. Controlling road congestion \nMeanwhile, prospective electric car buyers in China may be affected by efforts to ease congestion. \n\"For mega-cities like Beijing and Shanghai , they don't only control the air pollution, but they also control the transport congestion. So they actually control the number of cars on the roads,\" Lei told CNBC. \nThe congestion problems in those mega-cities have seen purchasing and driving restrictions — usually reserved for traditional gasoline-powered cars — extended to EVs. \n\"In the past, we only had that for gasoline cars, but now, because more and more people want to buy EVs, it extended to EVs,\" Lei said.
