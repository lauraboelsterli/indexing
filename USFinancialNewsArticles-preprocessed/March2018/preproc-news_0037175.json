    "text": "QUEBEC CITY, March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Devonian Health Group Inc. (\" Devonian \" or the \" Corporation \") (TSX VENTURE:GSD) announces that the Board of Directors has approved the grant of options (the ‘‘Options’’) to purchase subordinate voting shares in the capital of the Corporation. Such options are exercisable at a price of $1.20 and for a period of five years from the date of grant. An aggregate of 250,000 options was granted to certain directors and consultants of the Corporation. Such options vest on the grant date.\nAbout Devonian\nDevonian is a late stage botanical pharmaceutical corporation with novel therapeutic approaches targeting unmet medical needs. Devonian's core strategy is to develop prescription botanical drugs. This strategy is supported by US-FDA set of regulatory guidelines favouring a more efficient drug development pathway versus traditional prescription medicines. Devonian is based on a broad-based platform originating from over ten years of research. This platform provides a unique process of extraction, purification, stabilization and conditioning of a molecular complex responsible for the photosynthetic process in plants and algae: The Supra Molecular Complex Extraction and Stabilisation Technology (SUPREX). \"Thykamine™\" is the first product issued from this platform. The potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities of \"Thykamine™\" have been demonstrated in several pre-clinical experiments as well as in a clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate distal ulcerative colitis. The product is now moving into large phase II clinical trials in two therapeutic areas: Ulcerative Colitis and Atopic Dermatitis. While the development of prescription botanical drugs is its core business, Devonian is also involved in the development of high value derma-cosmeceutical products as part of a secondary strategy to generate short-term revenues and optimize manufacturing efficiency.\nFor more information about Devonian Health Group Inc., visit www.groupedevonian.com .\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements about Devonian's objectives, strategies and businesses that involve risks and uncertainties.
