    "text": "BEIJING, March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Phoenix New Media Limited (NYSE: FENG) (\"Phoenix New Media\", \"ifeng\" or the \"Company\"), a leading new media company in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We are very pleased to deliver better-than-expected financial results, and we are especially encouraged by the strong growth in our advertising revenues,\" stated Mr. Shuang Liu, CEO of Phoenix New Media, \"We appreciate and embrace the new government policies implemented in 2017 against fake and vulgar media content. Such policies match our mission to provide professional journalism, high-quality news, and tasteful content to our customers. As part of our ongoing efforts to further enrich our premium content and create our own IP, we launched an innovative online video mini-series titled A Journey through Literature, which explored Chinese culture and philosophies. During its 6-week broadcast, the show attracted numerous viewers to ifeng and also received praise from the People's Daily.\nThe unique value proposition offered by our programmatic advertising platform combined with our brand advertising solution enabled us to generate higher-than-expected revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. While we continue to enhance our existing products, we are also actively developing new products to cultivate future growth engines. During the quarter, we launched Zhizhi, a new Paid Knowledge Sharing product that takes our news app to a more versatile level. In addition, we broadened the content categories of our digital reading business by adding two of the most popular genres with our younger target demographic: chat stories and comics. Going forward, we are confident that our brand equity, credibility, professionalism, and synergies between our business segments will enable us to garner additional market share and solidify our industry-leading position.\"\nMs. Betty Ho, CFO of Phoenix New Media, further stated, \"We are happy to report another solid quarter during which our growth momentum continued. During the fourth quarter of 2017, our total revenues increased by 12.1% year-over-year to RMB461.8 million. In particular, our net advertising revenues increased by 16.3% year-over-year to RMB410.5 million, primarily driven by a 62.6% year-over-year increase in our mobile advertising revenues. The strong growth of the mobile advertising business enabled it to contribute about 60% of our total advertising revenue in 2017. The continued optimization of our ifeng News App drove its users to grow over 30% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on our content and product improvement to maximize shareholders' value.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nREVENUES\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 12.1% to RMB461.8 million (US$71.0 million) from RMB411.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet advertising revenues (net of advertising agency service fees) for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 16.3% to RMB410.5 million (US$63.1 million) from RMB353.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was primarily attributable to a 62.6% year-over-year increase in mobile advertising revenues that was partially offset by a 18.1% year-over-year decrease in PC advertising revenues.\nPaid services revenues [1] for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by 12.7% to RMB51.2 million (US$7.9 million) from RMB58.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues from digital entertainment [2] for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by 12.9% to RMB39.5 million (US$6.1 million) from RMB45.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was due to a 27.7% decrease in the MVAS revenues mainly resulting from the decline in users' demand for services provided through telecom operators in China and partially offset by a 19.2% increase of digital reading revenues to RMB17.0 million (US$2.6 million). Revenues from games and others [3] for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by 12.1% to RMB11.7 million (US$1.8 million) from RMB13.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues generated from web-based games operated on the Company's own platform.\n[1] Prior to 2016, the Company's paid services revenues comprised mainly of revenues generated from MVAS and games and others. Digital reading was previously classified under \"games and others.\" In order to align with the Company's overall strategies, digital reading was re-classified from \"games and others\", and digital reading together with MVAS was determined as \"digital entertainment\" starting from the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. Accordingly, the revenues from digital entertainment and the revenues from games and others for the four quarters of 2016 have been reclassified.\n[2] Digital entertainment includes mobile value-added services delivered through telecom operators' platforms, or MVAS, and digital reading.\n[3] Games and others include web-based and mobile games, and other online and mobile paid services through the Company's own platforms.\nCOST OF REVENUES\nCost of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 1.7% to RMB208.7 million (US$32.1 million) from RMB205.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily attributable to the increase in content and operational costs and sales taxes and surcharges and partially offset by the decrease in revenue sharing fees and bandwidth costs.\nContent and operational costs for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to RMB143.6 million (US$22.1 million) from RMB138.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily attributable to an increase in advertisement-related content production cost. Revenue sharing fees to telecom operators and channel partners for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased to RMB12.4 million (US$1.9 million) from RMB17.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily attributable to a decrease in the sales of MVAS products. Bandwidth costs for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased to RMB12.8 million (US$2.0 million) from RMB15.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to the decrease in bandwidth purchase costs as a result of intense competition. Sales taxes and surcharges for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to RMB39.9 million (US$6.1 million) from RMB34.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Share-based compensation included in cost of revenues was RMB1.2 million (US$0.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to negative RMB0.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulting from the increase in estimated forfeiture rate of share-based awards based on the actual forfeiture rate in the quarter.\nGROSS PROFIT\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 22.5% to RMB253.1 million (US$38.9 million) from RMB206.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to 54.8% from 50.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the increase of revenues and decrease of certain costs of revenues as explained above.\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in accordance with the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company has presented certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, which excluded the impact of certain reconciling items as stated in the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below.

Share-based compensation included in operating expenses was RMB3.5 million (US$0.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to RMB2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nLoss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB5.4 million (US$0.8 million) as compared to income from operations of RMB21.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased slightly to RMB3.7 million (US$0.6 million) from RMB3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Foreign currency exchange loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB4.5 million (US$0.7 million) as compared to foreign currency exchange gain of RMB8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was mainly caused by the appreciation of Renminbi against US dollars in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gain from equity investments for the fourth quarter of 2017, including impairments, was RMB4.9 million (US$0.7 million) as compared to loss from equity investments of RMB0.03 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit excluding share-based compensation. Non-GAAP gross margin is non-GAAP gross profit divided by total revenues. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations is income/(loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations divided by total revenues. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited is net income attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited excluding share-based compensation and gain/(loss) from equity investments, including impairments. Non-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited divided by total revenues. Non-GAAP net income per diluted ADS is non-GAAP net income attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited divided by weighted average number of diluted ADSs. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the aforementioned non-GAAP to GAAP reconciling items add clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with the related GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that using these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its business allows both management and investors to assess the Company's performance against its competitors and ultimately monitor its capacity to generate returns for investors. The Company also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the effect of items like share-based compensation and gain/(loss) from equity investments, including impairments, which have been and will continue to be significant and recurring in its business. However, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company's gross profit, income/(loss) from operations and net income attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited for the period. In addition, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as an alternative to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nExchange Rate\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"USD\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.
