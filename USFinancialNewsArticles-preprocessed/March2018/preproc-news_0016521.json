    "text": "SUNNYVALE, California, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Anodot , the AI powered analytics company, today announced that it appointed Andy Fenselau as Chief Marketing Officer, based in the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and Amit Levi as the VP Head of Product, based in the Israel offices. This is the next step in Anodot's hyper-growth trajectory following a recent $23 million round of funding. Fenselau previously led strategy, marketing and the lead machine at Elastifile and EMC XtremIO, while Levi led the development of data products at Cooladata and Yokee Music before joining Anodot.\nIn December 2017, Anodot announced a successful $23 million Series B round of funding with investors Redline Capital Management , Aleph Venture Capital and Disruptive Technologies Venture Capital . Anodot is already leveraging this investment to open offices in London and Sydney, to accelerate its sales, marketing and customer success teams, and to further develop its patented machine learning and AI analytics platform. The appointment of Fenselau as the company's first CMO, based in Silicon Valley, and Levi as the VP Head of Product, based in Israel, is a key part of this next global growth phase.\nAndy Fenselau brings with him 22 years of success in driving transformational enterprise solutions to leading market positions across SaaS, storage, databases and management software, driving hyper growth from disruptor to market leadership. At Elastifile, Fenselau successfully launched and scaled the company globally, resulting in over 100% year-to-year growth. Before that, he led marketing for EMC XtremIO, building it into the fastest-growing product in Enterprise IT history, ramping $1 billion in sales in just over 18 months.\n\"Anodot is truly something special, combining powerful AI analytics technology with a simple SaaS platform that delivers real time to valueâ€¦ and an amazing team behind it all. Integrating real-time detection across all business data, Anodot helps its customers see blind spots, find anomalies and predict supply/demand requirements for tremendous value across a range of use cases and industries like e-commerce, ad-tech, gaming and fintech,\" said Fenselau.\nAmit Levi joins Anodot with a vast experience in planning, developing and shipping large scale big data and analytics products to the top mobile and web companies. Levi's product leadership has led to major revenue growth at both Yokee Music and Cooladata.\n\"Anodot is a leading solution in AI analytics, empowering teams to become proactive instead of reactive,\" said Levi. \"Its business incident detection platform predicts issues immediately as they appear, and alerts relevant business owners in real time like no other system. I'm ecstatic about joining the Anodot team.\"\n\"Over the past year, Anodot has seen incredible success, more than tripling our revenues, with over 70 customers like Foursquare, Lyft, Microsoft and Upwork, all benefiting from breakthrough real time anomaly detection and AI analytics,\" said Anodot's CEO and co-founder David Drai. \"As we drive further expansion in 2018, we are excited to bring Andy and Amit onto the team and expand our GTM leadership in Silicon Valley.\"\nAbout Anodot\nAnodot illuminates business blind spots with AI analytics, so companies will never miss another revenue leak or brand-damaging incident.
