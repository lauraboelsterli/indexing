CEFC denied this and said operations were normal.\nReferring to the media reports, CEFC Group (Europe) said it was a standalone entity and its investments in seven European countries functioned independently of the parent group.\nCEFC in Europe has invested in Czech brewery group Lobkowicz, Prague soccer club Slavia Praha and hotels and real estate.\nIt also owns a stake in Czech-Slovak investment company J&T Finance Group and owns 49.9 percent of airline firm Travel Service, which controls national carrier Czech Airlines.\nIn a few years, CEFC has transformed from a niche fuel trader into an oil and finance conglomerate, with assets across the world and ambitions to be one of China’s energy giants.\nOn Friday, filings showed state-controlled China Huarong Asset Management Co had bought a 36.2 percent stake in the unit of CEFC China Energy through which CEFC is acquiring a $9.1 billion stake in Russia’s Rosneft.\n$1 = 20.6640 Czech crowns Reporting by Jason Hovet Editing by David Evans and Edmund Blair\n ",
