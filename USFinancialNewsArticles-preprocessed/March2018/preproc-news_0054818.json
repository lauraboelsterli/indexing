    "text": "London (Reuters) - Britain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, said on Wednesday Russia had underestimated the international response to the nerve agent attack on a Russian spy in England which London blames on Moscow.\nBritain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson speaks during a banquet with diplomats at Mansion House in London, Britain March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson Johnson told an audience of ambassadors in London that 27 countries had now moved to expel Russian diplomats over Moscow’s suspected involvement - which Russia denies.\n“These expulsions represent a moment when a feeling has suddenly crystallized, when years of vexation and provocation have worn the collective patience to breaking point, and when across the world – across three continents – there are countries who are willing to say enough is enough,” Johnson said.\nSlideshow (6 Images) “If they (Russia) believed that we had become so morally weakened, so dependent on hydrocarbons, so chronically risk averse and so fearful of Russia that we would not dare to respond, then this is their answer,” he added.\nRussia denies any involvement in the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who have been in a critical condition in hospital since they were found unconscious on March 4 on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury.\nReporting by Andrew MacAskill; Writing by Andrew Heavens; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ",
