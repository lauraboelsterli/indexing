    "text": "President Donald Trump praised Saudi Arabia's defense acquisitions before as he met with the nation's wealthy young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman , at the White House — and pushed for even more.\n\"Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation, and they're going to give the United States some of that wealth, hopefully, in the form of jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,\" Trump said Tuesday.\nSaudi Arabia's oil-rich monarchy is one of America's most important strategic partners in the Middle East and a significant patron of U.S. defense companies.\n\"There's nobody that even comes close to us in terms of technology and the quality of the equipment, and Saudi Arabia appreciates that,\" Trump added.\nDuring the Oval Office talks, Trump touted a creation of 40,000 American jobs due to Saudi military sales. The president used several maps and charts of Saudi acquisitions to further make his point.\nThe crown prince, likewise, added that last year's Saudi pledge of $200 billion in investments will rise to approximately $400 billion and that a 10-year window to implement the deal was already under way.\nFollowing his visit with Trump, the 32-year-old crown prince was due to meet with Defense Secretary James Mattis , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , CIA Director Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster .\nAfter Washington engagements, the Saudi delegation is also slated to meet with defense industry giants Lockheed Martin and Boeing .\nIn the past nine months alone, the U.S. has secured $54 billion in foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia.\nHere's a look at some of the U.S.-made weapons the Saudis are considering for purchase, according to several memos of proposed sales from the State Department and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The cost, quantity and time frame of delivery may change pending final negotiations.\nArmored vehicles Cpl. Tyler Main | United States Marines A U.S. M1A1 Abrams main battle tank America's stalwart M1 Abrams, used in nearly every major U.S. conflict since its inception in 1980, serves as the main battle tank of the Army and Marines.\nAt close to 70 tons, the mighty Abrams tank is among the heaviest in the world, but it makes up for its weight with terrifying firepower and impressive maneuverability.\nThe estimated cost of associated equipment, training and logistical support is $1.15 billion. The principal contractor will be General Dynamics Land Systems in Sterling Heights, Michigan.\n153 M1A1/A2 Abrams main battle tanks 153 M2 .50-caliber machine guns 266 7.62mm M240 machine guns 153 M250 smoke grenade launchers 20 M88A l/A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift Evacuation Systems that are also known as HERCULES vehicles 169 AN/VAS-5 driver vision enhancers 133 AN/PVS-7B night vision devices 4,256 rounds M865 training ammunition 2,394 rounds M831Al training ammunition Helicopters U.S. Department of Defense The CH-47F Chinook is a dual rotor multimission helicopter used by the Army as well as international defense forces.

The most advanced missile system on the planet can hunt and blast incoming missiles right out of the sky from its truck-based launcher.\nThe Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, is a missile-defense system that uses kinetic energy to deliver \"hit to kill\" strikes to incoming ballistic threats.\nThe estimated cost of equipment, services and logistical support is $15 billion. The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Dallas; Camden, Arkansas; Troy, Alabama; and Huntsville, Alabama; as well as Raytheon in Andover, Massachusetts.\n44 THAAD launchers 360 THAAD interceptor missiles 7 AN/TPY-2 radars WATCH: Meet Saudi Arabia's crown prince show chapters Meet Saudi Arabia’s crown prince 30 Mins Ago | 02:52",
