    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla., March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Emergent Capital, Inc. (OTCQB: EMGC) (\"Emergent\" or the \"Company\"), today announced its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal loss from continuing operations was $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to total income from continuing operations of $3.7 million for the same period in 2016. The reduction was primarily a result of a change in the fair value of life settlements which was negatively impacted by updated life expectancies procured by the Company with respect to the insureds' lives and maturities of approximately $7.8 million compared to $3.8 million for the same period in 2016. The updated life expectancy reports implied that in aggregate, the insureds' health improved, therefore lengthening their life expectancies relative to prior life expectancies. This was offset by an increase in the gain on maturities of $5.3 million on three policies during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to a $3.1 million gain on maturity of two policies for the same period in 2016.\nThe following table provides a summary of the components of income from the Company's life settlements.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2016\nChange in estimated probabilistic cash flows\n$\n22,378\n$\n20,994\nPremiums paid during period\n(21,617)\n(18,931)\nChange in life expectancy evaluation\n(7,791)\n(3,764)\nChange in discount rates\n—\n2,156\nRealized gain on maturities\n5,287\n3,098\nChange in fair value of life settlements\n$\n(1,743)\n$\n3,553\n*Amounts in thousands\nTotal expenses from continuing operations were $4.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $27.3 million for the same period in 2016. The reduction was primarily attributable to interest expense of $7.3 million during the three month period compared to $8.1 million during the same period in 2016, and a gain of $6.7 million for the change in fair value of revolving credit facilities compared to a loss of $14.2 million during the same period in 2016.\nInterest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 includes $4.7 million on the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility; $1.2 million on the 5% Convertible Notes; $824,000 on the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes and $467,000 in participation interest for the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $2.9 million, or $(0.02) per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of 23.6 million, or $(0.84) per diluted share for the same period in 2016. The net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 includes an income tax benefit of $3.2 million. There was no income tax benefit during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $51.9 million compared to $1.1 million during the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily due to13 policy maturities during the year ended December 31, 2017 which resulted in a net gain of $35.9 million compared to 12 policy maturities and a net gain of approximately $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Income from continuing operations for 2016 was further impacted by the adoption of the 2015 VBT, which reduced the fair value of the Company's life settlements by $17.6 million.\nThe following table provides a summary of the components of income from the Company's life settlements.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\nChange in estimated probabilistic cash flows\n$\n89,940\n$\n78,406\nPremiums paid during period\n(84,718)\n(71,681)\n2015 VBT Adoption\n—\n(17,638)\nChange in life expectancy evaluation\n(2,973)\n(16,015)\nChange in discount rates\n13,411\n9,305\nUnrealized gain on acquisitions\n—\n611\nRealized gain on maturities\n35,891\n17,876\nChange in fair value of life settlements\n$\n51,550\n$\n864\n*Amounts in thousands\nTotal expenses from continuing operations were $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $50.5 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily associated with a one-time expense of $2.0 million for extinguishment of the 15% Senior Secured notes and $2.5 million in debt modification cost of the 8.5% Convertible Notes, offset by a $6.7 million reduction in operating expenses primarily due to a $2.7 million decrease in legal expenses, a $2.6 million decrease in professional fees and a $1.0 million decrease in personnel cost compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reduced its headcount from 20 employees to 12 employees and recognized a onetime severance cost of approximately $1.0 million related to this reduction, which is included in personnel cost and is being paid over a period of twelve months.\nThe Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $3.2 million, or $(0.04) per fully diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net loss of $49.4 million, or $(1.79) per fully diluted share, for the same period in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $31.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of $1.0 million. The Company had 158,495,399 shares outstanding, treasury shares of 608,000 and an undiluted book value of $1.25 per share at December 31, 2017.\nLife Settlements Portfolio Highlights\nOn December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Company's 608 life insurance policies was $567.5 million compared to $498.4 million for 621 life insurance policies at December 31, 2016. The weighted average discount rate was 15.95% at December 31, 2017 compared to 16.37% at December 31, 2016. The aggregate face value of the Company's portfolio of life insurance policies was approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, 13 life insurance policies that served as collateral under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility matured totaling $67.2 million of face value.\nRevolving Credit Facility Highlights\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our facility experienced a change in fair value loss of approximately $4.5 million compared to a gain of approximately $1.4 million during the same period in 2016. This change in fair value is a combination of increased borrowings, the lengthening of life expectancies of certain insureds and an increase in the discount rate used to value the facility which was 18.57% at December 31, 2017 compared to 18.50% at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed approximately $87.3 million from the facility, approximately $42.1 million was collected from maturity proceeds while approximately $19.6 million were utilized to repay principal during the year. In addition, for the first time, the Company was able to participate in the waterfall distribution receiving funds of approximately $570,000.\nAssuming no event of default, funds on account from policy proceeds shall be distributed in specified stages of priority. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately $37.1 million of proceeds received from the maturity of policies pledged under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, were distributed through the waterfall in the following stages of priority (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nClause\nAmount\nUse of Proceeds\nFirst:\n$\n313\n$\n239\nCustodian and Securities Intermediary\nSecond:\n—\n—\nWhite Eagle - Ongoing Maintenance Cost Reimbursable\nThird:\n—\n—\nAdministrative Agent - Protective Advances\nFourth:\n39\n53\nAdministrative Agent - Administrative Agent Fee and Legal Expense Reimbursement\nFifth:\n16,037\n10,932\nAdministrative Agent - Accrued and Unpaid Interest\nSixth:\n19,633\n34,799\nAdministrative Agent - Required Amortization\nSeventh:\n—\n—\nAdministrative Agent - Amortization Shortfall\nEighth:\n467\n—\nAdministrative Agent - Participation Interest\nNinth:\n—\n—\nReserved\nTenth:\n—\n—\nAdministrative Agent Aggregate Unpaid Participation Interest\nEleventh:\n—\n—\nAdministrative Agent - Remaining Available Amount After Clause First to Tenth\nTwelfth:\n—\n—\nWilmington Trust - Custodian and Securities Intermediary - Unpaid Fees\nThirteenth:\n570\n—\nBorrower - Any Remaining Available Amount After Clause First to Twelfth\nTotal Distributions\n$\n37,059\n$\n46,023\nAbout Emergent Capital, Inc.\nEmergent (OTCQB: EMGC) is a specialty finance company that invests in life settlements.
