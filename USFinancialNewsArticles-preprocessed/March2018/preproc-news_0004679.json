    "text": "Anyone can achieve greatness. Anyone.\nGreatness is relative, yes. The results might look different; for some, simply quitting an addiction means greatness. For others, creating a Fortune 500 company means greatness.\nAnyone can do this. But most people won't.\nI'm not talking about simple averages and logistics, where \"obviously everyone can't be in the top 5 percent.\" That's bull. If you take a class of 100 students, 100 students could achieve greatness.\nMore from Anthony Moore: \n13 paradigm-shattering books to open your mind\nLiving an extraordinary life means giving up a normal one\n4 strategies to produce deep, meaningful work \nThis is because we all have a choice, every moment of every day. As author Rebecca Eanes once wrote, \"In between every action and reaction, there is a space.\" In this moment, you choose how you will react.\nThis moment is very small, sometimes small enough we don't believe it's there. This is where phrases like \"I had no choice\" or \"I couldn't help it\" come from. Yes, you could. You just chose not to. Stop lying to yourself.\nshow chapters Silicon Valley CEO: You need these 3 traits to make it in the tech business      12:22 PM ET Thu, 25 May 2017 | 01:06 More and more people are hiding behind the excuse that their behaviors, actions, and choices are out of their control. They claim the economy, Donald Trump, their boss, their landlord, the cops, societal norms, and a hundred other things control their life.\nIt's time to unlearn this prison of a belief. Not dissect it, or analyze it, or debate it.\nJust completely unlearn it.\nWhy is so much of the world mediocre? \"Good is the enemy of great. And that is one of the key reasons why we have so little that becomes great. We don't have great schools, principally because we have good schools. We don't have great government, principally because we have good government. Few people attain great lives, in large part because it is just so easy to settle for a good life.\" -Jim Collins\nYou may wonder: if 100 out of 100 people could achieve greatness, why do so few ever do?\nIt's not even that they tried and failed, either; most people never even try at all.They spend their lives without even as much as an attempt to create their masterpiece.\nWhy do so few people ever achieve greatness (even when they could)?\nIt's a good question. The answer is simple:\nBecause it's easier to let someone else call the shots.\nAnd as long as someone else is calling the shots, greatness isn't attainable.\nIt's scary to be the CEO of your life. It's an enormous responsibility. It means you can't blame other people for your problems anymore — every failure, every missed opportunity, and every failed attempt is on you.\nshow chapters Olympic gold medalist: Failing made me a better athlete      11:27 AM ET Tue, 9 Aug 2016 | 01:31 Most people don't want this heavy responsibility. So they begin stacking excuses like bricks, sealing themselves inside a box of explanations and rationalizations.\nTo this, author David Schwartz once quipped: \"The fellow who has gone nowhere and has no plans for getting anywhere always has a bookful of reasons to explain why.\"\nFor most people, it's just easier to blame unchangeable external factors for their lack of success.\nIt becomes extremely difficult to help people get out of this limiting mindset, too. In his book, \"Choose Yourself ,\" James Altucher wrote: \"If someone insists they need to be in prison even though the door is unlocked, then I am not going to argue. They are free to stay in prison.\"\nWhy is so much of the world mediocre?\nBecause they choose to be.\nAnyone can achieve greatness. And anyone who claims they can't is simply trying to explain why they can't leave their cell — even though the door is unlocked.\n\"The moment you accept total responsibility for everything in your life is the day you claim the power the change anything in your life.\" -Hal Elrod\nIncrease your clarity to avoid settling for second-best \"We are kept from our goal not by obstacles but by a clear path to a lesser goal.\" Robert Brault\nNo one wakes up, brushes their teeth, and puffs out their chest with a confident smile and yells, \"Today, I am going to SUCK!\"\nI mean, maybe some people do.\nNo — most people would claim they want to live exciting, extraordinary lives. They might even appear to work very hard at it. But they never really make any progress.\nshow chapters 25 successful leaders give kids their best money-saving tips      9:44 AM ET Thu, 4 May 2017 | 00:58 These people make up what author Hal Elrod once labeled the \"Mediocre Majority.\" These are people that, despite their good intentions, still end up settling for second-best.\nTheir problem isn't that they willingly and intentionally dive face-first into a brick wall of mediocrity. Their problem is that the path to mediocrity is simply more clear than the path to greatness.\nYou follow the path that is most clear.\nAnd since most people have marked the path to mediocrity pretty well, that's the one most people follow. It's what they know.\nIf you want to live an extraordinary life, you need to develop clarity on exactly how to do that.\nExtremely successful people have high levels of clarity on everything that is most important. These top-tier individuals know if you don't know where you're headed, there's no telling where you'll end up.\nIn the famous words of Bilbo Baggins: \"It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.\"\nFinding clarity isn't always easy. In the past 5 years, I've had at least a dozen different ideas for my life  —  a Navy SEAL, a novelist, a career coach, even a chef at a 5-star restaurant. \"Clarity\" was rarely available.\nYet clarity is exactly what you need if you want to end up settling for the mediocrity most people slowly slip into. (This 20-minute exercise was incredibly helpful for me).\nHow to achieve greatness, starting today \"If you want to live an exceptional and extraordinary life, you have to give up many of the things that are part of a normal one.\" -Srinivas Rao \nAchieving greatness is simply a matter of consistently going from point A to point B, every single day .\nIn the words of Tim Grover, personal trainer to Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant: \"People are always asking me about the secrets and tricks I use to get results. Sorry if this disappoints you: there are no secrets. There are no tricks. It's simple. Ask yourself where you are now, and where you want to be instead. Ask yourself what you're willing to do to get there. Then make a plan to get there. Act on it.\"\nThis isn't sexy advice. There are no shortcuts or \"hacks.\" It's not easy.\nBut it's simple: consistent progress , every day.\nWhat does \"greatness\" mean to you? No one else can define that for you.\nshow chapters This is why Tim Cook and other successful leaders wake up around 4:00 AM      6:09 PM ET Thu, 9 Feb 2017 | 01:01 Once you determine what that means, what can you do today to get a little closer there?\nBy the way, we've stumbled upon the very formula that is responsible for the greatest accomplishments by the most successful leaders the world has ever witnessed:\nMoving one step closer, every day.\nThat's it.\nHundreds of the world's most prolific creators, rulers, humanitarians, and leaders have been saying this in different ways for thousands of years. Their advice is just as refreshingly relevant today as it was then. It will be in the year 3000, too.\nIn conclusion \"Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice, and discipline.\" -Jim Collins\nGreatness doesn't happen by chance.\nSettling for mediocrity doesn't, either.\nThey're both choices. Both require work. Sometimes, it takes just as much work — maybe more — to remain in mediocrity. Sitting with the mental stress and disappointment of mediocrity is an enormous daily drain.\nIf you're reading this, you have a choice today — to move from point A to point B; to take a step closer to personal evolution.\nMost people won't ever achieve greatness.\nBut you can. And all you need to do is take one step today.\nAnthony Moore is the founder of StuffGradsLike.com where he coaches 20 and 30 somethings to achieve success in career, finances, and passion. \nLike this story?
