    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has deployed a naval vessel from its regional anti-piracy effort to help in the search after a fishing boat was hijacked by pirates off Ghana, South Korea’s foreign ministry said on Saturday.\nThe ministry said the fishing boat had about 40 crew - mostly from Ghana but including three South Koreans. It said the pirates used a speedboat to take away the South Koreans.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in sent South Korea’s anti-piracy Cheonghae unit to the area to try to secure the South Koreans’ release, the ministry said.\nThe South Korean government has been working to tackle piracy with a number of African countries, as well as the United States and the European Union.\nReporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Andrew Bolton\n ",
