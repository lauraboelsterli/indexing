    "text": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acasta Enterprises Inc. (TSX: AEF) (“ Acasta ” or the “ Company ”) announced today that it has completed the previously announced sale (the “ Transaction ”) of its Stellwagen business unit (“ Stellwagen ”) to a company (the “ Purchaser ”) that will be indirectly owned by Mr. Douglas Brennan and certain other investors.\n“With the closing of the Transaction, Acasta has reduced its over-all bank indebtedness to approximately U.S.$153 million. Moving forward, Acasta will focus exclusively on creating value in its consumer products operating companies and focus on further debt reduction initiatives,” commented Ian Kidson, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Acasta.\nAcasta has applied the initial proceeds from the Transaction, being approximately U.S.$35 million, to satisfy the previously disclosed payment of U.S.$25 million owed by Acasta by March 31, 2018 under its U.S.$150 million credit facility (the “ Credit Facility ”) and to pay down additional amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. As a result of the Transaction, Acasta has effectively also reduced its share count from approximately 95.7 million issued and outstanding common shares to approximately 69.7 million common shares.\nAs previously disclosed, Acasta retained ownership of profit participating notes (“ PPNs ”) issued to Acasta by a subsidiary of Stellwagen and is working with its financial advisor to monetize the PPNs. Acasta will use proceeds from the sale of the PPNs to further pay down indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nThe special committee of independent directors of the board of directors received an opinion from Blair Franklin Capital Partners Inc. dated March 18, 2018 that the consideration received by Acasta in connection with the Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to Acasta.\n2017 Financial Statements and Investor Conference Call\nAcasta will release its fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results after market close on Monday April 2, 2018 instead of March 29, 2018 as previously announced.\nAcasta’s senior management will host a conference call on Tuesday, April 3, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. (E.D.T.) to discuss the Company’s financial and operating results. Please dial 1-416-406-0743 or toll-free (Canada/US) 1-800-806-5484 with passcode 1948342. To ensure your participation, please join approximately five minutes prior to the scheduled start of the conference call.\nThe conference call will be archived on the Company’s website at www.acastaenterprises.com and will be available for replay at 1-905-694-9451 or toll-free (Canada/US) 1-800-408-3053 with passcode 8204336, expiring on May 15, 2018.\nAdvisories:\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward Looking Statements\nThis news release includes forward looking statements.

Forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, monetizing the PPNs and statements about other anticipated future events or results, including comments with respect to Company’s future financial performance and condition. Forward looking statements are statements that are predictive in nature, depend upon or refer to future events or conditions and are identified by words such as “will”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “intends”, “plans”, “believes”, “estimates” or similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Such statements are based on current expectations of the Company’s management and inherently involve numerous risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including economic factors. The forward-looking information contained in this news release is presented for the purpose of assisting readers in understanding the Company’s business and strategic priorities and objectives.
