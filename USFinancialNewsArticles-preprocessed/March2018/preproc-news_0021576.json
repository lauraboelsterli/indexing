In 2017, Forbes tallied that group at $2.4 trillion, said Buffett.\n\"This has been a prosperity that's been disproportionately rewarding to the people on top,\" explained Buffett. \"The economy is doing well, but all Americans aren't doing well,\" he said.\nFor its ranking of global billionaires, Forbes used stock prices and exchange rates from February 9, 2018 . \nSee also: \nBillionaire Ray Dalio: There are 2 realities in this country—for the bottom 60 percent it's a 'miserable economy' \nBillionaire Warren Buffett says 'the real problem' with the US economy is people like him \nHow Amazon founder Jeff Bezos went from the son of a teen mom to the world's richest person \nshow chapters Billionaire Warren Buffett says 'the real problem' with the US economy is people like him      1:52 PM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 | 00:45 Like this story?
