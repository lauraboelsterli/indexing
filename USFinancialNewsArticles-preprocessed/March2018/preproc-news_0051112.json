Earnings per fully-diluted ordinary share and ADS were $0.16 and $0.03 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to loss per fully-diluted ordinary share and ADS of $0.11 and $0.02 in the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA, defined as non-GAAP net income before income taxes, interest expenses, interest income, depreciation and amortization, was $35.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $2.4 million in the corresponding period of 2016.\nCash\nAs of December 31, 2017, Fang had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $507.1 million, compared to $590.5 million as of December 31, 2016. Net cash generated from operating activities was $57.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to cash flow generated from operating activities of $85.1 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to the decrease of cash inflow of loan receivable related to operating activities compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nRevenues\nFang reported total revenues of $444.3 million for 2017, representing a decrease of 51.5% from $916.4 million for 2016, primarily due to the decline in e-commerce services revenue by 489.9 million.\nRevenue from marketing services was $149.3 million for 2017, a decrease of 9.8% from $165.4 million for 2016, primarily due to less demand from property developers.\nRevenue from e-commerce services was $87.8 million for 2017, a decrease of 84.8% from $577.7 million for 2016, primarily due to Fang's transformation back to a technology-driven open platform model.\nRevenue from listing services was $165.4 million for 2017, an increase of 40.0% from $118.1 million for 2016, driven by the increased number of paying members in lower-tier cities.\nRevenue from financial services was $12.1 million for 2017, a decrease of 59.3% from $29.6 million for 2016,, primarily due to the reduced loan demand from decreased secondary transaction volumes of Fang's own franchised brokerage services and a strategic shift to a more diversified loan business, which is still at its early stage.\nRevenue from other value-added services was $29.8 million for 2017, an increase of 16.6% from $25.6 million for 2016, primarily driven by the growth of data products in the research business.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue was $174.6 million for 2017, a decrease of 74.6% from $687.2 million for 2016, primarily driven by the closing of the self-owned brokerage stores, deduction of e-commerce staff and cost optimization under the technology-driven open platform model.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $232.9 million for 2017, a decrease of 38.8% from $380.7 million for 2016.\nSelling expenses were $91.3 million for 2017, a decrease of 60.3% from $229.8 million for 2016, primarily driven by the decrease of advertising and promotion fee, sales commission fee.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $141.1 million for 2017, a decrease of 6.7% from $151.3 million for 2016, primarily due to the deduction of staff cost.\nOperating Income\nOperating income was $36.8 million for 2017, compared with operating loss of $151.4 million for 2016.\nIncome Tax Expenses\nIncome tax expenses were $21.4 million for 2017, compared to $25.0 million for the corresponding period in 2016. The expenses decrease was primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded ASC 740 (FIN 48) tax and interest liability.\nNet Loss/Income and EPS\nNet income attributable to Fang's shareholders was $16.3 million for 2017, compared to net loss $169.6 million for 2016. Earnings per fully-diluted ordinary share and ADS were $0.18 and $0.04 in 2017, compared to loss per fully-diluted ordinary share and ADS of $1.81 and $0.36 in 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $63.6 million for 2017, compared to negative $121.2 million for 2016.\nCash\nCash generated from operating activities was $126.9 million for 2017, compared to net cash generated from operating activities $131.2 million for 2016, primarily due to the decrease of cash inflow of loan receivable related to operating activities compared to 2016.\nBusiness Outlook\nFang estimates its net income for 2018 will range from approximately $100 million to approximately $120 million, representing a year-on-year increase of approximately 388.3% to approximately 485.9%. This forecast reflects Fang's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nConference Call Information\nFang's management team will host a conference call on the same day at 8:00 AM U.S. EST (8:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong time).

For more information about Fang, please visit http://ir.fang.com .\nSafe Harbor Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"is expected to,\" \"anticipates,\" \"aim,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"are likely to,\" \"estimates,\" \"may,\" \"should\" and similar expressions, and include, without limitation, statements regarding Fang's future financial performance, revenue guidance, growth and growth rates, market position and continued business transformation. Such statements are based upon management's current expectations and current market and operating conditions, and relate to events that involve known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Fang's control, which may cause its actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the impact of Fang's transformation back to a technology-driven Internet platform and the impact of current and future government policies affecting China's real estate market. Further information regarding these and other risks, uncertainties or factors is included in Fang's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Fang does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Fang's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), Fang uses in this press release the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission: (1) non-GAAP operating (loss)/income, (2) non-GAAP net (loss)/income and (3) non-GAAP basic and diluted (loss)/earnings per ordinary share and per ADS (4) adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Results\" set forth at the end of this press release.\nFang believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding its operating performance by excluding share-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects, realized gain on available-for-sale security, interest income and expenses, income tax expenses, and depreciation expense for the relevant period, which (1) may not be indicative of Fang's recurring core business operating results or (2) are not expected to result in future cash payments. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Fang's historical performance and assist its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that share-based compensation, interest income and expenses, income tax expenses, and depreciation expenses have been and will continue to be a significant recurring expense that will continue to exist in Fang's business for the foreseeable future. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliation between non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nFor investor and media inquiries,
