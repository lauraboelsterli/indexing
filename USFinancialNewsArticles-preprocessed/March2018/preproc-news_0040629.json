Cash distributions of C$0.50 per Class A unit and US$0.50 per Class U unit were paid during the year.\nThe Fund’s investment objectives are (i) to provide Unitholders with quarterly cash distributions; and (ii) to maximize total return through capital appreciation and distributions.\nTo achieve its investment objectives, the Fund invests in an actively managed portfolio of U.S. financial or real estate issuers selected from the S&P 500 Index that are classified as “Financials” or “Real Estate” by Standard & Poor’s Global Industry Classification Standard and which have a market capitalization of at least US$10 billion and a credit rating issued by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services of at least A- at the time of purchase. The portfolio may also include U.S. publicly listed alterative asset management issuers which have a market capitalization of at least US$5 billion at the time of purchase. In addition, the Fund may invest up to 25 percent of the net asset value in other U.S. financial, real estate or alternative asset management issuers that do not meet the rating or market capitalization requirements noted above.\nTo generate additional income above the distributions earned on its equity securities, the Fund will, from time to time, write covered call options in respect of all or a portion of the securities in its portfolio.\nThe Fund’s investment portfolio is managed by its investment manager, Strathbridge Asset Management Inc. The Class A units are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol USF.UN.
