The company logo of Noble Group is seen at its headquarters in Hong Kong March 23, 2015. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo Noble has a $379 million bond that matures in 2018 and a $750 million bond due in 2022. The Hong Kong-headquartered firm has finalised a restructuring agreement with a group of senior creditors holding 46 percent of its debt, and is in talks with others, as it races to launch a deal crucial to its survival.
