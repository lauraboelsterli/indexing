    "text": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Chile’s“A Fantastic Woman,” a drama about a transgender woman who battles her lover’s family after he dies, won the Oscar on Sunday for best foreign language film.\n90th Academy Awards - Oscars Backstage - Hollywood, California, U.S., 04/03/2018 - Rita Moreno poses with director Sebastian Lelio from Chile after he won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for \"A Fantastic Woman\". REUTERS/Mike Blake The film, directed and co-written by Sebastián Lelio, marked Chile’s first Oscar victory in that category. It had been considered a favorite to win the award.\nThe movie’s 28-year-old star, transgender actress Daniela Vega, has appeared in only one film before“A Fantastic Woman.” On Sunday, she became the first openly transgender presenter at an Oscar ceremony, when she introduced a song.\n“I want to thank the cast of the film,” said director Sebastián Lelio,“especially the brilliant actor Francisco Reyes and the inspiration for this movie, Daniela Vega.”\n90th Academy Awards - Oscars Arrivals - Hollywood, California, U.S., 04/03/2018 - Sebastian Lelio and Daniela Vega and cast members of 'A Fantastic Woman'. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri Vega plays Marina, a waitress and singer in a relationship with an older, divorced man. When the man has an aneurysm and falls down the stairs, Marina rushes him to the hospital. Before long, police are questioning her about whether she had any part in his death.\nMarina contends with even more painful encounters with the man’s family and ex-wife, who threaten, cajole and insult Marina in an effort to keep her away from the memorial service.\nSlideshow (3 Images) The transgender woman’s battles with prejudice are evoked in surrealistic scenes in the movie, which are reminiscent of Latin America’s literary tradition of magic realism.\nThe Chilean film beat nominees from Russia, Lebanon, Sweden and Hungary.\nActress Rita Moreno, 86, presented the award and had the audience cheering for her as she danced toward the microphone, wearing the same dress she wore when she won an Oscar in 1962 for“West Side Story.”\nReporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Jill Serjeant, Sandra Maler and Jonathan Oatis\n ",
