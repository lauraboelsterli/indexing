    "text": "509 COMMENTS It’s happy hour on the east coast, but dark clouds are looming over American saloons. Perhaps just in time, a foreign visitor has arrived in the United States to try to help prevent a potential trade war from disrupting American merriment.\nThis week the Journal highlighted the high stakes involved in President Donald Trump’s effort to use new U.S. tariffs to force foreign governments to accept new terms for international commerce.\nReported the Journal:\nPresident Donald Trump isn’t a drinker. But when the Irish prime minister comes to visit Thursday, Mr. Trump may be asked to consider how whiskey might get caught up in a complicated tit-for-tat that could be triggered by the aluminum and steel tariffs the U.S. announced last week. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of Ireland who is visiting Washington for annual St. Patrick’s Day celebrations, will emphasize to Mr. Trump the benefits of trade between the two countries, just as the president is preparing to enforce protectionist measures. The Irish leader carries a trove of data points, including that the U.S. has a surplus in services trade with Ireland and that 800 Irish companies in the U.S. employ 100,000 people. This column would never criticize the President for being a teetotaler. Nevertheless, it’s fair to question whether he fully appreciates the potential impact of his policies on a treasured liquid import. According to the Journal: \n“We do have a concern about where this might go,” Mr. Varadkar said. The European Union has put bourbon on the list of U.S. products that could be subject to countertariffs, and “the countertariff to that may then be Irish whiskey, and I don’t want to see Ireland, which has such a strong, balanced, economic relationship with the U.S., getting caught up in a European and American trade war,” he said. The U.S. tariffs will modestly increase the cost of beer cans. The European response could then raise the cost of U.S. bourbon overseas. If Mr. Trump then feels his negotiating position necessitates a new U.S. border tax on Irish whiskey, can any bar patron feel safe?\nThe promising news is that, judging by the official White House transcript, the Irish Prime Minister made a good impression on the U.S. President:\nPRIME MINISTER VARADKAR: So I’m going to be in New York on Saturday. THE PRESIDENT: Oh, good. Wow, that’s good. PRIME MINISTER VARADKAR: Yeah, for the parade. So marching on 5th Avenue. THE PRESIDENT: That’s good, I’d like to do it with you, I don’t know. PRIME MINISTER VARADKAR: Does it pass Trump Tower? THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) It does. PRIME MINISTER VARADKAR: It does. Okay. Okay. THE PRESIDENT: It goes right by Trump Tower. PRIME MINISTER VARADKAR: That should be good. The two men discussed trade and today the Irish Independent suggests that our President and his esteemed visitor may have made some progress. The Irish newspaper had a reporter covering the White House meeting and notes:\nMr Trump was happy to take questions about visiting Ireland, golf and the alleged assassination attempt by Russian agents in the UK. But when the ‘Irish Independent’ asked if he would reconsider his steel tariffs, he just stared and remained silent. The media opportunity finished soon after... After the meeting, Mr Varadkar addressed the media on his encounter with ‘The Donald’ and revealed he proposed a new trade deal between the US and the EU. “We also spoke about trade – the president has enormous concerns that the US isn’t being treated fairly, when it comes to trade, by China and Europe,” Mr Varadkar said. “I put across the view that maybe the best way to resolve this is a new trade deal between America and Europe – and the president seemed very open to that,” he added. Sources at the meeting said the proposal was well received by the president. On both sides of the Atlantic, revelers are no doubt hoping for a quick resolution. For Americans, there’s more at stake than simply higher whiskey prices, significant as they may be. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan noted another valuable import in welcoming Mr. Varadkar to the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon. “The good news is, we have Guinness. Now, the Guinness does taste better in Ireland. But I realize this probably isn’t the right year to bring up trade issues,” said Mr. Ryan.\nThose who appreciate the freedom to enjoy beverages without heavy tariffs don’t always enjoy the luxury of choosing the time and place where conviviality must be staunchly defended. But they must surely appreciate the timing of Mr. Varadkar’s visit and his welcome message. \n***\nBottom Stories of the Day \nWhat Would We Do Without NASA? \n“Astronaut Scott Kelly and His Twin Brother Are Still Identical, NASA Says,” Space.com, March 16 \nMaster of Understatement \n“Man Says Samurai Sword Attack by Girlfriend Was a Big Misunderstanding,” MSN, March 15 \nOut on a Limb \n“Nikolay Glushkov, a friend of a Putin critic who was found dead with a rope around his neck, was strangled, police say,” NBC News on Twitter, March 16 .\n***\nFollow James Freeman on Twitter. \nSubscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click. \nTo suggest items, please email best@wsj.com . \n(Carol Muller and Lisa Rossi help compile Best of the Web.
