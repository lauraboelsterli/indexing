    "text": "BERKELEY, Calif., Aduro Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADRO) today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net loss for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was $26.1 million, or $0.34 per share, and $91.9 million, or $1.26 per share, respectively. This compared to net loss of $29.6 million, or $0.44 per share, and $91.1 million, or $1.40 per share, respectively, for the same periods in 2016.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $349.7 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $361.9 million at December 31, 2016.\n“In 2017, we expanded clinical development activities of our STING agonist program with the initiation of a global combination trial of ADU-S100 with Novartis’ proprietary anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, PDR001. We also initiated clinical development of BION-1301, a novel anti-APRIL antibody, in multiple myeloma,” said Stephen T. Isaacs, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Aduro. “We believe we are well-positioned with the support of our collaboration partners and strong cash position to further advance our clinical programs, particularly in the activation of the STING pathway.”\n2017\nDevelopment Achievements\nContinued to advance ADU-S100 in a Phase 1 dose escalation in solid tumors and lymphomas Initiated a global combination trial of ADU-S100 and Novartis’ anti-PD-1, PDR001, for the treatment of solid tumors and lymphomas Presented preclinical data demonstrating anti-APRIL antibody blocking of TACI in addition to BCMA results in inhibition of regulatory T cells Initiated Phase 1/2 clinical trial of novel anti-APRIL antibody, BION-1301, for the treatment of multiple myeloma Initiated Phase 1 clinical trial of neoantigen-based personalized immunotherapy (pLADD)\nFinancial Performance\nRevenues were $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $17.2 million for the full year 2017, compared to $3.9 million and $50.7 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2016. The decrease in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in grant revenue. The decrease in revenue for the full year 2017 was primarily due to the recognition of a $35.0 million milestone payment in 2016 for the clinical advancement of ADU-S100 under our agreement with Novartis, partially offset by the recognition of a $2.0 million milestone payment in 2017 for progress in our anti-CD27 antibody program licensed to Merck.\nResearch and development expenses were $22.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $89.4 million for the full year 2017, compared to $20.9 million and $87.7 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2016. The increase in research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to higher contract manufacturing costs for our B-select antibodies and a related contingent payment obligation. The increase in research and development expenses for the full year 2017 was primarily due to higher personnel and allocated facility costs, as well as higher contract manufacturing costs associated with our B-select antibodies, partially offset by decreased manufacturing costs for a discontinued pancreatic cancer program.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $8.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $33.8 million for the full year 2017, compared to $8.0 million and $34.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense and outside professional services. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the full year 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in professional services and consulting fees.\nIncome tax benefit was $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $11.4 million for the full year 2017, compared to provision for income taxes of $5.1 million and $21.5 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2016. The income tax benefit recorded for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 was due to the current benefit of income taxes paid in 2016.\nAbout Aduro\nAduro Biotech, Inc. is an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases.
