    "text": "HONG KONG, March 29 (Reuters) - Sunac China, the countryâ€™s fourth-largest property developer, said on Thursday it plans to boost contract sales by 24 percent this year to 450 billion yuan ($72 billion).\nIt will also book an impairment provision of around 16 billion yuan on its holding in embattled Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing. Company vice-president Gao Xi told an earnings briefing that Sunac would not have to worry about a negative impact from Leshi in the future.\nTianjin-based Sunac said earlier on Thursday that core profit more than tripled, helped by a big jump in revenue.
