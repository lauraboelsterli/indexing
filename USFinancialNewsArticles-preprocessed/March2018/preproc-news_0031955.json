    "text": "TORONTO, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eurocontrol Technics Group Inc. (TSX-V:EUO) (OTCQB:EUCTF) (“Eurocontrol” or the “Company”) announces the appointment of Paul Wood as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, following the resignation of Bruce Rowlands who will remain on the Company’s board of directors, and the appointment of Dennis Logan, a non-executive director of the Company, as Chairman.\nThe Company also announces that the board has determined that it is timely, and in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders, to initiate a formal process to explore a broad range of strategic alternatives that may be available to Eurocontrol. The Company will provide updates at such time as the board of directors approves a strategic alternative, or otherwise determines that further disclosure is appropriate or required.\nPaul Wood will continue to serve as a member of the Company’s board of directors.

Dennis Logan has a background in investment banking and has substantial experience serving on company boards. He will continue to Chair the Company’s audit committee in addition to his role as Chairman.\nPaul Wood commented, “The Company’s strong balance sheet underpinned by cash and a minimum earn out receivable of $1.5 million per year until 2022, with potential incremental upside from now through to 2024, combined with its outstanding technological team and global customer base, places Eurocontrol in a unique position as it commences this formal process. The Company intends to maintain its commitment to its current businesses and to lever this combination of balance sheet and technological strength.”\nDennis Logan, the Company’s Chairman, stated, “On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Bruce Rowlands who has been at the helm of the Company for 12 years.
