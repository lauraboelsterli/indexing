    "text": "HONG KONG, March 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UTStarcom (“UTStarcom” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ:UTSI), a global telecommunications infrastructure provider, today reported its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nUTStarcom’s Chief Executive Officer Tim Ti stated, “Our performance in 2017 was excellent. This is the second consecutive year that we delivered operating profits. Revenue growth was in the double digits, gross margin expanded and non-GAAP EPS was up 200%. We exceeded our financial goals and continue to invest aggressively in R&D to develop and introduce new and improved products to strengthen our competitive position. Although fourth quarter revenue was lower than anticipated, this does not diminish the outstanding performance we delivered for the year, as the fourth quarter revenue was simply impacted by the timing of order delivery.”\nTim continued, “We are confident that our technologies, product solutions and geographic coverage provide the foundation for a solid future. We are seeing strength in India, and early traction in South America and Taiwan. We have introduced important new products, specifically SyncRing, and see other opportunities developing, such as in retail store automation. Our operating achievements in 2017 position us well for future growth. We have a dedicated, talented team in place to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.”\nBusiness Highlights\nIn October 2017, the Company announced that the special committee of the Company’s board of directors had received a notice from Shah Capital Opportunity Fund LP, Himanshu H.
