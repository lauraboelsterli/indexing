    "text": "ATLANTA, March 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Regional Health Properties, Inc. (NYSE American: RHE) (NYSE American: RHEpA) a self-managed healthcare real estate investment company that invests primarily in real estate purposed for senior living and long-term care, today announced postponing the release of its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year period ended December 31, 2017 and its previously announced conference call to discuss such results originally scheduled for March 29, 2018. The Company also announced that it will file a Form 12b-25 (Notification of Late Filing) with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Form 12b-25 allows a company an additional 15 calendar days (or until April 17, 2018) to file its Form 10-K which otherwise would be due on April 2, 2018.\nThe delay is to allow additional time to re-evaluate the company's non-cash reserve balances.\nAs soon as possible, management will issue a press release announcing a revised date for the fourth quarter conference call and the date by which the Company expects to issue a press release announcing its results for the fourth quarter and full year period ended December 31, 2017.\nAbout Regional Health Properties\nRegional Health Properties, Inc.

Words such as \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"likely,\" \"will,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates\" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Statements in this press release regarding future events and developments and our future performance, as well as management's expectations, beliefs, plans, estimates or projections relating to the future, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, among others, statements regarding target or anticipated improvements in our portfolio operating metrics (including occupancy rates and rent coverage ratios) and reductions in our general and administrative expenses, anticipated refinancing of certain mortgage debt and our ability in general to refinance our senior secured mortgage debt on favorable terms, the impact of the pending professional and general liability claims against us and our strategy to expedite settlement of such claims, our on-going executive officers search, the dividend suspension for the fourth quarter and the future review thereof, portfolio growth, the operational risk of our tenants, the nature of our acquisition pipeline and our ability to make acquisitions, and the reduction of our overhead costs.\nForward-looking statements, by their nature, involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or contemplated by our forward-looking statements due to various factors, including, among others: our dependence on the operating success of our operators; the significant amount of, and our ability to service, our indebtedness; covenants in our debt agreements that may restrict our ability to make investments, incur additional indebtedness and refinance indebtedness on favorable terms; the availability and cost of capital; our ability to raise capital through equity and debt financings or through the sale of assets; the effect of increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement on our operators and the dependence of our operators on reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payors; the relatively illiquid nature of real estate investments; the impact of litigation and rising insurance costs on the business of our operators; the impact on us of litigation relating to our prior operation of our healthcare properties; the effect of our operators declaring bankruptcy, becoming insolvent or failing to pay rent as due; the ability of any of our operators in bankruptcy to reject unexpired lease obligations and to impede our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding and retain security deposits for the debtor's obligations; our ability to find replacement operators and the impact of unforeseen costs in acquiring new properties; and other factors discussed from time to time in our news releases, public statements and documents filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this press release, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regional-health-properties-postpones-conference-call-to-discuss-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-2017-financial-results-300621443.html\nSOURCE Regional Health Properties, Inc.",
