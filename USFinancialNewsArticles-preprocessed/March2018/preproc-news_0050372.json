    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 10:15 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago Turkey started preparations for further operations in northern Syria - Erdogan Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has started preparations to clear northern Syria’s Ayn al-Arab, Ras al-Ain and Tel Abyad regions from militants up to the Iraqi border, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, adding that it would also clear militants from Iraq. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan speaks during a meeting in Ankara, Turkey March 30, 2018. Murat Cetinmuhurdar/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS \nErdogan said Turkey has no intention of harming soldiers of allied nations positioned in the region, but that it could not allow militants to roam free. \nUnited States troops are positioned alongside Kurdish YPG militants in Syria’s Manbij. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday it had assured the YPG of its support to stabilise northern Syria. \n(This version of the story corrects to show Turkey has started preparations for further operations, not new operations) Writing by Ali Kucukgocmen",
