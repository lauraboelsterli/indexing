    "text": "Raises Guidance for FY18 Earnings Per Share and Operating Margin\nBEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Progress (NASDAQ: PRGS), the leading provider of application development and deployment technologies, today announced results for its fiscal first quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nRevenue was $94.0 million during the quarter compared to $91.0 million in the same quarter last year, a year-over-year increase of 3% on an actual currency basis, and flat on a constant currency basis. On a non-GAAP basis, revenue was $94.2 million during the quarter compared to $91.2 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 3% on an actual currency basis, and flat on a constant currency basis.\nOn a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.27 compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.01 in the same quarter last year. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.54 compared to $0.34 in the same quarter last year, growth of 59%.\n“We are very pleased with our strong start to 2018,” said Yogesh Gupta, CEO at Progress. “We exceeded both our revenue and earnings per share expectations in the first quarter, and the strength of our business has enabled us to increase our full year guidance for both operating margin and earnings per share. Our business is strong and stable, and we remain confident in our future prospects.”\nAdditional financial highlights included:\nThree Months Ended GAAP Non-GAAP (In thousands, except percentages and per share amounts) February 28,\n2018\nFebruary 28,\n2017\n%\nChange\nFebruary 28,\n2018\nFebruary 28,\n2017\n%\nChange\nRevenue $ 94,047 $ 90,970 3 % $ 94,194 $ 91,203 3 % Income from operations 17,768 1,222\n*\n34,744 27,130 28 % Operating margin 19 % 1 %\n*\n37 % 30 % 23 % Net income (loss) 12,912 (525 )\n*\n25,519 16,847 51 % Diluted earnings (loss) per share 0.27 (0.01 )\n*\n0.54 0.34 59 % Cash from operations (GAAP) /Adjusted free cash flow (Non-GAAP) $ 31,595 $ 37,300 (15 )% $ 32,948 $ 42,981 (23 )% *Not meaningful\nPaul Jalbert, CFO, said: “Our strong Q1 operating margins reflect our ongoing commitment to running our business efficiently. We continue to generate strong cash flows, and maintained our disciplined approach to capital allocation by returning over $50 million to our shareholders during the quarter.”\nOther fiscal first quarter 2018 metrics and recent results included:\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $167.5 million at the end of the quarter; DSO was 51 days compared to 48 days in the fiscal first quarter of 2017 and 47 days in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017; Pursuant to the $250 million share authorization of the Board of Directors, Progress repurchased 1.1 million shares for $45.0 million during the fiscal first quarter of 2018. As of February 28, 2018, there was $175.0 million remaining under this authorization; and On March 27, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share of common stock that will be paid on June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 1, 2018.\n2018 Business Outlook\nProgress provides the following guidance for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2018 and the second fiscal quarter ending May 31, 2018:\n(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) FY 2018\nGAAP\nFY 2018\nNon-GAAP\nQ2 2018\nGAAP\nQ2 2018\nNon-GAAP\nRevenue $398 - $404 $399 - $404 $93 - $96 $93 - $96 Diluted earnings per share $1.24 - $1.32 $2.36 - $2.41 $0.24 - $0.26 $0.51 - $0.53 Operating margin 21% - 22% 36% - 37% * * Cash from operations (GAAP) / Adjusted free cash flow (Non-GAAP)\n$115 - $121 $115 - $120 * * Effective tax rate 26% 22% * * * We do not provide guidance for this financial measure.\nBased on current exchange rates, the expected positive currency translation impact on Progress' fiscal year 2018 business outlook compared to 2017 exchange rates is approximately $8 million on GAAP and non-GAAP revenue, and $0.04 on GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. The expected positive currency translation impact on Progress' fiscal Q2 2018 business outlook compared to 2017 exchange rates is approximately $3 million on GAAP and non-GAAP revenue, and $0.01 on GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. To the extent that there are changes in exchange rates versus the current environment, this may have an impact on Progress' business outlook.\nConference Call\nThe Progress quarterly investor conference call to review its fiscal first quarter of 2018 will be broadcast live at 5:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 28, 2018 and can be accessed on the investor relations section of the company’s website, located at www.progress.com . Additionally, you can listen to the call by telephone by dialing 1-888-710-4011, pass code 9975518. The conference call will include comments followed by questions and answers. An archived version of the conference call and supporting materials will be available on the Progress website within the investor relations section after the live conference call.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nProgress provides non-GAAP supplemental information to its financial results.\nWe use this non-GAAP information to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because our management believes the information helps illustrate underlying trends in our business and provides us with a more comparable measure of our continuing business, as well as a greater understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business, by excluding the effects of certain items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. Management also uses this non-GAAP financial information to establish budgets and operational goals, which are communicated internally and externally, evaluate performance, and allocate resources. In addition, compensation of our executives and non-executive employees is based in part on the performance of our business evaluated using this same non-GAAP information.\nHowever, this non-GAAP information is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and should be considered in conjunction with our GAAP results as the items excluded from the non-GAAP information often have a material impact on Progress’ financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments to Progress' GAAP financial results is included in the tables below and is available on the Progress website at www.progress.com within the investor relations section.\nAs described in more detail below, non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP costs of sales and operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations and operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude the effect of purchase accounting on the fair value of acquired deferred revenue, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, fees related to shareholder activist, restructuring charges, acquisition-related expenses, certain identified non-operating gains and losses, and the related tax effects of the preceding items. We also provide guidance on adjusted free cash flow, which is equal to cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus restructuring payments.\nIn the noted fiscal periods, we adjusted for the following items from our GAAP financial results to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures:\nAcquisition-related revenue - In all periods presented, we include acquisition-related revenue, which constitutes revenue reflected as pre-acquisition deferred revenue that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of acquisitions. The acquisition-related revenue relates to Telerik, which we acquired on December 2, 2014, and Kinvey, which we acquired on June 1, 2017. Since GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue, GAAP results alone do not fully capture all of our economic activities. We believe these adjustments are useful to management and investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of the business because, although we cannot be certain that customers will renew their contracts, we have historically experienced high renewal rates on maintenance and support agreements and other customer contracts. Additionally, although acquisition-related revenue adjustments are non-recurring with respect to past acquisitions, we expect to incur these adjustments in connection with any future acquisitions. Amortization of acquired intangibles - In all periods presented, we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles because those expenses are unrelated to our core operating performance and the intangible assets acquired vary significantly based on the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions and the maturities of the businesses acquired. Stock-based compensation - In all periods presented, we exclude stock-based compensation to be consistent with the way management and the financial community evaluates our performance and the methods used by analysts to calculate consensus estimates. The expense related to stock-based awards is generally not controllable in the short-term and can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. As such, we do not include these charges in operating plans. Stock-based compensation will continue in future periods. Fees related to shareholder activist - In September 2017, Praesidium Investment Management publicly announced in a Schedule 13D filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission its disagreement with our strategy and stated that it was seeking changes in the composition of our Board of Directors. We have incurred professional and other fees relating to Praesidium’s actions. We exclude these fees because they distort trends and are not part of our core operating results. We do not expect to incur additional professional and other fees related to this matter. Restructuring expenses - In all periods presented, we exclude restructuring expenses incurred because those expenses distort trends and are not part of our core operating results. Acquisition-related and transition expenses - In all periods presented, we exclude acquisition-related expenses because those expenses distort trends and are not part of our core operating results. In recent years, we have completed a number of acquisitions, which result in our incurring operating expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred. By excluding certain transition, integration and other acquisition-related expense items in connection with acquisitions, this provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance and the financial results of less acquisitive peer companies. We consider these types of costs and adjustments, to a great extent, to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of our control. Furthermore, we do not consider these acquisition-related costs and adjustments to be related to the organic continuing operations of the acquired businesses and are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired assets. In addition, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of future acquisitions. Income tax adjustment - In all periods presented, we adjust our income tax provision by excluding the tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments discussed above.\nConstant Currency\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. As a result, our revenue results have been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, if the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries strengthen, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are positively impacted.\nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons, we present revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis, which helps improve the understanding of our revenue results and our performance in comparison to prior periods. The constant currency information presented is calculated by translating current period results using prior period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains statements that are “ ” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(3) Our ability to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets, including an increased emphasis on a cloud and subscription strategy, may not be successful. (4) If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, or to enhance and improve our existing products and services in a timely manner to meet market demand, partners and customers may not purchase new software licenses or subscriptions or purchase or renew support contracts.
