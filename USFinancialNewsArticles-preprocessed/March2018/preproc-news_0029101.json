Cricket - ODI - New Zealand vs England - Hagley Park, Christchurch, New Zealand, March 10, 2018. England’s Ben Stokes celebrates with team mate Joe Root after winning the one-day international match and series. REUTERS/Ross Setford. All-rounder Stokes, 26, was not present at Bristol Crown Court and denied the charges via video link from New Zealand where he is on duty with the England squad. Two other men charged along with Stokes also pleaded not guilty to the same charges. England’s second test against India at Lord’s starts on Aug. 9. The Bristol incident and the legal process that followed kept Stokes out of England’s Ashes tour of Australia but he returned to the team last month for the one-day international series against New Zealand.
