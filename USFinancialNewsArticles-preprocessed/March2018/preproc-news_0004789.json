The tariffs Mr. Trump announced of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum mark some of the steepest protections the U.S. has imposed in years , the WSJ’s Jacob S. Schlesinger, Peter Nicholas and Louise Radnofsky report. Mr. Trump says they’re aimed at protecting national security and reviving American producers he says have been battered by years of unfair trade. The curbs could hit imports from countries including Canada, South Korea and Brazil. The WSJ’s Andrew Tangel writes they’re likely to ripple across the U.S. economy , hitting manufacturers of goods from jets and cars to beer cans that already have been coping with higher commodity prices. Some countries already are warning of retaliation, but a bigger concern is that actions could fracture a global trading system built up over decades under the World Trade Organization.\nLumber costs are turning sharply upward, assuming buyers can even get diminished wood supplies delivered. A series of fires across prime forests along with a trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada have crimped the amount of timber in the market, the WSJ’s Benjamin Parkin writes, and a shortage of railcars and trucks is adding steeper transportation costs to record-high prices for lumber . One broker says the business faces “a lumber supply crisis,” and the construction companies that buy the materials say the rising costs will drive up prices for new homes. The price-supply concerns are adding to growing stresses in the U.S. housing market, with home sales sputtering and inventories of homes tight. Builders expect to step up the pace of construction this spring, but double-digit gains in transport rates in some markets means the costs will keep rising even when they can find the lumber they need.\nAmazon.com Inc. is starting to feel pain from a natural result of moving into the grocery business—spoilage. Investors looking at the company’s recent drive into the supermarket arena are pushing Amazon to explain how much of the food from its operations goes to waste . The demand from Green Century Capital Management, Inc. and other investors is through a request to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the WSJ’s Heather Haddon and Laura Stevens report, and comes as Amazon is bulking up in a field where waste counts for a major cost. Food retailers alone are responsible for waste worth some $18 billion a year, according to nonprofit ReFED, roughly double the sector’s profit from food sales. The waste creates environmental concerns, but investors say it also can put a cloud over earnings. More investors are pushing companies to change food-waste and packaging practices that they see as a potential drag on profits in a low-margin business.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES A U.S. Steel Corp. facility in Granite City, Ill. Photo: Bloomberg News KFC is topping off its supply-chain troubles in the U.K. with a new shortage crisis. The restaurant chain, which had to close many of its outlets in the country after the disastrous rollout of a new distribution contract with DHL, finally has the chickens mostly where they need to be. But the BBC reports KFC now is facing a nasty aftertaste with a shortage of gravy . KFC, which has 900 restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland, last month switched its supplier contract from Bidvest Logistics to DHL, which worked with Quick Service Logistics to overhaul the company’s delivery network and consolidate much of the operation into a single distribution center. The troubled result provided a lesson in the gap between designing far-flung and fast-moving distribution networks and actually putting them into motion. The ongoing problems, which the chain pins on DHL, suggest that fixing such troubled operations is harder than simply delivering a bucket of chicken.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ The cardinal rule when you’re a supplier is you don’t run out of what you need to supply.
