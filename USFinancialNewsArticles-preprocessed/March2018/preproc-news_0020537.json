    "text": "BEVERLY, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ARA) (“ARA” or the “Company”), a leading provider of outpatient dialysis services, today announced financial and operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nCertain metrics, including those expressed on an adjusted basis, are Non-GAAP financial measures (See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation tables further below).\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights (all percentage changes compare Q4 2017 to Q4 2016 unless noted):\nNet patient service operating revenues decreased 2% to $194.4 million; Net income attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. was $0.2 million as compared to a loss of $7.1 million; Adjusted EBITDA less noncontrolling interests (“Adjusted EBITDA-NCI”) was $28.6 million as compared to $32.2 million; Adjusted net income attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. was $6.0 million or $0.18 per share for Q4 2017; Total dialysis treatments increased 6.7%, of which 6.1% was non-acquired growth; and As of December 31, 2017, the Company operated 228 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 15,600 patients.\nJoseph (Joe) Carlucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results. As I reflect on 2017, I could not be more proud of how our organization has responded, and frankly risen above, many of the challenges we faced a little over a year ago. I believe we have entered 2018 in a stronger position to grow - driven by a more sustainable cost structure, continued execution on our development program, and other operational tailwinds. We also enter 2018 with an even greater focus on building upon our operating model to integrate patient care even more closely with our physician partners. We are doing this from a position of strength because the partnership model we’ve developed has been validated by strong quality metrics, outstanding patient satisfaction and industry-leading physician satisfaction rates.”\n“During the fourth quarter of 2017, our organization maintained its strong focus on delivering quality patient care, while sustaining the performance in the operational initiatives we outlined in early 2017. We delivered on the commitments we made by achieving our 2017 financial guidance, and we are establishing 2018 guidance that is underpinned by solid fundamentals,” continued Carlucci.\nFinancial and operating highlights include:\nRevenue: Net patient service operating revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $194.4 million, a decrease of 2.4% as compared to $199.1 million for the prior-year period due to adverse changes in payor mix, partially offset by treatment growth. Net patient service operating revenues for the year ending December 31, 2017 were $745.1 million, a decrease of 0.6% as compared to $749.8 million for the prior-year period.\nTreatment Volume: Total dialysis treatments for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 565,945, representing an increase of 6.7% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-acquired treatment growth was 6.1% and acquired treatment growth was 0.6% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Total dialysis treatments for the year ending December 31, 2017 were 2,191,172, representing an increase of 8.1% over the prior year period. Non-acquired treatment growth was 7.9% and acquired treatment growth was 0.2% for the year ending December 31, 2017.\nClinic Activity: As of December 31, 2017, the Company provided services at 228 outpatient dialysis clinics serving 15,637 patients. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we opened nine de novo clinics, acquired three dialysis clinics and merged one clinic into another. For the year ending December 31, 2017, we opened 15 de novo clinics, acquired three dialysis clinics, merged two clinics and sold two clinics. As of December 31, 2017, we had 25 signed de novo clinics scheduled to open in the future.\nNet income, Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, Net income (loss) attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc., Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less noncontrolling interests:\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) 2017 2016 Amount Percentage Change* Net income $ 19,718 $ 16,560 $ 3,158 19.1 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (19,487 ) (23,679 ) (4,192 ) (17.7 )% Net income (loss) attributable to ARA $ 231 $ (7,119 ) $ 7,350 NM Non-GAAP financial measures**: Adjusted EBITDA $ 48,051 $ 55,880 $ (7,829 ) (14.0 )% Adjusted EBITDA less noncontrolling interests $ 28,564 $ 32,201 $ (3,637 ) (11.3 )% (Unaudited)\nYear Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) 2017 2016 Amount Percentage Change* Net income $ 75,683 $ 88,205 $ (12,522 ) (14.2 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (70,826\n) (88,590 ) (17,764 ) (20.1 )% Net income (loss) attributable to ARA $\n4,857\n$\n(385\n) $ 5,242 NM Non-GAAP financial measures**: Adjusted EBITDA $\n176,357\n$ 212,172 $ (35,815 ) (16.9 )% Adjusted EBITDA less noncontrolling interests $ 105,531 $ 123,582 $ (18,051 ) (14.6 )% * NM - Not Meaningful\n** See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nOperating Expenses: Patient care costs for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $124.5 million, or 64.0% of net patient service operating revenues, as compared to $121.1 million, or 60.8% (or 59.9% excluding the Modification Expense described below) of net patient service operating revenues, in the prior-year period.

These excluded GAAP measures include noncontrolling interests, interest expense, income taxes, and other charges. We expect the variability of these charges to have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\nPlease see the “Forward-Looking Statements” section of this release for a discussion of certain risks to our outlook.\nConference Call\nAmerican Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. will hold a conference call to discuss this release on Wednesday, March 7, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI provide information useful for evaluating our business and a further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends because Adjusted EBITDA excludes the results of actions that are outside the operational control of management, but can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We believe Adjusted EBITDA-NCI is helpful in highlighting the amount of Adjusted EBITDA that is available to us after reflecting the interests of our joint venture partners. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI are not measures of operating performance computed in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operations, or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in conformity with GAAP, or as measures of profitability or liquidity. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI may not be indicative of historical operating results, and we do not mean for these items to be predictive of future results of operations or cash flows. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these items in isolation, or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI:\ndo not include stock-based compensation expense, and beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2017, do not include associated payroll taxes; do not include transaction-related costs; do not include depreciation and amortization—because construction and operation of our dialysis clinics requires significant capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization are a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits; do not include interest expense—as we have borrowed money for general corporate purposes, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits and cash flows; do not include income tax receivable agreement income and expense; do not include loss on early extinguishment of debt; do not include costs related to certain legal matters; beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2016, do not include executive and management severance costs; do not include management fees; do not include certain income tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us and other non-income based taxes; and do not reflect gain on sale of assets.\nIn addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not adjusted for the portion of earnings that we distribute to our joint venture partners.\nYou should not consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI as alternatives to income from operations or net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of our operating performance, or as alternatives to cash provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, since not all companies use identical calculations.\nWe use Adjusted net income attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. because it is a useful measure to evaluate our performance by excluding the impact of certain items that we believe are not related to our normal business operations and/or are a result of changes in our liabilities from period to period. See the notes to the tables below for further explanation of the exclusion of certain items. By excluding these items we believe Adjusted net income allows us and investors to evaluate our net income on a more consistent basis. “Adjusted net income attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc.” is defined as Net income (loss) attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. plus or minus, as applicable, share-based compensation due to option modifications and other transactions at the time of the Company’s initial public offering, certain legal matter costs, loss on early extinguishment of debt, transaction-related costs, executive and management severance costs, gain on sale of assets, income tax receivable agreement income/expense, tax valuation allowance and other tax adjustments, and accounting changes in fair value of noncontrolling interest puts, net of taxes as applicable. We use the Adjusted weighted average number of diluted shares to calculate Adjusted net income attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. per share. The Adjusted weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is calculated using the treasury method as if certain unvested in-the-money options subject to a contingency are treated as being vested to provide investors with a calculation of the fully-diluted number of shares assuming certain pre-IPO options vest.\nWe use Adjusted cash provided by operating activities less distributions to NCI because it is a useful measure to evaluate the cash flow that is available to the Company for investment in property, plant and equipment, debt service, growth and other general corporate purposes. “Adjusted cash provided by operating activities less distributions to noncontrolling interests” is defined as cash provided by operating activities plus transaction-related expenses less distributions to noncontrolling interests.\nWe use Adjusted owned net debt because it is a useful metric to evaluate the Company’s share of interests in the cash on our consolidated balance sheet and the debt of the Company. “Adjusted owned net debt” is defined as debt (other than clinic-level debt) plus clinic-level debt guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries of American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. less cash (other than clinic-level cash) less the Company’s pro rata interest in Clinic-level cash. “Owned net leverage” is defined as the ratio of Owned net debt to our trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA-NCI.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI for the periods indicated:\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited) Reconciliation of Net income to Three Months Ended Year Ended Adjusted EBITDA: December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $ 19,718 $ 16,560 $ 75,683 $ 88,205 Add: Stock-based compensation 1,269 17,047 16,359 40,298 Depreciation and amortization 9,740 9,246 37,634 33,862 Interest expense, net 7,237 7,362 29,289 35,933 Income tax expense (benefit) and other non-income based tax 9,029 (2,166 ) 8,474 (753 ) Transaction-related costs — — 717 2,239 Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — 526 4,708 Income tax receivable agreement (income) expense (1,773 ) 3,444 (7,234 ) (1,286 ) Certain legal matters (1) 3,535 2,737 15,249 6,779 Executive and management severance costs (2) — 1,650 917 1,650 Gain on sale of assets (704 ) — (1,257 ) — Management fees — — — 537 Adjusted EBITDA (including noncontrolling interests) $ 48,051 $ 55,880 $ 176,357 $ 212,172 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (19,487 ) (23,679 ) (70,826 ) (88,590 ) Adjusted EBITDA –NCI $ 28,564 $ 32,201 $ 105,531 $ 123,582\n(1) Certain legal matters costs include legal fees and other expenses associated with matters outside the ordinary course of our business, including, but not limited to, our handling of, and response to, the UnitedHealth litigation, a now-concluded SEC inquiry, the CMS request for information, the securities and derivative litigation, and the Company’s internal review and analysis of factual and legal issues relating to the aforementioned matters as described in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
