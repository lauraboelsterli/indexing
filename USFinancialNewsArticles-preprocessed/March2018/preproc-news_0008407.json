    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Ministry of Defense said on Monday that Washington was flouting a U.N. resolution on Syria by failing to stop rebels it controlled from launching daily attacks on the Syrian army in eastern Ghouta and shelling Damascus.\nMoscow was responding to a U.S. allegation on Sunday that Russian aircraft had flown bombing missions over the besieged eastern Ghouta region in defiance of a United Nations ceasefire.\nThe ministry said Washington was the one breaching the U.N. resolution, saying it had done nothing to stop rebel shelling of Damascus from eastern Ghouta in which civilians had been killed.\nIt also said the U.S. had done nothing to stop rebel attacks in eastern Ghouta which it said had been designed to alter the borders of a de-escalation zone.\n“Washington does nothing to tame militants under its control in eastern Ghouta,” the ministry said in a statement.\nRussia also flatly rejected the U.S. allegation that Russia was ignoring the U.N. resolution on a ceasefire in Syria, it said.\nReporting by Polina Ivanova; Writing by Maria Tsvetkova; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ",
