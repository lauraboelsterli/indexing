Berluti is headed by Antoine Arnault.\nLVMH hired Ackermann, a respected stylist who had created his own brand in 2003, in September 2016.\nAckermann’s departure comes just a few weeks after LVMH’s Christian Dior label announced that its menswear designer Kris Van Assche was leaving the label after 11 years.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; editing by Richard Lough\n ",
