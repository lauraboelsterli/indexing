    "text": "Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said the company will see $15 billion in revenue in 2018, according to a report from USA Today . \nThe streaming giant posted $11.7 billion in revenue for 2017 and has not previously issued full-year revenue guidance for 2018. \nThe company had only issued guidance for operating margin, which it claims as its \"primary profit metric,\" forecasting an increase of 300 basis points year over year in 2018. \nThe company has said it will invest more heavily in content and marketing in the coming year, as it faces increasing pressure from relative newcomers in streaming, Apple , Amazon and Hulu.\nNetflix is also likely to face a challenge from Disney 's forthcoming streaming service. \nRead the full USA Today report here.",
