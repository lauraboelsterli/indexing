    "text": "OTTAWA, March 28 (Reuters) - Canada’s chief NAFTA negotiator said on Wednesday that there is still quite a bit of work to be done at the three-nation talks to modernise North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nWhen asked by reporters whether NAFTA negotiators were close to a deal, Steve Verheul, Canada’s chief negotiator, said: “No, we’ve got quite a bit of work do yet”. Asked whether a deal could be done in April, he replied: “That would be a bit of a challenge.”\nVerheul was speaking to reporters after meeting union representative from Canada and Mexico to discuss NAFTA.
