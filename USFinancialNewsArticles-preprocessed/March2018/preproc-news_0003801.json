Gross sales for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 10.1 percent to $934.8 million from $848.8 million for the same period last year. Favorable currency exchange rates increased net sales by approximately $7.3 million and gross sales by approximately $9.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter. Net sales and gross sales in the 2017 fourth quarter were adversely affected by inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors. The Company estimates that net sales in the 2017 fourth quarter were adversely affected by approximately 2 percent due to such reductions.\nNet sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which is comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Hydro® energy drinks and Mutant® Super Soda drinks, increased 7.6 percent to $736.1 million for the 2017 fourth quarter, from $684.4 million for the same period last year. Net sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, increased 7.8 percent to $69.6 million for the 2017 fourth quarter, from $64.5 million in the comparable 2016 quarter. Net sales for the Company’s Other segment, which includes certain products of American Fruits & Flavors (“AFF”) sold to independent third parties, were $4.7 million for both the 2017 and 2016 fourth quarters.\nNet sales to customers outside the United States increased 8.7 percent to $210.4 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, from $193.5 million in the corresponding quarter last year.\nGross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2017 fourth quarter was 62.1 percent as compared to 66.1 percent in the 2016 fourth quarter, primarily attributable to sales mix, inventory reserves in China, lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the 2016 fourth quarter, as well as to increases in certain other costs.\nOperating expenses for the 2017 fourth quarter were $236.5 million, compared with $246.4 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. The comparable 2016 fourth quarter operating expenses included distributor termination expenses of $46.3 million.\nDistribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.6 percent for the 2017 fourth quarter, compared with 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter last year.\nSelling expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter were 13.6 percent, compared with 12.0 percent in the fourth quarter last year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the 2017 fourth quarter were $96.7 million, or 11.9 percent of net sales, compared with $132.2 million, or 17.5 percent of net sales, for the 2016 fourth quarter. General and administrative expenses for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter, excluding distributor terminations of $46.3 million, were $85.8 million, or 11.4 percent of net sales. Stock-based compensation (a non-cash item) was $13.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $12.1 million in the comparable quarter last year.\nOperating income for the 2017 fourth quarter increased to $267.1 million from $251.7 million in the comparable quarter last year.\nThe effective tax rate for the 2017 fourth quarter was 24.8 percent, compared with 29.9 percent in the same period last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase of $69.2 million in the stock compensation deduction related to excess tax benefits that are recorded in net income. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a provisional charge of $39.8 million related to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 and a $2.1 million charge for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits, as a result of the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nNet income for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 16.4 percent to $201.3 million from $172.9 million in the comparable quarter last year. Net income per diluted share for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 17.5 percent to $0.35 from $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: “Our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola system bottlers continues to progress. During the fourth quarter, we launched our Monster Energy® brand in a number of smaller countries with Coca-Cola system bottlers, and are currently planning for further launches or transitions in 2018, including in Argentina, Armenia, Belarus and Tanzania in the first quarter and are at an advanced stage for a relaunch of our Monster Energy® brand in India. In the United States, we are in the process of launching Caffé Monster™, an energy coffee, in 13.7 oz. glass bottles in three flavors, as well as Muscle Monster® in 15 oz. plastic bottles in two flavors. Further product launches are planned for 2018 in both our domestic and international markets, including Mutant®, positioned as an affordable energy brand, in South East Asia and Pakistan in the first half of 2018,” Sacks added.\n2017 Twelve-Months\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 10.5 percent to $3.4 billion from $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the disclosure of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.\nCaution Concerning\nCertain statements made in this announcement may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws, as amended, regarding the expectations of management with respect to our future operating results and other future events including revenues and profitability. The Company cautions that these statements are based on management’s current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of the control of the Company, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made herein. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to recognize benefits from The Coca-Cola Company transaction and the American Fruits & Flavors transaction; the effect of The Coca-Cola Company’s refranchising initiative, our ability to introduce and increase sales of both existing and new products; our ability to implement the share repurchase program; unanticipated litigation concerning the Company’s products; changes in consumer preferences; changes in demand due to obesity and other perceived health concerns, including concerns relating to certain ingredients in our products or packages; changes in demand due to product safety concerns; changes in demand due to both domestic and international economic conditions; activities and strategies of competitors, including the introduction of new products and competitive pricing and/or marketing of similar products; actual performance of the parties under the new distribution agreements; potential disruptions arising out of the transition of certain territories to new distributors; changes in sales levels by existing distributors; unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the termination of existing distribution agreements or the transition to new distributors; changes in the price and/or availability of raw materials; other supply issues, including the availability of products and/or suitable production facilities including limitations on co-packing availability and retort production; product distribution and placement decisions by retailers and effects of retailer consolidation; unfavorable resolution of tax matters; changes in governmental regulation; the imposition of new and/or increased excise sales and/or other taxes on our products; criticism of energy drinks and/or the energy drink market generally; our ability to satisfy all criteria set forth in any U.S. model energy drink guidelines; the impact of proposals to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or restrict the venues and/or the size of containers in which energy drinks can be sold; unforeseen economic and political changes and local or international catastrophic events; or political, legislative or other governmental actions or events, including the outcome of any state attorney general, government and/or quasi-government agency inquiries, in one or more regions in which we operate. For a more detailed discussion of these and other risks that could affect our operating results, see the Company’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
