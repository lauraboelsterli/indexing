Foti, Jr., remind investors that they have until May 29, 2018 to file lead plaintiff applications in a lawsuit against Patterson Companies, Inc. (Nasdaq:PDCO), if they purchased the Company’s shares between June 26, 2015 and February 28, 2018, inclusive (the “Class Period”). This action is pending in the United States District of Minnesota.\nWhat You May Do\nIf you purchased shares of Patterson and would like to discuss your legal rights and how this case might affect you and your right to recover for your economic loss, you may, without obligation or cost to you, contact KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or via email ( lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com ), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqgs-pdco/ to learn more. If you wish to serve as a lead plaintiff in this class action, you must petition the Court by May 29, 2018 .\nAbout the Lawsuit\nPatterson and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.\nOn February 12, 2018, the Federal Trade Commission disclosed that it had filed a complaint against the Company for violating antitrust regulations through a conspiracy with other dental supply companies to fix the prices of dental products and refuse to offer discounts or service to buying groups representing dental practitioners. Then, on March 1, 2018, the Company revealed dismal financial results for 2018Q3 and the departure of its Chief Financial Officer.\nOn this news, the price of Patterson’s shares plummeted $7.48 per share, or 23% in one day.\nAbout Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC\nKSF, whose partners include former Louisiana Attorney General Charles C. Foti, Jr., is a law firm focused on securities, antitrust and consumer class actions, along with merger & acquisition and breach of fiduciary litigation against publicly traded companies on behalf of shareholders.
