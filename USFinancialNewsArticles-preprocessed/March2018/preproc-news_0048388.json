Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street to attend Prime Minister's Questions, in London, March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville \n“If there are those who are trying to suggest that the government should be rejecting the result of the referendum as a result of these sort of claims, I say to them very clearly ... the referendum was held, the vote was taken, the people gave their view and we will be delivering on it,” May told parliament.
