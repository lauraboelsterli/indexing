This is the first year that the prestigious Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago received a first-place ranking. \nAll of the schools on in the top 10 are difficult to get into, but some stand out as being particularly selective. Stanford University had the lowest acceptance rate, with just 5.7 percent of applicants being accepted into a class of 853 students. \nThe cost of attending a top 10 business school ranges from $59,811 for out-of-state students at UC Berkeley to $78,772 at Harvard. \nFortunately, graduates from these programs earn some serious starting salaries. On average, graduates at these business schools earned well over six-figures. Graduates from the Wharton School of business at the University of Pennsylvania earned an average of $159,815 after graduation â€” the highest starting salary across all business schools in the country. \nLike this story?
