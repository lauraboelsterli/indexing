The Trump administration’s decision to levy tariffs on Chinese goods is triggering threats of retaliation from Beijing and big concerns over U.S. exports , worries deep enough to pummel shares of American companies focused on manufacturing and international trade. The WSJ’s Bob Davis reports that President Donald Trump said the tariffs would hit goods with a combined total value of “about $60 billion,” although the administration said earlier they would cover $50 billion of imports. That amounts to about 10% of U.S. imports from China, and the administration chose 1,300 product categories that may be covered. China quickly fired a retaliatory shot back against what called a “vile” action, targeting for higher tariffs $3 billion in U.S. goods, including fruit, pork, recycled aluminum and steel pipes . Bigger items like Boeing Co. aircraft and soybeans weren’t on Beijing’s list, suggesting there’s still room for negotiations, or for the confrontation to escalate.\nUber Technologies Inc. is getting caught in the same quandary as shippers as it tries to grow in a boisterous U.S. freight market. The company looking for trucks in a high-demand period where capacity is commanding a premium, WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes, Uber Freight is facing the reality that its ride-sharing model won’t work for freight the way it does in matching passengers with automobiles . As the one-year-old business scales up, it’s contending with the driver shortage--just like other freight businesses. The app-based operator hopes new incentives, including discounts on fuel and equipment, will attract drivers to its platform. But the bigger lure may come if Uber can prove it can pay drivers faster than other load providers. That may push more established brokers to speed up their own payment terms, just as they’re trying to upgrade their technology.\nAn executive exodus at Whole Foods is raising concerns among suppliers. A string of top managers have left the grocery chain since Amazon.com Inc. acquired Whole Foods last year, including leaders in areas such as produce and local foods that are tied to specialty suppliers embedded in the grocer’s culture. The WSJ’s Heather Haddon and Laura Stevens report the companies say they’re making big strides in integrating operations and overhauling back-office functions , including inventory management. Whole Foods’ main distributor, United Natural Foods Inc., even reported a 19% year-over-year jump in business to the chain last quarter. Whole Foods invited top suppliers in to discuss their frustration with operational changes, including fee increases that may push them to other retailers. Such unrest across the supply chain is a typical concern after big mergers. But some suppliers worry the executive departures mean that changes in strategy will be deeper and longer-lasting than they had bargained for.\nCOMMODITIES The Port of Shanghai. Photo: Bloomberg News Chocolate is hot all of a sudden, at least for investors. The U.S. price for cocoa has surged 31% this year, making the chocolate ingredient one of the year’s stars in a rebounding commodities market. The gains aren’t necessarily coming because consumers are growing that much fonder of chocolate, the WSJ’s David Hodari reports, but because earlier expectations for an oversupply of cocoa have crumbled as production has weakened and traders have been rejecting more low-quality beans at ports. Cocoa prices have been especially volatile in the past couple of years, with futures swinging up and down at double-digit rates. The wild swings come in a market for final demand that is relatively stable, meaning buyers often stock up months in advance to protect against volatility. Still, demand for cocoa in Europe is growing rapidly, and that could push prices even higher, at least until production heats up again.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ You never want to have to turn down a load to a customer because you can’t find a truck. ’\n—Evan Armstrong, president of Armstrong & Associates.\nNumber of the Day 12.7% Year-over-year increase in rail intermodal shipments in the third week of March, the third straight double-digit annual increase, according to the Association of American Railroads.\nIN OTHER NEWS Business activity in the eurozone slowed for the second straight month in March.
