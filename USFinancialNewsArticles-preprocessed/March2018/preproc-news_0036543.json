    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Today the country's fifth largest retail lender, loanDepot, announced Tammy Richards will join the executive team as Chief Operations Officer for enterprise mortgage operations. Richards has 30+ years of experience, and has been a C-Level executive during the industry's shift into contemporary times.\n\"As I help our industry move into the modern digital era, there is only one team I wanted to join,\" said Richards. \"loanDepot—with its current positioning and recent launch of sister company mello Home to expand services for customers—is the best place to bring my expertise, and I'm thrilled to join the leading FinTech team.\"\nRichards has served in senior roles at Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and most recently Caliber Home Loans. In her impressive career, she's overseen the move to digital mortgage processing and e-signings, reduced costs, and driven company efficiency and growth at scale.\n\"Leaders like Tammy who truly understand how to blend technology and high-touch service are rare in the mortgage industry,\" said Jeff Walsh, loanDepot's Chief Operating Officer. \"She gets our vision of expanding to meet customer needs with new offerings beyond mortgage, and is the best person to drive tech-enabled process improvement.\"\nRichards will report to Walsh and oversee about 1,600 team members. She will grow and refine loan production, and manage underwriting, processing, credit policy, funding/closing processes, and quality controls. She will be located in our Southern California headquarters, and collaborate closely with our recently launched state-of-the-art mello Innovation Lab—which houses 450+ developers and engineers—to simplify and improve the loan process.\nActive in her community, Richards established a literacy program for adults and a reading program in a local elementary school in Orange County, California. She is a coordinator for the Special Olympics and volunteers with UNICEF and the Primary Children's Medical Center.\nShe holds a Black Belt Six Sigma and studied business administration from the University of Phoenix.\nAbout loanDepot\nloanDepot is the nation's fifth largest retail mortgage lender and second largest nonbank consumer lender.
