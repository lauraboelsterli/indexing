Ayton took over again, scoring the first seven points in overtime as the Wildcats blanked the Bruins in the decisive five-minute period.\nSenior center Thomas Welsh had 17 points and tied a career high with 17 rebounds and junior guard Aaron Holiday had 15 points for the Bruins (21-11), who missed all seven of their field-goal attempts in overtime.\nFreshman starting guard Kris Wilkes had 12 points and senior forward Gyorgy Goloman had nine points and two 3-pointers for the UCLA, which already had cemented its spot in the NCAA Tournament.\nDefending champion Arizona will USC, who defeated Oregon 74-54, in the final on Saturday. The Wildcats beat USC in their only meeting on Feb. 10.\nAyton had his 22nd double-double, tying the Arizona freshman record set by Al Fleming. Former Bruins star Kevin Love holds the Pac-12 record with 23.\nWelsh had his 18th double-double of the season. Ayton and Welsh were the only Pac-12 players to average a double-double this season. Ayton averaged 19.6 points and a league-high 11.3 rebounds. Welsh averaged 12.8 and 10.5.\nAyton had a free throw, two layups and a 15-footer in the first three minutes of overtime for a 74-67 lead Arizona never lost.\nHoliday, who entered with a conference-leading 20.5 scoring average, was 5 of 20 from the field while being guarded mainly by Jackson-Cartwright. Holiday was 3 of 12 on 3-pointers. He has 84 threes this season, second in the league.\nArizona committed only six turnovers.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
