(NYSE: BFAM) (the “Company”) today announced the pricing of the previously announced underwritten public offering by certain of its stockholders, including certain of its executive officers and directors (the “Selling Stockholders”) of 4,606,062 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $102.70 per share. The Company has agreed to repurchase from the underwriter 800,000 shares of the 4,606,062 shares of common stock being sold by the Selling Stockholders at a per-share purchase price equal to the price payable by the underwriter to the Selling Stockholders. As such, only 3,806,062 shares of the 4,606,062 shares of common stock being sold by the Selling Stockholders will be sold to the public. The Selling Stockholders will receive all of the net proceeds from this offering. No shares are being sold by the Company. The offering is expected to close on March 29, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nMorgan Stanley is acting as the sole underwriter for the offering.\nAn automatic shelf registration statement (including a prospectus) relating to the offering of common stock was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 10, 2017 and became effective upon filing.

LLC, Attn: Prospectus Department, 180 Varick Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10014.\nThe offering of these securities will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.

These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “projects,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates” or “anticipates,” or, in each case, their negatives or other variations or comparable terminology. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future, including risks and uncertainties relating to the consummation of the proposed offering by the Selling Stockholders and the repurchase by the Company and the risks identified, or incorporated by reference, in the prospectus supplement or accompanying prospectus.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180327005457/en/\nInvestors:\nBright Horizons\nElizabeth Boland, 617-673-8125\nCFO\neboland@brighthorizons.com\nor\nSolebury Communications Group\nKevin Doherty, 203-428-3233\nMD\nkdoherty@soleburyir.com\nor\nMedia:\nBright Horizons\nIlene Serpa, 617-673-8044\nVP – Communications\niserpa@brighthorizons.com\nSource: Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc.",
