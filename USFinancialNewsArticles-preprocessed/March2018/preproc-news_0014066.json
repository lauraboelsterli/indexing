    "text": "MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hydrogenics Corporation (NASDAQ:HYGS) (TSX:HYG) (\"Hydrogenics\" or \"the Company\"), a leading developer and manufacturer of hydrogen generation and hydrogen-based power modules, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. Results are reported in US dollars and are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n2017 Highlights\nRecord fourth quarter and full year 2017 revenue of $19.5 million and $48.1 million, respectively, up 124 percent and 66 percent, respectively, compared to the prior-year periods Fourth quarter 2017 gross margin of 28.6% compared to 22.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 Breakeven Adjusted EBITDA 2 in the 2017 fourth quarter versus a loss of $1.7 million in the prior-year period Increase in total cash to $22.4 million as of December 31, 2017, reflecting $6.5 million in positive cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter\n“I am pleased to announce record results for both the fourth quarter and 2017 as a whole,” said Daryl Wilson, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We posted revenue of $19.5 million in the final three months of 2017, driving top line performance up 66% to over $48 million for the year. This clearly illustrates the increasing demand for our proprietary applications, the breadth of our product portfolio, and the desire of many nations – particularly China – to move towards hydrogen-based energy solutions. Our Chinese revenue was strong last year, as we continued expanding our presence and the customers we serve across this robust market. Going forward, we remain bullish on the fuel cell mobility space, whether for buses in China, trains in Europe, or trucks in North America.\n“At the same time, our gross margin rebounded by over 6% to close to 29% in the fourth quarter, benefiting from product mix as well as higher economies of scale, which we expect to continue given the strength of our backlog and current trends within the industry. In addition, our total cash balance rose to $22.4 million at year-end due to improved financial results and resulting positive cash flow from operations. We believe 2018 will be a year of strong growth and improving performance, which should leave the Company well positioned for higher shareholder returns going forward.”\nSummary of Results for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 (compared to the Quarter Ended December 31, 2016 unless otherwise noted)\nCompany revenue was $19.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an improvement of 124%, or $10.8 million, from the $8.7 million reported in the prior-year period. This increase reflects solid growth in both OnSite Generation and Power Systems. Hydrogenics secured $13.9 million of orders for renewable energy storage, industrial gas and power system applications during the quarter, resulting in an order backlog of $144.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Order backlog movement during the fourth quarter (in $ millions) was as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2017\nbacklog Orders\nReceived FX Orders\nDelivered/\nRevenue\nRecognized December 31, 2017\nbacklog OnSite Generation $ 27.0 $ 4.8 $ 0.7 $ 12.6 $ 19.9 Power Systems 120.5 9.1 2.0 6.9 124.7 Total $ 147.5 $ 13.9 $ 2.7 $ 19.5 $ 144.6 Of the above backlog of $144.6 million, Hydrogenics expects to recognize approximately $55 million in the following twelve months as revenue. Sales for the year ending December 31, 2018 will also include orders received and delivered in 2018.\nGross profit was $5.6 million (28.6% of revenue) in 2017 compared to $2.0 million (22.5% of revenue) in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in gross profit was principally due to improved product mix through increased production and delivery of standardized fuel cells for the mobility market, and economies of scale, particularly within the Power Systems business segment. Cash operating costs 1 increased $1.7 million, to $5.5 million, for the current quarter compared to $3.8 million for the prior-year period. This was principally due to an increase of $1.0 million in net research and development expenses (“R&D”) associated with the pending rollout of the Enbridge Power-to-Gas facility in Toronto, Canada and additional R&D related to hydrogen rail applications. The Company reported break-even Adjusted EBITDA 2 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a $1.7 million loss in the prior-year period. This change reflects the increase in both gross profit and cash operating costs noted above. The net loss for the quarter was $1.1 million, or $(0.07) per share, versus $2.5 million, or $(0.20) per share, in the prior-year period.\nTotal cash increased in the quarter by $2.1 million to $22.4 million on December 31, 2017 from $20.3 million on September 30, 2017 reflecting improved cash flow from operations offset by investments in capital assets and financing costs.\nSummary of Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 (compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016, unless otherwise noted)\nRevenue increased by $19.1 million, or 66%, to $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $29.0 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflected (i) an $11.6 million improvement in Power Systems revenue driven almost exclusively by growth within the Chinese mobility market; and (ii) a $7.5 million increase in OnSite Generation revenue principally driven by the delivery of energy storage projects in Europe and Asia.\nGross margin increased to 23.7% ($11.4 million) in 2017 from 20.7% ($6.0 million) in 2016, reflecting an improvement within the Power Systems group due principally to product mix, partially offset by a decline in the OnSite Generation gross margin from 20.0% to 14.1%, primarily due to lower than expected margins on some select projects in the second quarter of 2017. These projects faced unanticipated delays and overruns due to postponed construction and scope changes by the engineering firms responsible for the facilities where Hydrogenics’ electrolyzers would be located.\nCash operating costs were $17.8 million in 2017 compared to $13.9 million for 2016, with the increase principally driven by a $2.8 million increase in net R&D expense (primarily in the third and fourth quarter of 2017, as previously noted) and a $1.1 million increase in cash selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense driven partially by the foreign currency impact of the strengthening euro on euro-denominated SG&A expenses.\nHydrogenics’ Adjusted EBITDA loss decreased to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $7.6 million in the prior-year period due to the improved gross profit in the year, largely offset by the increase in cash operating costs noted above. Cash used in operating activities for the year improved by $8.4 million from $13.2 million in 2016 to $4.8 million in 2017.\nNotes\nCash operating costs are defined as the sum of SG&A and R&D, less amortization and depreciation, and stock-based compensation expense inclusive of compensation costs indexed to the Company’s share price. This is a non-IFRS measure and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Management uses this measure as a rough estimate of the amount of fixed costs to operate the Corporation and believes this is a useful measure for investors for the same purpose. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding stock-based compensation (both cash settled long term compensation indexed to share price and share based compensation), other finance income and expenses, depreciation and amortization. These items are considered by management to be outside of Hydrogenics’ ongoing operational results. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nConference Call Details\nHydrogenics will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EST on March 8, 2018 to review the fourth quarter results.
