    "text": "Frank Booker scored 25 points and Hassani Gravett produced all six of his points in overtime as South Carolina held off LSU 83-74 in a Southeastern Conference game Wednesday night in Columbia, S.C.\nThe Gamecocks outscored LSU 11-2 in overtime after losing a 15-point second-half lead. Booker made 8 of 10 shots, including 6 of 7 3-point attempts. Wesley Myers added 23 points for the Gamecocks (16-14, 7-10 SEC).\nTremont Waters scored 19 and Skylar Mays and Wayde Sims added 12 each to lead the Tigers (16-13, 7-10). LSU lost its seventh consecutive road game.\nGravett started the overtime scoring with a 3-pointer, then assisted on Maik Kotsar’s layup and made a jumper for a 79-72 lead with two minutes left.\nMyers and Gravett each sank a free throw before the Tigers scored their only points of overtime on Brandon Sampson’s tip-in with 45 seconds left.\nThe score was tied at halftime and there were four lead changes and another tie during the first four minutes of the second half.\nFelipe Haase, Booker and Justin Minaya each made a 3-pointer during a 15-2 run that gave South Carolina a 54-41 lead.\nThe Gamecocks led by 15 three times before the Tigers came back. Brandon Rachal scored five points as pulled LSU within 62-57.\nAfter Booker made a jumper, Sims scored five points and the Tigers closed within 64-62.\nHaase made a layup and Myers hit two free throws to give South Carolina a 68-62 lead with three minutes remaining.\nDuop Reath’s layup and Mays’ dunk got LSU within two with two minutes remaining.\nMyers made two free throws before Sims answered with a layup, leaving the Gamecocks with a 70-68 edge with 59 seconds left.\nKotsar made two free throws for South Carolina with 40 seconds left.\nReath made one of two free throws for the Tigers and Booker turned the ball over with 12 seconds left.\nAfter two timeouts, Waters went one-on-one and swished a 3-pointer with five seconds remaining to tie the score at 72.\nA desperation half-court shot by South Carolina missed everything, leading to overtime.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
