(Photo: Business Wire)\n“We are very excited to welcome Dr. Febbo, who comes to us at a transformative time in the evolution of genomic medicine,” said Garret Hampton, Ph.D., Executive Vice President of Clinical Genomics at Illumina. “Phil brings a wealth of clinical and scientific experience to Illumina, from understanding the genomic basis of common human cancers, to the development of clinical tests based on next generation sequencing. We believe that his experience will ensure that Illumina is uniquely positioned to change medical practice with the use of genomics.”\nFor the past 25 years, Dr. Febbo has worked at leading institutions throughout the United States, most recently serving as CMO of Genomic Health (NASDAQ:GHDX). Prior to joining Genomic Health, Dr. Febbo served as Professor of Medicine and Urology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where his laboratory focused on using genomics to understand the biology and clinical behavior of prostate cancer, and his clinical practice focused on genitourinary oncology. While at UCSF, Dr. Febbo was the co-leader of the Prostate Cancer Program at the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Program Principal Investigator of the Translational Research Program for the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology.\nDr. Febbo holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology from Dartmouth College, received his M.D. degree at UCSF, and completed his internal medicine residency at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. After his fellowship in medical oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, he was an Attending Physician in the Genitourinary Oncology Center at Dana-Farber, Instructor at Harvard Medical School, and a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Todd Golub's laboratory at Dana-Farber, as well as the Whitehead Institute Center for Genomic Research of MIT (now the Broad Institute). In 2004, Dr. Febbo moved to Duke University Medical Center’s Institute of Genome Sciences and Policy. He has been a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation since 2009.\nAbout Illumina\nIllumina is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.
