Combined with a full host of easy-to-use workflow tools and performance features, the Aplio i600 improves diagnostic confidence and enables clinicians to deliver quick, reliable exams.\nThe Aplio i600 provides intuitive ergonomics to help boost productivity during routine and complex exams thanks to its small and light iSense design which makes it easy for clinicians to adjust the console to virtually any scanning position.
