    "text": "47 Transplantation Centers Offering AlloSure\n9 Centers Enrolled in K-OAR\nBRISBANE, Calif., March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CareDx, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNA), a molecular diagnostics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated, high-value diagnostic solutions for transplant patients, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent highlights:\nAlloSure commercially launched on October 9, 2017\n-- As of February 28, 2018, 47 U.S. transplant centers providing AlloSure testing to patients\n-- Continued progress in Kidney Allograft Outcomes AlloSure Registry (K-OAR) enrollment, with 9 centers initiated as clinical trial sites as of February 28, 2018 Achieved total revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 of $12.5 million\n-- AlloSure® testing revenue of $0.5 million, representing 282 test results provided to kidney transplant patients\n-- AlloMap® testing revenue of $8.1 million, with fourth quarter US test volume increasing 8% year-over-year to 3,840 tests\n-- Product revenue of $3.7 million Revenue for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $48.3 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year Announced refinancing of debt with Perceptive Advisors, to be completed in April 2018\n“The initial AlloSure interest and traction we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2017 continues in 2018,” said Peter Maag, CareDx President and Chief Executive Officer. “As of February 28, 2018, 47 centers are offering this high-value diagnostic test to kidney transplant patients across the US. Additionally, we enrolled our first patients and centers in the K-OAR registry and remain on-track to initiate 35 centers in this innovative study collecting longer-term outcome data on kidney transplant patients.”\nMaag added, “We believe our new and simplified capital structure positions CareDx to achieve its financial and operational goals going forward. I want to thank the entire CareDx team for our 2017 accomplishments and am looking forward to 2018 being another record year for the company. CareDx is well-positioned to become a leading provider of diagnostic solutions to the transplant community.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $12.5 million, an increase of 15% compared with $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Testing revenue for the quarter was $8.6 million compared with $7.4 million in the same period of 2016. Product revenue in the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $3.7 million, compared to $3.5 million in the same period of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the net loss was $31.7 million compared to a net loss of $15.5 million in the same period of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 net loss includes charges totaling $27.1 million for changes in the estimated fair values of warrant and derivative liabilities, and contingent consideration.

The change in cash and cash equivalents from $6.0 million as of September 30, 2017, is due to $19.5 million net cash received from a public offering of common stock and exercises of common stock warrants and options, partially offset by approximately $6.5 million net cash used to repay debt, bank overdraft and deferred purchase obligations, and $2.1 million net cash used in operating activities.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $48.3 million, an increase of 19% compared with $40.6 million in full year 2016 revenue.

The full year 2017 net loss includes charges totaling $30.8 million for changes in the estimated fair values of warrant and derivative liabilities, and contingent consideration. Basic and diluted net loss per share were $2.38 compared to $2.39 in the full year 2016.\nNon-GAAP net loss was $16.1 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $13.8 million in 2016.

These forward-looking statements are based upon information that is currently available to CareDx and its current expectations, speak only as of the date hereof, and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including general economic and market factors, among others discussed in CareDx’s filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 filed by CareDx with the SEC on April 21, 2017 and the periodic reports that CareDx has subsequently filed with the SEC. Any of these may cause CareDx’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied by CareDx’s forward-looking statements. CareDx expressly disclaims any obligation, except as required by law, or undertaking to update or revise any such forward-looking statements.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCareDx has presented certain financial information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and also on a non-GAAP basis in this release, including non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share. We define non-GAAP net loss and per share results as the GAAP net loss and per share results excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation; changes in estimated fair value of warrants, derivative liabilities and contingent consideration; acquisition related impairment charges and amortization of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and related tax effects, costs involved with completing an acquisition; amortization of debt discount; and certain other financing charges. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in assessing our operating results through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core business operating results over multiple periods. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with CareDx's GAAP financial statements, because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of CareDx's operating results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided immediately following the financial tables.\nCONTACTS:\nCareDx, Inc.\nSasha King\nChief Commercial Officer\n415-287-2393\nsking@caredx.com\nInvestor Relations\nDavid Clair\nIntegrated Corporate Relations, Inc.\n646-277-1266\ndavid.clair@icrinc.com\nCareDx, Inc.
