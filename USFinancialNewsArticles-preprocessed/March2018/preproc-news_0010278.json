The company expanded its Horizon oil sands site last year.\nWCS heavy crude was trading on Thursday at $24.70 per barrel below WTI, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers data.\nThe Alberta government on Wednesday estimated that the higher-than-usual differential was costing heavy oil producers C$30 million to C$40 million in revenue per day.\nOverall daily production during the quarter rose 19 percent to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).\nThe company’s net income fell to C$396 million ($308.17 million), or 32 Canadian cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from C$566 million, or 51 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned 46 Canadian cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 36 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
