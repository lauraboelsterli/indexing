    "text": "BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE American: CDOR), a hotel-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) headquartered and incorporated in the state of Maryland, today announced the closing on the sale of a legacy hotel asset, the 135-room Comfort Suites located at 52939 US 933 North in South Bend, IN for $6.1 million. Net proceeds from the sale will be applied to outstanding debt on the Company’s $150 million secured credit facility.\n“With the closing of the sale of the Comfort Suites South Bend, we now own only three legacy hotels of the 55 that the Company owned at the beginning of 2015,” said Bill Blackham, Condor’s Chief Executive Officer. “Of the three legacy assets remaining, one is under contract for sale and one is being actively marketed for sale, though there can be no guarantee that these two planned dispositions will actually close. The portfolio transformation is substantially complete as we have now sold 52 legacy hotels generating over $150 million in gross proceeds and recycled the net proceeds into 14 high-quality select-service assets with an average age of less than four years old,” Mr. Blackham continued.\nAbout Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc.\nCondor Hospitality Trust, Inc.
