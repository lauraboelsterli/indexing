    "text": "March 22, 2018 / 10:45 AM / Updated an hour ago German justice minister calls in Facebook over data \"scandal\"   BERLIN (Reuters) - German Justice Minister Katarina Barley has asked to speak to Facebook executives to find out whether the social media site’s 30 million users in the country were affected by what she described as “scandal” involving personal data. A picture shows the Facebook logo at the Facebook office in Berlin, Germany, August 29, 2016. REUTERS/Stefanie Loos/Files Barley said it must be possible for users of social media sites to specify whether they are happy for their data to be used in certain ways, rather than just giving them the option to tick “yes” or not be able to use the service. “We know that companies respect the rules when sanctions are particularly painful,” she said on Thursday. “And the data protection basic regulation calls for fines of up to 4 percent of a company’s yearly global trunover.” Barley also said data protection had to be regulated at a European level, rather than by national governments.
