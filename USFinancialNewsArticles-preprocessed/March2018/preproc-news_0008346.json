Our average fee per credit card increased to RMB104.49 (US$16.06) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRevenues from advertising and marketing services and other services increased by 154% to RMB36.8 million (US$5.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB14.5 million in the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in revenues from big data and risk management solutions as well as an increase in the advertising services provided to credit card issuers.\nCost of revenues increased by 231% to RMB61.3 million (US$9.4 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB18.5 million in the prior year period.

The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to net loss or any other measure of performance or as indicators of our operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data. The Company encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before share-based compensation expenses. EBITDA represents net loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted net loss represents net loss before share-based compensation expenses.\nFor more information on this non-GAAP financial measure, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results\" set forth at the end of this press release.\nExchange Rate Information\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader.
