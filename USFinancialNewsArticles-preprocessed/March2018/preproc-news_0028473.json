    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 5:14 PM / in 38 minutes Sports court upholds four-year ban for Polish weightlifter Zielinski Reuters Staff 1 Min Read ZURICH (Reuters) - The Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Thursday confirmed a four-year period of ineligibility for Tomasz Zielinski, a Polish weightlifter who tested positive for a banned substance two years ago. Zielinski, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics, was given a four-year ban after testing positive for 19-Norandrosterone during a doping control during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. CAS rejected Zielinski’s appeal, deciding “it could not conclude otherwise than that the athlete had committed the anti-doping rule violation intentionally. Furthermore, the Panel did not find any reasons to reduce the four-year period of ineligibility”. Reporting by John Miller, editing by John Revill",
