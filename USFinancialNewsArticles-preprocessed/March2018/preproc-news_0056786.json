    "text": "HOUSTON, Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB:SPIN), today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 year ended December 31, 2017.\nDr. William Donovan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented, \"Fiscal 2017 marked a year of substantial progress in our commercialization efforts and our national affiliate expansion plans for Quad Video Halo. We continue to see significant interest in our Quad Video Halo through discussions with potential decision-makers and partners. We concluded the year with four Quad Video Halo systems in operation and 780 procedures conducted in 2017. The Quad Video Halo system continues to meet all of its performance requirements, and the level of satisfaction among doctors and patients continue to support and validate our entire business model.”\nDr. Donovan further stated, \"I am pleased to announce we have affiliate programs in Houston, Odessa, Tyler, and one in New Mexico. We are focusing our efforts on expanding our footprint by entering new states through the collaboration with doctors and affiliates by making the Quad Video Halo system available strategically based on geographics and market need.”\n2017 Financial Highlights\nWe collected $387k in collections 4Q17 bringing total collections to $17,900,000 since inception YOY cash provided (used) from Operations in 2017 vs 2016 - ($149,806) in 2017 vs $202,614 in 2016 Gross margin increased to 70% in 2017 vs 68% in 2016 Net loss in 2017 was $405,924 vs $755,945 in 2016 EPS (loss) (-.02) in 2017 vs (-.04) in 2016 Non cash charges totaled $309,991 in 2017 compared to $789,135 in 2016 Collections in 2017 totaled $1,799,201 vs $2,378,793 in 2016\nDr. William Donovan, continued; “Although we are pleased with our overall performance, we faced a number of events that adversely affected our operations. One of the major causes of the lower revenues was Hurricane Harvey. This devastated Houston and prevented many patients from getting to our Houston affiliate’s office for examinations and treatments. Most patients spent 2-3 months trying to clean up from the floods. Our office in Houston was closed for 2 full weeks and was only partially open for the next 2 months.”\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 versus 2016:\nWe recorded $1,855,615 in net revenues with $571,769 in costs of services and gross profit of $1,283,846 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2,117,078 in net revenues with $689,101 in costs of services and gross profit of $1,427,977 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe recognize revenue by reference to “net revenue,” which is gross amounts billed using CPT codes less account discounts that are expected to result when individual cases are ultimately settled. A discount rate of 48% based on settled patient cases, was used to determine net revenue during 2017 and 2016. Accordingly, we had gross revenues of $3,059,327 with net revenues of $1,855,615 for the year ended December 31, 2017, versus gross revenues of $3,537,791 with net revenues of $2,117,078 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExpenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 versus 2016:\nOperating, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,624,717 as compared to $2,087,266 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBad debt expense, included in operating, general and administrative expenses, totaled $270,000 and $683,338, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOther income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was an expense of $49,365 as compared to expense of $50,995 for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, other income of $6,357 offset by expenses of $55,722. For the year ended December 31, 2016, other income was $7,057 offset by expenses of $58,502.\nNet Income or Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 versus 2016:\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $405,924 compared to net loss of $755,945 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 versus 2016:\nDuring 2017, cash used in operating activities was $149,806 as compared to $202,616 of cash provided in 2016.\nCash flows used in financing activities totaled $25,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, consisting of a payment of current debt of $75,000, and $50,000 of draws on our line of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash flows used from financing activities totaled $120,000, consisting of a payment of long-term debt of $250,000 draws of $130,000 on the line of credit.\nConclusion\nDr. Donovan concluded, \"We continue to be optimistic by our commercial progress and the positive market feedback we have been receiving about the Quad Video Halo. We are continuing to discuss new opportunities with potential affiliate partners as part of our business development efforts. We are encouraged by the opportunities in our target markets, which we believe can derive significant benefits for doctors and patients.”\nConference Call Details\nConference Call: An investor's conference call with management will be held Today, Thursday, March 29, at 4:20 p.m. (EDT).
