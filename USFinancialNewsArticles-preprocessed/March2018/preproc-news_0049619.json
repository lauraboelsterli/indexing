LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,123.00, down 0.4 percent from its previous close. The Indian rupee will likely open lower against the U.S. currency, weighed by a selloff in regional equities and expected dollar demand from importers ahead of the long weekend. Indian government bonds are likely to rise today as market sentiment remains positive after New Delhi took steps to ease debt supply in first half of the next financial year. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.30 percent-7.36 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street closed sharply lower Tuesday, with each of the major U.S. indexes suffering their fourth decline in five sessions, fueled by a selloff in the tech sector. • Asian shares pulled back as Wall Street was knocked hard on concerns about tighter regulations on the tech industry, denting a brief global equities recovery driven by hopes of easing fears of a trade war between China and the United States. • The dollar stalled as lingering global trade tensions curbed its capacity to bounce back from recent lows. • U.S. Treasury yields fell on Tuesday with 10-year yield hitting six-week lows as fund managers purchased bonds to rebalance their portfolios for quarter-end, offsetting sales to make room for the record high $294 billion in government debt this week. • Oil prices fell, with Brent falling back below $70 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crudes dipping below $65, pulled down by a report of increasing U.S. crude inventories that surprised many traders. • Gold prices edged higher buoyed by a softer dollar, a day after the yellow metal recorded its biggest one-day percentage fall in nearly two weeks as U.S.-China trade spat concerns eased.
