This plan includes a 120% increase of the company’s quarterly dividend starting with the dividend to be declared in the June quarter, with a bias for the dividend to grow over time, and an additional $2 billion share repurchase authorization, with execution planned over the next 12 to 18 months.\nOn an annualized basis, a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share of common stock would return approximately $702 million to stockholders based on shares outstanding as of December 24, 2017. Dividend payments are subject to quarterly declaration by the Board.\nThe new authorization increases the share repurchase authorization granted in November 2017 to an aggregate of $4 billion. Repurchases may be made through both public market and private transactions, and may include the use of derivative contracts and structured share repurchase agreements. The share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n“Our significant increase in capital returns, including our plan to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to stockholders over the next five years, underscores our confidence in the sustainability of long-term data economy demand drivers and the strength of Lam,” stated Martin Anstice, chief executive officer of Lam Research. \"We continue to execute on our plan to increase shareholder returns through share repurchases and dividends over time as a complement to the substantial investments we are making to realize our long-term growth opportunities.”\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:\nStatements made in this press release that are not of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
