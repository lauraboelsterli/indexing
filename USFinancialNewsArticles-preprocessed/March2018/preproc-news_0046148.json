Britain's Home Secretary Amber Rudd, leaves 10 Downing Street in London, March 14, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville \n“In terms of illegal material, I still think there is much, much more they can do,” Rudd told a committee of lawmakers, adding that some offensive material should be taken down. \n“In some instances, they do make a decision themselves to remove the material which they find offensive. I do think there is more that can be done.” Reporting by Alistair Smout and Andrew MacAskill; editing by Stephen Addison",
