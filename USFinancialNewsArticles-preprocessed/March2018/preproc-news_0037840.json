Included in the fiscal 2018 second quarter and year-to-date earnings is an income tax benefit of approximately $600,000 related to the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liability due to the passage of H.R.1, known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”.\nMichael Pudil, president and chief executive officer, commented: “We are delighted to report that our fiscal 2018 second quarter sales were up 35% as compared to the prior fiscal second quarter. Our recreational powersports sales increased 27% in the fiscal 2018 second quarter. More importantly, our sales in our diversified group which includes energy, aerospace and defense, and industrial markets continued to accelerate and increased 92% year-to-date versus the prior year. These increases in sales directly affected our bottom line and we are pleased to report our year-to-date pretax income increased by $1.1 million over the prior year.” Pudil concluded: “We are excited and optimistic about our future. We have a twenty plus year relationship with our major customer that provides us with a solid base of business going forward and that, in combination with the continued growth in our diversified business, leads us to believe that our results will continue to improve.”\nThe Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $.04 per share. The dividend will be payable April 17, 2018 to holders of record on April 3, 2018. Pudil commented: “We are also pleased to announce the reinstatement of our dividend program. WSI has a solid balance sheet and believes that it sees the stability ahead that will support a dividend. We believe that a consistent dividend program is a further sign of WSI’s financial strength and improved business outlook. It is our objective to reward our shareholders with cash dividends as well as increasing share appreciation while, at the same time, maintaining our strong financial position. We believe the dividend program helps us accomplish these goals.”\nWSI Industries, Inc. is a leading contract manufacturer that specializes in the machining of complex, high-precision parts for a wide range of industries, including automotive, avionics and aerospace, energy, recreational powersports vehicles, small engines, marine, bioscience and the defense markets.\nFor additional information:\nMichael Pudil (President & CEO) or Paul D.
