The virus killed 1,380 birds at a rural farm with 1,900 approximately-80-weeks-old Rhode Island Red chickens and white chickens in the state of Guanajuato, the ministry said in the report posted on the website of the Paris-based OIE. The remaining birds were culled. Another outbreak was detected among backyard birds in the neighbouring state of Queretaro where it killed seven birds out of a flock of 26. Mexico had reported an outbreak of H7N3 in May last year. Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide, editing by Gus Trompiz",
