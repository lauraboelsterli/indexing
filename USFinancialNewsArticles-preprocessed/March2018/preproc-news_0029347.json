    "text": "GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- StarTek, Inc. (\"STARTEK\") (NYSE:SRT), a provider of business process outsourcing services, is reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nManagement Commentary\n“Today, we are announcing a strategic transaction involving Aegis, one of the leading global service providers of customer experience management,” said Chad Carlson, CEO of STARTEK. “This combination provides us with the opportunity to significantly diversify our revenue base and expand into new growth markets, while adding global economies of scale to enhance margins and profitability. We truly could not have found a more complementary partner to join us in our next evolution of growth.\n“In January, we entered into a multi-year strategic alignment with one of the largest and fastest growing companies in the world. This was a critical win that will enable us to expedite the diversification of our revenue while reducing vertical concentration in the wireless industry. We look forward to building upon this relationship for many years to come.\n“Q4 was certainly a challenge as we worked to conclude the high-grading initiative discussed last year to improve the overall quality of revenue. We experienced a delay in ramping new business due to client delays and a challenging labor market, which led to a drag on both revenue and margins. We also experienced soft call volumes related to the new iPhone X launch, which compares to robust volumes for the iPhone 7 in the 2016 quarter. We have been actively working with our clients this year to accelerate the new business ramps and more effectively align our cost structure.\n“Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on revenue diversification, operating efficiencies and providing a high level of service to our clients. We will also work diligently to ramp new business wins as we integrate with the Aegis platform. We are excited to embrace the new larger team once the transaction closes and work together to become a formidable global provider for clients. With the significant strategic developments announced this year, we are all the more confident in STARTEK’s position to realize sustainable, predictable, profitable growth.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter was $71.6 million compared to $77.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a temporary decline in production billings related to the company’s margin improvement initiative, as well as lower call volumes related to the iPhone X launch compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by new business and net growth from existing clients.\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.0 million compared to $10.7 million in the same period of 2016.\nGross margin in the fourth quarter was 8.4% compared to 13.8% in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the temporary decline in production billings while continuing to incur site fixed and variable costs related to new client ramps. This was partially offset by higher-margin new business.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses remained flat at $8.5 million compared to the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 11.8% compared to 11.1%.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter was $2.5 million or $(0.15) per share, compared to net income of $1.2 million or $0.07 per share in the year-ago quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA* in the fourth quarter was $0.6 million compared to $5.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to the aforementioned factors impacting revenue and gross margin.\nFree cash flow* in the fourth quarter was $(1.5) million compared to $(3.4) million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the company’s cash position was $1.5 million compared to $1.0 million at December 31, 2016. STARTEK closed the quarter with a $19.1 million balance on its $50 million credit facility compared to $26.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2016.\n*A non-GAAP measure defined below\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in 2017 was $292.6 million compared to $307.2 million in 2016.\nGross profit was $32.4 million compared to $36.4 million in 2016, with gross margin of 11.1% compared to 11.9% in 2016.\nSG&A expenses in 2017 were $32.6 million compared to $33.2 million in 2016. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 11.1% compared to 10.8% in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA in 2017 was $12.5 million compared to $17.0 million in 2016.\nNet loss was $1.3 million or $(0.08) per diluted share in 2017, compared to net income of $0.4 million or $0.02 per share in 2016.\nFree cash flow in 2017 was $8.3 million compared to $7.1 million in 2016.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nSTARTEK will hold a conference call today at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and strategic transaction.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThis press release contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Free cash flow. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included below. This non-GAAP information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. It is provided solely to assist in an investor’s understanding of these items on the comparability of the Company’s operations.\nThe Company defines non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income), impairment losses and restructuring charges, depreciation and amortization expense, (gains) losses on disposal of assets and share-based compensation expense. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business. Management believes that excluding these non-cash and other non-recurring items helps investors and analysts assess the strength and performance of our ongoing operations.\nManagement believes that measures that exclude impairment losses and restructuring charges or other non-recurring items permit a more meaningful comparison and understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nNet income (loss) $ (2,452 ) $ 1,192 $ (1,276 ) $ 395 Income tax (benefit) expense (371 ) 384 (436 ) 718 Interest expense, net 369 530 1,604 1,574 Impairment losses and restructuring charges, net 92 8 520 364 Depreciation and amortization expense 2,697 2,868 11,080 12,250 (Gains) losses on disposal of assets (1 ) 16 3 (3 ) Share-based compensation expense 270 443 1,015 1,722 Adjusted EBITDA $ 604 $ 5,441 $ 12,510 $ 17,020 The Company defines non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities reduced by capital expenditures. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and it should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nFree cash flow:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities 1,603 (559 ) 15,528 10,937 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (3,146 ) (2,859 ) (7,185 ) (3,797 ) Free cash flow $ (1,543 ) $ (3,418 ) $ 8,343 $ 7,140\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315005486/en/\nInvestor Relations\nLiolios Group, Inc.\nSean Mansouri or Cody Slach\n949-574-3860\ninvestor@startek.com\nSource: StarTek, Inc.",
