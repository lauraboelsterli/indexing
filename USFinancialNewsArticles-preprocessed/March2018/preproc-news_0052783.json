    "text": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - OPEC is seeking “very long-term” cooperation with other crude exporters, the secretary general of the oil exporting group said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO - OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo addresses a news conference in Vienna, Austria, November 7, 2017. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader Mohammad Barkindo was commenting on news that top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia were working on a long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for up to 20 years.\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced the plan in an interview with Reuters on Monday.\nRussia, the world’s biggest oil producer, has worked with the 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in previous oil gluts to rein in supplies and push up prices, but a 10 to 20-year deal between the two would be unprecedented.\n“We are looking for a very long-term cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries,” Barkindo told an energy conference in Baghdad.\nOPEC states, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers agreed to cut supplies from January 2017 to lift oil prices that plunged from above $110 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016.\nA deal to extend the pact, which has boosted prices to around $70 now, was agreed in November. The output cuts are now due to run until the end of 2018.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is pictured at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger “In addition to the 24 countries that came to sign the declaration of cooperation in November, we have six more producing countries who came to show solidarity,” he said.\nSeveral oil exporters have suggested a six-month extension to the supply pact, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi told the conference, without identifying the countries.\nRegarding Iraq’s own resources, the minister said OPEC’s second-largest producer might have oil reserves twice as big as indicated by current estimates of about 150 billion barrels.\nHe said the crude market was stabilizing and prices had “improved”, adding that a decision on whether to extend cuts beyond 2018 depended on meetings to be held by the exporters by the end of this year.\nBarkindo said OPEC was evaluating the impact of the supply pact to determine the “appropriate action” when it expired.\nIn addition, he said investment in the oil industry was increasing as oil prices recovered but had not yet reached the level before the downturn in 2014.\nReporting by Ahmed Rasheed; Writing by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ",
