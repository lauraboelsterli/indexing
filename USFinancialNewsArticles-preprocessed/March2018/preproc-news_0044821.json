    "text": "(Reuters) - A reshuffled Slovak government led by Peter Pellegrini won a parliamentary confidence vote on Monday, a month after the murder of an investigative journalist sparked mass protests and forced long-serving leader Robert Fico to resign.\nFILE PHOTO: New Slovak Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini gestures as he arrives at a European Union summit in Brussels, Belgium, March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo The new government won 81 votes in the 150-member parliament.\nFico, prime minister for 10 of the last 12 years, bowed out this month amid protests and calls for an early election, handing the three-party ruling coalition to Pellegrini, a long-time senior member of the ruling Smer party.\nThe new cabinet has adopted its predecessorâ€™s agenda, including plans to reach a balanced budget by 2020. It underwent six personnel changes but only added two people who have not previously held any government post.\nPellegrini has pledged to keep Slovakia on a pro-European and pro-NATO path.\nFico had sought to position Slovakia - a country of 5.4 million that is an European Union member since 2004 and part of the euro zone monetary club - as a pro-EU bastion in a eurosceptic region.\nReporting by Tatiana Jancarikova; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ",
