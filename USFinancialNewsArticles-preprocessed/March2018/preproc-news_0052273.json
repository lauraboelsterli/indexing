    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 7:56 PM / a few seconds ago Teva wins reversal of U.S. jury's $235 million GSK drug patent verdict Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday overturned a U.S. jury’s verdict that required Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to pay GlaxoSmithKline Plc more than $235 million (£167 million) for infringing a patent covering its blood pressure drug Coreg. The GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) logo is seen on top of GSK Asia House in Singapore, March 21, 2018. Picture taken March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Loriene Perera \nU.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in Wilmington, Delaware ruled that the evidence did not support the jury’s finding in June that Teva sales of a generic version of the drug caused doctors to infringe GSK’s patent. \nThe jury had awarded GSK $234.1 million in lost profits and said the drug company deserved an additional $1.4 million in royalties. It also had rejected Teva’s contention that the patent was invalid. \nNeither Teva nor GSK immediately responded to requests for comment. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Teva’s generic version of Coreg, or carvedilol, in 2007. \nGSK had alleged that while Teva’s FDA application had a carve-out to address its use for treating chronic heart failure, which GSK said remained under patent, the generic drugmaker changed its label in 2011 to add that use. \nGSK said that as a result, Teva induced healthcare providers to infringe its patent by selling a generic version of the drug and marketing it as a substitute for Coreg. \nThe case is GlaxoSmithKline LLC et al v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 14-cv-00878. Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Susan Thomas",
