    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 26 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer sent a “cease and desist” letter to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, Fox News reported on Monday, after she spoke in a “60 Minutes” television interview about her alleged affair with Trump and the threat she said she received to stay silent.\nFox reported Michael Cohen’s attorney demanded in the letter sent late Sunday after the interview was broadcast that Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, apologize for implying in the interview that Trump was behind a threat she said a stranger made against her in 2011 if she did not “leave Trump alone.”\nCohen also demanded Daniels, an actress, dancer, and producer, refrain from making “false and defamatory statements” about Cohen in the future.\nDaniels sued the president on March 6, stating that Trump never signed an agreement for her to keep quiet about an “intimate” relationship between them.\nWhite House aides did not respond immediately to requests for comment after the interview aired.
