( NASDAQ: SMSI ) (“Smith Micro” or the “Company”) today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with several institutional investors for the issuance and sale of $5 million of the Company’s common stock, at a purchase price of $1.75 per share. As part of its purchase, each investor will also receive a warrant to purchase an additional number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares purchased by the investor at an exercise price of $2.17 per share.\nThe offering is expected to close on or about March 5, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThe Company’s estimated net proceeds from the private placement are expected to be approximately $4.5 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\n“I am pleased with the private placement transaction that will significantly strengthen our balance sheet and support our working capital needs,” said William W. Smith, Jr., President and CEO of Smith Micro Software. “We believe this additional capital will enable us to better execute upon our sales, marketing and engineering efforts, particularly with the deployment of our SafePath® Family platform by a Tier 1 wireless operator in the U.S., which we announced last year.\n“We will be diligent with our execution and expect to see a positive impact on revenues that will build throughout the year, returning the Company to positive cash flow from operations, and break-even in the second half of 2018.”\nChardan acted as exclusive placement agent in connection with this offering, and Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC served as counsel to the Company.\nAs part of the closing, the Company will enter into a registration rights agreement with investors whereby the Company agrees to prepare and file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow for the registration of the resale of shares of common stock issued in the transaction, as well as the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in the transaction. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the resale registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC within thirty days after its filing (sixty days in the event the registration statement is reviewed by the SEC).\nAbout Smith Micro Software, Inc.:\nSmith Micro develops software to simplify and enhance the mobile experience, providing solutions to some of the leading wireless service providers, device manufacturers, and enterprise businesses around the world.
