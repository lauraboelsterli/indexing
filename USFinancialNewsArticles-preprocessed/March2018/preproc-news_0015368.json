    "text": "JOHNSON CITY, Tenn., March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NN, Inc., (NASDAQ: NNBR), a diversified industrial company, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGAAP Results\nFourth Quarter\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $14.5 million, or 10%, to $156 million, compared to $142 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Growth in the medical, aerospace and automotive end markets accounted for the increase.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.0 million, compared to $6.4 million for the same period in 2016. Income (loss) from continuing operations on a GAAP basis for fourth quarter of 2017 was $54.3 million. This compares to Income (loss) from continuing operations on a GAAP basis of $(2.1) million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Income (loss) from continuing operations in 2017 was favorably impacted by $52.3 million of tax benefit due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from operations for fourth quarter 2017 in the Autocam Precision Components segment was $6.3 million compared to $6.7 million for the same period in 2016.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from operations for fourth quarter 2017 in the Precision Engineered Products segment (PEP) was $8.6 million compared to $8.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nFull Year\nNet sales for 2017 increased $34.8 million, or 6%, to $620 million, compared to $585 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Growth in the medical, aerospace and automotive end markets accounted for the increase.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from operations for 2017 was $33.5 million, compared to $35.7 million for 2016. Income (loss) from continuing operations on a GAAP basis for 2017 was $26.0 million. This compares to Income (loss) from continuing operations on a GAAP basis of $(9.6) million in 2016. Income (loss) from continuing operations in 2017 was favorably impacted by $52.3 million of tax benefit due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from operations for 2017 in the Autocam Precision Components segment was $34.4 million compared to $29.5 million for 2016.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from operations for 2017 in the Precision Engineered Products segment (PEP) was $36.8 million compared to $34 million for the same period in 2016.\nAdjusted Results\nFourth Quarter\nAdjusted income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $15.5 million, compared to $13.8 million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted net income increased to $8.2 million or $0.30 per diluted share from $5.7 million or $0.21 per diluted share for the same period in 2016.\nRichard Holder, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy toward building a diversified industrial company. We had strong organic growth of 6% over the prior year and completed the acquisition of DRT Medical. Overall operating performance in the quarter was as expected. Operating margins were negatively impacted by substantial growth-oriented investments. Additionally, the fourth quarter is our lowest margin quarter of the year due to fewer production days.\"\nBusiness Group Results\nAutocam Precision Components\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $82.1 million, compared to $78.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 4.3% or $3.4 million. Growth in our Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) automotive business accounted for the increase. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter decreased $0.6 million to $7.4 million, compared to $8.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nMr. Holder commented, \"Autocam continues to win new business and outgrow its CAFE related end market. During the fourth quarter, Autocam was preparing to launch several multi-year programs, which required substantial up-front investment. While these investments had negative impact on its profitability, they are expected to drive enhanced growth over the long term.\"\nPrecision Engineered Products\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $74.0 million, compared to $63.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $11.0 million. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter was $15.2 million, compared to $14.0 million in 2016.\nMr. Holder commented, \"Like Autocam, the PEP group is in the process of executing launches on several large scale multi-year programs primarily in our Aerospace and Defense end market. Many of these costs are being incurred ahead of anticipated future revenues and therefore negatively impact overall margins in the short-term.\"\nFULL YEAR\nAdjusted income from operations for 2017 was $67.8 million, compared to $70.9 million for 2016. Adjusted Net income increased to $42.8 million or $1.55 per diluted share from $33.8 million or $1.24 per diluted share for 2016.\nBusiness Group Results\nAutocam Precision Components\nNet sales for 2017 were $336.9 million, compared to $326.1 million in 2016, an increase of 3.3% or $10.8 million. Growth in our Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) automotive business accounted for the increase. Adjusted income from operations for 2017 increased $1.6 million to $39.0 million, compared to $37.4 million in 2016.\nPrecision Engineered Products\nNet sales for 2017 were $282.9 million, compared to $258.8 million in 2016, an increase of $24.1 million. Adjusted income from operations for 2017 was $58.8 million, compared to $58.4 million in 2016.\nMr. Holder concluded, \"The fourth quarter was a transitional quarter as we continued to lay the foundations for growth in 2018 and beyond through the initial execution of several large multi-year new sales programs across the enterprise. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of DRT Medical which further enhanced our Life Sciences portfolio. All of these initiatives underpin our strategic goal to strengthen our position as a global diversified industrial company.\"\nThe full set of financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 can be found in our supplemental presentation posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nninc.com .\nNN will discuss its results during its quarterly investor conference call this morning starting at 9:00 a.m. ET.

Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provide supplementary information about the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and integration related expenses, foreign-exchange impacts on inter-company loans reorganizational and impairment charges. Over the past four years, we have completed seven acquisitions, two of which were transformative for the Company, and sold two of our businesses. The costs we incurred in completing such acquisitions, including the amortization of intangibles and deferred financing costs, and these divestitures have been excluded from these measures because their size and inconsistent frequency are unrelated to our commercial performance during the period, and which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating costs. We exclude the impact of currency translation from these measures because foreign exchange rates are not under management's control and are subject to volatility. Other non-operating charges such as, the write-off of our interest rate swap, are excluded as the charges on not indicative of our ongoing operating cost. We believe the presentation of adjusted income from operations and adjusted operating margin provide useful information in assessing our underlying business trends and facilitates comparison of our long-term performance over given periods.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company's industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to actual income growth derived from income amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\n(a) Non-GAAP Adjusted income from operations, represents GAAP income from operations, adjusted to exclude the effects of restructuring and integration expense, non-operational charges related to acquisition, divestiture and restructuring and integration costs, intangible amortization costs for fair value step-up in values related to acquisitions, and when applicable, our share of income from joint venture operations. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies in the industrial industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within the industry. Non-GAAP adjusted income from operations, is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to GAAP income from operations.\n(b) Non-GAAP adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations , represents GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude the tax-affected effects of restructuring and integration charges (related to plant closures and other charges incurred to implement our strategic goals, that do not necessarily represent a major strategic shift in operations), charges related to acquisition, and transition costs, amortization of intangibles costs for fair value step-up in values related to acquisitions and amortization of deferred financing costs, and foreign exchange gain (loss) on inter-company loans. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies in the industrial industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within the industry. Non-GAAP adjusted income(loss) from segment operations is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations.\n(c) This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the table above. In addition, the footnotes above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment item. NN, Inc. estimates the tax effect of the adjustment items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying NN, Inc's. overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nn-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300610610.html\nSOURCE NN, Inc.",
