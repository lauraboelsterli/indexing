    "text": "MADISON HEIGHTS, MICHIGAN, March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American LLC:INFU), a leading national provider of infusion pumps and related services for the healthcare industry in the United States and Canada, reported financial results today for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Highlights:\nNet revenues totaled $18.9 million, an increase of 12% over the fourth quarter of 2016. Net revenues totaled $71.1 million, an increase of 1%, over fiscal year 2016, despite the negative pricing impact of the SE1609 announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in July 2016; Income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes the “non-cash expense” impact of $17.0 million for income tax expense, including: (i) $11.4 million for a valuation allowance; and (ii) $5.6 million for the cumulative effect of changes in the federal tax rates from 34% to 21%, in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in connection with the 2017 Tax Act; Net loss was $18.0 million, or $0.79 loss per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2016 net loss of $0.5 million, or $0.02 loss per diluted share. For the full year 2017, net loss was $20.7 million, or $0.91 loss per diluted share, compared to $0.2 million, or $0.01 loss per diluted share for fiscal year 2016.\nNon-GAAP measurements (defined in GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation tables in appendixes):\nNet collected revenues increased 17% over the fourth quarter 2016 and 1% over fiscal year 2016; Net collected rental revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $14.7 million, an increase of 12%, compared to the same 2016 period’s $13.1 million. For the full year of 2017, net collected rental revenues were $55.4 million, a decrease of 2%, compared to 2016 of $56.6 million; Adjusted EBITDA (“AEBITDA”) increased 14% to $3.3 million with a margin of 17.6% compared to the fourth quarter 2016. AEBITDA declined 10% to $11.7 million with a margin of 16.4% compared to fiscal year 2016; Net debt at December 31, 2017 was $25.5 million, a decrease of $3.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 and a decrease of $8.5 million for the full year of 2017 compared to the end of 2016.\nManagement Discussion\nGregg Lehman, executive chairman of the board, said, “We made significant progress in 2017 in repositioning the business and setting the stage for enhanced financial performance in 2018 and in the years to come. This is a testament to the leadership team and all the employees for their dedication and commitment to drive operational excellence throughout the Company. I am confident in our new CEO, Rich DiIorio, and strongly believe he and his leadership team will continue to improve on our operational metrics and drive value for our shareholders.”\nRich DiIorio, chief executive officer of InfuSystem, said, “During the second half of 2017, the management team shifted the focus to improving operations, reducing costs, and paying down debt. The Company reduced net debt (a non-GAAP financial measure) an additional $3.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $8.5 million for all of 2017.”\n“After my appointment as CEO in November 2017, the team continued the focus on operational improvements and I am very pleased to report substantial progress. Most notably, for 2017, we increased our third-party payor networks to 520, a 15% increase compared to 2016, and improved our cash collections from our direct facility billing for Medicare patients. The substantial improvement in cash collections for our direct facility billing helped contribute to an overall decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts.”\n“After a comprehensive review and evaluation of our IT projects and expenditures, we redirected resources to those programs and services where we believe the Company can get the best return on investment. As a result, IT spending (both capitalized and uncapitalized) was reduced during the second half of the year. After review of our capitalized IT projects, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.0 million.”\n“The Company’s management team has built momentum and are excited about carrying this momentum into 2018. We expect that better collection efforts, more efficient use of our pump fleet, and reduced capital expenditures will provide for continued generation of strong cash flow,” concluded Mr. DiIorio.\nStock Repurchase Program\nReflecting the Company’s much improved financial position and cash-generating capabilities, the Company’s Board of Directors has approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to one million shares of the Company’s outstanding stock. The repurchase program will be subject to market conditions, the periodic capital needs of the Company’s operating activities, and the continued satisfaction of all covenants under the Company’s existing credit agreement. Repurchases under the program may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase shares and may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time.\nFourth Quarter Results\nNet revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $18.9 million, an increase of $2.0 million, compared to the same prior year period net revenues of $16.9 million, due to an increase in product sales of $1.0 million, or 51%, and an increase in rentals of $1.0 million, or 7%.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.3 million, an increase of 6%, compared to $10.7 million for the same prior year period. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenues, equaled 60% of total net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 63% in 2016 comparable quarter.\nProvision for doubtful accounts (“Bad Debt”) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1.2 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, compared to the same period in 2016. Bad Debt was 6% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 10% for the same 2016 period.\nNet loss increased from $0.5 million, or $0.02 loss per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016, to $18.0 million, or $0.79 loss per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted net loss (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $0.7 million, or $0.03 loss per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $0.1 million, or $0.01 loss per diluted share, in the same prior year period.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, AEBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) increased $0.4 million, or 14% to $3.3 million, compared to $2.9 million in the same prior year period.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 million and $9.2 million of net availability on its revolving credit facility compared to $0.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $9.8 million of availability on its revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2017. Net Debt (a non-GAAP financial measure) as of December 31, 2017 was $25.5 million compared to $29.3 million as of September 30, 2017.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nNet revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were $71.1 million, which was an increase compared to the prior year’s net revenues of $70.5 million, primarily due to an increase in Product Sales of 21% offset by a decrease in rentals of 2%.\nNet loss for the year increased from $0.2 million, or $0.01 loss per diluted share, to a net loss of $20.7 million, or $0.91 loss per diluted share. Adjusted net loss (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $2.2 million, or $0.10 loss per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $0.6 million, or $0.02 income per diluted share, in the same prior year period.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, AEBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure), decreased $1.3 million, or 10% to $11.7 million, compared to $13.0 million in the same prior year period.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 million and $9.2 million of net availability on its revolving credit facility compared to $3.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $9.9 million of availability on its revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016. Net Debt (a non-GAAP financial measure) as of December 31, 2017 was $25.5 million compared to $34.0 million for the same 2016 period.\nChris Downs, interim chief financial officer, said, “During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a “non-cash expense” valuation allowance, in the amount of $11.4 million, against our deferred tax assets to bring them to a level that it is more likely than not to be utilized. The Company also recorded a “non-cash expense” of $5.6 million for the cumulative effect of changes in the federal income tax rates from 34% to 21%, in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in connection with the 2017 Tax Act. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company evaluated our deferred tax assets for recoverability during the fourth quarter of 2017, considering negative and positive evidence, including our historical financial performance, projections of future taxable income based on management’s approved business plans, and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, to arrive at this conclusion,” concluded Mr. Downs.\nConference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call for investors on Tuesday, March 13, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss fourth quarter and year end performance and results.
