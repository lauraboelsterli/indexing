    "text": "SAO PAULO, March 26 (Reuters) - Brazil’s power company Furnas Centrais Elétricas SA, a subsidiary of state-controlled Eletrobras, signed a $175-mln contract with the construction unit of Odebrecht for the expansion of a power plant in Rio, according to a document and a statement from Furnas.\nOdebrecht was one of the main targets in the so-called Car Wash corruption investigation in Brazil that led to the arrest of dozens of politicians and executives. Its construction unit, Odebrecht Engenharia e Construção (OEC), recently said it was working “on its liquidity” to avoid a default on bonds.
