    "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ: MRVL), a leader in storage, networking and connectivity semiconductor solutions, today reported the fourth fiscal quarter and the full fiscal year, ended February 3, 2018. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $615 million, which exceeded the midpoint of the Company's guidance provided on November 28, 2017.\nGAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $49 million, or $0.10 per share. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $165 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $120 million.\n\"Our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year results continue to demonstrate that Marvell's strategy is working and that our team is executing it very well,\" said Marvell President and CEO Matt Murphy. \"We are making tremendous progress in the transformation of Marvell, and I look forward to the year ahead.\"\nFirst Quarter of Fiscal 2019 Financial Outlook\nRevenue is expected to be $585 million to $615 million. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 62% to 63%. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $250 million to $260 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $215 million. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.26 per share. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.33 per share.\nConference Call\nMarvell will conduct a conference call on Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018. Interested parties may join the conference call by dialing 1-844-647-5488 or 1-615-247-0258, passcode 4297718. The call will be webcast by Thomson Reuters and can be accessed at the Marvell Investor Relations website at http://investor.marvell.com/ with a replay available following the call until Friday, March 16, 2018.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of share-based compensation expense, amortization and write-off of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, restructuring and other related charges, litigation settlement, and certain expenses and benefits that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to Marvell's core business.\nIn fiscal 2018, Marvell began using a non-GAAP tax rate to compute the non-GAAP tax provision. This non-GAAP tax rate is based on Marvell's estimated annual GAAP income tax forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating Marvell's non-GAAP income, as well as the effects of significant non-recurring and period specific tax items which vary in size and frequency. Marvell's non-GAAP tax rate is determined on an annual basis and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events that may materially affect the non-GAAP tax rate such as tax law changes; significant changes in Marvell's geographic mix of revenue and expenses; or changes to Marvell's corporate structure. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a non-GAAP tax rate of 4% has been applied to the non-GAAP financial results.\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per share from continuing operations is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income from continuing operations by non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted). For purposes of calculating non-GAAP diluted net income per share, the GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) is adjusted to exclude the potential benefits of share-based compensation expected to be incurred in future periods but not yet recognized in the financial statements. The expected compensation costs are treated as additional proceeds assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method.\nMarvell believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Marvell's financial condition and results of operations. While Marvell uses non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance its understanding of certain aspects of its financial performance, Marvell does not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Consistent with this approach, Marvell believes that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of its financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, allows for greater transparency in the review of its financial and operational performance.\nExternally, management believes that investors may find Marvell's non-GAAP financial measures useful in their assessment of Marvell's operating performance and the valuation of Marvell. Internally, Marvell's non-GAAP financial measures are used in the following areas:\nManagement's evaluation of Marvell's operating performance; Management's establishment of internal operating budgets; Management's performance comparisons with internal forecasts and targeted business models; and Management's determination of the achievement and measurement of certain performance-based equity awards (adjustments may vary from award to award).\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of Marvell's business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Marvell's results as reported under GAAP. Marvell expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from Marvell's non-GAAP net income should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\nForward-Looking Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties, including: Marvell's expectations regarding its first quarter of fiscal 2019 financial outlook; and Marvell's use of non-GAAP financial measures as important supplemental information.
