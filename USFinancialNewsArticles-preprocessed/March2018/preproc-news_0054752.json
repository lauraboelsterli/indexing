PM Hotel Group , a leading, national hotel management company based in Washington, D.C., will manage the hotel.\n“The Sheraton Society Hill is a remarkable asset in an unmatched location surrounded by numerous business and leisure demand generators, from the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall to Fortune 500 companies like Comcast and Aramark,” said Dave Pollin, co-founder, BPG. “We are in the advanced planning stages of a complete makeover of the hotel to upgrade the guest experience. In addition to improving both guest rooms and public spaces, we intend to change brand affiliations to better match and serve the surrounding community.”\nNestled in the Old City district of Philadelphia at One Dock Street, the hotel is in the midst of some of the nation’s most renowned historical attractions, including The National Constitution Center and Penn’s Landing.

The hotel also provides 20,000 square feet of versatile meeting and event space, including the 7,800 square-foot Society Hill Ballroom capable of hosting up to 900 guests. Guests may indulge on contemporary dining with a dash of ambiance and a nod to the historical importance of the surroundings at Taste, the hotel’s on-site restaurant. The hotel’s exclusive Club Lounge offers a complimentary continental breakfast, evening hors d’oeuvres and a variety of beverage options.\n“Hotel guests can take a short stroll down cobblestone streets to Philadelphia’s most renowned restaurants and cultural attractions, while also being just blocks from the city’s financial district and City Hall,” Pollin added. “With nearly 370 rooms, more than 20,000 sq. ft. of function space and a textbook blend of amenities, the Sheraton Society Hill is the perfect location for all downtown Philadelphia travel occasions.
