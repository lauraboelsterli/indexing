    "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BloomReach, Inc., a global leader in personalized digital experiences, today announced that Hilarie Koplow-McAdams has joined its board of directors. Koplow-McAdams is an enterprise software veteran who brings over three decades of operating experience at growth-stage technology companies like Salesforce, Intuit, Oracle and New Relic.\nBloomReach achieved significant growth in 2017, increasing its Personalization bookings by over 200 percent and its Experience business (the result of its acquisition of Hippo) by over 100 percent year-over-year. This growth was driven by the increasing demand for better customer experiences that goes well beyond ecommerce alone and touches almost all verticals. In the past year, BloomReach saw increased demand from sectors such as financial services, travel & hospitality and retail. The company signed new enterprise-level customers including REI, Staples and NHS, secured key implementation partners including Sapient Razorfish, Accenture Interactive, Valtech and LiveArea, and established technical integrations with SAP Hybris, ElasticPath and Commercetools.\nBloomReach's search and personalization tools power 20 percent of all North-American e-commerce transactions to increase revenue and drive customer loyalty. Over 250 enterprise brands currently run on the BloomReach platform. The company's leadership in the Web Content Management space, and its visionary roadmap were recently validated by Gartner in its latest series of Magic Quadrants. 1 All this momentum led the company to look for stronger go-to-market expertise on its board to further build out its market presence in 2018.\n\"We are thrilled to welcome Hilarie, who has played an instrumental role in some of the technology industry's most exceptional growth stories, to our board,\" said Raj De Datta, CEO and co-founder of BloomReach. \"Her more than impressive track record in go-to-market execution and her expertise in building and scaling sales organizations will be a tremendous asset to our company as we are defining the digital experience space. Hilarie is exactly the person we need in our current growth stage to help us execute on our vision and enable us to tap into an eight billion dollar market.\"\nBefore joining NEA in December 2017, Koplow-McAdams was president at New Relic, where she was responsible for growth strategies and leading global sales, marketing, customer success, support, and business development. Prior to joining New Relic, she served as president of global sales at Salesforce, where she led the company's worldwide sales teams and helped drive diversification and global expansion of the company's business. Before Salesforce, Koplow-McAdams was vice president of direct sales for small business and a member of the executive committee at Intuit. She began her career at Oracle Corporation, holding a variety of leadership positions over nearly two decades and spearheading development of the company's Oracle Direct sales channel.\n\"Throughout my career, I've been passionate about helping enterprise companies accelerate growth, define new categories and elevate their customer experience,\" said Koplow-McAdams. \"I've been fortunate to help run some phenomenal companies in a variety of operating roles, and now I'm excited to put my knowledge to work for BloomReach. I think this company has a great potential and I'm thrilled to partner with Raj and his team execute on that.\"\nApart from Koplow-McAdams, BloomReach's board consists of Raj De Datta (CEO & Co-Founder), Ajay Agarwal (Bain Capital Partners), Ashutosh Garg (former Google Search Engineer), Peter Nieh (Lightspeed Venture Partners), Marcus Ryu (Guidewire), Jeroen Verberg (CFO & Co-Founder of Hippo CMS) and Ravi Viswanathan (New Enterprise Associates).\nKoplow-McAdams is a Venture Partner at NEA, and serves on the board of directors for Tableau Software, Zendesk and Duo Security, is vice chair of the board of directors of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, and serves on the advisory council of the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy.
