Reported operating margin in the Consumer Healthcare International (\"CHCI\") segment was 1.0%. Reported operating margin in the Prescription Pharmaceuticals (\"RX\") segment was 26.1%.\nPerrigo CFO Ron Winowiecki commented, \"The Perrigo team delivered on its internal and external goals and commitments in calendar year 2017 driven by 1) actions taken to simplify, focus and execute on the company's core businesses, 2) a focus on operational execution in challenging end-markets, 3) a cost optimization program that improved our cost structure, and 4) strong cash flow conversion and improved balance sheet flexibility.\nFourth quarter reported net sales in our CHCA segment grew 2.5% on a constant currency basis with record fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 23.1%. Our CHCI segment delivered 3.3% net sales growth in the quarter, on a constant currency basis and excluding the exited European distribution businesses, with an adjusted operating margin of 15.3%. RX net sales were consistent with the prior year, excluding a $5 million year-over-year Entocort ® impact as new product launches more than offset expected price erosion. Adjusted operating margin in this business was 38.1% due to product mix and increased investments in our new product pipeline. Finally, our durable business model and efficient supply chain once again delivered excellent cash flow conversion to adjusted net income.\"\nRefer to Tables I - VI at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the current year and prior year periods and additional non-GAAP information.

Net sales grew 2.5% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher net sales in the gastrointestinal and analgesics categories compared to the prior year. New product sales of $17 million were led by the store brand version of Nexium ® and smoking cessation products. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower net sales of nutritional drink products in the infant nutrition category, in addition to pricing pressure in certain OTC categories and discontinued products of $3 million.\nThe CHCA segment achieved fourth quarter reported gross profit margin of 34.1% and adjusted gross profit margin of 36.0%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus the prior year, primarily driven by increased net sales in relatively higher margin categories and positive contributions from supply chain efficiencies. These positive contributions were partially offset by price erosion in certain OTC categories versus the prior year.\nReported operating margin was a fourth quarter record of 22.0%. Adjusted operating margin was a fourth quarter record of 23.1%, which was higher compared to the prior year due to gross margin flow through and lower selling and administrative costs due to previously announced restructuring actions.\nFourth Quarter\nEnded\nFourth Quarter\nEnded\nYoY\nConstant\nCurrency\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n% change\n% Change\nReported Net Sales\n$374\n$420\n(10.8)%\n(16.9)%\nReported Gross Profit\n$173\n$151\n14.0%\nReported Gross Margin\n46.1%\n36.1%\n1,000 bps\nReported Operating Income (Loss)\n$4\n$(76)\nNM\nReported Operating Margin\n1.0%\n(18.1)%\nNM\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n$195\n$176\n10.7%\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n52.0%\n41.9%\n1,010 bps\nAdjusted Operating Income\n$57\n$36\n57.5%\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n15.3%\n8.7%\n660 bps\nReported net sales decreased 10.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales grew approximately 3.3% excluding $82 million from the exited unprofitable distribution businesses and favorable foreign currency movements of $26 million. This increase was driven primarily by higher net sales in the personal care category and in the U.K. store brand business along with new product sales of $14 million dollars. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in the anti-parasite category in addition to discontinued products of $2 million.\nFourth quarter reported gross and adjusted margins increased approximately 1,000 bps over the previous year driven by actions taken that improved business performance including exiting unprofitable distribution businesses, optimizing go-to-market strategies and manufacturing more products in-house.\nReported operating income was $4 million and reported operating margin was 1.0%. Adjusted operating income grew $21 million to $57 million, while adjusted operating margin expanded 660 bps to 15.3% due to higher gross margin contribution and lower advertising and promotional investments as a percentage to net sales.\nPrescription Pharmaceuticals (RX) Segment\n(in millions)\n(see the attached Tables I - VI for reconciliation to GAAP numbers)\nFourth Quarter\nEnded\nFourth Quarter\nEnded\nYoY\nConstant\nCurrency\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n% change\n% Change\nReported Net Sales\n$261\n$266\n(1.7)%\n(1.8)%\nReported Gross Profit\n$118\n$121\n(2.7)%\nReported Gross Margin\n45.0%\n45.5%\n(50) bps\nReported Operating Income\n$68\n$(259)\nNM\nReported Operating Margin\n26.1%\n(97.3)%\nNM\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n$139\n$149\n(6.7)%\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n53.2%\n56.1%\n(290) bps\nAdjusted Operating Income\n$100\n$115\n(13.4)%\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n38.1%\n43.2%\n(510) bps\nReported net sales in the fourth quarter were $261 million compared to $266 million last year. Excluding the $5 million year-over-year impact of Entocort ® , net sales were relatively in line with the prior year as new product sales of $23 million were offset by lower net sales of existing products of $21 million, due primarily to price erosion, which was in line with our expectations.\nReported gross margin was 45.0% and adjusted gross margin was 53.2%, which were lower compared to the prior year primarily due to product mix driven by a relatively greater contribution from partnered products and price erosion.\nReported operating margin was 26.1%. Adjusted operating margin was 38.1%, which included an increase of $6 million in R&D investments compared to the prior year and lower selling expenses due to previously announced restructuring actions.\nGuidance\nThe Company expects calendar year 2018 reported net sales to be in the range of $5.0 billion to $5.1 billion, reported operating income to be in the range of $682 million to $742 million, reported effective tax rate to be approximately 24.0%, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.64.\nThe Company also expects calendar year 2018 adjusted operating income to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.09 billion, adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20.5% and adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.45.\nPerrigo President and CEO Uwe Roehrhoff commented, \"Perrigo's durable businesses delivered strong results in a dynamic healthcare market. The management team's continued focus on operational execution provides a solid foundation to deliver on our 2018 plan.

In some cases, can be identified by terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential\" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. The Company has based these on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While the Company believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, including: the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases; future impairment charges; the success of management transition; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than the Company does; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; potential third-party claims and litigation, including litigation relating to the Company's restatement of previously-filed financial information; potential impacts of ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; resolution of uncertain tax positions; the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation and healthcare policy; general economic conditions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; the consummation of announced acquisitions or dispositions and the success of such transactions, and the Company's ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; and the Company's ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other initiatives. In addition, the Company may be unable to remediate one or more previously identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may incur additional tax liabilities in respect of 2016 or be found to have breached certain provisions of Irish company law in connection with the Company's restatement of previously filed financial statements, which may result in additional expenses and penalties. These and other important factors, including those discussed under \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as the Company's subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ expressed or implied by these . The in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations for net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales excluding sales attributable to held-for-sale businesses, the European distribution businesses and Entocort ® , as well as adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted operating cash flow, adjusted EPS guidance and adjusted diluted shares within this press release to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for these non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.\nThe Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation.\nNon-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which include adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted operating cash flows, and adjusted diluted shares are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. The Company discloses adjusted net sales, which excludes operating results attributable to held-for-sale businesses, the European distribution businesses and Entocort ® in order to provide information about sales of the Company's continuing business. In addition, the Company discloses net sales growth and adjusted net sales growth on a constant currency basis to provide information about sales of the Company's continuing business excluding the exogenous impact of foreign exchange. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past, present and future underlying operating results, and also facilitate comparison of the Company's operating performance to the operating performance of its competitors.\nA copy of this press release, including the reconciliations, is
