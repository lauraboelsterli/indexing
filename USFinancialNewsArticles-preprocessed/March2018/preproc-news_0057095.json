Forward-looking information is often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate\", \"plan\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"intend\", \"should\", and similar expressions. This information involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking information. Forward looking information in this news release includes, but is not limited to, the following: statements with respect to the timing of closing and the expected completion of the Transaction and satisfaction of the conditions required with respect thereto. There can be no assurance that the proposed Transaction will be completed, or that it will be completed on the terms and conditions contemplated in the arrangement agreement.\nThe forward-looking information contained in this news release is based on certain expectations and assumptions made by the Trust, including: expectations and assumptions concerning receipt of required approvals and the satisfaction of other conditions to the completion of the Transaction, the timing of the completion of the Transaction and that the arrangement agreement will not be amended or terminated.\nAlthough the Trust believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking information contained in this news release is based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking information because the Trust can give no assurance that it will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking information addresses future events and conditions, by its very nature it involves inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, the failure to obtain necessary approvals or satisfy the conditions to closing the Transaction; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the arrangement agreement; material adverse changes in the business or affairs of the Trust; the parties' ability to obtain regulatory approvals in order to complete the Transaction; either party's failure to consummate the Transaction when required; competitive factors in the industries in which the Trust operates; interest rates, prevailing economic conditions; and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Trust. Additional factors and risks which may affect the Trust or its business are described in the Trust's annual information form and the Trust's management's and discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017 and in the other reports filed under the Trust's profile on www.sedar.com .\nThe forward-looking information contained in this news release represents Trust's expectations as of the date hereof, and is subject to change after such date. The Trust disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable securities regulations.\nTHE TORONTO STOCK EXCHANGE HAS NOT REVIEWED AND DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR THE ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.\nSOURCE Pure Industrial Real Estate Trust (PIRET)",
