    "text": "Walgreens Acquires All 103 Rite Aid Stores in West Virginia, Enters Agreement to Join PEIA Network\nDEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- West Virginia public employees can continue using their neighborhood Rite Aid drugstores as their in-network pharmacy after all 103 stores in the state were purchased by Walgreens in February. Under a recent agreement, these Rite Aid stores will remain in-network for West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency (PEIA) members as the stores convert to Walgreens pharmacies.\nIn addition, while PEIA pharmacy customers will see no interruption in service at Rite Aid locations, all 15 Walgreens stores in the state will also join PEIA’s network effective April 1.\nPEIA’s 160,000 members include state employees, teachers, employees of state colleges, universities and numerous local governmental agencies, as well as their dependents and retirees under age 65.\n“We look forward to welcoming West Virginia Rite Aid customers to Walgreens,” said Paul Blankenship, regional vice president, Walgreens. “We’ve been a trusted brand since 1901 and we’re proud to serve West Virginia, as we expand our presence through convenient Rite Aid locations in communities across the state.”\nNationally, 1,932 Rite Aid drugstores are being acquired by Walgreens. As ownership transfers, each location becomes a Walgreens-owned Rite Aid store and associates in the store become employees of Walgreens. The pharmacy becomes a Walgreens pharmacy while the rest of the store continues normal business operations under the Rite Aid brand. While external signage remains Rite Aid for the time being, stores will be converted to the Walgreens brand in phases over time.\nThe 15 West Virginia Walgreens stores that join the PEIA network on April 1 are located in Morgantown, Princeton, Beaver, Elkins, Martinsburg, Cross Lanes, Barboursville, Beckley, Huntington, Summersville, Bridgeport, Grafton, Charleston, Hurricane and Charles Town.\nAbout Walgreens\nWalgreens ( walgreens.com ), a provider of trusted care in communities since 1901, is included in the Retail Pharmacy USA Division of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBA), the first global pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise. Approximately 8 million customers interact with Walgreens in stores and online each day, using the most convenient, multichannel access to consumer goods and services and trusted, cost-effective pharmacy, health and wellness services and advice.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180312005205/en/\nWalgreens\nJim Graham\n847-315-2921\nhttp://news.walgreens.com\n@WalgreensNews\nfacebook.com/Walgreens\nSource: Walgreens",
