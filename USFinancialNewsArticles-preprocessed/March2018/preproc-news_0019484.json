Backlog was $296 million as of December 30, 2017, a 34% increase from $221 million as of December 31, 2016.\n“We are very pleased to announce an exceptional performance of our fourth quarter and Full Year 2017 results and we are looking forward to increased organic, acquisition and strategic growth for 2018. Our success in the fourth quarter and Full Year 2017 was reflected in our strong backlog, profitability, and substantial growth in our strategic geographic presence and service offerings,” said Dickerson Wright, PE Chairman and CEO of NV5. “Our fourth quarter revenues were the highest of any quarter. This is noteworthy as the fourth quarter is typically our second slowest quarter based on seasonality. In the fourth quarter, revenues increased 48%, EBITDA increased 70% and Net Income increased 250%. In the Full Year 2017, revenues increased 48%, EBITDA increased 61%, and Net Income increased 107%. Our acquisition pipeline is very strong and we are pleased with the management structure we have in place to ensure operational growth in both our Infrastructure and Buildings, Technology and Sciences groups.”\nTotal Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $95.1 million, a 48% increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. Total Revenues includes intercompany revenues where the Company performed the services in lieu of using a third-party sub-consultant.

Net Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $73.2 million, an increase of 43% from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nEBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.8 million or 16% of Net Revenues, an increase of 70% from $7.0 million or 14% of Net Revenues for the fourth quarter of last year.\nAdjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.26 per diluted share compared to $0.41 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of the 2017 Tax Reform Adjusted EPS would have been $0.71 per share, an increase of 73% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.5 million, resulting in GAAP EPS of $1.06 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of the 2017 Tax Reform Net Income would have been $5.6 million and GAAP EPS would have been $0.51 per share.\nGAAP EPS and Adjusted EPS reflect weighted-average shares outstanding of 10,867,713 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to weighted-average shares outstanding of 10,507,542 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nFull Year 2017 Total Revenues were $337.5 million, an increase of 48% from Full Year 2016 Total Revenues of $228.7 million.

The Company expects Gross Revenues will range from $370 million to $405 million, which represents an increase of 11% to 22% from 2017 Total Revenues of $333 million. Net Revenues is expected to range from $296 million to $324 million, which represents an increase of 10% to 21% from 2017 Net Revenues of $268 million. The Company expects that Full Year 2018 Adjusted EPS will range from $2.92 per share to $3.21 per share, an increase of 23% to 35%. Furthermore, the Company expects that Full Year 2018 GAAP EPS will range from $2.20 per share to $2.47 per share. This guidance for Total Revenues, Net Revenues, Adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS excludes anticipated acquisitions for the remainder of 2018.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTotal Revenues and Net Revenues are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Gross Revenues – GAAP include sub-consultant costs and other direct costs which are generally pass-through costs. Furthermore, Gross Revenues – GAAP eliminates intercompany revenues where the Company performed the service in lieu of using a third-party sub-consultant. Therefore, the Company believes that Total Revenues and Net Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry, provide a meaningful perspective on its business results. A reconciliation of gross revenues as reported in accordance with GAAP to Total Revenues and Net Revenues is provided at the end of this news release.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Management believes EBITDA, in addition to operating profit, net income and other GAAP measures, is a useful indicator of NV5’s financial and operating performance and its ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes, capital expenditures and debt service. A reconciliation of net income as reported in accordance with GAAP to EBITDA is provided at the end of this news release.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share data (“Adjusted EPS”) is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Adjusted EPS reflects adjustments to reported diluted earnings per share (“GAAP EPS”) data to eliminate amortization expense of intangible assets from acquisitions, net of tax benefits. As the Company continues its acquisition strategy, the growth in Adjusted EPS will likely increase at a greater rate than GAAP EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EPS is provided at the end of this news release.\nNV5’s definition of Total Revenues, Net Revenues, EBITDA and Adjusted EPS may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as contract revenues, net income and diluted earnings per share.\nConference Call\nNV5 will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and Full Year 2017 financial results at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on March 8, 2018.\nDate: Thursday, March 8, 2018 Time: 4:30 p.m. Eastern Toll-free dial-in number: +1 844-348-6875 International dial-in number: +1 509-844-0152 Conference ID: 2078309 Webcast: http://ir.nv5.com Please dial-in at least 5-10 minutes prior to the start time in order for the operator to log your name and connect you to the conference.\nThe conference call will be webcast live and available for replay via the “ Investors ” section of the NV5 website.\nAbout NV5\nNV5 Global, Inc.
