    "text": "March 8, 2018 / 8:38 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago Exclusive - Boeing says Embraer-size deals compatible with cash strategy Reuters Staff 1 Min Read CHICAGO (Reuters) - The head of Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Thursday the U.S. planemaker can absorb transactions on the scale of a proposed tie-up with Brazil’s Embraer without putting at risk internal investments in its business or returning cash to shareholders. FILE PHOTO - Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg talks to members of the media after a meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., December 21, 2016. REUTERS/Carlos Barria Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also told Reuters in an interview that Boeing was “making progress” in talks with the Brazilian aerospace company. It continues to study a number of possible structures for a deal, which some outside analysts have said could value Embraer at $5-6 billion. “Acquisitions of the scale of Embraer are not only very doable for us, they are also things we can selectively do, aligned with our (cash deployment) strategy,” Muilenburg said.
