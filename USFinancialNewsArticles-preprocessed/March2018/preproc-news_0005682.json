    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Habit Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:HABT) (“The Habit” or the “Company”), today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 26, 2017.\nHighlights for the fourth quarter ended December 26, 2017 include:\nTotal revenue increased 15.2% to $85.1 million compared to $73.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCompany-operated comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.0% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet loss of $6.2 million, or $(0.30) per diluted weighted average share, which included $6.1 million of net expense relating to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, compared to net income of $1.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted weighted average share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net loss (1) was $44,000, or $(0.00) per fully distributed weighted average share compared with adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income of $1.8 million, or $0.07 per fully distributed weighted average share for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) was $7.3 million compared to $8.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company opened 13 new company-operated restaurants and one franchised restaurant during the fourth quarter. As of December 26, 2017, the Company had 193 company-operated locations and 16 franchised/licensed locations (excluding seven licensed locations in Santa Barbara County, California from which the Company is not entitled to royalties) for a system-wide total of 209 locations.\n(1) Adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to each of these measures is included in the accompanying financial data. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” included herein.\n“We believe we made progress solidifying our business in 2017 and remain confident in the strength of the Habit brand and our strategy of providing a differentiated, high-quality fast casual experience at a tremendous everyday value,” said Russ Bendel, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Habit Restaurants, Inc. “We have a number of exciting and relevant initiatives that we’re working on to naturally evolve our brand, focused on quality/value, convenience and innovation. We believe our initiatives can enhance the Habit experience not only in 2018, but for many years to come.”\n“During the quarter, we opened 13 new company-operated Habit Burger Grills, of which four were drive-thrus, and one franchised restaurant in Shanghai, China. In 2018 we plan to open approximately 30 new Company-operated locations, including approximately 15 drive thru locations, while franchisees expect to open six to eight locations during the year.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nTotal revenue was $85.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $73.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCompany-operated comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.0% for the quarter ended December 26, 2017. The decrease in company-operated comparable restaurant sales was driven primarily by a 3.0% decrease in transactions partially offset by a 2.0% increase in average transaction amount.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.2 million, or $(0.30) per diluted weighted average share, which included $6.1 million of net expense relating to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, compared to net income of $1.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted weighted average share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted into law. This new legislation provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, among other provisions. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company recognized other income of $57.9 million related to the reduction in liabilities under its tax receivable agreement (“TRA”). The Company also recognized an additional $64.0 million of income tax expense as related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $44,000, or $(0.00) per fully distributed weighted average share, compared to adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income of $1.8 million, or $0.07 per fully distributed weighted average share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. A reconciliation between GAAP net income (loss) and adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income (loss) is included in the accompanying financial data.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nTotal revenue was $331.7 million in fiscal year 2017, compared to $283.8 million in fiscal year 2016.\nCompany-operated comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.1% for the year ended December 26, 2017. The decrease in company-operated comparable restaurant sales was driven primarily by a 1.1% decrease in transactions partially offset by a 1.0% increase in average transaction amount.\nNet loss for fiscal year 2017 was $2.8 million, or $(0.14) per diluted weighted average share, which included $6.1 million of net expense relating to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, compared to net income of $4.7 million, or $0.27 per diluted weighted average share in fiscal year 2016.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net income in fiscal year 2017 was $4.2 million, or $0.16 per fully distributed weighted average share, compared to $8.0 million, or $0.31 per fully distributed weighted average share, in fiscal year 2016. A reconciliation between GAAP net income (loss) and adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income (loss) is included in the accompanying financial data.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company currently anticipates the following for its fiscal year 2018:\nTotal revenue between $389 million to $393 million; Company-operated comparable restaurant sales of flat to slightly positive for the year; The opening of approximately 30 company-operated restaurants and six to eight franchised/licensed restaurants; Restaurant contribution margin of 16.0% to 17.0%; General and administrative expenses of $37.5 million to $38.0 million; Depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $24.0 million; Capital expenditures of $43.0 million to $46.0 million; and An effective pro forma tax rate of approximately 29.0% to 30.0%, which assumes the conversion of all common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC for shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock), which would eliminate the non-controlling interests.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 today at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. Russ Bendel, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ira Fils, Chief Financial Officer will host the call.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing (855) 327-6837 or for international callers by dialing (778) 327-3988. A replay will be available after the call and can be accessed by dialing (844) 512-2921 or for international callers by dialing (412) 317-6671; the passcode is 10004264. The replay will be available until Wednesday, March 7, 2018. The conference call will also be webcast live from the Company’s corporate website at ir.habitburger.com under the “Events” page. An archive of the webcast will be available at the same location on the corporate website shortly after the call has concluded.\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used in this release:\nComparable restaurant sales reflect the change in year-over-year sales in our comparable restaurant base. A restaurant enters our comparable restaurant base in the accounting period following its 18th full period of operations. We operate on a 4-4-5 calendar, each accounting period will consist of either four or five weeks with the exception of a 53-week year, where the last period contains six weeks.\nAverage Unit Volumes (AUVs) are calculated by dividing revenue for the trailing 52-week period for all company-operated restaurants that have operated for 12 full accounting periods by the total number of restaurants open for such period.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net income includes net income attributable to The Habit (i) excluding income tax expense, (ii) excluding the effect of non-recurring items, (iii) assuming the exchange of all common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC into shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock), which results in the elimination of non-controlling interests in The Habit Restaurants, LLC, and (iv) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on fully distributed pro forma net income before income taxes at our estimated long term effective income tax rate. Adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income is a non-GAAP financial measure because it represents net income attributable to The Habit, before non-recurring items and the effects of non-controlling interests in The Habit Restaurants, LLC. We use adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone and eliminates the variability of non-controlling interests as a result of member owner exchanges of common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC into shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock).\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net income per fully distributed weighted average share is calculated using adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income as defined above and assumes the exchange of all common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC into shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock).\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, represents net income before interest expense, net, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, represents EBITDA plus pre-opening costs, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of assets, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, and exchange related expenses.\nAbout The Habit Restaurants, Inc.\nThe Habit Burger Grill is a burger-centric, fast casual restaurant concept that specializes in preparing fresh, made-to-order chargrilled burgers and sandwiches featuring USDA choice tri-tip steak, grilled chicken and sushi-grade tuna cooked over an open flame.

All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “potential,” “project,” “projection,” “plan,” “intend,” “seek,” “may,” “could,” “would,” “will,” “should,” “can,” “can have,” “likely,” the negatives thereof and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. They appear in a number of places throughout this press release and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected.\nWhile we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this press release in the context of the risks and uncertainties disclosed in our soon to be filed annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2017, including the sections thereof captioned “Cautionary Note Regarding ” and “Risk Factors.” These filings and others are available online at www.sec.gov , ir.habitburger.com or upon request from The Habit.\nWe caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you.

We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures, including those discussed above. These measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or superior to, financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance understanding of past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. However, when analyzing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider adjusted earnings per fully distributed weighted average share or adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income in isolation or as substitutes for net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or other operation statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP measures used in this press release may be different from the measures used by other companies.\nConsolidated Statement of Operations Data (unaudited):\nOur operating results are presented as a percentage of total revenue, with the exception of restaurant operating costs, depreciation and amortization expense, pre-opening costs and loss on disposal of assets, which are presented as a percentage of restaurant revenue.\n13 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended (amounts in thousands except share and per\nshare data) December 26, 2017 December 27, 2016 December 26, 2017 December 27, 2016 Revenue Restaurant revenue $ 84,526 99.3 % $ 73,403 99.4 % $ 330,230 99.6 % $ 282,819 99.7 % Franchise/license revenue 565 0.7 % 449 0.6 % 1,468 0.4 % 991 0.3 % Total revenue 85,091 100.0 % 73,852 100.0 % 331,698 100.0 % 283,810 100.0 % Operating expenses Restaurant operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) Food and paper costs 25,729 30.4 % 21,545 29.4 % 101,683 30.8 % 84,585 29.9 % Labor and related expenses 29,218 34.6 % 24,548 33.4 % 110,785 33.5 % 92,588 32.7 % Occupancy and other operating expenses 15,328 18.1 % 12,530 17.1 % 56,796 17.2 % 46,352 16.4 % General and administrative expenses 8,191 9.6 % 7,294 9.9 % 32,559 9.8 % 28,849 10.2 % Exchange related expenses 103 0.1 % 253 0.3 % 494 0.1 % 674 0.2 % Depreciation and amortization expense 5,268 6.2 % 4,101 5.6 % 18,761 5.7 % 14,880 5.3 % Pre-opening costs 1,119 1.3 % 813 1.1 % 3,062 0.9 % 2,174 0.8 % Loss on disposal of assets 38 0.0 % 18 0.0 % 81 0.0 % 128 0.0 % Total operating expenses 84,994 99.9 % 71,102 96.3 % 324,221 97.7 % 270,230 95.2 % Income from operations 97 0.1 % 2,750 3.7 % 7,477 2.3 % 13,580 4.8 % Other (income) expense Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (57,919 ) -68.5 % — 0.0 % (57,231 ) -17.3 % — 0.0 % Interest expense, net 208 0.2 % 179 0.2 % 588 0.2 % 634 0.2 % Income before income taxes 57,808 67.9 % 2,571 3.5 % 64,120 19.3 % 12,946 4.6 % Provision for income taxes 63,991 75.2 % 607 0.8 % 65,388 19.7 % 3,646 1.3 % Net income (loss) (6,183 ) -7.3 % 1,964 2.7 % (1,268 ) -0.4 % 9,300 3.3 % Less: net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests 22 0.0 % (644 ) -0.9 % (1,539 ) -0.5 % (4,640 ) -1.6 % Net income (loss) attributable to The Habit Restaurants, Inc. $ (6,161 ) -7.2 % $ 1,320 1.8 % $ (2,807 ) -0.8 % $ 4,660 1.6 %\nNet income (loss) attributable to The Habit Restaurants, Inc. per share Class A common stock: Basic $ (0.30 ) $ 0.07 $ (0.14 ) $ 0.27 Diluted $ (0.30 ) $ 0.07 $ (0.14 ) $ 0.27 Weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding: Basic 20,365,489 19,501,665 20,285,780 17,139,777 Diluted 20,365,489 19,509,244 20,285,780 17,148,466\nSelected Balance Sheet and Selected Operating Data (unaudited): Balance Sheet Data December 26, 2017 December 27, 2016 (dollar amounts in thousands) Balance Sheet Data-Consolidated (at period end): Cash and cash equivalents $ 28,277 $ 44,192 Property and equipment, net (a) 139,956 102,857 Total assets 292,124 330,366 Total debt (b) 13,700 6,036 Total stockholders' equity 144,595 143,887 (a) Property and equipment, net consists of property owned or leased, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.\n(b) Total debt consists of deemed landlord financing.\n13 Weeks Ended Selected Operating Data December 26, 2017 December 27, 2016 Other Operating Data: Total restaurants at end of period 209 172 Company-operated restaurants at end of period 193 162 Company-operated comparable restaurant sales (a) (1.0 )% 1.7 % Company-operated average unit volumes $ 1,881 $ 1,917 52 Weeks Ended Selected Operating Data December 26, 2017 December 27, 2016 Other Operating Data: Company-operated comparable restaurant sales (a) (0.1 )% 1.9 % (a) Company-operated comparable restaurant sales reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the company-operated comparable restaurant base.

The effective rate also excludes the impact of discrete items and reduced corporate tax rate due to tax law change. The estimated tax rate includes provisions for U.S. federal income taxes and assumes the highest statutory rates apportioned to each state and local jurisdiction.\n(d) For all periods presented, represents the total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding including all outstanding LLC Units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC as if they were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for the Company’s Class A common stock (with a corresponding cancellation of shares of our Class B common stock).
