    "text": "Mad Money with Jim Cramer Cramer's lightning round: Investing in Disney requires patience It's that time again! \"Mad Money\" host Jim Cramer rang the lightning round bell, which means he gave his take on callers' favorite stocks at rapid speed. Updated 19 Hours Ago CNBC.com \nThe Walt Disney Company : \"I think patience is required because of the Fox deal , but here's what I have to say about Disney: it ain't going away. It's going to get strong. But don't look at it every day. It requires patience.\" \nRH : \"[CEO] Gary Friedman's doing the right thing, but you may have to buy [shares] a little bit lower if it gets there. But wow, Gary, what an operator.\" \nImmunoGen : \"It's made too much of a move. It's up real big â€“ 52-week high. We've got to wait for a pullback. And by the way, I like Regeneron again.\" \nAdvanced Micro Devices : \"I think it's stalled right here but [CEO] Lisa Su is doing a great job. Don't forget, she's going up against Nvidia and Intel . That's not easy competition.\" Watch the full lightning round here: show chapters",
