Actual results could differ materially from those projected or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following: the conditions to the completion of the transaction may not be satisfied; debt financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all; closing of the transaction may not occur or may be delayed, either as a result of litigation related to the transaction or otherwise; the parties may be unable to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction; revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected; operating costs, customer loss, and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, and suppliers) may be greater than expected; Lifetime may assume unexpected risks and liabilities; completing the acquisition may distract Lifetime’s management from other important matters; and the other factors discussed in “Risk Factors” in Lifetime’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and subsequent filings with the SEC, which are available at http://www.sec.gov . Lifetime assumes no obligation to update the information in this communication, except as otherwise required by law. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180302005406/en/\nLifetime Brands, Inc.:\nLaurence Winoker, 516-203-3590\nChief Financial Officer\ninvestor.relations@lifetimebrands.com\nor\nJoele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher:\nDan Katcher / Matt Sherman / Andrew Squire\n212-355-4449\nSource: Lifetime Brands, Inc.",
