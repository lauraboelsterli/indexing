    "text": "CALGARY, TransAlta Corporation (\"TransAlta\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: TA; NYSE: TAC) today announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") has accepted the notice filed by the Company to implement a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for a portion of its common shares (\"Common Shares\").\nPursuant to the NCIB, TransAlta may repurchase up to a maximum of 14,000,000 Common Shares, representing approximately 4.86% of issued and outstanding Common Shares as at March 2, 2018. Purchases under the NCIB may be made through open market transactions on the TSX and any alternative Canadian trading platforms on which the Common Shares are traded, based on the prevailing market price. Any Common Shares purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled.\nTransactions under the NCIB will depend on future market conditions. TransAlta retains discretion whether to make purchases under the NCIB, and to determine the timing, amount and acceptable price of any such purchases, subject at all times to applicable TSX and other regulatory requirements. TransAlta may also enter into an automatic securities purchase plan in connection with its NCIB that contains parameters regarding how its Common Shares may be repurchased during times when it would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase Common Shares due to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed blackout periods.\nThe period during which TransAlta is authorized to make purchases under the NCIB commences on March 14, 2018 and ends on March 13, 2019 or such earlier date on which the maximum number of Common Shares are purchased under the NCIB or the NCIB is terminated at the Company's election.\nUnder TSX rules, not more than 102,039 Common Shares (being 25% of the average daily trading volume on the TSX of 408,156 Common Shares for the six months ended February 28, 2018) can be purchased on the TSX on any single trading day under the NCIB, with the exception that one block purchase in excess of the daily maximum is permitted per calendar week.\nThe NCIB provides the Company with a capital allocation alternative with a view to long-term shareholder value. TransAlta's Board of Directors and Management believe that, from time to time, the market price of TransAlta's Common Shares does not reflect the underlying value and purchases of Common Shares for cancellation under the NCIB may provide an opportunity to enhance shareholder value.\nAs of March 2, 2018, there are 287,903,467 Common Shares outstanding, of which 287,297,124 Common Shares are considered to be in the public float as they are not held by directors, officers or principal shareholders of the Company. Accordingly, the maximum number of Common Shares that may be repurchased under the NCIB represents approximately 4.86% of the number of Common Shares currently outstanding, and approximately 4.87% of the public float.\nAbout TransAlta Corporation:\nTransAlta owns, operates and develops a diverse fleet of electrical power generation assets in Canada, the United States and Australia with a focus on long-term shareholder value. We provide municipalities, medium and large industries, businesses and utility customers clean, affordable, energy efficient, and reliable power. Today, we are one of Canada's largest producers of wind power and Alberta's largest producer of hydro-electric power. For over 100 years, TransAlta has been a responsible operator and a proud community-member where its employees work and live.
