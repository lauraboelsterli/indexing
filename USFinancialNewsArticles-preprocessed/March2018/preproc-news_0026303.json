Billerbeck to Retire\nBoard Commences CEO Search; COO Glen Hawk to Serve as Interim CEO\nPORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:LSCC), the leading provider of customizable smart connectivity solutions, today announced that its President and Chief Executive Officer, Darin G. Billerbeck, has decided to retire and will also step down from the Company’s Board of Directors on March 16, 2018. The Board has appointed Glen Hawk, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer since November 2015, as Interim CEO, effective March 16, 2018. The Board will conduct a thorough search process for a permanent CEO, including both internal and external candidates, and has retained Egon Zehnder, a leading executive search firm. Mr. Billerbeck will remain with the Company until May 31, 2018 to help ensure a smooth transition.\nJohn Bourgoin, Chairman of the Board, said, “On behalf of the entire Board, I would like to thank Darin for his leadership and numerous contributions to Lattice over the past seven years to position the Company for long-term success. During his tenure, Darin strengthened the Company’s operational performance and drove R&D efforts that have led to our strongest customer-aligned product portfolio in the Company’s history. As we conduct a comprehensive and efficient search for a new CEO, the Board and I are confident that Glen will provide continuity of leadership to ensure that Lattice continues to achieve operational excellence, meet the needs of our customers and deliver value for shareholders.”\nMr. Billerbeck, President and CEO, said, “I am privileged to have led this exceptional organization and to have had the opportunity to work with this incredibly talented team. Lattice is well positioned for the future, as the Company builds on its strong core business, continues to invest in an extensive suite of solutions at the edge of the cloud, and remains focused on its strategic goals. I am proud of all that we have accomplished during my tenure, and look forward to working with Glen to ensure a seamless transition as Lattice continues to drive a return to revenue and profitability growth, improve its cost structure, and build shareholder value.”\nA graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Hawk brings over 30 years of experience in the semiconductor industry and has served as Lattice’s Chief Operating Officer since November 2015. Prior to joining Lattice, Mr. Hawk was the Vice President and General Manager of the NAND solutions Group at Micron Technology, Vice President and General Manager at Numonyx, and General Manager of the Flash Products Group at Intel.\nAbout Lattice Semiconductor Corporation:\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a leader in smart connectivity solutions at the network edge, where the “things” of IoT live.
