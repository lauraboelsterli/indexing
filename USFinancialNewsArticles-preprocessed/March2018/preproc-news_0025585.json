The tests are based on the science of Nucleosomics速, which is the practice of identifying and measuring nucleosomes in the bloodstream or other bodily fluid - an indication that disease is present.\nAs cancer screening programs become more widespread, Volition's products aim to help to diagnose a range of cancers quickly, simply, accurately and cost effectively. Early diagnosis has the potential to not only prolong the life of patients, but also to improve their quality of life. Volition's research and development activities are currently centered in Belgium, with additional offices in London, Texas and Singapore, as the company focuses on bringing its diagnostic products to market first in Europe, then in the U.S. and ultimately, worldwide.\nFor more information about Volition, visit Volition's website https://volitionrx.com/ or connect with us via:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/volitionrx\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/volitionrx\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VolitionRx/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/VolitionRx\nThe contents found at Volition's website address, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube are not incorporated by reference into this press release and should not be considered part of this press release.
