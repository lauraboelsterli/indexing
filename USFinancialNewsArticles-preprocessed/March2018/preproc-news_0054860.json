    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, March 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tanager Energy Inc. (“ Tanager ” or the “ Corporation ”) (TSX-V:TAN) (OTCQB:TANEF) is announcing today a series of proposed significant transactions.\nTanager has entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the “ Letter of Intent ”) to purchase Titan Chalk, Inc. and Haloroc Technologies, Inc. (collectively referred to as the “ Sellers ”) in exchange for US$110,162,250 to be paid with Common Shares of Tanager at a price of CDN$0.1634 per share and three (3) year warrants in the amount of US$11,061,225 at a strike price of CDN$1.00 per share. The proposed acquisition (the “ Proposed Transaction ”) will deliver rights to approximately 40,059 net mineral acres of prospective Austin Chalk mineral leases in Washington, Austin, Fayette, Lee, Burleson and Brazos Counties, Texas and 55 producing wells.\nAdditionally, Tanager announces that it intends to complete a non-brokered private placement offering of common shares in the capital of Tanager (“ Common Shares ”) at a price of CDN$3.268 per Common Share (on a post-Consolidation basis), for gross proceeds of up to CDN$13,600,080 (US$10.4 million) (the “ Private Placement ”). Closing of the Private Placement is conditional upon the following: (i) completion of the Proposed Transaction; (ii) a continuance of Tanager from Alberta to British Columbia (the “ Continuance ”); (iii) a name change of the Corporation to “HB2 Energy, Inc.” (the “ Name Change ”), or such other name as the board of directors of the Corporation determines; (iv) a consolidation (the “ Consolidation ”) of the Common Shares on the basis of 20 pre-Consolidation Common Shares for 1 post-Consolidation Common Share; (v) the appointment of two new directors to the board of directors of Tanager to replace two resigning directors; and (vi) the appointment of Sam Haskell as Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation.\nThe Private Placement\nHaloroc Energy, Inc. (“ Haloroc ”) has agreed to subscribe to purchase Common Shares under the Private Placement for an aggregate purchase price of up to US$10,000,000, subject to reduction at the election of Tanager in an amount of up to, but not exceeding, US$5,000,000, provided that third parties acceptable to Tanager subscribe for Common Shares under the Offering such that the total amount raised under the Private Placement is not less than US$10,000,000. In consideration for the commitment to purchase Common Shares, Tanager intends to issue to Haloroc, upon closing of the Offering, 1,000,383 Common Share purchase warrants (“ Warrants ”) (on a post-Consolidation basis), with each Warrant entitling the holder to acquire an additional Common Share (on a post-Consolidation basis) at a price of CDN$3.268 per share (on a post-Consolidation basis), exercisable for a period of three (3) years from the date of issuance.\nThe securities issued in connection with the Private Placement will be subject to a four month restriction from the date of closing. The net proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to develop the Gen 3 Austin Chalk assets, replenish working capital and for general corporate purposes.\nA special shareholder meeting is proposed to be held on May 14, 2018 in Austin, Texas for Tanager shareholders to vote on certain proposed corporate actions summarized in this release, which will be detailed further in a management proxy and information circular (the “ Proxy and Information Circular ”), expected to be filed and circulated no later than April 10, 2018.\nThe Gen 3 Austin Chalk Play\nTanager’s acquisition targets two companies that have assembled a substantial acreage position in the heart of an emerging Austin Chalk formation play in Giddings Field in portions of Washington, Austin, Fayette, Lee, Burleson and Brazos Counties, Texas. This play is referred to internally as the Gen 3 Austin Chalk. In the core area of the Gen 3 Austin Chalk Play, the Austin Chalk has substantial matrix porosity, thickness and hydrocarbon saturation, which permits a reliable calculation of minimum reservoir volume from well logs and other traditional geologic mapping techniques. In these areas, the Austin Chalk has been shown to respond to the application of high intensity, modern multi-stage plug and perf frac techniques originally developed for and implemented in shale plays such as the Eagle Ford shale.\nSignificant offset operators in the play include EOG Resources, Inc., WildHorse Resource Development Corp., BlackBrush Oil & Gas, L.P. (an Ares Management portfolio company), GeoSouthern Energy Corporation, Verdun Oil Company (an EnCap portfolio company), and EnerVest, whose Austin Chalk assets are being rolled into Magnolia Oil & Gas Corporation through a recently-announced US$2.66 billion transaction with TPG Pace Energy Holdings. Of significant note is the presence of both BlackBrush and EOG Resources in the play, as both companies were pioneers in stimulating the Austin Chalk through high intensity perf and plug fracs with great success in their Karnes County, Texas Eagle Ford acreage positions. BlackBrush divested a significant portion of its Karnes County Austin Chalk acreage in 2016 in a transaction with EnerVest. For more information, please see the press release of TPG Pace Energy Holdings Corp. dated March 20, 2018, available on TPG Pace Energy Holdings Corp.’s website at www.tpg.com .\nTanager’s proposed acquisition includes approximately 28,650 net mineral acres of operated leases that are held by production, along with 54 producing legacy Austin Chalk wells, 7,000 net mineral acres of operated undeveloped mineral leasehold, and 4,400 net mineral acres (13,200 gross acres) of non-operated leasehold operated by BlackBrush Oil & Gas, L.P. The proposed acquisition is subject to title due diligence and customary adjustments for net mineral acres conveyed at closing. The Sellers may continue to acquire additional acreage prior to closing.\nMr. Roger S. Braugh, Jr., a director of the Corporation, is the President and a holder of 50% of the stock of Titan Chalk, Inc. In addition, Christopher J. Pettit, a director of the Corporation, controls Chris Pettit & Associates, PC, which is the trustee of a trust that is the holder of 50% of the stock of Titan Chalk, Inc. Accordingly, the Proposed Transaction with Titan Chalk, Inc. is considered a “related party transaction” under TSX Venture Exchange (“ TSXV ”) Policy 5.9 and Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“ MI 61-101 ”), and is subject to the minority approval requirements, which will be sought at the upcoming special meeting of the shareholders of Tanager to be held on May 14, 2018. The Corporation has determined that there is an exemption available from the formal valuation requirement of TSXV Policy 5.9 and MI 61-101 for the Proposed Transaction (Formal Valuation - Issuer Not Listed on Specified Markets).\nManagement Restructuring\nTo manage and develop the assets proposed to be acquired, Tanager plans to augment and restructure its corporate management. Haloroc has proposed that Craig Perry and Michael Bertuccio will be appointed to the board of directors of Tanager upon the resignation of current Tanager directors Tom Crain and Chris Pettit.
