    "text": "Defenseman Hampus Lindholm scored the game-winning goal 1:21 into overtime as the Anaheim Ducks overcame a big night from Connor McDavid and posted a 5-4 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Sunday.\nThe Ducks gained a point in their sixth straight game by controlling possession in the extra session. They won the opening faceoff and constantly skated around in their own defensive zone before moving the puck up the ice.\nLindholm won it by snapping a shot from the middle of the slot over goalie Cam Talbot. Lindholm’s eighth career game-winning goal occurred after the Ducks dominated the third period by scoring three times and outshooting Edmonton 22-6.\nAdam Henrique netted the tying goal with 89 seconds left in regulation on his second tip-in of the night. He also scored Anaheim’s first goal of the third period.\nCorey Perry also scored in the third. Josh Manson netted Anaheim’s first goal.\nMcDavid scored Edmonton’s first goal and set up two others, increasing his season points total to 99. He is four points ahead of Tampa Bay’s Nikita Kucherov for the league lead.\nTy Rattie, Leon Draisaitl and Ethan Bear also scored for Edmonton. The Oilers are 8-2-2 in their past 11 games, but they already were eliminated from playoff contention.\nTalbot, who was scheduled to get the game off, made 33 saves after Al Montoya was scratched.\nDucks goaltender John Gibson stopped 28 shots.\nThe Ducks tied it at 4-4 when Henrique tipped in Brandon Montour’s shot that appeared to deflect off Edmonton’s Darnell Nurse.\nMcDavid scored his latest goal 1:46 into the second period. After Ryan Kesler coughed the puck up in the neutral zone, McDavid fired a wrist shot from the right circle by Manson and past Gibson’s stick side for a 1-0 Edmonton lead.\nThe Ducks tied it 19 seconds later when Manson completed a three-on-two by lifting a slap shot from the left circle into the top of the net.\nThe Oilers regained a one-goal lead when McDavid made a pass from the right corner to Matt Benning, whose one-timer from the high slot was tipped in by Rattie with 12:16 remaining in the middle period.\nEdmonton took a two-goal lead with less than two minutes left in the second when Draisaitl lifted a one-timer from the right side over Gibson’s glove.\nAnaheim tied the game in the first 5:51 of the third.\nHenrique tipped in Marcus Pettersson’s shot 1:55 into the third, and Perry backhanded the rebound of Cam Fowler’s wraparound attempt by Talbot nearly four minutes later.\nBear restored Edmonton’s lead by finishing off McDavid’s pass through the slot with a wrist shot over Gibson with 7:18 to play. It was the rookie’s first goal in 13 career NHL games, while McDavid registered his 60th assist of the season.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
