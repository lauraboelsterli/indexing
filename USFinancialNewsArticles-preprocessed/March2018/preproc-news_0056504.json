    "text": "Pierre-Luc Dubois collected his first career hat trick and Sergei Bobrovsky made 37 saves as the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Calgary Flames 5-1 on Thursday night in Calgary to regain third place in the Metropolitan Division standings.\nWith 18 goals on the season, Dubois, the third overall pick in the 2016 NHL Draft, set a franchise record for most goals by a rookie. The victory at Scotiabank Saddledome is the 12th in 13 games for the Blue Jackets, as well as the 128th head coach John Tortorella has collected with the team, also a franchise mark.\nThe Blue Jackets took advantage of a struggling Flames squad early when Markus Hannikainen opened the scoring on his team’s first shot against rookie goalie Jon Gillies 2:09 into the game. Matt Calvert made a slick pass to the front of the net from the end boards, and Hannikainen buried the point-blank chance.\nDubois doubled the lead at 12:23. Artemi Panarin gained the zone and backed off defenders before slipping a pass across the slot that Dubois one-timed with authority.\nDubois notched his second goal at the 3:55 mark of the second period, a frame in which the Flames controlled play but couldn’t score. Panarin sent a pass to the front of the net, which ricocheted off a skate right to Dubois in the slot, and he slammed it home.\nAfter Markus Nutivaara, who signed a four-year contract extension on Thursday, made it a four-goal edge midway though the third period, Dubois netted his third of the night with 4:37 remaining with another one-timer.\nChris Stewart scored Calgary’s lone goal with 21.4 seconds left on the clock, which snapped the team’s goal drought at 167:21.6.\nGillies made 23 saves for the Flames, who have lost seven straight games, in which they’ve scored only eight goals.\nThe Flames are missing their top three scorers with Sean Monahan and Matthew Tkachuk out due to injury and Johnny Gaudreau away from the team due to his father being taken to hospital because of cardiac problems. Now their second-pairing defensive duo is also on the shelf, with T.J. Brodie out due to injury and Travis Hamonic having left the game in the first period due to injury.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
