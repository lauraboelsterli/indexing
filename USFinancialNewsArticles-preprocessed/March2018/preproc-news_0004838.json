    "text": "HELSINKI, March 2 (Reuters) - Finnish mobile game and animation studio Rovio said on Friday its head of games Wilhelm Taht will leave the company with immediate effect following the companyâ€™s dramatic profit warning last week.\nRovio said Taht was leaving his position for personal reasons with CEO Kati Levoranta assuming the role for the time being.\nShares in Rovio, which listed on the Helsinki bourse last September, dropped 50 percent last week due to a gloomy financial outlook for this year.\nInvestors expect the management to explain reasons behind the profit warning in a news conference starting 1200 GMT.
