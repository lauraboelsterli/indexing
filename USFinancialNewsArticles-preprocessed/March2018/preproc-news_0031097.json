Three Months Ended December 31 Net Income 2017 2016 Domestic ($2,994 ) ($722 ) Mueller BV ($1,748 ) ($87 ) Eliminations $100 $54 Net Income ($4,642 ) ($755 ) The chart below depicts the net income on a consolidating basis for the twelve months ended December 31. Twelve Months Ended December 31 Net Income 2017 2016 Domestic ($143 ) ($3,955 ) Mueller BV ($2,350 ) $1,555 Eliminations $167 $119 Net Income ($2,326 ) ($2,281 ) B. Revenue ($168 million) and the net loss ($2.3 million) were nearly unchanged for 2017 as compared to 2016. While the year-over-year results are similar, there were large changes in performance throughout the company, the backlog more than doubled, and a significant consolidation of operations is underway in the Netherlands.\nNet income in 2017 was reduced by approximately $4.2 million due to the recent tax reform in the United States and by $2 million in non-recurring costs related to the consolidation in the Netherlands, such as severance, loss on sale of assets, and lease terminations. The 2016 result was similarly reduced by $4.2 million due to the settlement of part of the company’s pension plans in the United States.\nExcluding these effects, earnings before tax in the United States would have been $6.1 million, an increase of $4.9 million over 2016. In the Netherlands, earnings before tax would have been a loss of $0.9 million, a decrease of $3.0 million compared to 2016.\nC. Backlog increased during the fourth quarter from $90 million to $94 million. For 2017, the backlog increased 96% in the United States and 181% in The Netherlands for an overall increase of 113%. Backlog in the United States increased in nearly all the product lines led by increases in BioPharm, Dairy Farm Equipment, and PyroPure. Dairy Farm Equipment continues to experience strong market conditions in Canada. In response, we have further increased production in our new milk cooler production line in Springfield and have begun to ship coolers for Canada from our Lichtenvoorde facility.\nD. The decrease in performance in The Netherlands was related to lower sales of dairy farm products and $2 million in non-recurring costs. Regulation of the farms has moved from a milk quota system to a phosphate quota system regulating animal waste on the farms. After a period of regulatory uncertainty, farmers are beginning to understand how they can trade phosphate quotas when the size of their farms change. Milk cooler backlog at the beginning of 2018 is 40% higher than a year earlier. The remainder of the backlog increase came from heat transfer products sold by DEG Engineering, the German subsidiary acquired in 2016.\nE. Tax expense of approximately $4.2 million was recognized in December due to new United States federal tax legislation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted in December 2017. This includes a $0.9 million transition tax expense estimate and $3.3 million tax expense due to the revaluation of the deferred tax asset due to a decrease in the tax rate. In certain cases, the Company has recorded for 2017 a reasonable estimate of the effects of the TCJA, and accordingly such amounts are provisional. Final adjustments, if necessary, will be determined in 2018 and recorded as a measurement period adjustment through 2018 tax expense.\nF. On March 2, 2018, the final inspections were conducted on the new facility in Groenlo, The Netherlands, and management accepted possession from the construction company. For the past 9 months Mueller BV has been offering settlements to coworkers who have chosen not to move to the new location, replacing some of them with staff in the Groenlo area. The new facility is expected to start production on April 9 th .\nG. The pre-tax results for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were unfavorably affected by a $221,000 increase in the LIFO reserve. The pre-tax results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, were unfavorably affected by a $697,000 increase in the LIFO reserve. The pre-tax results for the three months ended December 31, 2016, were favorably affected by a $500,000 decrease in the LIFO reserve. The pre-tax results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, were unfavorably affected by a $500,000 increase in the LIFO reserve.\nH. The Company completed the lump sum pension payments to participants who elected to take the settlement. These payments, paid from the assets of the plans, were available for participants who were no longer employed by the company as of May 6, 2016, but who had not yet begun receiving their benefit. The eligible participants represented about a quarter of the obligations of the plans and just over 50% of those eligible elected the settlement. The payments, totaling $13.8 million to 218 participants, were made on or about September 26, 2016. The results for twelve months ended December 31, 2016 contained a negative noncash effect on the pre-tax earnings of the Company of $6.7 million ($4.2 million net of tax).\nI. The consolidated financials are affected by the euro to dollar exchange rate when consolidating Mueller B.V., the Dutch subsidiary. The month-end euro to dollar exchange rate was 1.05 for December 2016 and 1.20 for December 2017 respectively.\nThis press release contains that provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions.
