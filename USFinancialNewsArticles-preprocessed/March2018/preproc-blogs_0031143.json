Economic analyst Lawrence \"Larry\" Kudlow appears on CNBC at the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid “If you keep tax rates minimum, if you keep regulations and government spending minimum, if you keep the dollar sound and steady, you are going to have a terrific economy,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
