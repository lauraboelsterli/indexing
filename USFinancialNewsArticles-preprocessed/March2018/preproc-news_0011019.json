    "text": "Published: Mar 4, 2018 4:38 p.m. ET Share \nNo part likely to win majority, potentially ushering in instability Reuters Voters line up at a polling station in Rome on Sunday. \nBy Eric Sylvers \nROME — Italians went to the polls Sunday in a national election that has underscored themes that have dominated other important votes in Europe over the past year: the disruptive power of populist parties, a fractured electorate and the continued fallout from the migration and economic crises. \nThe final opinion polls, which were published in mid-February ahead of a two-week blackout, suggested that no group would emerge with a parliamentary majority, an outcome that could usher in a protracted period of political instability and tension in the eurozone’s third-largest economy. \nRead: Italy’s election: The nightmare, best-case and most likely scenarios for stocks \nPolls close at 11 p.m. local time, after which exit polls will be immediately made public. Full results will be released Monday morning. \nThe election has been a three-way race between Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right coalition, an alliance anchored by the ruling center-left Democratic Party and the antiestablishment 5 Star Movement. The latest surveys showed Berlusconi’s center-right coalition enjoying a last-minute surge of momentum in the weeks before the vote and possibly emerging as the single-biggest alliance. Polls placed his coalition — which includes the anti-immigrant League and a smaller far-right party that traces its roots to the Italian fascist movement — at about 35%. ",
