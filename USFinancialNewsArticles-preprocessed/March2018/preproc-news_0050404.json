    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) (“Pioneer” or “the Company”) today announced that it has signed a purchase and sale agreement with Sundance Energy, Inc. to sell approximately 10,200 net acres in the western portion of Pioneer’s Eagle Ford Shale acreage position for $102 million, subject to normal closing adjustments.
