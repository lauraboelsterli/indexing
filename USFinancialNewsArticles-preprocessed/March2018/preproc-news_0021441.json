Pravind Jugnauth, the prime minister, told reporters Gurib-Fakim would resign after March 12, following the celebration of the countryâ€™s 50th anniversary. He did not comment on the row over credit card expenditure but he has previously said everyone should shoulder their responsibility, when asked about the issue by reporters.
