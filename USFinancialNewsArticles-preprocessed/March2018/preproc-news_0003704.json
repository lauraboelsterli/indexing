These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating the company's performance.\nThe primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the company's results in the same way management does. Management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the company's operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the company's business. Further, to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the company's relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, amortization of acquired leases, the net amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible senior notes, gains/losses on conversions of the company's convertible senior notes, gains/losses on sales of land and building improvements, gains/losses on company-initiated acquisitions of entities in which the company held an equity investment, and termination of office leases, as well as income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the company's long-term benefit over multiple periods.\nSpecifically, management is excluding the following items from its non-GAAP earnings per share, as applicable, for the periods presented in the Q4 FY18 financial statements and for its non-GAAP estimates for Q1 and FY19:\nStock-Based Expenses: The company's compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles and Acquired Leases: The company views amortization of acquisition- and building-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company's research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.\nAmortization of Debt Discount: Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the company's $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes due in April 2018 that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rate was approximately 2.5% for the convertible notes due 2018, while the actual coupon interest rate of the notes is 0.25%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management's assessment of the company's operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.\nGains on Acquisitions of Strategic Investments: The company views gains on sales of its strategic investments resulting from acquisitions initiated by the company in which an equity interest was previously held as discrete events and not indicative of operational performance during any particular period.\nIncome Tax Effects and Adjustments: The company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisitions-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles and acquired leases, amortization of debt discount, and gains on acquisitions of strategic investments. The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three-year period, and considers other factors including the company's expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates. For fiscal 2018, after evaluating the impact of the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") for the period from enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017 to fiscal year end, the company concluded that its previously disclosed non-GAAP tax rate of 34.5 percent remained appropriate. For fiscal 2019, the company has determined that its projected non-GAAP tax rate will be 21.5 percent, which reflects currently available information, including the anticipated impact of the Tax Act and interpretations thereof, as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the company's ongoing analysis of the Tax Act over the measurement period, the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in the company's geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the company's strategy or business operations. The company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate.\nThe company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. For this purpose, capital expenditures does not include our strategic investments, nor does it include any costs or activities related to our purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, and building - leased facilities.\n1 Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\"\nASC 340-40 \"Other Assets and Deferred Costs – Contracts with Customers\" and Accounting Standards Update 2016-01 \"Financial Instruments\" (ASU 2016-01), which will be effective as of the beginning of Fiscal 2019.\nsalesforce.com, inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended January 31,\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nRevenues:\nSubscription and support\n$\n2,655,000\n$\n2,110,651\n$\n9,710,538\n$\n7,756,205\nProfessional services and other\n196,003\n183,337\n769,474\n635,779\nTotal revenues\n2,851,003\n2,293,988\n10,480,012\n8,391,984\nCost of revenues (1)(2):\nSubscription and support\n548,475\n463,271\n2,033,457\n1,617,315\nProfessional services and other\n189,317\n162,686\n740,065\n616,724\nTotal cost of revenues\n737,792\n625,957\n2,773,522\n2,234,039\nGross profit\n2,113,211\n1,668,031\n7,706,490\n6,157,945\nOperating expenses (1)(2):\nResearch and development\n396,547\n344,192\n1,553,073\n1,208,127\nMarketing and sales\n1,364,305\n1,089,243\n4,829,291\n3,918,027\nGeneral and administrative\n274,490\n257,941\n1,088,358\n967,563\nTotal operating expenses\n2,035,342\n1,691,376\n7,470,722\n6,093,717\nIncome (loss) from operations\n77,869\n(23,345)\n235,768\n64,228\nInvestment income\n11,779\n3,627\n35,848\n27,374\nInterest expense\n(21,561)\n(24,323)\n(86,943)\n(88,988)\nOther income (1)\n20,130\n20,572\n17,435\n9,072\nGains from acquisitions of strategic investments\n0\n0\n0\n13,697\nIncome (loss) before benefit from (provision for) income taxes\n88,217\n(23,469)\n202,108\n25,383\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes\n(20,662)\n(27,971)\n(74,630)\n154,249\nNet income (loss)\n$\n67,555\n$\n(51,440)\n$\n127,478\n$\n179,632\nBasic net income (loss) per share\n$\n0.09\n$\n(0.07)\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.26\nDiluted net income (loss) per share\n$\n0.09\n$\n(0.07)\n$\n0.17\n$\n0.26\nShares used in computing basic net income (loss) per share\n724,127\n700,994\n714,919\n687,797\nShares used in computing diluted net income (loss) per share\n749,464\n700,994\n734,598\n700,217\n(1)\nAmounts include amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, as follows:\nThree Months Ended January 31,\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nCost of revenues\n$\n38,866\n$\n43,214\n$\n165,545\n$\n127,676\nMarketing and sales\n30,066\n31,000\n121,340\n97,601\nOther non-operating expense\n315\n564\n1,433\n2,491\n(2)\nAmounts include stock-based expense, as follows:\nThree Months Ended January 31,\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nCost of revenues\n$\n32,748\n$\n30,545\n$\n129,954\n$\n107,457\nResearch and development\n62,653\n63,323\n259,838\n187,487\nMarketing and sales\n112,015\n113,422\n468,553\n388,937\nGeneral and administrative\n30,266\n37,097\n138,668\n136,486\nsalesforce.com, inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(As a percentage of total revenues)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended January 31,\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nRevenues:\nSubscription and support\n93\n%\n92\n%\n93\n%\n92\n%\nProfessional services and other\n7\n8\n7\n8\nTotal revenues\n100\n100\n100\n100\nCost of revenues (1)(2):\nSubscription and support\n19\n20\n19\n19\nProfessional services and other\n7\n7\n7\n8\nTotal cost of revenues\n26\n27\n26\n27\nGross profit\n74\n73\n74\n73\nOperating expenses (1)(2):\nResearch and development\n14\n15\n15\n14\nMarketing and sales\n48\n48\n46\n47\nGeneral and administrative\n9\n11\n10\n11\nTotal operating expenses\n71\n74\n71\n72\nIncome (loss) from operations\n3\n(1)\n3\n1\nInvestment income\n0\n0\n0\n0\nInterest expense\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nOther income (1)\n1\n1\n0\n0\nGains from acquisitions of strategic investments\n0\n0\n0\n0\nIncome (loss) before benefit from (provision for) income taxes\n3\n(1)\n2\n0\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n2\nNet income (loss)\n2\n%\n(2)\n%\n1\n%\n2\n%",
