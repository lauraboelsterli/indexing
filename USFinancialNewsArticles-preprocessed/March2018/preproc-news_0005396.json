    "text": "SUGAR LAND, Texas, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, U.S. Dataworks announced the appointment of industry veteran David L. Peterson as President and Chief Strategy Officer. In his new role, David will expand the availability of Clearingworks, U.S. Dataworks' flagship integrated receivables software, allowing all banks, regardless of size, to deliver key financial technology solutions to their business customers.\n\"I'm delighted to join the U.S. Dataworks team,\" Peterson said, \"and very eager to bring critically- needed integrated receivables solutions to financial institutions and their business customers.\" Integrated receivables has not traditionally been a key component of FI-supplied corporate treasury management. However, continued Peterson, \"a new study released by Aite Group 1 indicates that 73% of all business customers consider a bank's ability to offer an integrated receivables solution as an 'Important' or 'Extremely Important' factor in choosing their banking relationships. Most businesses would even change banks to obtain automated receivables and cash application processes. Such powerful customer demand will move banks to use this technology. It will lower their SMB and corporate customers' remittance-related costs, with increased efficiency and convenience.\"\nPrior to joining U.S. Dataworks, Peterson was founder and CEO of Goldleaf Technologies, a leading provider of financial services technology, and of i7strategies, a consulting firm focused on financial services innovation. Peterson currently serves on the Board of Directors for Payments First, a regional ACH association. He is a frequent contributor to regional and national publications, and a keynote speaker for numerous industry events.\nAbout U.S. Dataworks\nU.S. Dataworks provides integrated software solutions that empower banks of any size to offer sophisticated treasury management services to their business customers.
