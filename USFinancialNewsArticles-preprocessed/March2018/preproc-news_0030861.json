    "text": "18 COMMENTS John Skipper, the former president of ESPN who abruptly resigned in December citing a substance-abuse problem , says his decision to step down after more than 20 years at the company was prompted by an extortion attempt by a person from whom he purchased cocaine.\nIn an interview with the Hollywood Reporter , Mr. Skipper said he disclosed the situation to Bob Iger, chief executive of Walt Disney Co. , the majority owner of ESPN, on Friday, Dec. 15. His resignation, which he called a mutual decision at the time, was announced the following Monday.\nNewsletter Sign-up Reached by phone, Mr. Skipper confirmed the contents of the interview with the Hollywood Reporter and declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment.\n“In December, someone from whom I bought cocaine attempted to extort me,” Mr. Skipper said in the interview to the Hollywood Reporter.\n“They threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well,” he said. “I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob [Iger], he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.”\nMr. Skipper’s shocking resignation almost three months ago came at a critical time for ESPN. The sports TV juggernaut is coping with a shifting media landscape where consumers are cutting back on cable-TV subscriptions, and ESPN is planning to launch its own streaming service this year. His exit came only a few days after Disney agreed to buy $52.4 billion of assets from 21st Century Fox Inc., including 22 regional sports networks. Earlier this month, Disney named James Pitaro, who has been Disney’s consumer products and digital chief since 2016, as ESPN’s new president .\nMr. Skipper said he has since gotten therapy and spent time in a rehabilitation facility, and he has ongoing resources to help him now. In the interview, he said his cocaine use didn’t interfere with his job \"other than a missed plane and a few canceled morning appointments.”\n“I do want to make it clear, however, that anything I did in this regard, and anything else resulting from this, was a personal problem,” Mr. Skipper said. “My drug use never had any professional repercussions, but I still have profound regret.”\nMr. Skipper also addressed a question about rumors of any inappropriate behavior toward female colleagues, saying such speculation is “categorically and definitively untrue.” Given the timing and surprising nature of Mr. Skipper’s resignation in December, just as the #MeToo movement swept the nation, rumors had swirled inside and outside ESPN of whether his exit was tied to any relationships with women.\nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com",
