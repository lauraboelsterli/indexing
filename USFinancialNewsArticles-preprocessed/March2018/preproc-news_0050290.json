    "text": "Luke Glendening had two goals, Darren Helm contributed a goal and two assists and the Detroit Red Wings surprised the Pittsburgh Penguins with a 5-2 win at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit on Tuesday night.\nDetroit defenseman Niklas Kronwall recorded his 400th career point with a first-period goal and rookie defenseman Joe Hicketts notched the first two points of his career with two assists. Frans Nielsen scored the go-ahead goal.\nDylan Larkin added two assists and Jimmy Howard stopped 22 shots for the Red Wings, who were eliminated from playoff contention last week.\nSidney Crosby and Kris Letang scored for the Penguins, while Matt Murray made 21 saves.\nCrosby scored 38 seconds into the game. Jake Guentzel made a steal in his own zone, skated along the left side and slid a pass to a wide-open Crosby. He one-timed it past Howard for his 27th goal.\nKronwall tied it with 3:17 remaining in the period. Helm fed him the puck from behind the net and Kronwall ripped a shot from the slot past Murray.\nPittsburgh had an apparent goal disallowed on an officials’ review midway through the second period when referees determined the puck didn’t cross the goal line. Detroit then scored twice in short order to take a 3-1 lead.\nThe first of those tallies came on a power play with Jamie Oleksiak in the penalty box for high sticking. Martin Frk passed the puck through traffic to Nielsen, who lifted a shot from the left circle over Murray’s right shoulder.\nJust 41 seconds later, Glendening scored his first goal of the night when he tipped a Nick Jensen shot from the point through Murray’s legs.\nThe Wings made it 4-1 with 13:39 remaining in the third when Larkin whipped a pass from behind the net to Helm, who scored his 10th goal.\nLetang scored his seventh goal this season with 3:16 left. Glendening’s 11th goal of the season with the Penguins’ net empty clinched Detroit’s win.\nPittsburgh won the first two meetings by identical 4-1 scores.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
