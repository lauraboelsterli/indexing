Whenever we use words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate\" or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when we discuss our expectations regarding our growth or profitability, reduction of costs and expenses, expected divestitures, plans for our existing and new products and services, penetration of new markets and securing new customers, contributions of our regions to our growth, resolution of our outstanding patent infringement claims, strengthening of our balance sheet and delivery long-term shareholder value. Because such statements deal with future events and are based on OTI's current expectations, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties and actual results, performance or achievements of OTI could differ materially from those described in or implied by the statements in this press release. Forward-looking statements could be impacted by the effects of the protracted evaluation and validation periods in the U.S. and other markets for contactless payment cards, or new and existing products and our ability to execute production on orders, as well as other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the \"Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. Except as otherwise required by law, OTI disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, whether as a result of new information, future events or circumstances or otherwise. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nOTI Press Contact:\nRichard Harris\nMarketing Manager\npress@otiglobal.com\nOTI Investor Relations Contact:\nGreg Falesnik\nManaging Director\nMZ Group – MZ North America\nMain: +1-949-385-6449\nOTIV@mzgroup.us\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/on-track-innovations-to-report-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-and-host-a-conference-call-on-wednesday-march-21st-at-9-am-eastern-time-300608742.html\nSOURCE On Track Innovations Ltd.
