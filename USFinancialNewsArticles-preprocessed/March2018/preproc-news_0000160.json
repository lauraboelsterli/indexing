    "text": "RUTLAND, Vt., March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Casella Waste Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CWST), a regional solid waste, recycling and resource management services company, today reported its financial results for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017. The Company also provided guidance for the next fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017:\nRevenues were $151.2 million for the quarter, up $7.4 million, or 5.2%, from the same period in 2016. Revenues were $599.3 million for the fiscal year, up $34.3 million, or 6.1%, from fiscal year 2016. Net income was $20.0 million for the quarter, as compared to a net loss of $(12.0) million for the same period in 2016. Net loss was $(21.8) million for the fiscal year, as compared to a net loss $(6.9) million in fiscal year 2016. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders* was $4.6 million for the quarter, as compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders was $28.7 million for the fiscal year, as compared to $7.8 million in fiscal year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $30.2 million for the quarter, up $0.8 million, or 2.8%, from the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $129.0 million for the fiscal year, up $8.4 million, or 7.0%, from fiscal year 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities was $107.5 million for the fiscal year, up $27.1 million, or 33.7%, from fiscal year 2016. Normalized Free Cash Flow was $38.8 million for the fiscal year, up $11.7 million, or 43.1%, from fiscal year 2016. On February 26, 2018, Standard & Poor’s increased our Corporate Credit Rating from ‘B’ to ‘B+’ with a positive outlook.\n“We had a strong operational quarter and a great year, as we continued to execute well against our key strategies,” said John W. Casella, Chairman and CEO of Casella Waste Systems, Inc. “We remain focused on creating shareholder value through increasing landfill returns, improving collection profitability, creating incremental value through resource solutions, driving general and administrative efficiencies, and strong capital discipline.”\n“The progress we have made on our strategies can be seen in the positive financial results in the fourth quarter,” Casella said. “Our disciplined solid waste pricing programs continued to add value, with landfill pricing up 3.6% and collection pricing up 3.7%. This strong pricing was coupled with 2.0% solid waste volume growth, mainly driven by 4.8% growth in landfill volumes as we continued to source new volumes in the tightening northeastern disposal markets, and 1.2% solid waste revenue growth from acquisitions.”\n“As we first announced in early August 2017, we have adjusted our capital strategy to balance delevering with prudent acquisition or development investments,” Casella said. “We have set a goal to grow revenues by $20.0 million to $40.0 million per year through acquisition or development activity for the next three years as part of this new strategy. We are off to a great start with this strategy, with roughly $18.0 million of acquired revenues over the last two months. During the fourth quarter we completed a small tuck-in hauling acquisition, and in early January 2018 we completed the acquisition of an integrated solid waste company in Western Massachusetts that provides us with a new market entrance and a strategic truck and rail served transfer station that will enable us to direct additional waste volumes to our landfills in New York and Pennsylvania. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we believe that investing a portion of our excess cash flows to grow our business will create additional shareholder returns through higher cash flow growth rates driven by new revenue streams, internalization to our disposal facilities and cost synergies.”\nFor the fourth quarter, revenues were $151.2 million, up $7.4 million, or 5.2%, from the same period in 2016, with revenue growth mainly driven by robust collection and disposal pricing, strong solid waste volumes, the roll-over impact from acquisitions, and higher volumes in the customer solutions line-of-business, partially offset by lower recycling commodity pricing and volumes.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $20.0 million, or $0.46 per diluted common share, up $32.0 million for the fourth quarter, as compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(12.0) million, or $(0.29) per diluted common share for the same period in 2016. Adjusted Net income Attributable to Common Stockholders was $4.6 million, or $0.11 of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share*, for the fourth quarter, compared to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders of $1.9 million, or $0.05 of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, for the same period in 2016.\nOperating income was $9.9 million for the fourth quarter, down $(0.1) million from the same period in 2016, whereas Adjusted Operating Income* was $10.3 million for the fourth quarter, down $(0.6) million from the same period in 2016.\n“During the fourth quarter, operating income was down approximately $2.0 million year-over-year in our recycling business,” Casella said. “This decline was mainly driven by China’s National Sword program, which imposed strict new contamination standards for recycled commodities and significantly reduced global demand for paper and cardboard products. This has led to mixed paper price declines of approximately 80% from July 2017 to January 2018, while at the same time our operating costs are up as we have slowed sorting lines and increased labor to produce higher quality end products. Our mature risk mitigation programs, such as the Sustainability Recycling Adjustment fee, have worked well to offset the majority of commodity price declines during the quarter and we expect these programs to continue to significantly reduce our commodity risk exposure.”\nFor the fiscal year, revenues were $599.3 million, up $34.3 million, or 6.1%, from fiscal year 2016, reflecting the impact of robust collection, disposal and recycling commodity pricing, higher volumes in the Company's collection, disposal, and customer solutions lines-of-business, and the roll-over impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower organics volumes.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $(21.8) million, or $(0.52) per diluted common share, a decrease of $(15.0) million for the fiscal year, as compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(6.8) million, or $(0.17) per diluted common share, for fiscal year 2016. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders was $28.7 million, or $0.67 of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, for the fiscal year, compared to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders of $7.8 million, or $0.19 of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, for fiscal year 2016.\nOperating loss was $(12.6) million for the fiscal year, down $(57.5) million from operating income of $44.9 million in fiscal year 2016, whereas Adjusted Operating Income was $52.8 million for the fiscal year, up $6.9 million from fiscal year 2016.\n2018 Outlook\n“Our fiscal year 2018 budget is on track with the fiscal year 2021 strategic plan that we first introduced in August 2017, and reflects continued execution of our key strategies with the goal of driving additional shareholder value,\" Casella said. “We remain cautious about near-term headwinds from the recycling business, however we believe that our mature risk mitigation programs will continue to offset the vast majority of commodity price declines and current market conditions are contemplated in our fiscal year 2018 guidance.”\nThe Company provided guidance for the next fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 by estimating results in the following ranges:\nRevenues between $618 million and $628 million (as compared to $599.3 million in fiscal year 2017); Adjusted EBITDA between $135 million and $139 million (as compared to $129.0 million in fiscal year 2017); and Normalized Free Cash Flow between $42 million and $46 million (as compared to $38.8 million in fiscal year 2017).\nThe Company provided the following assumptions that are built into its outlook:\nOverall the Company expects revenue growth of between 4.6% and 6.3% in fiscal year 2018. However, the Company expects that the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard to lower our revenues by approximately 1.5%. Given this change, the Company expects revenue growth of between 3.1% and 4.8% in fiscal year 2018. In the solid waste business, revenue growth of between 6.0% and 7.5%, with price growth from 2.5% to 3.5%, volume growth from 0.5% to 1.0%, and 3.0% growth from acquisitions already completed. In the recycling business, overall revenue declines of between 15.0% and 20.0%, driven by lower commodity prices, lower volumes and changes in revenue recognition, partially offset by higher processing fees. In the Other segment, overall revenue growth of approximately 5.0%, with growth in the industrial segment for the Customer Solutions group and higher volumes in the Organics group. The budget includes the roll-over impact of acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2017 and in early fiscal year 2018, but does not include any acquisitions that have not yet been completed. Capital expenditures of approximately $65 million, and payments on operating leases of approximately $7.5 million. No material changes in the regional economy from the last 12 months.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Normalized Free Cash Flow related to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 are described in the Reconciliation of 2018 Outlook Non-GAAP Measures section of this press release.\nConference call to discuss quarter and fiscal year results\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on Friday, March 2, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
