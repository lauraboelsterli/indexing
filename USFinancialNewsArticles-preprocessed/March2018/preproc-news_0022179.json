FILE PHOTO - A shareholder carries a bag with the logo of E.ON during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Essen, Germany May 10, 2017. REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen Adjusted net income will come to 1.3 to 1.5 billion euros ($1.60-1.85 billion) this year, compared with 1.4 billion in 2017, E.ON said on Monday. The group said its bottom line would grow by 5 to 10 percent per year through 2020 but that the Innogy deal would help it surpass that target. ($1 = 0.8108 euros)",
