The housebuilder and construction company said it would raise the money through a 1 for 3 rights issue to cover the costs of a project to build a major ring road in northern Scotland that has run behind schedule and above cost. Galliford had been working on the project with Carillion, which collapsed in January, and with Balfour Beatty. $1 = 0.7029 pounds Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Alistair Smout",
