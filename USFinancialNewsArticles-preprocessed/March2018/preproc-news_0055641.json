The two U.S. Commerce Department reports are due at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nInvestors have been jittery that rising inflation will force the Fed to accelerate rate hikes.\nDow e-minis were up 78 points, S&P 500 e-minis rose 9.75 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis gained 41.75 points.\nThe S&P 500 is down 2.56 percent in the first quarter, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 3.5 percent lower - set for their worst quarterly performances in more than two years.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq’s slim 0.66 percent gain for the quarter is keeping it on course for its seventh straight quarter of gains.\nFacebook was up 1.6 percent. The company said late on Wednesday it would end partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target users.\nGameStop shares fell 2.8 percent after the company reported revenue that beat analysts’ estimates on strong sales of Nintendo Switch consoles.
