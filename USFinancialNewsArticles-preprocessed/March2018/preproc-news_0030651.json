    "text": "0 COMMENTS As Oren Cass points out in “ Doomsday Climate Scenarios Are A Joke ” (op-ed, March 12), society is constantly adapting to all sorts of changes. That is definitely true, and the best way to adapt to climate change and avoid some of those “doomsday” scenarios is for society to adapt to a carbon-free future fueled by renewable energy. To do otherwise in the face of projected climate changes would be, as Mr. Cass puts it, “silly.”\nChristine Vidovich\nSan Pedro, Calif.",
