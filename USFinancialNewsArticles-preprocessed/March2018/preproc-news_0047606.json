    "text": "0 COMMENTS Kroll Bond Rating Agency conferred its highest rating on the U.S. government, marking the firm’s new push into sovereign credit.\nKroll’s grade on the U.S. on Wednesday is its first public sovereign rating, with the New York-based firm planning to issue more ratings on governments worldwide in coming months, a spokeswoman said.\nKroll pegged its AAA rating on the U.S. government’s status as a reserve currency country and its strong economy, the largest in the world. The rating is on par with those given by Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings to the U.S., and means that the country’s credit is ironclad, with default risk basically nonexistent.\nThe only big firm that hasn’t bestowed the highest rating on U.S. government debt is S&P Global Ratings, which dropped the debt one notch in 2011, grading it AA+.\nBut America’s interest costs actually went down after the downgrade, not rising as is usual when a credit rating is lowered. The result highlighted the U.S. government’s status within the world economy and the sheer number of parties willing to lend money to it.\nKroll’s rating on the U.S. is unsolicited, meaning that the firm wasn’t hired for the credit analysis.\nA U.S. debt rating is “a benchmark for everything else,” said Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors LLC. He added that the ratings tend not to be on an absolute level, but relative to the creditworthiness of other entities.\nFounded after the financial crisis in 2010, Kroll is one of 10 firms that the Securities and Exchange Commission recognizes as a national rating organization. It has gained influence in commercial mortgage-backed securities, capturing almost half of market share, according to a December SEC report . It also rates corporations, insurance companies and U.S. public finance entities, among other assets.\nStill, the credit rating industry remains highly concentrated, despite calls for change after top grades awarded by the biggest firms proved to understate the risk in assets, such as mortgage-backed securities, before the financial crisis.\nThe largest ratings firms—S&P, Moody’s and Fitch—constitute 96% of all ratings outstanding as of 2016, according to the SEC report.\nThose three enjoy similar dominance in revenues, and are often paid by the government entities or corporations that they rate, creating what some analysts describe as a potential conflict of interest that has not abated over the past decade, despite heightened scrutiny.\nThe Kroll rating comes as some analysts question the U.S.’s fiscal position. Mr. Whalen said that he doesn’t think the U.S. continues to be worthy of the top rating, given its recent lack of fiscal discipline. Recent tax cuts will likely lead to a widening of the fiscal deficit and an influx of Treasury market supply, analysts say.\nAdditionally, a recent report from Moody’s shows that the U.S. is whittling its tax base just as its interest expenses surge. Meanwhile, the U.S. population is aging and a reduction in trade and immigration, Moody’s warned, could affect long-term growth.\nKroll analysts also showed concern over the government’s widening deficit and its large debt load as seen as a percentage of gross domestic product. But they said Wednesday that greater political polarization as seen in “brinkmanship over the debt ceiling and budget” don’t change the firm’s view of the U.S. government’s pristine credit quality.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 2.777% on Wednesday from 2.790% on Tuesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com",
