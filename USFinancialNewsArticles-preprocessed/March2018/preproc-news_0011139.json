    "text": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey wants the public‚Äôs help in measuring the health of conversations on Twitter in an effort to combat the widespread abuse and hostility on the service.\nHe asked users for suggestions on Thursday, saying that he wants to develop a system of metrics that would be used to determine what makes a Twitter conversation healthy. Like how doctors diagnose the health of their patients by checking things like body temperature, Twitter would use these metrics to diagnose the health of online conversations and, presumably, create a system that promotes more positive comments.\nDorsey acknowledged Twitter‚Äôs failure to rein in some of its most toxic users over the years, saying the company has ‚Äúwitnessed abuse, harassment, troll armies, manipulation through bots and human-coordination, misinformation campaigns, and increasingly divisive echo chambers.‚Äù While Twitter (twtr) loves ‚Äúinstant, public, global messaging and conversation,‚Äù he said, the company ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt fully predict or understand the real-world negative consequences.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe acknowledge that now, and are determined to find holistic and fair solutions,‚Äù Dorsey said.\nWe‚Äôre committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.\n‚Äî jack (@jack) March 1, 2018\nTwitter has said several times that it would take steps to stop offensive comments . It started removing the verified status of popular users‚Äîindicated as a blue check mark on their profiles‚Äî who post racist comments. It also said it would suspend users who engage in ‚Äúviolent extremism.‚Äù But it hasn‚Äôt been enough.\nDorsey said that most of Twitter‚Äôs efforts to combat abusive posts involve punitive measures like ‚Äúremoving content‚Äù that violate the company‚Äôs terms. A better way to address the problems, Dorsey believes, would be to create ‚Äúa systemic framework to help encourage more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking.‚Äù\nHe said Twitter has been working with outside researchers like the media non-profit Cortico on ways to measure the health of public conversations. Cortico listed some of its proposed metrics in a separate post, which include the following:\nShared Attention: Is there overlap in what we are talking about?\nShared Reality: Are we using the same facts?\nVariety: Are we exposed to different opinions grounded in shared reality?\nReceptivity: Are we open, civil, and listening to different opinions?\nDorsey conceded that Twitter doesn‚Äôt know if Cortico‚Äôs proposed metrics are best ways to measure ‚Äúconversation health.‚Äù He added that Twitter doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúknow how best to measure them, or the best ways to help people increase individual, community, and ultimately, global public health.‚Äù\nDorsey hopes that people will provide feedback about Twitter‚Äôs ideas for healthy conversations. Next week, he and other Twitter executives plans to discuss the topic in more detail with users through the company‚Äôs Periscope live video service.\n newsletter.\nNot everyone is convinced that Dorsey‚Äôs plans will work.\nJillian York, the director of International Freedom of Expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, criticized Dorsey‚Äôs new initiative, accusing him of failing to listen to his own staff that works on combating abuse.\nSome folks inside your ‚Äútrust and safety council‚Äù have privately told me they‚Äôre there just to make you look good, that you don‚Äôt listen.\n‚Äî ü¶Ñ jillian (@jilliancyork) March 1, 2018\nOther Twitter users also criticized Dorsey‚Äôs plan.\nIs there a canonical list of all the times @jack has said Twitter is committed to change? Because it hasn‚Äôt been true any time before now. https://t.co/vJrw4bJ0r9\n‚Äî ¬°feduardo! (@fedward) March 1, 2018\nI think the hardest part will be dealing with your lack of honesty. @Twitter shadow bans conservative points of view & you have employees who intentionally go after certain people with conservative values. If you want to be fair, it must apply to all users.\n‚Äî Sevens Secret (@SevensSecret) March 1, 2018\nDorsey seems to have anticipated the skeptical response, and said that he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve this will be easy.‚Äù\nDefinitely don‚Äôt believe this will be easy. That‚Äôs why we must be more open.\n‚Äî jack (@jack) March 1, 2018",
