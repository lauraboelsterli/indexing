He will oversee Toft Group's corporate development, client care, marketing and sales teams and lead the San Francisco branch of Toft Group.\n\"Demand for top talent, particularly qualified diverse candidates, is at an all-time high as healthcare companies recognize a talent gap has emerged, driven by waves of baby-boomer retirements,\" said Robin Toft, founder, president and chief executive officer of Toft Group. \"Ron is a proven leader with an extensive track record of building successful healthcare companies.
