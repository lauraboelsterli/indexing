    "text": "By Valentina Zarya 8:04 AM EDT\nGood morning, Broadsheet readers! Two girls from Brooklyn explain why they’re walking out of high school today, we meet the woman who might become the CIA’s first female chief, and Queen Elizabeth is as susceptible to wage inequality as the rest of us (or at least the woman who plays her is). Have a wonderful Wednesday.\nEVERYONE'S TALKING\n• Why they’re walking. It’s been exactly one month since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and thousands of students around the country are planning to pay tribute to the 17 lives lost by walking out of school for exactly that many minutes at 10 a.m. Eastern time. The nationwide walkout is organized by Women’s March Youth Empower, an offshoot of the organization that organized the post-inauguration event in January 2017.\nNaomi Giancola and Maddie Paterna, two young women from Midwood High School in Brooklyn, New York explain to Fortun e why they have organized a walkout for their classmates:\n“The primary goal of our walkout is to allow students to have an open discussion about gun control. For so many of us, schools and teachers are the primary source of our information. How are we supposed to get different perspectives if we’re not talking about it amongst ourselves?”\n“We hope that this will force people to actually think about guns and their impact on our lives. We want our peers to formulate their own opinions on gun control. We have already had countless students come up to us and say that they have learned more about the issue of gun control from our Instagram than they have ever learned in school.”\nFortune\nAdvertisement ALSO IN THE HEADLINES\n• Haspel’s history. With Secretary Rex Tillerson out and CIA chief Mike Pompeo taking his spot, the new head of the intelligence agency will, if confirmed, be Gina Haspel—the first woman to hold the job. What do we know about Haspel? The good: She has received several awards, including the George H. W. Bush Award for excellence in counterterrorism and the Presidential Rank Award, the highest award in the federal civil service. The ugly: A 2017 New York Times report says Haspel, in 2002, oversaw the torture of two suspects at a secret prison in Thailand and later was involved in the destruction of videotapes documenting that torture.\nFortune\n• Las mujeres más poderosas. The Association of Latino Professionals for America (ALPFA) has brought back its annual list of the 50 Most Powerful Latina women in Corporate America. Topping the list is PG&E CEO Geisha Williams (read my feature on her here ). No. 2 is PepsiCo’s EVP for Global Operations Grace Puma, while PwC’s Maria Castañón Moats, vice chair and U.S. and Mexico assurance leader, rounds out the top three.\nFortune\n• MS Lawsuit. According to court filings made public Monday, U.S. women working in technical roles at Microsoft filed 238 internal complaints of gender discrimination or sexual harassment between 2010 and 2016. Of the 118 claims of gender discrimination filed, the tech giant only deemed one as “founded.” That lawsuit, filed in Seattle in 2015, accuses Microsoft of systematically denying pay raises and promotions to women working there. The company denies discrimination of any kind.\nFortune\n• Manning’s not looking back. Speaking at the SXSW Conference on Tuesday morning, Chelsea Manning said she had no regrets about her “data dump” of hundreds of thousands of classified military documents with WikiLeaks in 2010. The former U.S. Army intelligence analyst served seven years in prison for violating the Espionage Act before her sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama in 2017. Proof that she’s looking forward and not backward? She has quietly filed to run for the U.S. Senate in her home state of Maryland.\nFortune\nMOVERS AND SHAKERS: A+E Networks CEO Nancy Dubuc has been named CEO of Vice Media. Scholastic announced the appointment of Stephanie Smirnov as executive vice president and head of global corporate communications. Shutterstock has hired Lisa Nadler as chief human resources officer.\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\n• Hill still stirring it up. Conservative groups are criticizing Hillary Clinton for her comments about Trump voters. At a Mumbai, India, event over the weekend, Clinton said her one-time presidential opponent’s campaign “was looking backwards. You don’t like black people getting rights, you don’t like women getting jobs, you don’t want to see that Indian American succeeding more than you are.” As a result, Fox & Friends slammed Clinton for “trash[ing] America’s heartland.”\nFortune\n• A royal injustice. Claire Foy, the actress who plays Queen Elizabeth II on Netflix’s The Crown earned less than her male counterpart during the first two seasons of the show. While this is far from the first report of a wage gap in Hollywood, it feels particularly egregious since the entire show centers around the Queen.\nVanity Fair\n• Mad women. On Monday, a group of 180 female advertising executives announced the launch of Time’s Up Advertising in partnership with the larger Time’s Up movement and legal-defense fund. “As women in senior leadership positions in advertising, we’ve agreed that we have the power to change this business we love until it looks more like the industry we want to lead,” reads a letter on the group’s website .\nNew York Magazine\n• Pearl, you’re a gem. Pearl Street Films, the production company founded by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in 2012, announced late Monday that all of its future projects will include inclusion riders (contractual clauses that insist on gender and racial diversity in the hiring of cast and crew).\nFortune\nShare today’s Broadsheet with a friend.\nLooking for previous Broadsheets?
