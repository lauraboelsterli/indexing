A broker reacts while trading at his computer terminal at a stock brokerage firm in Mumbai, India, February 26, 2016. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/Files The broader NSE Nifty closed 0.99 percent lower at 10,094.25, its lowest closing level since Dec. 6. The benchmark BSE Sensex ended down 0.76 percent at 32,923.12, its lowest closing level since Dec. 7. Financial stocks lost ground, with public sector lenders taking the brunt. “When you look at the data, it’s relentless selling by foreign investors. Hedge funds are shorting the PSU banks. PSU banks’ valuations are high and their earnings growth look muted,” said Sunil Sharma, Chief Investment Officer at Sanctum Wealth Management. The Nifty PSU bank index closed down 2.6 percent, with Bank of Baroda Ltd ending 7.3 percent lower.
