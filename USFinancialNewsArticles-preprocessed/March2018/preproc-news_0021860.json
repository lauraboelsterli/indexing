    "text": "Published: Mar 11, 2018 4:52 p.m. ET Share \nAdaptation of Madeline L’Engle book has so-so debut Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection Chadwick Boseman stars in “Black Panther.” \nBy Ben Fritz \nIt was a box-office wrinkle Walt Disney Co. didn’t see coming. \nRather than its new, heavily marketed adaptation of a classic children’s book topping the box office this weekend, a superhero movie it released nearly a month ago continued to dominate ticket sales. \nRead: Yes, Black Panther is still breaking all kinds of records \nDisney’s DIS, +0.67% “A Wrinkle in Time” opened to a so-so $33.3 million in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates, putting it in second place behind the company’s own “Black Panther,” which grossed $41.1 million and was No. 1 at the box office for the fourth weekend in a row. “Black Panther” has now grossed a total of $562 million domestically, No. 7 of all time. \nOverseas, the African superhero film made its debut to a solid, if not spectacular, $66.5 million in China, its final major market launch, and its global total reached $1.08 billion. “Black Panther” is now ranked No. 21 of all time at the worldwide box office. The first Marvel movie featuring a nonwhite star still appears to still have plenty of juice left before finishing its box office run.",
