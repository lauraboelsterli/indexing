    "text": "Published: Mar 14, 2018 3:36 p.m. ET Share \nTelevision commentator has criticized president’s decision to impose tariffs \nBy David Harrison Reuters Economic analyst Lawrence \"Larry\" Kudlow appears on CNBC at the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 7, 2018. \nLawrence Kudlow, President Donald Trump’s pick for National Economic Council director, is a prominent Republican economic analyst and television commentator with an extensive record of policy views. \nA former budget official in the Reagan administration, Mr. Kudlow, 70, worked as an economist at Bear Stearns before becoming an editor at the conservative National Review in 1994 and later a host on CNBC. He has been a vocal advocate of “supply-side” economics, the idea that cutting business taxes and regulation will lead to greater investment, hiring and economic growth. He supports free trade and a strong dollar, positions at odds with those of his new boss. He also favors tax cuts and low interest rates, putting him in sync with the president.",
