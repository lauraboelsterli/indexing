Dutkowsky, chairman and chief executive officer. \"During fiscal 2018, we closed the acquisition of Avnet's Technology Solutions business and introduced the new Tech Data – a global company that is redefining technology distribution with a unique end-to-end product and services portfolio and highly specialized skills. Fiscal 2018 was also a year of significant strategic and financial progress, posting the highest sales, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow from operations in our history and revealing the enhanced earnings power and strong cash flow profile of the new Tech Data. This strong financial performance enabled us to pay down $850 million of debt and attain our post-acquisition target leverage ratio well ahead of our 18 to 24-month plan. Our employees, customers and vendor partners are excited about the value the new Tech Data brings to the market today, as well as the future promise of our company.\"\nBusiness Outlook\nPlease note, the Business Outlook for worldwide net sales provided below is based on the new revenue recognition standard (\"ASC 606\") that the Company adopted as of February 1, 2018.\nFor the quarter ending April 30, 2018, the Company anticipates worldwide net sales to be in the range of $8.0 billion to $8.3 billion. For the quarter ending April 30, 2018, the Company anticipates EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.67 and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.60. This guidance assumes an average U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.22 to €1.00. This guidance assumes weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 38.6 million. For the quarter ending April 30, 2018, the Company anticipates its effective tax rate will be in the range of 27 percent to 29 percent. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019, the Company expects its effective tax rate will be in the range of 26 percent to 28 percent, primarily related to the decrease in the U.S. federal income tax rate as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nWebcast Details\nTech Data will hold a conference call today at 9:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2018.
