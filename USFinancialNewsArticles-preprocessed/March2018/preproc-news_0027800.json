Brause as its Chief Financial Officer effective March 26, 2018, as part of a mutually agreed upon transition process between the Company and current Chief Financial Officer, Howard Katzenberg. Katzenberg will serve as an advisor to OnDeck until April 13, 2018, working closely with Brause to facilitate a smooth transition.\n\"We are excited to welcome Ken to OnDeck and look forward to benefitting from his financial expertise and proven track record leading sophisticated financial services operations,\" said Noah Breslow, OnDeck's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nBrause said, \"OnDeck is the clear leader in online small business lending, and I am very pleased to join Noah and the rest of the team at such an exciting time in the company's evolution and growth trajectory.\"\nBrause, 53, joins OnDeck with more than 30 years of experience in the financial services industry. Most recently, Brause served as Executive Vice President and Treasurer of CIT Group and CIT Bank with responsibility for all areas of CIT's Treasury function, including funding & liquidity, investments, balance sheet management, and capital management. Prior to becoming Treasurer, Brause was Chief Financial Officer for CIT's North America Banking group with responsibility for overseeing all financial aspects of the company's Commercial Services, Corporate Finance, Equipment Finance, Factoring, and Consumer Banking activities. Brause previously served as the President of CIT's Small Business Lending group, managing the firm's SBA lending activities, and also served as the integration lead for CIT's purchase of OneWest Bank, as well as CIT's head of Investor Relations.\nEarlier in his career, Brause was the Investor Relations Officer for The Bank of New York and American General Corporation, and served as the Vice President of Strategy & Development at Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. After beginning his career at Booz, Allen & Hamilton, Brause spent 13 years at Bankers Trust in various financial roles, including head of Investor & Media Relations and as a Principal in Debt Capital Markets. Brause received his M.B.A. in Finance and Accounting from The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business (now known as the Booth School of Business) and his B.S. of Economics in Finance and Management from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\nBreslow continued, \"We are deeply grateful to Howard for his many contributions to OnDeck over the last decade, including nearly six years as our Chief Financial Officer. Howard has helped position OnDeck for our next phase of growth and profitability and we wish him the best in his future endeavors.\"\nKatzenberg said, \"The last ten years at OnDeck have been truly remarkable, and I take great pride in the company we've built.
