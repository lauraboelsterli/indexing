    "text": "CNBC.com Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Time Inc. signage is displayed in the lobby of the company's new headquarters in New York. \nMeredith Corporation said on Wednesday it will consider selling its Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money brands, citing differences in target audience with its other titles. \nThe media company also about 200 employees have been notified that their positions have been eliminated, and approximately 1,000 more positions will be eliminated over the next 10 months. The layoffs are part of Meredith's plan to cut $400 to $500 million in costs following its $2.8 billion acquisition of Time in January. \n\"These are attractive properties with strong consumer reach. However, they have different target audiences and advertising bases, and we believe each brand is better suited for success with a new owner,\" Meredith President and CEO Tom Harty said in a statement. \nMeredith boasts reaching nearly 80 percent of millennial women with publications, like Country Life, Better Homes and Gardens and Woman's Weekly. Its roster also includes 17 television stations. Its content primarily focuses on entertainment, food, lifestyle, home, parenting, beauty and fashion. ",
