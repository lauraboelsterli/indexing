    "text": "- Third Quarter Net Sales Increased 4.1% to $585.5 Million -\n- Third Quarter Net Income Improved by 139% to $19.7 Million -\n- Third Quarter Adjusted EBITDA Increased 3.8% to $42.2 Million -\nTUCKER, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GMS Inc. (NYSE:GMS), a leading North American distributor of wallboard and suspended ceilings systems, today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 ended January 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter 2018 Highlights Compared to Third Quarter 2017\nNet sales increased 4.1% to a record $585.5 million; base business net sales increased 2.9% Net income increased to $19.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $8.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA grew 3.8% to a record $42.2 million Gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 33.4%\nMike Callahan, President and CEO of GMS, stated, “We delivered record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA performance during the third quarter, topping a very challenging year-over-year comparison. I am particularly encouraged that we delivered solid organic revenue growth despite the impact of adverse weather conditions in the southern U.S. I am also pleased to report we captured approximately three points of wallboard price growth during the third quarter and expanded our overall gross margin on both a sequential and annual basis, which keeps us on track to achieve our previously announced guidance of gross margin in excess of 32.5% for fiscal year 2018.”\nMr. Callahan continued, “We generated broad-based sales growth across all of our product groups led by strong double-digit growth in ceilings during the third quarter. We completed one acquisition in the quarter and maintain a very robust pipeline that we anticipate will become more active over the next few quarters. Looking towards the balance of the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver another year of record net sales and Adjusted EBITDA.”\nThird Quarter 2018 Results\nNet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 ended January 31, 2018 were $585.5 million, compared to $562.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 ended January 31, 2017.\nWallboard sales of $256.4 million increased 0.6%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 with wallboard unit volume decline of 1.9% to 826.3 million square feet offset by pricing improvement of 2.9%. Wallboard volume decline was partially driven by lost shipping days due to abnormal weather conditions across many of our largest markets in the southern U.S. as well as a tough comparison to an extremely strong third quarter of fiscal 2017. Ceilings sales of $90.4 million rose 10.5%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, mainly due to greater commercial activity, price gains and the positive impact of acquisitions. Steel framing sales of $96.7 million grew 3.5%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, mainly driven by pricing improvement. Other product sales of $142.0 million were up 7.4%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, as a result of strategic initiatives, price gains and the positive impact of acquisitions.\nGross profit of $195.4 million grew 5.2%, compared to $185.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, mainly attributable to higher pricing and increased sales. Gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 33.4%, compared to 33.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 largely due to pricing discipline and purchasing initiatives. On a sequential basis, gross margin improved 60 basis points from 32.8% from the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nNet income of $19.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, increased by 139% or $11.5 million, compared to $8.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted net income of $15.3 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, grew $0.5 million, compared to $14.8 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $42.2 million rose 3.8%, compared to $40.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.2% as a percentage of net sales, flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, with improvement in gross margin offset by an increase in SG&A related expenses.\nCapital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2018, GMS had cash of $28.9 million and total debt of $597.5 million, compared to cash of $19.8 million and total debt of $610.5 million as of October 31, 2017.\nTax Legislation Update\nWe recognized an income tax benefit of $4.5 million during the three months ended January 31, 2018 compared to income tax expense of $5.4 million during the three months ended January 31, 2017. The change over the third quarter of fiscal 2017 is primarily related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. More specifically, we recognized a provisional income tax benefit of $7.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the enactment of the Tax Act. Our Adjusted EPS disclosures exclude the net benefit from this item and reflects an effective tax rate of 34.5% based on our estimated taxes under the Tax Act. For fiscal 2019, we anticipate our full year effective tax rate will be approximately 23% to 25%.\nLease Accounting\nIn order to take advantage of the Tax Act’s accelerated depreciation provisions, facilitate the implementation of the new lease accounting standard which we will adopt in fiscal 2020, and improve the comparability of our financial statements with our publicly traded peers, beginning in fiscal 2019 we intend to finance the purchase of new commercial vehicles under capital leases and to convert the majority of our legacy equipment operating leases into capital leases or purchase the equipment outright. We anticipate that this will reduce our SG&A expense and increase our Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $21.0 to $24.0 million per year beginning in fiscal 2019. The change is also expected to increase the property and equipment and debt accounts by approximately $75 million as of the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\nConference Call and Webcast\nGMS will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its results for the third quarter ended January 31, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on March 6, 2018. Investors who wish to participate in the call should dial 800-239-9838 (domestic) or 323-794-2551 (international) at least 5 minutes prior to the start of the call. The live webcast will be available on the Investors section of the Company’s website at www.gms.com . There will be a slide presentation of the results available on that page of the website as well. Replays of the call will be available through April 6, 2018 and can be accessed at 844-512-2921 (domestic) or 412-317-6671 (international) and entering the pass code 2730994.\nAbout GMS Inc.\nFounded in 1971, GMS operates a network of more than 210 distribution centers across the United States. GMS’s extensive product offering of wallboard, suspended ceilings systems, or ceilings, and complementary interior construction products is designed to provide a comprehensive one-stop-shop for our core customer, the interior contractor who installs these products in commercial and residential buildings.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nGMS reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, it presents Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and base business growth, which are not recognized financial measures under GAAP. GMS believes that Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin assist investors and analysts in comparing its operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s management believes Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and base business growth are helpful in highlighting trends in its operating results, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates and capital investments. In addition, the Company utilizes Adjusted EBITDA in certain calculations under its senior secured asset based revolving credit facility and its senior secured first lien term loan facility.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons GMS considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in GMS’s industry or across different industries.\nForward-Looking Statements and Information:\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
