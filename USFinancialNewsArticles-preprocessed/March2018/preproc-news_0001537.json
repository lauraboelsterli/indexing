    "text": "5 COMMENTS Italy will elect a new Parliament Sunday. To many eyes the campaign reflects what seems like chronic Italian chaos, with a flamboyant former leader and television executive duking it out with various Euroskeptic and antiestablishment parties. So it may come as a surprise to many that chaos at home isn’t translating into geopolitical irrelevance. Quite the opposite.\nIn countries from Libya to Niger, Italy’s armed forces are quietly conducting nation-building. Rome’s foreign and military policy is helping make the Middle East and North Africa more stable, with benefits for all of Europe. We should give the Italians credit for it.\nItaly plays an important but unsung role in a number of hot spots. In Iraq alone, Italian officers have already trained some 130,000 troops and 10,000 police officers, and in Afghanistan and Lebanon they’re also training government forces. \nSoon more than 250 Italian troops will deploy on a similar mission in Niger. “In Italy, the public is cautious about hard combat missions, but the armed forces are accepted by everyone when they do institution-building,” noted Giampaolo Di Paola, a retired admiral who has served as defense minister and chief of the defense staff.\nItalian leaders are realistic about their capacity to single-handedly build democratic institutions in war-torn countries. But professional training provided by military officers used to operating under democratic systems can make a crucial difference in fragile countries. \n“In many of these countries, the armed forces are the main component of government, so it’s crucial to build them,” Mr. Di Paola says. In a new report, the RAND Corp. makes much the same case, pointing to the U.S. and British armed forces’ success in building South Korea’s and Ghana’s militaries. South Korea has since thrived; to a lesser extent, so has Ghana.\nCloser to home, Italy’s most pressing problem—and one of Europe’s—is stemming the tide of migrants and refugees arriving from North Africa and the Middle East. Here Italy is starting to enjoy some success. In January, 3,141 illegal migrants reached Italy via Libya, according to the Italian Interior Ministry. It’s a 27% drop compared with January 2017. February has seen an even steeper drop, of 90% compared with February 2017.\nCooperation with local armed forces, including training, has made a big difference. “When we arrived last year, the Libyan coast guard and navy were not active,” Italy’s ambassador to Tripoli, Giuseppe Perrone, says. “They would not go out in their waters. Zero. Now that has changed. By the end of last year, they had rescued 20,000 people.” \nMr. Perrone is one of only a handful of ambassadors based in Libya. Most countries consider it too dangerous. His diplomatic staff works with 300 Italian officers (soon to be joined by another 100) to train Libya’s navy, coast guard, air force, border force and counterterrorism agency. Italian officers train Libyan troops in Italy, too. “We can’t afford a security vacuum in Libya, so we have to help the Libyans build their institutions,” Mr. Perrone says. “They have to be the main actor dealing with illegal migration to Europe via Italy.” \nItaly’s efforts aren’t without controversy. Some migrant-aid organizations have accused it of heavy-handedness. Mr. Perrone has been called a colonialist. Italy has been accused of paying off Libyan militias to keep migrants away. (The Italian government denies any such deals.)\nBut European policy makers now share the Italian view that institution-building in Africa and the Middle East is the only sustainable answer to instability and illegal migration. And while the Italian soldiers’ efforts have eased the pressure on Europe, they’re getting little credit for it. “People see our efforts and say, ‘Bravo, but what about Russia?’ ” Mr. Di Paola says. “If we deployed one battalion”—about 800 troops—“to Lithuania, NATO would love it, but if we deployed 10 battalions to Africa, nobody would say much at all.”\nRussia’s military buildup in its neighborhood is a serious concern. But so is instability in the Mediterranean. Italy’s efforts are “like an invisible but essential protective shield, real and psychological: If it is broken or lowered, the consequences for Europe would be unpredictable in terms of security and political stability,” says Paolo Alli, an Italian parliamentarian from the Alternativa Popolare party and chairman of NATO’s Parliamentary Assembly.\nTo be sure, most asylum seekers arriving in Europe are Syrians, and not even Italy’s combined military would be able to create stability in that ravaged country. But Italy’s nation-building beyond its borders is as important to Europe as the outcome of its elections this Sunday. Governments come and go, but if Italy decided not to train all these armed forces and government agencies, it’s not certain that another country would assume its responsibilities.\nMs. Braw is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.",
