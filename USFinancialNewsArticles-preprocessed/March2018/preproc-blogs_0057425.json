    "text": "/ cameroon Mega Millions jackpot tops $500 million for only the fourth time \nThe jackpot for the Mega Millions lottery climbed to $521 million, but no winner was immediately announced early on Saturday for a pot that surpassed the half-billion-dollar mark for the fourth time in the game’s history, the lottery said. \nThe winning numbers drawn on Friday night were 11, 28, 31, 46, and 59 with a “mega Ball” of 1. \nThe drawing follows a March 27 Mega Millions drawing that was the twenty-third in a row without a jackpot-winning ticket. \nThe grand prize has rolled higher since it was last won on Jan. 5 at $451 million by a 20-year-old Florida man, the lottery said. \nFriday’s 11 pm ET (0300 GMT) jackpot drawing was for the tenth largest prize ever offered in the United States. Powerball holds the record with a $1.586 billion payout in 2016. \nThe Mega Millions record is $656 million won in 2012. ADVERTISEMENT",
