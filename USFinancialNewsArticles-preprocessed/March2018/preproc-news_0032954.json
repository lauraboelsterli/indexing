Built with computer code, powered by microchips and operated in the cloud, these digital building blocks did not exist until relatively recently. But in other respects, platforms are simply large aggregations of people coming together to search information online, shop or connect with friends.\nCompare today’s platforms to the American Constitution: a large aggregation of citizens organized on the principle of self-government. As a work of design, the Constitution is a brilliant piece of architecture, an intellectual foundation that has stood the test of time. If James Madison were a software developer in a Harvard dorm room and not a Virginia planter, we might say he was a better coder than Mark Zuckerberg. The Constitution understands human nature. Facebook , dangerously at times, does not.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Photo: Getty Images In designing the Constitution, Madison managed to appeal to people’s better angels while at the same time calculating man’s capacity to harm and behave badly. Facebook’s designers, on the other hand, appear to have assumed the best about people. They apparently expected users to connect with friends only in benign ways. While the site features plenty of baby and puppy photos, it has also become a place where ISIS brags about beheadings and Russians peddling misinformation seek to undermine the institutions of a free society.\n“If men were angels,” wrote Madison in Federalist 51, “no government would be necessary.” The father of the Constitution knew better. A government of men required a delicate set of checks and balances, and limits on executive authority. Minority rights needed protection. Even the concept of rule by the people was tempered to mean not direct plebiscite but representative democracy. With these limits in place, the Constitution has acted as a restraint on humanity’s darker impulses for nearly 230 years.\nFacebook’s design is the opposite. It proceeds from the same utopian assumptions that the pioneers of the internet largely espoused. Not only should information be free, but sharing it is by nature a good thing. This design philosophy has produced many unintended consequences. Bad actors have learned to manipulate the platform and sow uncertainty and chaos.\nLast month Robert Mueller obtained indictments against 13 Russians who are charged with brazenly posing online as legitimate interest groups when their real purpose was to promote confusion and disrupt the 2016 presidential elections. Think about Facebook from the perspective of these alleged trolls. If you wanted to create the perfect instrument to undermine confidence in the Western canon—democratic government, the rule of law, respect for empirical evidence—you would design something like Facebook. Vladimir Putin’s misinformation campaigns recall the line attributed to his namesake, Vladimir Lenin : “The capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.”\nFacebook isn’t the only social-media platform but it is the largest, making it a juicy target for mischief. Mr. Zuckerberg has pledged to make 2018 about “fixing” his invention, but so far the company has responded with a series of half measures and Band-Aid solutions including de-emphasis of outside news sources, elevation of friend-generated content, and promises of greater security and privacy protection. These necessary changes won’t weed out the corruption that has compromised trust in the platform.\nFacebook’s problem is one of structural design. Its continued high growth depends on engagement levels and audience size. In the quest for revenue growth there is no incentive to expose impostors and make-believe content. As a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study published earlier this month in Science magazine showed, false information tends to spread much faster than the truth. The further fake news spreads and the more user engagement it generates, the more money Facebook makes. While Mr. Zuckerberg has said he would sacrifice profit to clean up the platform, it is hard to see how Facebook can endure in its present form. There is simply too much rot.\nRegulators may have the last word, particularly since Facebook is treating its current predicament like a public-relations crisis rather than a threat to its business model. The company seems unable to curb the abuses that are tainting the platform. The head of Facebook’s advertising unit took pains to tweet that Russian-backed ads mostly ran after the 2016 election—and thus did not influence the outcome—when it was Russian-backed phony content, not ads, that had an impact on U.S. opinion. A retweet from President Trump forced the company to disavow its own executive.\nFacebook insists it is not a media company. Maybe so. But unless it takes on the responsibilities of an editor and publisher by verifying the identities of users, filtering content that runs on its platform, and addressing the incentives to post specious or inflammatory “facts,” Facebook should expect to be policed externally.\nAgain, Madison’s words are rooted in the realities of human nature: “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.” As presently constituted, Facebook is out of control and cannot last.\nMr. Bergevin is a longtime technology and communications executive.",
