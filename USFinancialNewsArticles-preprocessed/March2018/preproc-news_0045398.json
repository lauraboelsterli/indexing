    "text": "1 COMMENTS From upstate New York in the 1980s, we took multiple airplanes across what felt like incalculable stretches of earth to reach my mother’s native city, and when, half a world later, we’d step out onto the aircraft steps at Dum Dum Airport, it was the smell that told me we’d arrived. Eau de Calcutta: steamy and smoky, with a vegetal heart and a top note of spice, it was a smell you more tasted than breathed. We’d bundle into an Ambassador car and drive past huts surrounded by water-logged fields, past a billboard welcoming us to the “City of Joy,” past the pungent tannery district and into the knot of sooty, honking, banyan-draped city streets.\nThe city is called Kolkata now (its English name was changed in 2001), and like so much else in India, the city has been transformed by economic growth and liberalization. A communist state government that presided for 34 years over deindustrialization and social unrest has been replaced by an administration aligned with the Congress party and run by Bengal’s first female chief minister. Signs in a new airport terminal welcome visitors to the “cultural capital of India.” The fields between the airport and the city have been carpeted in concrete overpasses and glassy high-rises. The tanneries have shifted to a new site 15 kilometers away. In the city center, developers have bulldozed colonial-era buildings (and the preservation laws that protect them) to put up spindly high-rises.\nThe Epic City By Kushanava Choudhury\nBloomsbury, 238 pages, $28\nYet nobody looking for “the new India” would come to Calcutta to find it. If India’s Silicon Valley is the tech hub Bangalore, then Calcutta must be its Detroit, a former economic powerhouse scarred by decades of deindustrialization. That’s why the Calcutta-bred writer Kushanava Choudhury shocked his family when he decided to move back to the city after graduating from Princeton in 2001. “Nothing had changed since my childhood,” he found. “The footpaths were still overrun by hawkers . . . the mildewed concrete buildings, the bowl-shaped Ambassador taxis . . . the tea shop benches on the sidewalks, the caged balconies of the middle classes, the narrow entrails of corrugated slums. . . . The city was in its own time zone.” Any ambitious young person was best advised to flee.\nIn “The Epic City,” Mr. Choudhury has written neither a historical travelogue like William Dalrymple’s winning excavation of Delhi’s layered past, “City of Djinns,” nor a piece of immersive journalism like Suketu Mehta’s “Maximum City,” a gritty exploration of changing Mumbai. Instead, he presents a memoir of sorts, meditating on Calcutta through his own changing relationship to the city. The book interleaves his experiences as a boy brought up partly in the family’s ancestral house; as a recent college graduate working at the Statesman newspaper; and as a fledgling author who moves to Calcutta with his new, Delhi-raised wife.\n“Founded” by the East India Company agent Job Charnock in 1690, Calcutta thrived for centuries as British India’s economic, intellectual and political capital. Mr. Choudhury’s forebears belonged to the “bhadralok,” a class of wealthy, educated Bengalis who flourished under British rule. One of his relatives even “changed the family name from the Bengali ‘Kar’ to the Scottish ‘Kerr’ to attract more British clients.” In the narrow lanes of Calcutta’s “Black Town,” where Indians lived—in contrast to the “White Town” of the British—the bhadralok built ornate, rococo mansions that gave Calcutta the nickname “City of Palaces.”\nBy the end of the 19th century, Calcutta had also become a hub of anti-colonial ferment. In 1911 the British Viceroy shifted the imperial capital to Delhi, leaving Calcuttans with what Mr. Choudhury calls “a tropical variant of Stockholm syndrome”—an enduring sense that “the time when we were ruled would also be the era we would remember as our most glorious.” Over the coming decades, communal violence and horrifying famine ravaged the city; after independence in 1947, firms and factories started closing, leaving more than 45,000 acres of abandoned land.\nMr. Choudhury writes passionately about the Communist government’s misbegotten efforts and arrant failures to remedy Calcutta’s blight. Reporting on a government plan to dredge one of Calcutta’s foetid canals—and evict 50,000 slum dwellers in the process—Mr. Choudhury is pulled up short by the realization that “a democratically elected Communist government was following a colonial law that denied its people a basic foothold in the city. . . . ‘Capitalism’ and ‘Communism,’ ‘democracy’ and ‘development’ all seemed like terms whose meanings had been unmoored from their original forms.”\n“The Epic City” has a meandering structure, and Mr. Choudhury’s swerves from one topic or moment to another can sometimes wrong-foot the reader. His blend of memoir and reportage has the advantage, however, of letting him slip between the gates of so much writing about Calcutta—nostalgic evocations of a fading cosmopolis on one side and “the trope of an urban hellhole” on the other. The emotional climax of the book comes when Mr. Choudhury’s weddedness to Calcutta comes at the expense of harmony with his wife. They start couples therapy with a psychoanalyst who informs him that the number one cause for divorce in Calcutta is intrusive mothers-in-law. “How could I explain to the Freudian that the city,” as intractable as any in-law, “was the problem between us?”\nThough his book is entitled “The Epic City,” Mr. Choudhury leaves one with the sense that Calcutta might best be considered an “adda” city: An adda is a form of sociability widespread among Calcutta’s middle class, in which conversation among friends continues on for hours and goes nowhere in particular, ranging across all manner of topics over countless cups of tea. An old-fashioned adda looks like an artifact in an India addicted to Facebook and WhatsApp. Messy, engaging, impossible to summarize, it looks like Calcutta itself.\n—Ms. Jasanoff is a professor of history at Harvard and the author, most recently, of “The Dawn Watch: Joseph Conrad in a Global World.”",
