Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban speaks during a joint news conference with Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov in Sofia, Bulgaria, February 19, 2018. REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov “We will respect the law ... there is some room of maneuver but only within these limits,” Orban said. Orban seeks a third consecutive term in parliamentary elections on April 8. “There won’t be an election budget, the deficit will definitely remain below 3 percent ... and the most likely outcome is that we will keep (to the target),” he added.
