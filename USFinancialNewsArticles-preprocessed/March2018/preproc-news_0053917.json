Chairwoman of the Russian Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko attends a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, October 19, 2015. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/Files \nIt cited her as telling reporters: “Without a doubt, Russia, as is diplomatic practice, will respond symmetrically and observe parity when it comes to the number of diplomats.” \nTies between London and Moscow are badly strained by the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. Britain alleges Russia was to blame, but Moscow says it had no involvement. \nThe United States said on Monday it would expel 60 Russian diplomats, joining governments across Europe in punishing the Kremlin for the nerve agent attack.
