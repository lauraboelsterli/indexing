    "text": "FRANKFURT, March 6 (Reuters) - Germanyâ€™s biggest residential real estate company Vonovia stuck with its guidance for an increase in 2018 core profit as it reported a 21 percent jump in 2017 earnings.\nDemand for German real estate has risen in recent years, with investors seeking safe havens and interest rates remaining low. The arrival of more than 1 million migrants in 2015 and 2016 combined has added to increased demand for housing.\nVonovia this year sees its core profit (FFO 1) rising to 960 million to 980 million euros ($1.18-1.21 billion), excluding recently-acquired Buwog, it affirmed on Tuesday, from 920.8 million in 2017.\n$1 = 0.8113 euros Reporting by Maria Sheahan Editing by Arno Schuetze\n ",
