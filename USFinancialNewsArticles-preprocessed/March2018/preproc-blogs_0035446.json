This is a major task all of us need to accomplish together responsibly so as to avoid water-related conflicts.\" The report described NBS as being \"inspired and supported by nature.\" NBS either use or mimic naturally-occurring processes to help improve the management of water. Examples include dry toilets, water harvesting and permeable pavements. \"In the face of accelerated consumption, increasing environmental degradation and the multi-faceted impacts of climate change, we clearly need new ways to manage competing demands on our precious freshwater resources,\" Gilbert F. Houngbo, chair of UN-Water and president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said. ",
