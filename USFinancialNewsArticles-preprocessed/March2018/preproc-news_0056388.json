    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, DiaMedica Therapeutics Inc. (the “ Company ” and “ DiaMedica ”) (TSX-V:DMA) (OTCQB:DMCAF) is pleased to announce the successful completion of the second and final tranche of its previously announced offering of units (the “Units”) for additional gross proceeds of approximately USD$2.5 million (the “ Offering ”). In total, the Company has raised gross proceeds of USD$6.3 million.\n\"This financing should enable us to complete our recently initiated DM199 REMEDY Phase 2 study in patients who have suffered an acute ischemic stroke and also initiate our planned clinical study in patients with chronic kidney disease,\" commented Rick Pauls, DiaMedica’s President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We look forward to continuing to maximizing the value of our science and in advancing our clinical programs and we are grateful for the support and commitment from our investors.”\nDetails of the Offering\nThe Company issued 10,534,059 units of the Company (the “ Units ”) at a purchase price of USD$0.245 (CAD$0.31) per Unit (the “ Offering Price ”) in this second and final closing. Each Unit consists of one common share of DiaMedica Therapeutics and one-half of one common share purchase warrant (each whole Common Share purchase warrant, a “ Warrant ”). Each Warrant entitles the holder to acquire, subject to adjustment, one additional common share at an exercise price of USD$0.35 per share until 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on the date that is: (i) twenty-four months after the date of issuance, or (ii) if on any date (the “ Accelerated Exercised Date ”) (a) the volume-weighted average closing trading price of the Common Shares on any recognized Canadian stock exchange equals or exceeds USD$0.60 for a period of 21 consecutive trading days, then, at the Company’s sole discretion and upon the Company sending the holder written notice of such Accelerated Exercise Date (the “ Notice ”) and issuing a news release announcing such Accelerated Exercise Date (the “ News Release ”), the day that is 30 days following the later of: (i) the date on which such Notice is sent to the holder; or (ii) the date on which the News Release is issued.\nIn connection with closing of the second tranche of the Offering, the Company paid aggregate finder’s fees of approximately USD$156,000 and issued an aggregate of 648,334 Compensation Options (the “ Compensation Options ”) to the following finders: TriView Capital, CIBC, Leede Jones Gable and Mackie Research Capital Corporation. Each Compensation Option entitles the holder to purchase one Common Share at the Offering Price for a period of 24 months from the closing of the Offering, subject to acceleration on the same terms as the Warrants.\nThe Common Shares and Warrants issued by the Company under the Offering are subject to restrictions on resale in accordance with applicable securities laws and the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange. These restrictions will expire on July 30, 2018. The Offering is subject to final acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange.\nDiaMedica intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering towards (i) recently initiated REMEDY trial studying DM199 for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, (ii) DM199 study in patients with chronic kidney disease and (iii) for general corporate purposes.\nInsiders of the Company, subscribed in the non-brokered private placement and subscribed for an aggregate of 571,780 Units for gross proceeds of approximately USD$140,000. Participation of insiders of the Company in the Private Placement constitutes a related party transaction as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 ( Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions ).

The Company did not file a material change report 21 days prior to the closing of the private placement as the details of the participation of insiders of the Company had not been confirmed at that time.\nThis news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in the United States, or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons (as such term is defined in Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ 1933 Act ”).
