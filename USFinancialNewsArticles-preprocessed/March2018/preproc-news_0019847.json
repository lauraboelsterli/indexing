    "text": "The nation's leading parking technology company welcomes longtime technology entrepreneur and advisor as its chief executive; founder Aashish Dalal becomes Chairman\nCHICAGO, March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ParkWhiz today announced Yona Shtern as its new chief executive officer, assuming the role from founder Aashish Dalal who will become Chairman of the company's Board of Directors. The move positions ParkWhiz to continue to accelerate its growth, as it redefines the last mile of transportation for millions of people through their mobile devices and connected vehicles.\nShtern is an entrepreneur with an expertise in building and managing successful global brands in e-commerce, telecommunications and fashion retail. He was co-founder and CEO of Beyond the Rack, a well-known e-commerce marketplace which connected 15 million consumers with over 5,000 fashion and lifestyle brands. Shtern has served as the ParkWhiz Chairman for the past year.\n\"The Board and I spent a great deal of time searching for the right person to help lead ParkWhiz to the next level,\" said Dalal. \"Yona is an experienced leader who believes in what we've built, but also recognizes how vast our opportunity is for growth.\"\nThe transition comes 11 years after Dalal founded ParkWhiz. He created the company to simplify the parking experience and to remove the hassles of everyday travel. Since then, ParkWhiz has become the nation's leading parking reservations, payments and data platform and holds the richest parking data depository in North America.\n\"ParkWhiz is a company that is redefining a number of industry verticals. It mirrors my experience in the wireless and e-commerce sectors in which I oversaw rapid adoption of a better consumer paradigm,\" said Shtern. \"It's exciting to be at that stage of adoption again - powering the platform which enables consumers, devices and connected cars to interact with mobile services like parking.\"\nIn addition to Shtern, the company has attracted a number of key executives to its leadership team over the past year as it continues to drive growth, including Dan Roarty as President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Judge as Chief Technology Officer and Ed Lewis as Senior Vice President of Business Development.\nAbout ParkWhiz\nParkWhiz is the leading transactional platform that enables drivers, fleets and connected vehicles to select and book parking from the largest inventory of spaces before reaching their destinations, saving both time and money. Working with all major parking operators, it delivers transactional parking as a value-added service to major brands in sports and entertainment, travel, automotive and navigation, including Ford, Ticketmaster, Groupon, Madison Square Garden and others. The company operates two consumer-facing brands of its own, ParkWhiz and BestParking, available for Apple, Android and Amazon Alexa. ParkWhiz has parked over seven million vehicles and is operational in over 190 cities in North America and expanding rapidly.
