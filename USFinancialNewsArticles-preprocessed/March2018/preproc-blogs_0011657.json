    "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has blocked microblogging site Tumblr after complaints about pornographic content on hundreds of accounts, the communications ministry said on Tuesday.\nThe world’s most populous Muslim-majority country has stepped up efforts to police online content after a rise in hoax stories and hate speech, and because of anti-pornography laws pushed by Islamic parties.\nThe ministry sent an email to Tumblr on Feb. 28 asking it to “clean its platform” of pornographic content within two days, Noor Iza, a spokesman for the ministry, said in a text message.\nIt then blocked eight Tumblr domain names on Monday after he said it had not received a response.\nIndonesia has tough anti-pornography laws and the ministry said it had received complaints about pornographic contents on more than 360 accounts.\nTumblr, which is part of Verizon’s Oath business, which also includes Yahoo and AOL, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\nAccording to the site’s community guidelines, any sexual or adult-oriented content should be flagged as “Not Suitable for Work” to warn users of the material.\nIndonesia blocked more than 70,000 sites displaying “negative” content such as pornography or militant ideology in January with a system using 44 computer servers to help purge the internet of material deemed harmful, the communications minister said in an interview last month.\nAuthorities also threatened last year to block Facebook Inc’s WhatsApp Messenger, which is widely used in the country, unless graphics interchange format (GIF) images provided by third parties were removed.\nAuthorities had blocked access to some channels on encrypted messaging service Telegram last year, saying it had several forums that were “full of radical and terrorist propaganda”.\nReporting by Tabita Diela; Writing by Ed Davies; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ",
