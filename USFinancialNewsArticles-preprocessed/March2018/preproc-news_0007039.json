    "text": "HONG KONG and BEIJING, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Paul Yang, SVP and General Manager of Ruder Finn Beijing, has been appointed to helm the fast growing and robust Ruder Finn Hong Kong office. He will also take on a new role as National Head of Automotive Practice, China. With his extensive experience in the automotive sector, Paul will centralize the practice in Hong Kong for Greater China. Judy Guo will replace Paul as Ruder Finn Beijing's General Manager and continue to broaden the integrated communications of all practices. Both will report directly to Elan Shou, EVP and Regional Director of Ruder Finn Asia.\nPaul has been the General Manager of Ruder Finn Beijing since 2012, and has established a consistent track record of delivering beyond client expectations, and developed a broad range of communications skills that have helped clients build and manage their reputation in China's complex business and media environment. The success and growth of Ruder Finn Beijing into the 2 nd largest Ruder Finn office in the region is a result of his passion, experience and commitment. Paul joined Ruder Finn as an intern, becoming full-time in 2003, and in 2007, was the first Chinese employee to participate in its Staff Development Exchange Program. From 2008 to 2011, Paul headed the Corporate Practice and substantially grew the client portfolio by adding MNCs and fast-growing Chinese brands as clients.\nHis experience covers a wide range of industries, including aviation and logistics, automotive, energy, finance, healthcare, travel and tourism and technology. Paul has also been consulted on reputation management, developed crisis manuals and response systems and provided crisis management training. He has extended his reach into Government and Public Affairs, connecting clients with China's key influencers and government stakeholders by organizing and promoting successful, relevant and insightful forums, summits and large-scale campaign events, including the BusinessWeek CEO Forum, Economist China Summit, Global Green Economic Forum, Volvo Group's Sustainable Cities Leadership Forum, and Visa's award-winning China-US Year of Tourism reputation campaign.\nAs well as inheriting Ruder Finn's leadership role in luxury and automotive, Judy will gear up the development in expanding business sectors such as technology, real estate, and travel & tourism. She will work closely with leaders and teams across Ruder Finn Greater China, and the region.\nJudy brings with her 17 years of experience in the communications industry including corporate, technology and brand marketing for travel, luxury and FMCG clients. She began her PR career in 2001, holding senior positions in WE RedBridge, Hill+Knowlton, Weber Shandwick, Text 100 and Bluefocus. Judy has consistently strived to offer clients in-depth strategies that go beyond traditional PR to embrace the new age of integrated communications and marketing. Recognized as one of the best leaders in the industry, Judy has advised a varied client portfolio on integrated marketing communications, content marketing, corporate communications, and crisis management. Judy holds a Bachelor of Literature degree from Wuhan University, majoring in communications. She is fluent in Chinese and English.\nElan Shou, EVP and Regional Director of Ruder Finn Asia :\n\"This major transfer of Paul Yang to Ruder Finn Hong Kong is further evidence of Ruder Finn's commitment to growing our people, providing opportunities and building individual careers. I am confident we will see more of these cross-office transfers in the future. I am delighted to have Judy on board. She is passionate, committed, shares our Ruder Finn family culture, and believes in our corporate philosophy \"What's Next\"!\"\nPaul Yang, SVP and General Manager of Ruder Finn Hong Kong, and National Head of Automotive Practice China:\n\"I'm very excited to continue my Ruder Finn journey with these new roles, to continue our growth momentum and expansion, in both Hong Kong and the automotive sector. I believe, with Ruder Finn's unique strength in China and Hong Kong as the Greater China hub, we are well positioned to take advantage of the increasing opportunities in the region, including China's 'Greater Bay Area' initiative.\"\nJudy Guo, General Manager of Ruder Finn Beijing:\n\"Ruder Finn has transformed into a leading integrated communications consultancy, creating great opportunities for clients, and for ourselves. \"I look forward to working with the team in providing more integrated offerings to our clients, enhancing their brand, and spurring business growth.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nElan SHOU, EVP and Regional Director of Ruder Finn Asia\nMobile: +86 21 5383 1188\nEmail: shoue@RuderFinnAsia.com\nAbout Ruder Finn Asia – 'The Art and Science of Engagement'\nFounded in 1989, Ruder Finn Asia ( www.ruderfinnasia.com ) is the Asia-Pacific subsidiary of New York-based Ruder Finn ( www.ruderfinn.com ), a global communications consulting firm, producing award-winning work at the intersection of content, creative and digital.
