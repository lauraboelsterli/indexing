REUTERS/Na-Son Nguyen/Pool Heraldo Munoz, Chile’s minister of foreign affairs, told a news conference the agreement was a strong signal “against protectionist pressures, in favor of a world open to trade, without unilateral sanctions and without the threat of trade wars.”\n“We will be giving a very powerful signal,” he said.\nReporting by Dave Sherwood and Felipe Iturrieta; Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Bill Trott\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
