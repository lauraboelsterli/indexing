    "text": "TORONTO, March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dalradian Resources Inc. (TSX:DNA) (AIM:DALR) (“Dalradian” or the “Company”) announces results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, including closing cash and cash equivalents of $138 million 1 .\nPatrick F.N. Anderson, Dalradian's President and CEO, commented: “Curraghinalt, one of the world’s best undeveloped gold projects, continues to move towards production. We are nearing completion of our infill drilling program and preparation of a resource update, which will then feed into an updated feasibility study later this year.\nOur planning application to build a mine has been accepted by the government and is currently in the review and public consultation phase. There is a thorough permitting process in Northern Ireland and as part of that we expect a public inquiry to be called late in 2018. We welcome this opportunity to demonstrate to the public that we will build a safe and environmentally responsible mine that will bring jobs and investment to the local area.\nOur expanded community relations team has stepped up engagement to build understanding and support for the project and our permitting team continues with preparation of additional materials to feed into the permitting process. Nearly 1,000 people have participated in our popular tunnel and site tours, which are open to the public, and we have had expressions of interest by more than 800 people in employment at our proposed mine.”\n1 All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted\nOperational highlights as of March 15, 2018\nDuring Q4 2017, Dalradian completed work on its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment in support of a planning (permitting) application to build a mine at Curraghinalt. The Planning Application was submitted to the Department for Infrastructure of Northern Ireland on November 27, 2017.\nDrilling completed to date, including all 2017 drill holes, totals 29,670 m of infill drilling in 76 holes to support the planned conversion of ounces from the inferred to indicated mineral resource category and 14,557 m in 36 holes of step-out drilling, up to 450 m beyond the existing resource envelope, to support resource growth.\nIn Q4 2017 and the period subsequent to year end, Dalradian reported on 20,843 m of drilling from the 40,000-metre drill program from a total of 23 step-out holes and 28 infill holes. Select results included: Step-out: 0.74 m of 82.47 g/t gold from the V75 vein in hole 17-CT-456 Step-out: 1.85 m of 19.27 g/t gold from the Crow vein in hole 17-CT-440 Step-out: 1.98 m of 32.54 g/t gold from the 106-16 vein in hole 17-CT-427 Infill: 1.51 m of 41.04 g/t gold from the 106-16 vein in hole 17-CT-424 Infill: 2.61 m of 36.15 g/t gold from the No. 1 vein in hole 17-CT-454 Infill: 1.05 m of 53.64 g/t gold from the Mullan-S vein in hole 17-CT-470\nOver Q4 2017, regional exploration continued across the broader licence areas, with 6 prospecting samples, 1 stream sediment sample, 129 soil samples, and 794 deep overburden samples collected. During all of 2017, 210 prospecting samples, 260 stream sediment samples, 299 soil samples, and 2,481 deep overburden samples were collected.\nCorporate and financial highlights of Q4 2017\nCash and cash equivalents were $138.0 million at December 31, 2017 compared with $35.7 million at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents increased this period as a result of closing a private placement previously announced on October 10, 2017. Orion Mine Finance acquired 34,013,605 common shares of the Company and Osisko Gold Royalties acquired 19,217,687 common shares of the Company, each at a price of C$1.47 per common share (the \"Issue Price\") for total gross proceeds of C$78.25 million.\nNet loss of $1.8 million ($0.01 per share) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with a net loss of $3.0 million ($0.01 per share) for the comparable period of 2016. For the 12 months ending December 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss of $7.7 million ($0.03 per share) compared to a net loss of $7.8 million ($0.03 per share) in the same period of 2016.\nExpenditures on mineral property under development for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $7.1 million compared with $3.7 million during the comparable period in 2016. During Q4 2017, permitting and drilling were the largest spending categories as work focused on finalizing the Planning Application and completing infill and step-out drilling at Curraghinalt. In Q4 2016, much of the activity centered on studies for the feasibility study and the Underground Program.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, expenditures on mineral property under development, net of $5.4 million proceeds received from processing of mineralized material during Q1 2017, were $19.5 million compared with $23.3 million during the comparable period in 2016.\nAs of March 15, 2018, Dalradian had 355,493,448 Common Shares issued and outstanding.\nOutlook\nNow that the Planning Application has been submitted, progressing to production at Curraghinalt is the Company’s primary goal and will be advanced in 2018 through drilling, engineering and geological studies, and environmental and permitting activities. The Company expects to release a mineral resource update during Q2 2018, followed by an updated FS during Q3 2018.\nThe 2018 work program is expected to include up to 14,000 metres of step-out drilling at the Curraghinalt deposit, up to 10,000 m of regional drilling and continued exploration of the Company’s large land package through sampling across the licence areas. Permitting activities will include preparation and submission of applications for ancillary permits and consents and expanded stakeholder relations activities to support the Planning Application.\nThe budget for 2018 is approximately $49 million for all operational activities in Northern Ireland and Canada, including general and administrative costs. Drilling/Geology and Permitting/Community Relations will utilize 50% of the operational budget, with planned expenditures roughly similar for the two areas. Mine planning and engineering work to produce the FS update is the third-largest component at approximately 10% of the overall budget.\nWorking capital at December 31, 2017 was approximately $132 million. This financial strength supports 2018 plans to continue exploration and other work to increase the value of Curraghinalt, while simultaneously moving the project through the permitting process.\nSupporting Documents\nThe 2017 year-end Financial Statements (not including notes) can be found below.
