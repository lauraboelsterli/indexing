Total group income fell to 671.9 million pounds ($933.20 million) in the year ended Dec. 31 from 737 million pounds in the previous year. Underlying adjusted earnings before interest, taxation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell to 64.7 million pounds in 2016, from 83.5 million a year earlier. Total income in the UK sales and lettings business declined 17.2 percent. Countrywide, whose Chief Executive Alison Platt stepped down in January, said the company entered 2018 with its pipeline “significantly below” that of 2017.
