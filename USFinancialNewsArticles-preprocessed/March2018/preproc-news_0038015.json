Lee was reappointed by President Moon Jae-in to lead the BOK for another four years. Lee noted the bank will closely monitor risks from high household debt and financial market volatility as it determines interest rates going forward. $1 = 1,086.8000 won Reporting by Cynthia Kim, Dahee Kim Editing by Eric Meijer",
