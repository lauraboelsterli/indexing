    "text": "--Firdapse ® NDA to be Resubmitted Before the End of this Quarter\n--Significant Progress with MuSK-MG Regulatory and Clinical Program\n--$84M Year-End Cash and Investments\n--Company to Host Quarterly Conference Call at 5:00 pm ET Today\nCORAL GABLES, Fla., March 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:CPRX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for people with rare debilitating, chronic neuromuscular and neurological diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year-\n“Throughout 2017, we made significant progress in successfully completing our second Phase 3 trial evaluating Firdapse for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) and successfully completing the required abuse liability studies that confirmed that Firdapse does not exhibit abuse potential. We also continued to build our rare neuromuscular disease platform as we prepared to enroll subjects in our Phase 3 clinical trial for MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis and our proof-of-concept clinical trial for spinal muscular atrophy Type 3,” said Patrick J. McEnany, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “We remain on track to resubmit our NDA for Firdapse this quarter, and we are actively engaged in pre-commercialization activities for a potential launch of Firdapse.”\n2017 and Recent Highlights\nAnnounced top-line results in LMS-003 trial, reaching both primary and secondary endpoints and completed required abuse liability studies Announced positive data from investigator-sponsored trial of Firdapse in treating MuSK antibody positive Myasthenia Gravis Confirmed timeline for NDA resubmission for Firdapse expected first quarter of 2018 following a positive Type C meeting recently held with the FDA Announced Phase 2 study of Firdapse in ambulatory patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 3 Reached an agreement with the FDA under SPA for Phase 3 Firdapse in MuSK-MG trial Reinitiated pre-commercialization activities for a potential launch of Firdapse Raised $53.8M in net proceeds from a public offering in November Ended December 31, 2017 with $84.0 million in cash and investments and no debt\nUpcoming Milestones\nResubmit NDA for Firdapse in the first quarter of 2018 Enroll first subject in Phase 3 trial for MuSK-MG in H1 2018 Enroll first subject in SMA Type 3 proof of concept trial in the second quarter of 2018 Expect to complete enrollment in the Phase 3 CMS (CMS-001) trial before the end of 2018 and to report top-line results from this trial in the first quarter of 2019\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial Results\nFor the year , Catalyst reported a GAAP net loss of $18,412,377, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $18,072,452, or $0.22 per basic and diluted share, for the 2016 fiscal year. Excluding non-cash loss of $186,904 attributable to the change in fair value of liability-classified warrants, Non-GAAP 1 net loss was $18,225,473, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share, for the year In comparison, Non-GAAP 1 net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $18,958,589, or $0.23 per basic and diluted share, which excludes non-cash gain of $886,137 attributable to the change in fair value of liability-classified warrants.\nFor the quarter , Catalyst reported a GAAP net loss of $5,387,698, or $0.06 per basic and diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $4,163,320, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, for the 2016 fiscal year. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Non-GAAP 1 net loss was the same as GAAP net loss as there were no Non-GAAP 1 adjustments. In comparison, Non-GAAP 1 net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $4,270,266, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, which excludes non-cash gain of $106,946 attributable to the change in fair value of liability-classified warrants.\nResearch and development expenses for the year were $11,375,237, compared to $11,369,941 for the 2016 fiscal year. For the fourth quarter of 2017, research and development expenses were $3,404,634, compared to $2,820,654 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Research and development expenses in 2017 were consistent with amounts expended in 2016, and included expenses related to ongoing studies and trials for Firdapse, the costs of Catalyst's Firdapse Expanded Access Program, and costs of Catalyst's CPP-115 and generic Sabril ® programs. Catalyst expects that its R&D spend for 2018 will continue to be substantial as Catalyst completes its clinical trial for CMS, continues its Expanded Access Program, continues its clinical programs for MuSK-MG and SMA Type 3, prepares the NDA submission for Firdapse, and manufactures Firdapse launch supplies.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year totaled $7,304,399, compared to $7,910,260 in the 2016 fiscal year. For the fourth quarter of 2017, general and administrative expenses totaled $2,107,152, compared to $1,493,545 in the same period in 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses from 2017 to 2016 was primarily due to Catalyst's efforts to conserve cash after the receipt of the FDA’s “refusal to file letter” for Firdapse. Catalyst expects that general and administrative costs will increase in 2018, as Catalyst prepares for the commercialization of Firdapse.\nCatalyst had no revenues in the year 2017 or 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, Catalyst had cash and investments of $84 million and no debt. Based on its current financial position and its forecasts of available cash, Catalyst believes that it has sufficient funds to support its operations through 2019 (without considering revenues and cash receipts that may be received in 2019 if Catalyst is successful in obtaining an approval of Firdapse and launching the product in 2019, of which there can be no assurance).\nMore detailed financial information and analysis can be found in Catalyst's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year , which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, earlier today, March 14, 2018.\nConference Call\nCatalyst management will host an investment-community conference call and webcast at 5:00 p.m. ET, today, Wednesday, March 14, 2018 to discuss the financial results and provide a corporate update.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause Catalyst's actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. A number of factors, including (i) whether the results of the LMS-003 trial, combined with the results of the Company's previous Phase 3 trial, will be acceptable to the FDA as support for an approval of Firdapse for the treatment of LEMS, (ii) whether the results of the abuse liability studies undertaken by Catalyst will be acceptable to the FDA as support for an approval of Firdapse, (iii) whether any NDA submitted for Firdapse will be accepted by the FDA, and the timing of any such submission and acceptance, (iv) whether the receipt of breakthrough therapy designation for Firdapse will expedite the development and review of Firdapse by the FDA or the likelihood that the product will be found to be safe and effective, (v) whether, if an NDA for Firdapse is accepted for filing, such NDA will be given a priority review by the FDA, (vi) whether Firdapse will ever be approved for commercialization, (vii) whether Catalyst will be the first company to receive an approval for amifampridine (3,4-DAP), giving it 5-year marketing exclusivity for its product, and (viii) those other factors described in Catalyst's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2017 and its other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could adversely affect Catalyst. Copies of Catalyst's filings with the SEC are available from the SEC, may be found on Catalyst's website, or may be obtained upon request from Catalyst.
