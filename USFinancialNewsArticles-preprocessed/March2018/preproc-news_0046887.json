    "text": "CAIRO/ALEXANDRIA (Reuters) - Egyptians began voting on Monday in a presidential election that guarantees victory to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, running virtually unchallenged with all credible candidates intimidated or locked up.\nSisi, who appears to see the vote more as a referendum on his rule than a serious democratic contest, has urged Egyptians to vote, hoping a large turnout will give him a mandate to repair the economy, crush Islamists fighting to topple him and revive Egypt’s diminished regional clout.\nOpposition figures have called for a boycott, while the president’s sole challenger is Moussa Mostafa Moussa, a Sisi supporter widely seen as a dummy candidate.\nSisi’s top potential challenger, influential former military chief of staff Sami Anan, was arrested and halted his presidential bid; another serious contender, ex-prime minister Ahmed Shafik, dropped his campaign, apparently under pressure.\nEgypt’s election commission said the election would be free and fair, and Sisi said he would have liked more candidates running.\nBy evening, turnout among the 59 million eligible voters appeared low. Polls closed at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) but there are two more days for Egyptians to cast votes, with official media hammering the message that voting was a national duty to foil the country’s “enemies”.\nSisi, an ex-general who in 2013 led the military overthrow of Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, is trying to defeat Islamist insurgents in the Sinai Peninsula and complete a series of mega-projects inaugurated with great fanfare since he came to power.\nThose who cast ballots said they were voting for stability.\n“If it weren’t for Sisi, Egypt would have become like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya - they (Islamists) would have destroyed the country,” said Fayez Amin, 72, tourism worker, who voted in the upscale Cairo neighbourhood of Zamalek.\n“Without Sisi you wouldn’t be able to be here,” he told a Reuters reporter.\n“If it weren’t for Sisi, the country would have collapsed. He is clearing the country of terrorists,” said Sayed Kamel, who runs a bookshop.\nIn the northern Sinai Peninsula, locked into a fight between the army and Islamist militants, officials overseeing voting said there was minimal turnout as many residents feared leaving their homes would expose them to an attack.\nIslamic State’s Sinai branch warned Egyptians against voting in an apparent threat weeks ahead of the election.\nMUZZLING OF OPPOSITION The vote follows the heaviest crackdown in decades on dissent, targeting not only Islamists but also secular and liberal activists. Hundreds of Brotherhood members and leaders have been locked up, critics muzzled and websites blocked.\nSecular opposition figures also urged Egyptians to stay away from the polls.\n“I’m boycotting the elections because it’s clear there aren’t actually elections, it’s simply a referendum on the ruling regime...All the opposition candidates that had popularity or national support are in jail,” said Ahmed Saad, a leader within the liberal Ghad al-Thawra Party, in Alexandria.\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi writes as he arrives to cast his vote during the presidential election in Cairo, Egypt, March 26, 2018. The Egyptian Presidency/Handout via REUTERS Another voter lamented the election’s lack of choice.\n“There’s no real competition or diversity of choice,” a 42-year-old man in Alexandria said, without giving his name for fear of reprisal by authorities.\nIn poorer neighbourhoods, where residents have been hard hit by inflation, there appeared to be less interest in voting. In the working-class Cairo neighbourhood of Sharbiya there were voting stations with only a handful of voters and none with more than 10 individuals waiting in line, a Reuters reporter said.\nIn Cairo’s Rabaa square, the scene of a bloody crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, few voters appeared, mostly elderly admirers of Sisi.\nAmr Darrag, a Brotherhood leader in exile, urged Egyptians not to vote, saying in a tweet they should not give legitimacy to Sisi because he had “usurped” power.\nSlideshow (21 Images) Large numbers of police and soldiers deployed at polling stations a day after a bomb attack that targeted a security chief in the northern city of Alexandria.\nTIMELINE: Egyptian since Arab Spring uprisings\nMEGA PROJECTS AND AUSTERITY A lower-than-expected turnout could suggest Sisi lacks a mandate to take more of the tough steps needed to revive the economy, which struggled after the 2011 revolution drove away tourists and foreign investors, both sources of hard currency.\nReuters reporters in Cairo and other provinces saw groups of Sisi supporters waving the Egyptian flags, dancing to nationalist songs and raising the victory sign.\nOne of the few young voters at a Heliopolis polling station, Zeina Sherif, 20, said: “Sisi is working on projects that we should give him a chance to finish.”\nRelated Coverage Military man Sisi vows to safeguard Egypt's security Major events in Egypt since Arab Spring uprisings These projects include an expansion of the Suez Canal and a new capital being built east of Cairo. These will in time improve the economy and people’s lives, Sisi says.\nBut critics say austerity measures have hurt his popularity, including a currency devaluation tied to an International Monetary Fund loan which left most Egyptians worse off. Many see little benefit from large projects and the harsh fiscal reforms.\nSeveral politicians called for a boycott of the vote weeks ago after all major opposition campaigns withdrew, saying repression had cleared the field of credible challengers.\nWest of Cairo, a young woman who also declined to give her name said: “This is not a democratic exercise. We don’t have any freedom of choice, or freedom of expression.”\nSisi has said he will not seek a third term, but critics expect him to remove a two-presidential term limit.\nHe won nearly 97 percent of the vote in 2014, but less than half of eligible Egyptians voted, even though the election was extended to three days.\nReporting by Mahmoud Mourad and Ahmed Aboulenein in CAIRO, Eric Knecht in ALEXANDRIA; Ahmed Tolba, Arwa Gaballa, Samia Nakhoul, Laila Bassam, John Davison, Mohamed Abdellah, and Mostafa Hashem in CAIRO, Nadine Awadalla in ALEXANDRIA, and Amina Ismail in MINYA; Editing by William Maclean/Mark Heinrich\n ",
