FILE PHOTO: Palestinian teen Ahed Tamimi enters a military courtroom escorted by Israeli security personnel at Ofer Prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Ammar Awad/File Photo Slideshow (2 Images) Ahed Tamimi’s lawyer was not immediately available to comment. The attorney told Reuters earlier that a plea bargain over the December incident, which turned Tamimi into a hero to Palestinians, had been offered by military prosecutors.
