The Shares repurchased will be held at a subsidiary as treasury shares and will not be outstanding for accounting or voting purposes.\nIn addition, the Company’s Board of Directors extended the Company’s authorization to make additional block repurchases of up to $10 million of Shares in the aggregate, at the discretion of the Company's Executive Committee.

The Company may repurchase less than the combined $20 million of Shares indicated above.\nAbout Tiptree\nTiptree Inc.
