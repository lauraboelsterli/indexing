    "text": "NEW YORK, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northeast Business Group on Health (NEBGH), the employer-led coalition of healthcare stakeholders based in New York, today announced it has named Candice Sherman as its permanent Chief Executive Officer. Sherman has been serving as interim CEO since October 2017, when Laurel Pickering left the organization for a position at WellDoc.\n“We are delighted that Candice has agreed to lead the organization on a permanent basis,” said Michelle Martin, Chair of NEBGH’s Board of Directors. “Candice has demonstrated a strong commitment to NEBGH and its members throughout her four years as Chief Operating Officer, and in the short time since assuming the role of interim CEO, has already brought a fresh perspective and new ideas. We are confident that her leadership and passion for health care quality and innovation are the right combination to ensure NEBGH continues to serve our membership and fulfill our mission.”\nSherman joined NEBGH in 2013 as Chief Operating Officer (COO). Previously, she was COO at St. John’s Well Child and Family Center, a $23 million Federally Qualified Health Center in Los Angeles. She has an extensive business background including senior general management roles at TABB Group, Dun & Bradstreet and Thomson Financial (now Thomson Reuters), and was also COO at two Internet startups. Aside from her Los Angeles experience, she has lived in New York City for her entire career.\n“It is an incredible honor to lead NEBGH as we continue to serve employers and other health care industry stakeholders,” said Sherman. “Managing health care costs and providing innovative solutions for our members will be very high priorities this coming year and I’m looking forward to working with our organization and members in reaching our goals.”\nAbout NEBGH\nNEBGH is an employer-led coalition of healthcare leaders and other stakeholders with the mission of empowering members to drive excellence in health and achieve the highest value in healthcare delivery and the consumer experience. The organization provides employers with help in obtaining the most value out of each healthcare dollar they spend and provides guidance in managing high-cost employee conditions through multi-stakeholder projects, publications and educational programming. NEBGH makes employers’ voices heard in efforts to transform healthcare, including playing a key role in New York State’s State Innovation Model project aimed at implementing a value-based Advanced Primary Care model.\nMedia contact:\nAdria Subbiondo\nadria@nebgh.org\n(212) 252-7440 x223\nSource:Northeast Business Group on Health",
