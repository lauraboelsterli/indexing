February’s imports were the lowest for any month level since July 2017.\nStill, for the first two months of the year the world’s No.1 coal importer brought in a total of 48.71 million tonnes of the fuel, up 14 percent from a year earlier, the data showed.\nDaily coal consumption at major utilities has declined to 524,700 tonnes as of March 2 from as much as 822,000 tonnes in early February, according to data from Wind consultancy, as cold winter weather eased across the country.\n“The coal supply crunch has eased since mid-February, so the advantages of imported coal became less obvious,” said Xu Bo, analyst at Haitong Futures.\nNorthern China’s official winter heating season ends on March 15, pointing to a seasonal drop-off in demand, while Beijing has vowed to cut more steel and coal capacity as it tries to curb pollution.\n“Coal consumption may fall this year due to concerns of slowing economic growth and deepened capacity reduction targets in downstream sectors such as steel and coal-fired power,” Man Shengang, chairman at Shandong Energy Zaozhuang Mining Group Co., told Reuters on Wednesday.\nChina aims to maintain its national economic growth target at around 6.5 percent and cut more steel, coal and coal-fired power capacity in 2018.\nFor more details, click on\nReporting by Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason Editing by Kenneth Maxwell\n ",
