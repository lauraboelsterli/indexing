    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data (all times local):\n1:15 p.m.\nExperts are saying that Cambridge Analytica, the political firm under fire for inappropriately obtaining data from Facebook, isn't alone in its data-mining capability.\nRobert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media, says what makes this case more insidious is its connection with possible elections meddling, something Facebook has been under scrutiny for.\nRicci says marketers are already using similar profiling techniques to sell products and services. What's different here is the use of data to try to influence who you are voting for — or whether you are voting at all.\nCambridge Analytica, whose clients have included Donald Trump's presidential campaign, reportedly used the data of 50 million Facebook customers without permission to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.\n1 p.m.\nThe head of the European Union's parliament says the bloc will investigate Facebook over the use of its data by a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm.\nCambridge Analytica, whose clients have included Donald Trump's presidential campaign, reportedly used the data of 50 million Facebook customers without permission to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.\nAntonio Tajani tweeted on Monday: \"Allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens' privacy rights. The European Parliament will investigate fully, calling digital platforms to account.\" Tajani, who is president of the EU parliament, hasn't provided details.\nU.K. lawmakers have already called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before a parliamentary committee about this case.\n12:35 p.m.\nFacebook is having its worst trading day since 2012 as details emerge about how a data mining company working for the Trump campaign improperly obtained and kept data on tens of millions of users during the 2016 election.\nA former employee of Cambridge Analytica said Monday on NBC's \"Today\" that the group identified voters who might be swayed and \"injected content\" that may or may not be true. Late Friday, Facebook said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app described as a personality test. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn't disclosed it until now.\nFacebook shares sank $13.43 in midday trading, putting the stock on pace for its biggest one-day fall since August 2012 and dragging down the rest of the technology sector, with fears rising of increased government regulation.\nAlphabet, Google's parent company, lost almost 3 percent and Microsoft fell almost 2 percent.\n11:30 a.m.\nA former employee of a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm says it used algorithms that \"took fake news to the next level\" using data inappropriately obtained from Facebook.\nChris Wylie says the firm, Cambridge Analytica, secured personal data in order to learn about individuals and then used it to create an information cocoon to change their perceptions.\nHe says the firm used \"informational dominance\" to capture every channel of information around a person to surround them with curated information, changing their perception of what's actually happening.\nIn an interview Monday on NBC's \"Today,\" Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to \"explore mental vulnerabilities of people.\nWhile Wylie said he doesn't know to what extent Trump's campaign used the techniques, he said Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was meeting with Cambridge Analytica in 2015, before Trump even announced his run for office.",
