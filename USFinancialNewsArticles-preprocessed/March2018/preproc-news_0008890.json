    "text": "MALVERN, Pa., March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies for the treatment of orphan diseases, today announced the appointment of Nancy Hutson, Ph.D., and Linda Tufts to its board of directors. PhaseBio also announced the retirement of board members Guy Fish, M.D., and Robert Ingram.\n“We are pleased to welcome Nancy and Linda to our board of directors. Their extensive industry experience and strategic expertise will be instrumental as we advance the clinical development of our lead therapy, PB1046, in pulmonary arterial hypertension, and move additional orphan product candidates into the clinic, including PB2452, our ticagrelor reversal agent,” said Jonathan P. Mow, Chief Executive Officer of PhaseBio. “I would also like to thank Guy and Bob for their valuable contributions to PhaseBio, which have played a pivotal role in our corporate development and the progress of our pipeline.”\nDr. Hutson has more than 30 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry. She retired from Pfizer Inc. in 2006 after spending 25 years in research and leadership positions, most recently serving as Senior Vice President of Global Research & Development and Director of Pfizer’s pharmaceutical research and development site Groton / New London Laboratories. Dr. Hutson currently serves on the boards of directors for BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Endo International plc, and on the scientific advisory board of Hatteras Venture Partners. Dr. Hutson received a Ph.D. in physiology and biochemistry from Vanderbilt University and a B.A. in general biology from Illinois Wesleyan University.\n“PhaseBio is applying its elastin-like polypeptide technology platform to create novel therapeutics that treat significant unmet needs by enabling both new mechanisms and less frequent dosing,” said Dr. Hutson. “I look forward to working with PhaseBio to advance PB1046 for people suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension, while also exploring opportunities to expand the application of its exciting technology platform.”\nMs. Tufts has more than 35 years of experience working with companies across the healthcare and life sciences sectors. Currently, Ms. Tufts is General Partner at Fletcher Spaght Ventures and Fletcher Spaght, Inc. Previously, she held positions at the Sony Corporation of America and Bain & Company, Inc. Ms. Tufts serves on the boards of directors at Juventas Therapeutics, Inc., and HistoSonics, Inc. She received an S.M. in management with a concentration in finance from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Sloan School of Management, and also holds an S.B. in electrical engineering and computer science, and an S.B. in humanities and science with a concentration in physics from MIT.\n“This is an exciting time for PhaseBio, as the company prepares to advance on key clinical milestones in 2018 that will create value, particularly the initiation of a Phase 1 trial of its ticagrelor reversal agent PB2452 shortly,” said Ms. Tufts. “I am thrilled to join PhaseBio to support the rapid progression of PB2452 and PB1046 through clinical trials and to help them bring novel therapies to patients in need.”\nAbout PhaseBio\nPhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies for the treatment of orphan diseases. PhaseBio is leveraging its proprietary elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) biopolymer technology platform to develop therapies with the potential for less-frequent dosing and better patient compliance. PhaseBio’s lead development candidate, PB1046, is a first-in-class weekly vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptor agonist for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The company is also developing PB2452, a reversal agent for the antiplatelet therapy ticagrelor. PhaseBio is privately owned, with headquarters and research laboratories in Malvern, PA.
