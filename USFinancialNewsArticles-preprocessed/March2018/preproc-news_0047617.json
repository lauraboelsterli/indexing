    "text": "-- Continued strong stockholder support for the business combination deadline to be extended until June 30, 2018 --\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Easterly Acquisition Corp. (“Easterly”) (NASDAQ: EACQ) announced the vote by stockholders to extend the deadline to complete an initial business combination to June 30, 2018. Stockholders representing 95.3% of the stockholder base voted, with all of the votes cast in favor of extending the time that Easterly has to complete its initial business combination. 7,035 shares of common stock were redeemed by existing Easterly stockholders in connection with the extension, leaving approximately $153 million cash in trust after redemptions.\nEasterly obtained the extension to allow it more time to complete its previously announced business combination with JH Capital Group Holdings, LLC (“JH Capital”). JH Capital is a specialty finance business that offers end-to-end solutions to customers at every stage of the distressed credit cycle, from default to rehabilitation. Its largest segment buys defaulted consumer receivables and strategically places the accounts for collection. Additionally, JH Capital helps consumers rehabilitate their credit profile by advocating on their behalf in the settlement of third-party debt.\n“We appreciate the support of our investors and look forward to the completion of the transaction,” said Darrell Crate, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Easterly. “This transaction will give the company the capital it needs to accelerate its growth plan and to position it better for the tailwinds that continue to build in the industry.”\n“The strong market fundamentals for purchasing charged-off consumer debt that we witnessed at the end of 2017 continued to provide significant opportunities for our business in the first quarter of 2018,” said Douglas Jacobsen, JH Capital’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are excited to complete our business combination with Easterly and list our common stock on the NASDAQ exchange, providing the public markets with the ability to share in our Company’s continued growth and success.”\nEasterly and JH Capital believe the deal continues to be priced attractively to peers:\nPublic Peer Trading Levels: Price / 2018E PRA Group\n(NASDAQ: PRAA)\nEncore Capital Group\n(NASDAQ: ECPG)\nMarch 28, 2018\n21.0x\n9.6x\nEACQ $10.18 Stock Price Discount\n62%\n18% Source: JH Capital provided materials, Capital IQ.
