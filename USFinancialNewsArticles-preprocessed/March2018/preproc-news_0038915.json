    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Eastside Distilling, Inc. (NASDAQ: EAST) , makers of award-winning craft spirits, announced today that Tom Wood has been appointed Vice President of Production effective immediately. Wood will work with Master distiller and EVP, Mel Heim, and oversee all manufacturing and production operations of the Company. Wood has been acting as a consultant in establishing Eastside’s new wine and RTD canning capabilities, and has taken the leadership role in managing the Company's current wine canning services for its winery customers. As Eastside grows its sales of Burnside Bourbon products, Redneck Riviera Whiskey and other craft spirits, Wood’s expertise will be increasingly valuable.\nWood has over 25 years of executive and management experience in high volume production, manufacturing management and corporate team development for companies, including Copa di Vino, Intel Corp., Georgia-Pacific Corp. and Trellis Earth Bioplastics. At Intel, Wood led a team of over 1,000 process engineers and technicians at the Beaverton semiconductor fabrication facility, and was responsible for maintaining the highest possible production standards. As head of production at Copa di Vino winery, Wood operated the winery, the leading U.S. producer of single serve wine in cups, launching 16 new consumer products and expanding Copa di Vino’s distribution from 18 states to 48 states and 22 countries.\nGrover Wickersham, chairman and CEO of Eastside Distilling, said, “At Copa di Vino, Tom successfully increased single service wine production from single digit millions to over $20 million in sales. He did so while significantly improving efficiencies, reducing overhead by roughly one-third and dramatically reducing product quality issues. He gives us a huge competitive advantage in single serve wine canning locally in the Pacific Northwest wine region. We’re delighted to have Tom Wood join the Eastside team at this critical moment, where our ability to deliver higher volumes seamlessly to our customers, whatever their demands, is the key to our future success in creating shareholder value. Tom’s being here will also help free up more creative time for our key blenders and distillers, Mel Heim and Travis Schoney.”\nWickersham added, “Prospective customers for our new canning business should call Pat Roth at (317) 809-3990 for further information on our wine and RTD Services.”\nAbout Eastside Distilling\nEastside Distilling, Inc.
