There are mass liquidation sales already happening at 182 locations going on for stores set to close by mid-April.\nThe sales delay comes just after founder of Toys ‘R’ Us Charles Lazarus died. The company confirmed the news Thursday.\n“There have been many sad moments for Toys”R”Us in recent weeks, and none more heartbreaking than today’s news about the passing of our beloved founder, Charles Lazarus.
