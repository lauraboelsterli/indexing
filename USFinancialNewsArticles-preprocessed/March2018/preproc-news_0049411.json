[NYSE:PVH] reported 2017 fourth quarter and full year results and announced 2018 outlook.\nNon-GAAP Amounts:\nAmounts stated to be on a non-GAAP basis exclude the items that are described below under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions.” Amounts stated on a constant currency basis are also deemed to be on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of amounts on a GAAP basis to amounts on a non-GAAP basis are presented later in this release and identify and quantify all excluded items.\nCEO Comments:\nCommenting on these results, Emanuel Chirico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, noted, “We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, which exceeded our expectations. These results are ahead of our long-term targets, driven largely by strong momentum in our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses.”\nMr. Chirico continued, “Our 2017 results demonstrate our strong execution and commitment to our long-term vision. We continued to make investments that centered around areas most impacted by the changing dynamics in the industry - the growing prominence of digital, the importance of having a nimble and responsive supply chain and our ever-present commitment to driving consumer engagement. We encouraged our associates to be forward-thinking, with a focus on adapting to the evolving consumer environment, enhancing our brands and their competitive positioning across product lines and geographies, and better aligning our business to make it easier to initiate and effect change.”\nMr. Chirico concluded, “We believe that the incredible brand power behind CALVIN KLEIN and TOMMY HILFIGER positions us well in the marketplace against our competition and will drive continued momentum, as reflected in our 2018 outlook. While we, like many other global consumer companies, will continue to face geopolitical headwinds, the power of our brands, our businesses and, most importantly, our people should drive our company forward.”\nU.S. Tax Legislation:\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Legislation”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Legislation is comprehensive and significantly revises the U.S. tax code. The revisions expected to significantly impact the Company are (i) the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, including the resulting remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities and the recognition of a valuation allowance on the Company’s foreign tax credits, (ii) the imposition of a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated and (iii) the implementation of a modified territorial tax system.\nThe Tax Legislation resulted in a one-time net tax benefit of $53 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consisting of a $265 million benefit primarily from the remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $38 million valuation allowance on the Company’s foreign tax credits and a $174 million transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated. The Company’s effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for 2017 reflects provisional estimates for the Tax Legislation. These estimates are subject to adjustment in 2018 under the measurement period allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as regulatory guidance needs to be issued in regard to the Tax Legislation and as the Company completes its final analysis of the impacts of the Tax Legislation. The Company’s effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis excludes this one-time net tax benefit.\nThe Company estimates that the 2018 effective tax rate will be in a range of 14.5% to 15.5%. This projection includes the Company’s provisional estimates of the impact of the Tax Legislation in 2018 and is subject to adjustment, including as a result of changes in the provisional amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 during the measurement period.\nFourth Quarter Business Review:\nThe Company’s calculations of the comparable store sales percentages throughout this release are based on comparable weeks and, therefore, exclude the 53rd week in 2017.\nCalvin Klein\nRevenue in the Calvin Klein business for the quarter increased 23% to $977 million (increased 18% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period. Calvin Klein International revenue increased 33% to $512 million (increased 23% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period, driven by outstanding performance in Europe and Asia, including a 4% increase in international comparable store sales. The benefit of a 53rd week in 2017 was largely offset by a revenue reduction due to the timing of the Chinese New Year, as the fourth quarter of 2016 included the peak Chinese New Year selling season, while the fourth quarter of 2017 did not. Calvin Klein North America revenue increased 13% (also on a constant currency basis) to $464 million compared to the prior year period as a result of strong wholesale performance across all categories and a 4% increase in North America comparable store sales. The benefit of a 53rd week in 2017 was offset by a revenue reduction resulting from the November 2016 deconsolidation of the Company’s Calvin Klein business in Mexico (the “Mexico deconsolidation”).\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a GAAP basis for the quarter increased to $79 million from $69 million in the prior year period. Included in earnings before interest and taxes for the prior year period was a $7 million noncash loss recorded in connection with the Mexico deconsolidation. Earnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis discussed below excludes this loss.\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a GAAP basis for the quarter increased to $79 million (there were no non-GAAP exclusions in the current year period) from $75 million on a non-GAAP basis in the prior year period. The earnings increase was principally attributable to the strong revenue increase noted above, partially offset by an approximately $15 million increase in marketing expenditures over the prior year period.\nTommy Hilfiger\nRevenue in the Tommy Hilfiger business for the quarter increased 22% to $1.1 billion (increased 15% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period. Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increased 37% to $702 million (increased 24% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period, driven by exceptional performance across all regions and channels, as well as the benefit of a 53rd week in 2017. Tommy Hilfiger International comparable store sales increased 6%. Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue increased 5% to $439 million (increased 4% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period. The increase in revenue was principally attributable to a 10% increase in comparable store sales offset, in part, by a reduction in wholesale off-price distribution. The benefit of a 53rd week in 2017 offset the revenue reduction resulting from the discontinuation of the Company’s directly operated womenswear wholesale business in the U.S. and Canada during the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with the licensing of this business to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (the “G-III license”).\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a GAAP basis for the quarter decreased to $47 million from $66 million in the prior year period. Included in earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were costs of (i) $83 million incurred in connection with an amendment to Mr. Tommy Hilfiger’s employment agreement pursuant to which the Company made a cash buyout of a portion of future payments to Mr. Hilfiger (the “Mr. Hilfiger amendment”) and (ii) $7 million incurred related to the April 2016 acquisition of the 55% interest in the Company’s former Tommy Hilfiger joint venture in China (“TH China”) that it did not already own (the “TH China acquisition”), primarily consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets. Included in earnings before interest and taxes for the prior year period were costs of (i) $15 million incurred related to the TH China acquisition, primarily consisting of noncash valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets, and (ii) $11 million incurred in connection with the early termination of the previous license agreement for the Tommy Hilfiger men’s tailored clothing business in North America (the “TH men’s tailored license termination”). Earnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis discussed below excludes these amounts.\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter increased to $137 million from $92 million in the prior year period. The earnings increase was principally due to the strong revenue increase noted above, as well as gross margin improvements, particularly in North America.\nHeritage Brands\nRevenue in the Heritage Brands business for the quarter was flat compared to the prior year period. Comparable store sales increased 1%.\nEarnings before interest and taxes for the quarter decreased to $8 million from $13 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by an increase in marketing expenditures as compared to the prior year period.\nFourth Quarter Consolidated Results:\nEarnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.39 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.26 in the prior year period. These results include the amounts described under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions” later in this release. Earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for these periods, as discussed below, exclude these amounts.\nEarnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $1.58 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.23 in the prior year period. Earnings per share on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $0.04 positive impact related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nFourth quarter revenue increased 19% to $2.5 billion (increased 13% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period.\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a GAAP basis for the quarter decreased to $58 million from $154 million in the prior year period. Included in earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were $119 million of net costs consisting of (i) $83 million incurred in connection with the Mr. Hilfiger amendment, (ii) $28 million incurred in connection with the Company’s redemption and issuance of senior notes, including $24 million related to the early redemption of the Company’s $700 million 4 1/2% senior notes and $4 million related to the Company’s issuance of €600 million 3 1/8% senior notes, (iii) $7 million incurred related to the TH China acquisition, (iv) a $3 million actuarial loss recognized on retirement plans and (v) a $2 million net gain recorded in connection with the consolidation within the Company’s warehouse and distribution network in North America, which included the impact of the sale of a warehouse and distribution center. Included in earnings before interest and taxes for the prior year period was a $6 million net gain consisting of (i) a $39 million actuarial gain recognized on retirement plans, (ii) $15 million of costs incurred related to the TH China acquisition, (iii) $11 million of costs incurred in connection with the TH men’s tailored license termination and (iv) a $7 million noncash loss recorded in connection with the Mexico deconsolidation. Earnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis discussed below excludes these amounts.\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter was $177 million compared to $147 million in the prior year period. The improvement in earnings was driven by growth in the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses. Partially offsetting these increases were an earnings decrease in the Heritage Brands business primarily attributable to an increase in marketing expenditures, an approximately $15 million increase in marketing expenditures in the Calvin Klein business and a $14 million increase in corporate expenses due, in part, to investments in digital and sourcing initiatives, including start-up costs associated with the Company’s joint venture manufacturing facility.\nNet interest expense increased to $33 million from $29 million in the prior year period, primarily attributable to increases in short-term borrowings and interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the net impact of the €600 million 3 1/8% senior notes issued in December 2017 and the $700 million 4 1/2% senior notes redeemed in January 2018. The effective tax rate on a GAAP basis was (329.9)% as compared to 19.6% in the prior year period, as the fourth quarter of 2017 included a one-time net tax benefit recorded in connection with the Tax Legislation. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 14.4% as compared to 17.8% in the prior year period, which includes a favorable impact from the mix of earnings between tax jurisdictions in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the prior year period.\nFull Year 2017 Consolidated Results:\nEarnings per share on a GAAP basis was $6.84 for 2017 compared to $6.79 in the prior year. These results include the items described under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions” later in this release. Earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for these periods, as discussed below, exclude these items.\nEarnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $7.94 for 2017 compared to $6.80 in the prior year. Earnings per share on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for 2017 included a $0.15 negative impact related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nRevenue for 2017 increased 9% to $8.9 billion (increased 7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The revenue increase was due to:\nA 10% increase (9% increase on a constant currency basis) in the Calvin Klein business compared to the prior year, driven by continued strength in Europe and China. International comparable store sales increased 6%. North America comparable store sales decreased 1%. An 11% increase (9% increase on a constant currency basis) in the Tommy Hilfiger business compared to the prior year, driven principally by outstanding performance across Europe and Asia, as well as the inclusion of a full first quarter of revenue from the China business as a result of the TH China acquisition in April 2016. Tommy Hilfiger International comparable store sales increased 8%. North America comparable store sales increased 3%.\nRevenue in the Heritage Brands business was flat compared to the prior year. Comparable store sales increased 2%.\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a GAAP basis for 2017 decreased to $632 million, inclusive of a $15 million negative impact due to foreign currency exchange rates, from $789 million in the prior year. These results include the amounts described under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions” later in this release. Earnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis for these periods, as discussed below, exclude those amounts.\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis for 2017 was $864 million, inclusive of a $15 million negative impact due to foreign currency exchange rates, compared to $794 million in the prior year. The improvement in earnings was driven by strong earnings growth in the Tommy Hilfiger business and a slight improvement in earnings in the Heritage Brands business. Partially offsetting these increases were a decrease in earnings in the Calvin Klein business due to the planned increase in marketing expenditures and investments associated with the CALVIN KLEIN creative team leadership changes and a $29 million increase in corporate expenses due, in part, to investments in digital and sourcing initiatives, including start-up costs associated with the Company’s joint venture manufacturing facility.\nNet interest expense for 2017 increased to $122 million from $115 million in the prior year primarily due to the net impact of the issuance of €350 million of senior notes in June 2016 and increases in short-term borrowings and interest rates as compared to the prior year, partially offset by long-term debt repayments made during 2016 and 2017. The effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for 2017 was (5.1)% as compared to 18.6% in the prior year, as the current year included a one-time net tax benefit recorded in connection with the Tax Legislation. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis for 2017 was 16.0% as compared to 19.0% in the prior year, which includes a favorable impact from the mix of earnings between tax jurisdictions in the current year as compared to the prior year.\nInventory levels increased 21% as compared to 2016 due to a shift in the timing of inventory receipts into 2017 as a result of the 53rd week and an expected increase in first quarter of 2018 sales as compared to the prior year period.\nStock Repurchase Program:\nDuring 2017, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock for $250 million (6.8 million shares for $692 million since inception) under the $1.250 billion stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors through June 3, 2020. Stock repurchases under the program may be made from time to time over the period through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, as the Company deems appropriate. Purchases are made based on a variety of factors, such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions, applicable legal requirements and limitations, restrictions under the Company’s debt arrangements, trading restrictions under the Company’s insider trading policy and other relevant factors. The program may be modified by the Board, including to increase or decrease the repurchase limitation or extend, suspend, or terminate the program, at any time, without prior notice.\n2018 Outlook:\nPlease see the section entitled “Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts” at the end of this release for further detail and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts discussed in this section.\nFull Year Guidance\nThe Company projects that 2018 earnings per share on a GAAP basis will be in a range of $8.76 to $8.86 compared to $6.84 in 2017.

Discrete tax benefit of $15 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. Pre-tax noncash gain of $153 million recorded in the first quarter of 2016 to write-up the Company’s equity investment in TH China to fair value in connection with the TH China acquisition, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016.

Estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items, which are based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it had identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item is taxable or tax deductible, and if so, in what jurisdiction the tax expense or tax deduction would occur. All items above were identified as either primarily taxable or tax deductible, with the tax effect taken at the statutory income tax rate of the local jurisdiction, or as non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect.\nAs a supplement to the Company’s GAAP results, the Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company presents results in this manner because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies but reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported revenues. The Company believes presenting constant currency revenue information provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance.\nThe Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the current year period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period).\nConstant currency performance should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The constant currency revenue information presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies.\nPlease see Tables 1 through 9 and the sections entitled “Reconciliations of 2017 Constant Currency Revenue” and “Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts” later in this release for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts.\nThe Company webcasts its conference calls to review its earnings releases.

The Company excludes such amounts that it deems non-recurring or non-operational and believes that this (i) facilitates comparing current results against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding the items described above are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nPVH CORP.\nNon-GAAP Measures (continued)\nThe following table presents the non-GAAP measures that are discussed in this release.

PVH CORP.\nReconciliations of 2017 Constant Currency Revenue\n(In millions)\nAs a supplement to the Company’s reported operating results, the Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company presents results in this manner because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies but reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported revenues. The Company believes presenting constant currency revenue information provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance.\nThe Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the current year period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period).\nConstant currency performance should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The constant currency revenue information presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies.\nGAAP Revenue % Change Quarter Ended GAAP Positive Impact of\nForeign Exchange\nConstant\nCurrency\n2/4/18 1/29/17 Calvin Klein North America $ 464.5 $ 409.4 13.4 % 0.6 % 12.8 % Calvin Klein International 512.2 385.5 32.9 % 9.9 % 23.0 % Total Calvin Klein 976.7 794.9 22.9 % 5.2 % 17.7 % Tommy Hilfiger North America $ 439.2 $ 419.1 4.8 % 0.8 % 4.0 % Tommy Hilfiger International 701.6 512.5 36.9 % 13.0 % 23.9 % Total Tommy Hilfiger 1,140.8 931.6 22.4 % 7.5 % 14.9 % Total Revenue $ 2,498.9 $ 2,107.7 18.6 % 5.3 % 13.3 % GAAP Revenue % Change Year Ended GAAP Positive Impact of\nForeign Exchange\nConstant\nCurrency\n2/4/18 1/29/17 Total Calvin Klein $ 3,461.6 $ 3,135.2 10.4 % 1.6 % 8.8 % Total Tommy Hilfiger $ 3,893.2 $ 3,510.8 10.9 % 2.1 % 8.8 % Total Revenue $ 8,914.8 $ 8,203.1 8.7 % 1.5 % 7.2 % PVH CORP.\nFull Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts\nThe Company is presenting its 2018 estimated results excluding the costs to be incurred related to the TH China acquisition, consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets and the resulting estimated tax effect. The 2018 estimated results are presented on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The Company believes presenting these results on a non-GAAP basis provides useful additional information to investors. The Company excludes such amounts that it deems non-recurring or non-operational and believes that this (i) facilitates comparing current results against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company, and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company has provided the reconciliations set forth below to present its estimates on a GAAP basis and excluding these amounts. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The estimated tax effect associated with the above pre-tax item is based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated the item identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item is taxable or tax deductible, and if so, in what jurisdiction the tax expense or tax deduction would occur. The item is identified as tax deductible, with the tax effect taken at the statutory income tax rate of the local jurisdiction.\n2018 Net Income Per Common Share Reconciliations\nCurrent Guidance Full Year\n2018\n(Estimated) First Quarter\n2018\n(Estimated) GAAP net income per common share attributable to PVH Corp. $8.76 - $8.86 $2.13 - $2.18 Estimated per common share impact of item identified as a non-GAAP exclusion $(0.24) $(0.07) Net income per common share attributable to PVH Corp. on a non-GAAP basis $9.00 - $9.10 $2.20 - $2.25 The GAAP net income per common share attributable to PVH Corp. amounts presented in the above table, as well as the amounts excluded in providing non-GAAP earnings guidance, would be expected to change as a result of (i) acquisition, restructuring, divestment or similar transactions or activities, (ii) the timing and strategy of restructuring and integration initiatives or other one-time events, if any, that the Company engages in or suffers during the period, (iii) any market or other changes affecting the Company’s expected actuarial gain or loss on retirement plans, (iv) the imposition of significant tariffs on apparel, footwear and accessories imported from China or any of the Company’s other significant sourcing countries, (v) adjustments to the Company’s income tax provision related to the Tax Legislation, including as a result of changes in the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 during the measurement period allowed by the SEC, as regulatory guidance needs to be issued related to the Tax Legislation and as the Company completes its final analysis of the impacts of the Tax Legislation, or (vi) any discrete tax events including changes in tax rates or tax law and events arising from audits or the resolution of uncertain tax positions.
