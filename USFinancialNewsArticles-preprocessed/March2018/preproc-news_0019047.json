The Wall Street bank is not looking beyond its two co-presidents, Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon, to replace Blankfein, the report said. on.wsj.com/2GapHsu The timing of any moves could still change, and Blankfein is firmly in control of his exit, the Journal said. Blankfein, 63, will retire ahead of or early in Goldman’s 150th anniversary year in 2019, the report added. Blankfein was named Goldman’s CEO in June 2006 after Henry “Hank” Paulson quit to become U.S. Treasury Secretary. Goldman’s shares were up 1.5 percent on Friday morning.
