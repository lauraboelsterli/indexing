Volunteers, having surrendered their phones, will conduct the count in strict secrecy. An announcement is expected at 9 am local time on Sunday.\nGermany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, has faced months of uncertainty after voters returned a fragmented parliament. An earlier attempt to form a Merkel-led three-way coalition collapsed.\nAt the urging of President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the SPD’s then leader Martin Schulz promised members the final say on whether to repeat a“grand coalition” with Merkel’s conservatives after first announcing he would lead the party into opposition.\nRejection of another tie-up with the conservatives“would be a disaster for Germany, the SPD and, above all, for Europe,” SPD lawmaker Thomas Oppermann told Die Welt newspaper, forecasting that 55 percent of members would back a coalition.\nMerkel has seen several junior coalition partners come and go over 12 years in office, and many fear the SPD could dwindle into irrelevance if it props up her government for another four years.\nThe SPD’s Jusos youth wing has been lobbying party members to vote against a re-run of the grand coalition, arguing they would do better to rebuild in opposition after the party’s drubbing in the September election.\nA“No” vote would throw the ball back into Steinmeier’s court, who could push the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), whose leader Christian Lindner torpedoed the earlier three-way talks, to have another go.\nBut Lindner told the Funke newspaper group, a new election would be the best solution if SPD members voted‘No’.\nOn another option, a Merkel-led minority government, he said the FDP would examine legislative proposals on a case-by-case basis, but added:“Such a government would probably only last a few months anyway.”\nManfred Weber, deputy leader of the Bavarian CSU, sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), also favoured a new election in the event of an SPD“No” vote, arguing a minority government would impair Germany’s standing in Europe.\n“Germany would remove itself as a serious factor in Europe and the world,” he said.
