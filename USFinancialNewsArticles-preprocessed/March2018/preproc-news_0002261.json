People run away from a site where an unidentified man was wounded in shooting near the White House, in Washington, U.S., March 3, 2018 in this still image obtained from social media. Courtesy of TWITTER/ @FLORIANLUHN /via REUTERS Authorities were withholding the manâ€™s name until relatives were notified. The Secret Service said the man approached the White House fence along Pennsylvania Avenue shortly before noon EST, pulled out a handgun and fired several shots. None of the shots appeared to have been directed at the White House. Slideshow (3 Images) President Donald Trump was in Florida at the time and was briefed on the incident, a White House spokesman said. There were no other injuries, police said. Pedestrian and vehicle traffic around the White House were blocked off by police, which is routine in such incidents. The Washington Metropolitan Police Department will lead the investigation of the shooting, the Secret Service said in the statement. Reporting by Mike Stone; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Bill Trott",
