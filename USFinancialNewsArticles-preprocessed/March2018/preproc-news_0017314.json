    "text": "March 7 (Reuters) - Travis Kalanick, the former Uber chief executive, announced on Wednesday in a Twitter post that he is going to start an investment fund called 10100.\nThe overarching theme of the new fund, pronounced \"ten-one-hundred\", will be to invest in real estate, ecommerce and emerging innovation in China and India, Kalanick said in a tweet.\nThe fund will oversee for-profit investments as well as non-profit work and focus on education and future of cities, Kalanick said. ( http://bit.ly/2Fqtq3M )\nTwitter was abuzz with speculation behind the meaning of the new fund's name.\nOne user suggested that it could be a reference \"Googol\" or \"10 to the power 100.\"\nKalanick was not immediately available to respond to additional queries regarding his new venture.\nKalanick, co-founder the San Francisco-based ride hailing startup Uber, resigned in June under pressure from investors after a string of setbacks.
