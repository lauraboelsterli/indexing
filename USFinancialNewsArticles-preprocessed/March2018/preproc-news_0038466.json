    "text": "When Dan Schulman talks about leadership, he says the person who made the most difference in his life was his father, who he describes as a “wise soul, a gentle person” and “my hero.”\nNow, as the CEO of PayPal, the huge payment processor that ranks as one of the largest companies on the Fortune 500 , Schulman says there’s one piece of advice from his father that “really stuck with me.”\n“He always said to me, ‘son, you are what you do, not what you say,’ ” he explains. “That’s what defines you as a person.”\nBefore PayPal, Schulman held executive positions at AT&T , American Express , and Priceline. He also launched Virgin Mobile with Virgin Group CEO Richard Branson, who he says had a big influence on his leadership style and philosophy of leading.\n“He basically said there’s no way that a company can be an enduring company if they’re not fundamentally a customer champion. So I really adopted that into my whole philosophy and way of thinking,” Schulman says about Branson. “And the second thing he said, companies need to be a force for good.”\nWatch the video above for more from our conversation with Schulman.",
