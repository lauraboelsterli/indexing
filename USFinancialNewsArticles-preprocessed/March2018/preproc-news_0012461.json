    "text": "YORK, Pa., March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The York Water Company’s (NASDAQ:YORW) President, Jeffrey R. Hines, announced today the Company’s 2017 earnings.\nPresident Hines reported that annual operating revenues for 2017 increased $1,005,000, and that net income increased $1,128,000 when compared to 2016. Higher operating revenues were primarily due to utilization of the Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC). DSIC is a Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission allowed charge that water utilities collect from customers for the replacement of aging infrastructure. Net income increased primarily due to lower income taxes from a higher volume of asset improvements eligible for the tax deduction under the IRS tangible property regulations and an increased allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). AFUDC is the cost of debt and equity funds used to finance plant construction. The increased income was partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation. Basic and Diluted Earnings per share for 2017 were $0.09 higher than 2016 and dividends per share rose by $0.0205 compared to 2016.\nDuring the year, the Company invested $24.6 million in capital projects for an additional untreated water pumping station and force main, as well as various replacements and improvements to infrastructure including company-owned lead service lines. During 2017, the Company replaced or relined approximately 42,500 feet of pipe to improve its distribution system, reduce ongoing expenses, and improve customer service.\nPresident Hines also reported that operating revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $468,000 and that net income increased by $585,000 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in fourth quarter net income also resulted from higher revenue from the utilization of the DSIC, lower income taxes due to a higher volume of asset improvements eligible for a tax deduction and increased AFUDC. Basic and Diluted Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.04 higher than the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPresident Hines reported that York Water plans to invest approximately $22.6 million in 2018 and $19.8 million in 2019 for spillway improvements and the armoring of one of the dams, replacing a water storage tank, expansion of a wastewater treatment plant, system expansion, and improvements to its pipes, service lines, and other facilities to ensure a safe, adequate, and reliable supply of drinking water and to maintain proper handling and disposal of wastewater for the Company’s growing customer base.\nPeriod Ended December 31 In 000's (except share and per share) Quarter Twelve Months 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating Revenues $ 12,353 $ 11,885 $ 48,589 $ 47,584 Net Income $ 3,527 $ 2,942 $ 12,974 $ 11,846 Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding 12,860 12,863 12,849 12,846 Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.27 $ 0.23 $ 1.01 $ 0.92 Dividends Declared Per Common Share $ 0.1666 $ 0.1602 $ 0.6472 $ 0.6267 This news release may contain forward-looking statements regarding the Company’s operational and financial expectations.
