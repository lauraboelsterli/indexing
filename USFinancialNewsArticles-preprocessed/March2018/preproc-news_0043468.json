The monitoring and information system in CVO helps a driver find safe routes and track the total travel time, as well as enables the owner to monitor the vehicle. CVO includes operations associated with moving freight and passengers in commercial vehicle and activities necessary to regulate these operations, as well as activities related to safety assurance, commercial vehicle credentials, and tax administration. The increasing demand for the expansion of transportation networks and growth in the logistics sector are key reasons for the growing demand for commercial vehicle operation systems.\nHardware offering is expected to lead the overall ITS market in roadways\nHardware offering includes interface boards, sensors, surveillance camera, telecommunication network, monitoring and detection systems, and other hardware components such as linked traffic controller and variable message sign. The large market size for hardware is owing to the implementation of numerous heterogeneous devices, including cameras, sensors, intelligent traffic management systems, and advanced traveler information systems across the ITS infrastructure of any region. In addition, these high-end systems are synchronized to respond in real time; hence, these are likely to need frequent software updates, thereby increasing the operational cost.\nAsk for PDF Brochure @ https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownload.asp?id=764\nNorth America held the largest share of the intelligent transportation system market in 2017\nThe highest market size in North America is attributed to the adoption of ITS to counter traffic congestion and boost safety on roads is propelling the growth of the ITS market in this region. Government funding and support toward the implementation of ITS in North America is another major driver for this market.\nSome of the key companies operating in the ITS market are Thales (France), Siemens (Germany), Garmin (Switzerland), Kapsch TrafficCom (Austria), TomTom (Netherlands), Cubic (US), Q-Free (Norway), EFKON (Austria), FLIR Systems (US), Denso (Japan), and so on.\nKnow more about the Intelligent Transportation System Market :\nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/intelligent-transport-systems-its-market-764.html\nAbout MarketsandMarkets™\nMarketsandMarkets™ provides quantified B2B research on 30,000 high growth niche opportunities/threats which will impact 70% to 80% of worldwide companies' revenues.
