    "text": "4 Hours Ago | 01:15 \nJob creation saw another powerful month in February, with companies adding 235,000 positions, ADP and Moody's Analytics reported Wednesday. \nThe total again defied Wall Street expectations, as economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting payrolls to grow by 195,000. Growth actually decelerated slightly, as January posted an upwardly revised 244,000 from the initially reported 234,000. \nFebruary marked the fourth month in a row that private payrolls hit 200,000 or better. \n\"The job market is red hot and threatens to overheat,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, said in a statement. \"With government spending increases and tax cuts, growth is set to accelerate.\" \nFebruary saw broad-based gains that stretched across both the services and goods-producing sectors. \nLeisure and hospitality led industry groups with 50,000 jobs, while professional and business services contributed 46,000 and trade, transportation and utilities added 44,000. \nHowever, construction rose 21,000 and manufacturing notched 14,000 new positions. In all, goods-producing industries increased by 37,000 while all services-related businesses added 198,000. \nIn terms of business size, the gains again were spread: Medium-sized firms (50-499 employees) led with 97,000. Large businesses and small firms contributed 70,000 and 68,000 respectively. \nThe gains come amid concerns that a tight jobs market could put upward pressure on wages and generate an inflation spike that would force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than the market anticipates. \nHowever, monthly jobs reports continue to defy expectations that payroll growth is bound to slow as the unemployment rate, currently at 4.1 percent, nears the level that economists generally consider full employment. \nDallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told CNBC on Tuesday that the central bank will need to hike three times this year to keep the economic expansion going. \nThe Moody's/ADP report precedes the more closely watched Labor Department nonfarm payrolls count, which comes Friday. The numbers often differ considerably. \nLast month's government count showed that average hourly earnings rose at the fastest pace in more than eight years, fueling more inflation concerns and sending the stock market briefly into a correction. Economists are looking for Friday's report to show growth of about 200,000 new jobs. ",
