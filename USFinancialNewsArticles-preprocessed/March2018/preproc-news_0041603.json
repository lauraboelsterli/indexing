Monterrey-based Cemex, which is trying to regain its investment grade credit rating, said it will cap its share issuance proposal to a maximum of 1 percent of outstanding shares. Earlier in March, Cemex said that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) was investigating its operations in Colombia and in other jurisdictions. (Reporting by Christine Murray)",
