Cricket   First Test Match - Kingsmead Stadium, Durban,   5, 2018. Australia's David Warner and Steve Smith leave the pitch after beating South Africa. REUTERS/Rogan Ward \nCameron Bancroft, who was caught on camera scuffing up the ball with improvised sandpaper, was banned for nine months following the scandal, which has outraged the fans, jolted the sponsors and prompted CA to send the trio home from South Africa. \n“David Warner will not be considered for team leadership positions in the future,” CA said in the statement.
