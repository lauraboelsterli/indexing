    "text": "Shares of several Apple suppliers traded sharply lower in Asia Monday morning trade following a report from Bloomberg that the tech giant was making screens of its own.\nThe iPhone maker is producing limited quantities of screens \"for testing purposes\" at a facility located close to its headquarters in California, according to the Bloomberg report , which cited several anonymous sources.\nApple is reportedly investing in developing \"next-generation MicroLED screens\" that aim to make devices slimmer and less of a drain on power, Bloomberg said. The report added that MicroLED displays were harder to make than organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screens.\nA spokeswoman at Apple declined to comment when contacted by CNBC.\nApple makes use of a network of suppliers that includes Samsung Electronics , which produces OLED panels for the iPhone X. Samsung shares were down 0.51 percent as of Asia morning trade, having pared some losses after falling more than 1 percent earlier.\nLG Display, which is reportedly expected to start supplying displays to Apple, was lower by 0.89 percent.\nOver in Japan, shares of Sharp were down 2.57 percent. Japan Display fell 1.45 percent after earlier recording a decline of more than 3 percent.",
