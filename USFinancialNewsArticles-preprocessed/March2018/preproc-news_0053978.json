The stock has been hammered for days following the outcry over the social media company’s handling of users’ data.\nThe company now faces an investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on how it allowed data of 50 million users get into the hands of a political consultancy.\nRed Hat shares were up 6.2 percent after the software developer reported better-than-expected quarterly results on strong demand for its hybrid cloud products.\nKinder Morgan shares were up 1.2 percent after Citigroup upgraded the stock to “buy”.\nInvestors are also awaiting consumer confidence data, expected at 10 am ET. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index is likely to have edged up to 131.0 in March from 130.8 the previous month.
