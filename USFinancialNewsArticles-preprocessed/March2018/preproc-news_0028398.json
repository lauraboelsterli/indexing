FILE PHOTO: A view shows the school in Dapchi in the northeastern state of Yobe, where dozens of school girls went missing after an attack on the village by Boko Haram, Nigeria February 23, 2018. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde He made the remarks during a visit to Yobe, the northeastern state in which Dapchi is located. Some 110 girls were kidnapped from their school in the town by suspected members of Boko Haram last month, the most high-profile mass abduction since the 2014 kidnap of over 270 Chibok schoolgirls.
