    "text": "6 Hours Ago | 00:51 \nA team of Toyota engineers built a basketball-throwing robot named \"Cue\" in their free time. The robot uses AI to sink shot after shot, and after 200,000 practice throws, the robot shoots with almost perfect accuracy. \nAt 6 feet 3 inches, Cue is shorter than the average NBA player.
