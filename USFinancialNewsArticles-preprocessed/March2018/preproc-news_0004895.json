At least not yet.\nBut times change.\nGo Big or Go Home With the aid of computing power, the record for largest prime number has continually been broken. 23,249,425 digits\n10\n8\ndigits\n7\n10\n6\n10\n65,050 digits\n5\n10\n4\n10\n3\n10\n2\n10\n79 digits\n10\n1950\n’70\n’80\n’10\n’90\n’2000\n’60\nLargest known prime number in 1951:\n5,210,644,015,679,228,794,060,694,325,390,955,853,335,\n898,483,908,056,458,352,183,851,018,372,555,735,221\nFirst thousand digits of prime number\ndiscovered in 2017:\n4,673,331,833,592,310,999,883,355,855,611,155,212,513,21\n1,028,177,144,957,985,823,385,935,679,234,805,211,772,07\n4,843,110,997,402,088,496,213,680,900,380,493,172,483,\n674,425,135,191,443,652,492,202,867,874,992,249,236,39\n6,330,386,193,059,511,707,705,228,503,560,117,796,386,4\n40,509,541,282,741,095,485,197,432,735,510,143,257,532,\n499,769,938,081,916,410,407,749,906,070,270,851,317,80\n8,544,314,827,192,879,270,515,747,600,591,825,011,224,2\n64,939,011,775,241,470,201,122,113,881,802,463,571,203,8\n52,569,710,311,808,614,896,188,925,840,677,509,768,149,\n545,679,074,421,592,539,280,860,434,515,131,070,523,18\n5,728,006,225,351,733,050,439,315,450,492,769,468,962,\n852,688,696,749,443,421,129,857,922,337,323,378,017,542\n,414,218,271,741,256,702,644,166,443,533,138,904,426,72\n2,561,811,076,280,626,415,505,109,923,842,039,912,255,3\n78,570,492,258,674,504,781,998,501,869,851,883,957,199,\n630,080,387,179,659,069,436,984,462,272,457,690,484,4\n26,240,770,404,565,169,263,900,086,517,264,629,905,937\n,605,954,294,867,916,546,335,621,392,167,445,576,727,46\n4,978,844,343,535,204,565,567,970...\nSource: University of Tennessee at Martin; Mersenne Research\nIn the middle of the last century, when prime numbers with only a few hundred digits were discovered, they were also considered useless. Now, those modestly sized primes are vital for computer encryption, which ensures that sensitive information can be transmitted safely over the internet.\n“If you’re trying to buy something on Amazon, and you want to send your credit card information, they use encryption algorithms, and those encryption algorithms use primes,” said Curtis Cooper, a professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Central Missouri.\nFor encryption, two large primes are multiplied together to produce a huge non-prime number, which can be used to encode a message, explained Seth Schoen, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which rewards the discovery of certain record-setting primes.\nAnyone can see this so-called public key, but once encrypted, a message can only be decoded with the secret key—the two prime numbers.\nCracking the code might be possible, but it would be too time-consuming to be practical.\nPrimes are different from other numbers because they can be divided evenly only by themselves and the number 1. Two is prime. Three is prime. So are 5, 7, 11 and 13.\nBecause primes follow no known pattern, they’re impossible to predict. Each candidate must be tested. The simplest test involves methodically checking to see whether a potential prime can be evenly divided by smaller numbers, an approach that is impossible for gargantuan figures like the one Mr. Pace discovered.\n“There’s not enough computer power to do it,” said George Woltman, who wrote the software Mr. Pace used to discover his prime. “You can test maybe 100 digits by trial division but to look for a really big prime number, you have to have a special form.”\nThe number Mr. Pace discovered, 2 77,232,917 minus 1 is a Mersenne prime, a number that is two to a prime power minus one.\nSome previous columns\nThe Math Behind Flu Season Measuring Success, One-Thousandth of a Second at a Time You May Now Kiss the Algorithm One Way to Get Your Child to Listen Although Mersenne primes may be huge, they can be verified easily using an algorithm called the Lucas-Lehmer test, which involves dividing a series of numbers by the potential prime. If the final quotient has a remainder of zero, the number is prime.\nIn 1994, Mr. Woltman, a computer scientist with a lifelong fascination with prime numbers, and his then-business partner sold the software company they had cofounded eight years earlier for more than $35 million.\nWith time on his hands and no need of a paycheck, Mr. Woltman started the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search—GIMPS for short—to hunt for the world’s largest prime numbers.\nMr. Woltman provides the software he has written to test for Mersenne primes free of charge to anyone who would like to participate. He estimates the project now has around 5,000 volunteers, including Mr. Pace, who has been looking for primes since 2003, and Dr. Cooper, who has been searching for more than two decades.\nRelated Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box. Mersenne primes, which are named for the French monk who studied them more than 350 years ago, are extremely rare. Mr. Pace’s number was only the 50th Mersenne prime to be discovered. Dr. Cooper, who uses more than 700 computers to conduct his searches, discovered the 43rd, 44th, 48th and 49th.\nBecause colossal primes are essentially useless, the hunt for record-breakers is mostly about the thrill of discovery—but there are also some cash incentives.\nGIMPS offers $3,000 for the discovery of each new Mersenne prime .\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation gave away $50,000 in 2000 for the discovery of a prime with more than 1 million digits and $100,000 in 2009 for the discovery of one with more than 10 million digits.\nBoth winners were GIMPS volunteers, and the group now has its sights set on the foundation’s remaining awards: $150,000 for the discovery of a prime with at least 100 million digits and $250,000 for one with at least 1 billion digits.\nAlthough prime numbers are a convenient device, the goal of the foundation’s awards, which were funded by an anonymous donor, is grander than a high-tech treasure hunt.\n“The donor wanted to encourage people to cooperate on significant computational problems,” said Landon Curt Noll, a computer scientist who has bagged three primes.\nBy that measure, GIMPS, a model of distributed computing where participants work on a common goal, has been wildly successful: Its volunteers have found the last 16 record-setting primes.\nFor now, the giant numbers aren’t needed. But that doesn’t mean they never will be.​\nWrite to Jo Craven McGinty at Jo.McGinty@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nPrime numbers with only a few hundred digits were first discovered in 1952.
