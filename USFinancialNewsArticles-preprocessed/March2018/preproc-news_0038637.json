(Nasdaq:ELGX), a developer and marketer of innovative treatments for aortic disorders, today announced the first results from ENCORE, a pooled, global analysis of several prospective clinical trials and registries studying polymer endovascular aneurysm repair (Polymer EVAR) using Ovation® Abdominal Stent Graft Systems.\nENCORE is a pooled, retrospective analysis of six prospectively enrolled clinical trials and registries of Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft Systems encompassing 1,296 patients, 160 centers and 339 investigators in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. This contemporary analysis standardizes outcome variables across each study. The data is a mix of real world registry and controlled data, and all endpoints are presented using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates.\nMedian follow up across all studies was 883 days (range 30 days – 5 years). At five years, the ENCORE analysis included the following results for Ovation based on the available data:\n99.1% freedom from AAA-related mortality 99.0% freedom from reintervention for Type 1a endoleak 99.7% freedom from rupture 99.2% freedom from conversion 96.4% freedom from all device-related reintervention\n“With ENCORE, our objective was to conduct a rigorous, global evaluation of the available Polymer EVAR clinical data, which includes nearly 1,300 patients, and to share the consolidated results with physicians worldwide,” said Matt Thompson, M.D., Chief Medical Officer for Endologix. “We look forward to sharing additional analyses from the ENCORE data set in the future, and we’d like to thank all of the clinical investigators who participated in the underlying studies that are the basis for the ENCORE analysis.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, March 20, 2018 to discuss the information contained in this press release and answer questions related to the ENCORE analysis.

The Company's focus is endovascular stent grafts for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). AAA is a weakening of the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in the body, resulting in a balloon-like enlargement. Once AAA develops, it continues to enlarge and, if left untreated, becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture. The overall patient mortality rate for ruptured AAA is approximately 80%, making it a leading cause of death in the United States.
