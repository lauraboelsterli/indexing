    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Epizyme, Inc. (NASDAQ:EPZM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company creating novel epigenetic therapies, today announced the appointment of Michael Giordano, M.D., to the company’s board of directors. Dr. Giordano brings to the board more than 15 years of leadership experience in oncology drug development.\n“Michael is a highly respected oncology leader, bringing us a wealth of experience developing novel and highly successful cancer therapies,” said Robert Bazemore, president and chief executive officer of Epizyme. “He has served as a valued clinical advisor to the company over the past several months and has made significant contributions to the company. We are delighted to now welcome Michael as a board member, and we look forward to his guidance as we approach our initial New Drug Application filings for tazemetostat, prepare our next product candidate, EZM8266, for the clinic, and evolve the company into a fully integrated, commercial organization.”\nMost recently, Dr. Giordano was senior vice president and head of development, oncology and immuno-oncology for Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). In this role, he was responsible for the development strategy for this therapeutic area, as well as for the direction of eight teams working on innovative medicines to improve the standard of care for patients, including Opdivo®, Yervoy®, Empliciti™, Ixempra®, and Sprycel®. He previously held positions of increasing responsibility within the BMS research and development organization, leading the development of more than a dozen molecules in the United States, Europe and Asia. Before joining BMS, he served as assistant professor of medicine and founding director of the Cornell Clinical Trials Unit, a National Institutes of Health and Industry-supported AIDS clinical trials center at New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical Center. He earned his M.D. and completed his residency and fellowship training at New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center, and received his B.A. in natural sciences from The Johns Hopkins University.\n“In working alongside the Epizyme team, I have been impressed by their passion and commitment to bringing new medicines to patients in need,” said Dr. Giordano. “Epizyme is translating epigenetic mechanisms of action into clinical therapies, making this a particularly exciting time to be joining the board. I look forward to collaborating with the leadership team and my fellow board members to help Epizyme advance novel therapeutics and realize its great potential.”\nAbout Epizyme, Inc.\nEpizyme, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to rewriting treatment for cancer and other serious diseases through novel epigenetic medicines. Epizyme is broadly developing its lead product candidate, tazemetostat, a first-in-class EZH2 inhibitor, with studies underway in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies, as a monotherapy and combination therapy in relapsed and front-line disease. The company is also developing a novel G9a program and its next development candidate, EZM8266, is targeting sickle cell disease. By focusing on the genetic drivers of disease, Epizyme's science seeks to match targeted medicines with the patients who need them.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: uncertainties inherent in the initiation of future clinical studies and in the availability and timing of data from ongoing clinical studies; whether interim results from a clinical trial will be predictive of the final results of the trial; whether results from preclinical studies or earlier clinical studies will be predictive of the results of future trials; whether results from clinical studies will warrant meetings with regulatory authorities, submissions for regulatory approval or review by governmental authorities under the accelerated approval process; whether fast track and orphan drug designations will provide the benefits for which tazemetostat is eligible; expectations for regulatory approvals to conduct trials or to market products; whether the company's cash resources will be sufficient to fund the company's foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of the company's therapeutic candidates; and other factors discussed in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the company's most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in the company's other filings from time to time with the SEC. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this press release represent the company's views as of the date hereof and should not be relied upon as representing the company's views as of any date subsequent to the date hereof.
