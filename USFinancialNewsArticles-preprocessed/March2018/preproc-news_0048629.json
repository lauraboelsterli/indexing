    "text": "Great Lakes Airlines, which operated small turboprop planes between destinations in the West and Midwest, has suspended flying.\nThe airline says in a note on its website that it stopped scheduled flights at midnight Monday but has not filed for bankruptcy protection and continues to operate parts of its business.\nThe airline did not immediately respond to messages on Tuesday.\nGreat Lakes served fewer than a dozen destinations, linking big cities including Los Angeles, Phoenix and Denver with smaller destinations like Telluride, Colorado, and Prescott, Arizona.\nOn its website, the airline is giving instructions for refunds.\nThe company says partner Aerodynamics Inc. will operate Great Lakes Jet Express flights between Denver and Pierre and Watertown, South Dakota.",
