Riley FBR in New York, who said the administration “sees the stock market as a report card for success and markets have so far said this trade war is not a good idea.”\nAt 2:52 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 330.56 points, or 1.35 percent, to 24,868.62, the S&P 500 had gained 30.29 points, or 1.13 percent, to 2,721.54 and the Nasdaq Composite added 76.17 points, or 1.05 percent, to 7,334.04.\nAll 11 S&P sectors were higher, with the biggest boost coming from the information technology index, which was up 1.2 percent. Facebook, Amazon and JPMorgan were three of the biggest drivers.\nThe energy sector was up 1.2 percent helped by rising oil prices due to forecasts for robust demand growth and concerns that OPEC will not be able to increase its production capacity.\nThe utilities sector was the biggest percentage gainer with a 1.9 percent increase followed by the financial sector, which was up 1.7 percent.\nShares of Clearside Biomedical jumped 37 percent after the drug developer’s eye drug met the main goal in a late-stage study, while Dermira plunged 64 percent after the company abandoned its acne drug.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.30-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 97 new highs and 20 new lows.
