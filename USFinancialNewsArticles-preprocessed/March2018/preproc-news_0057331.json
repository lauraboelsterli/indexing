    "text": "President Donald Trump bashed Amazon on Twitter for the second time in three days, this time claiming the U.S. Postal Service loses \"billions of dollars\" delivering packages for the Jeff Bezos-run retailer.\nTweet\nTweet\nAmazon is Trump's new favorite punching bag and that's taken a toll on the high-flying stock, which had at one point last month surpassed Alphabet to become the second-biggest company in the world by market value behind Apple. But the shares have since fallen back after word spread that Trump may start to take aim at the company and its billionaire CEO Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post.\nShares of Amazon lost 6 percent last week as they came into Trump's cross hairs. Axios reported on Wednesday that Trump was looking into altering the retailer's tax treatment, in part because of anger over how Amazon has hurt the commercial real estate industry because of its negative effect on brick-and-mortar retailers.\nTrump then confirmed his dislike for the retailer in a tweet Thursday, making Saturday's tweet his second direct strike at the company. The U.S. stock market was closed on Friday for Good Friday.\nTweet\nOn Trump's cost claim in Saturday's tweet, it was unclear what the president was directly referencing. There was a commentary in The Wall Street Journal last year written by a FedEx shareholder that cited Citigroup analysis claiming Amazon got a subsidy of $1.46 from the Postal Service for each package.\n",
