    "text": "Los Angeles, March 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EVgo, the nation’s largest network of public electric vehicle (EV) fast charging stations, today announced that it has appointed infrastructure construction expert Jeff Ricketts as Vice President of Engineering and Construction. Over the course of his career, Jeff Ricketts has built and managed teams to deliver refueling stations for compressed natural gas (CNG) and traditional gasoline and diesel. In his new role, Ricketts will lead the installation of EVgo’s fast charging stations across the country as the company rapidly scales its deployment of fast charging stations and networks.\nRicketts brings with him 40 years of infrastructure fueling station construction project experience, having most recently served as Director of Construction at Clean Energy Fuels. While at Clean Energy Fuels, he led the team that built over 1,000 compressed natural gas refueling stations across North America, which collectively fuel over 44,000 vehicles per day. Ricketts has successfully worked with national organizations that have rapidly expanded in size and footprint, having managed infrastructure projects for major energy entities such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Shell. Throughout the course of his career, Ricketts has been managing complex construction projects, from renovations at Joe Robbie Stadium for the Miami Dolphins to facilities construction in Haiti for the U.S. Navy.\nRicketts graduated from the University of Central Florida with a degree in Engineering and Construction Management.\n“Jeff Ricketts has delivered the construction of refueling stations across the country for decades, while increasing productivity, cost efficiency, and customer satisfaction,” said Cathy Zoi, EVgo’s CEO. “His expertise will help to drive EVgo’s growth as we continue to rapidly expand our fast charging network across the country.”\n“EVgo has proven itself as the leader in public DC fast charging, with over 1,000 stations in 66 markets around the country,” said Jeff Ricketts. “We have moved past the tipping point of a major transportation revolution, and I am looking forward to accelerating the pace of new installations and projects as we quickly expand EVgo’s network.”\nFor more information on EVgo, including its new, low-cost, no commitment fast charging plans, visit EVgo.com .\nAbout EVgo\nEVgo is America’s Largest Public Fast Charging Network.
