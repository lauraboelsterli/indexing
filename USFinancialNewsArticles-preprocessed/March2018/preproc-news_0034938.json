    "text": "What state should you move to based on your personality? What character on \"Downton Abbey\" would you be? What breed of dog is best for you? Some enormous percentage of Facebook's 2.13 billion users must have seen Facebook friends sharing results of various online quizzes. They are sometimes annoying, senseless and a total waste of time. But they are irresistible . Besides, you're only sharing the results with your family and friends. There's nothing more innocent, right?\nWrong.\nFacebook is in the business of exploiting your data . The company is worth billions of dollars because it harvests your data and sells it to advertisers. Users are encouraged to like, share and comment their lives away in the name of staying connected to family and friends. However, as an ethical hacker, security researcher and data analyst , I know that there is a lot more to the story. The bedrock of modern democracy is at stake .\nMore from The Conversation:\nTrust in digital technology will be the internet's next frontier, for 2018 and beyond",
