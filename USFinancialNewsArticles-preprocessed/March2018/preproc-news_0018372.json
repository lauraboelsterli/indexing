Manafort is accused of hiding tens of millions of dollars he earned advising pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine from the IRS. The charges are part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian efforts to influence US elections. Published 10 Mins Ago The Associated Press Getty Images Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort (R) arrives at the Albert V. Bryan U.S. Courthouse for an arraignment hearing as a protester holds up a sign March 8, 2018 in Alexandria, Virginia. \nPresident Donald Trump 's former campaign chairman has pleaded not guilty on charges including tax evasion and bank fraud. \nPaul Manafort did not speak during the Thursday arraignment at a northern Virginia courthouse. A trial date of July 10 has been set, four months earlier than the defense had wanted. \nThe grand jury indictment in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia, accuses Manafort of hiding from the Internal Revenue Service tens of millions of dollars he earned advising pro- Russia politicians in Ukraine . \nThe charges are part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian efforts to influence U.S. elections. \nMost of the charges against Manafort had been filed in the District of Columbia. But prosecutors say they were required to bring these charges to Virginia because they lacked venue in the nation's capital.",
