    "text": "Published: Mar 29, 2018 1:06 p.m. ET Share \nWindows will be part of a Core OS group; Terry Myerson will leave the company Getty Images \nBy Jay Greene \nMicrosoft Corp. is diminishing the role of its storied Windows franchise, which fueled its rise to the top of the personal-computer market in earlier decades, reflecting the massive shift in the way computing power is harnessed. \nThe software giant reorganized its business Thursday morning around its growing Azure cloud-computing operations and its stalwart Office productivity business. \nExecutive Vice President Terry Myerson, who ran the Windows business, will leave the company, according to an email from Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella. \nThe move is designed to focus Microsoft MSFT, +1.88% on the biggest areas of growth for the company. In the last quarter, though the company doesnâ€™t disclose revenue for those businesses, it said Azure jumped 98% and Office 365 grew 41%. At the same time, its More Personal Computing unit, which includes Windows, gained 2% to $12.17 billion in the latest period.",
