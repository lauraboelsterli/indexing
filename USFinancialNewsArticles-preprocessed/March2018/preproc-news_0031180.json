    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 1:03 AM / Updated 20 hours ago Tennis-Raonic outlasts Querrey, will face Del Potro in semi-finals Reuters Staff 2 Min Read March 16 (Reuters) - Milos Raonic overcame his frustrations to outlast Sam Querrey and advance to the BNP Paribas Open semi-finals with a 7-5 2-6 6-3 victory on Friday. Clearly unhappy at times with his play, the Canadian won the final three games of the third set to return to the Indian Wells semis for the third time in four years. Raonic, 2016 Wimbledon runner-up, broke American Querrey for a 5-3 advantage, then salvaged a tense final game in which Querrey had three break points. The Canadian will next face Argentine Juan Martin del Potro who beat Philipp Kohlschreiber 3-6 6-3 6-4 in Friday’s second quarter-final. World number one Roger Federer will meet Borna Coric in the other semi-final on Saturday. After a slow start to his season following a calf injury last year, Raonic prevailed by serving and volleying and attacking the net against Querrey, who was playing in his first Masters 1000 quarter-final. The Canadian won 17 of the first set’s final 21 points, including two breaks of serve, to take the set after Querrey had led 5-4. The American broke twice in the second set before Raonic came through in the third. “Sometimes they (his emotions) have taken me for a ride, they have cost me matches, but I have also been cost matches by holding it in,” Raonic said in a courtside interview. “So sometimes it is good to get them out and try to express energy in the right way,” Although he fired 17 aces and won 74 percent of his first-service points, the Canadian admitted he needs to improve. “I’ve got to serve better,” he said. “That’s my best thing and I’ve got to step up and I’ve got to do what I do well.” Reporting by Gene Cherry in Salvo, North Carolina, editing by Ed Osmond",
