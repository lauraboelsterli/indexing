The Company provided guidance for Q1 2018 net revenues growth of 27 % to 29% year over year and full year 2018 net revenues growth of 16% to 19 % from 2017.\nSHANGHAI, China, China Lodging Group, Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT) (“China Lodging Group”, “Huazhu” or the “Company”), a leading and fast-growing multi-brand hotel group in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter of 2017 Operational Highlights\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, China Lodging Group opened 137 hotels, including 2 leased (“leased-and-operated”) hotels and 135 manachised (“franchised-and-managed”) hotels and franchised hotels.\nThe Company closed a total of 47 hotels, which included 15 leased hotels and 32 manachised and franchised hotels, during the fourth quarter of 2017. This was mainly due to:\na) The Company's strategic focus to upgrade the quality of the product and service. The Company closed 5 hotels for brand upgrade purposes and permanently removed 11 hotels from its network for their non-compliance with the brand and operating standards. These hotels were mainly under HanTing and Hi Inn brands. By removing hotels of lower quality, the Company is able to provide a more consistent customer experience, which will help enhance both the brands and future profitability.\nb) Property related issues, including rezoning and returning of military-owned properties, and expiry of leases, which resulted in the closure of 28 hotels.\nc) Operating losses from hotels located mainly in selected 3 rd or lower tier cities which resulted in the closure of 3 hotels.\nThe ADR, which is defined as the average daily rate for all hotels in operation, was RMB211 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with RMB186 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB218 in the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase of 13.1% was due to both an increase in ADR of the mature hotels, as well as an increase in the proportion of midscale and upscale hotels with higher ADR in the Company’s brand mix. The sequential decrease resulted mainly from seasonality.\nThe occupancy rate for all hotels in operation was 86.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 84.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 93.1% in the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase of 1.4 percentage points was due to the improved performance across all brands as driven by strong travel demand and the increasing popularity of the Company’s brands. The sequential decrease resulted mainly from seasonality.\nRevPAR, defined as revenue per available room for all hotels in operation, was RMB181 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with RMB158 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB203 in the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase of 15.0% was attributable to both higher ADR and occupancy. The sequential decrease resulted mainly from seasonality.\nFor all hotels which had been in operation for at least 18 months, the same-hotel RevPAR was RMB172 for the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 6.5% increase from RMB162 for the fourth quarter of 2016, with a 4.9% increase in ADR and a 1.3-percentage-point increase in occupancy rate. The economy hotels registered a 6.9% same-hotel RevPAR improvement, driven by a 5.1% increase in ADR and a 1.5-percentage-point increase in occupancy rate. The midscale and upscale hotels registered a 4.8% same-hotel RevPAR improvement, driven by a 4.4% increase in ADR and a 0.3-percentage-point increase in occupancy rate. Crystal Orange hotels will not be counted in the same-hotel RevPAR statistics until they are in Huazhu system for 18 months.\nOperational Highlights of full year 2017\nFor the full year of 2017, the company opened 86 leased hotels and 579 manachised hotels and franchised hotels, and closed 39 leased hotels and 149 manachised and franchised hotels. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 671 leased hotels, 2,874 manachised hotels, and 201 franchised hotels in operation in 378 cities. The number of hotel rooms in operation totaled 379,675, an increase of 14.6% from a year ago.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had a total number of 696 hotels contracted or under construction, including 37 leased hotels and 659 manachised and franchised hotels.\nFor the full year of 2017, the ADR for all hotels in operation was RMB203, increasing 10.0% year-over-year from RMB185 in 2016. The occupancy rate for all hotels in operation was 88.3%, compared with 84.9% in 2016. As a result, the RevPAR for all hotels in operation was RMB180 in 2017, a 14.4% increase from RMB157 in 2016.\nThe same-hotel RevPAR was RMB174 in 2017, a 7.7% increase from RMB in 2016, with a 3.7% increase in ADR and a 3.3-percentage-point increase in occupancy rate. In 2017, the economy hotels and the midscale and upscale hotels posted an increase of 7.4% and 8.2% in same-hotel RevPAR, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s loyalty program had approximately 103 million members, who contributed approximately 76% of room nights sold during the full year of 2017 and approximately 87% of room nights were sold through the Company’s own direct channels.\n“We are pleased to have finished 2017 with strong fourth quarter operating results and expecting another solid year in 2018. Thanks to successful product upgrade, brand mix up-shift, and improved operational environment, we achieved 14.4% increase year-over-year in group blended RevPAR. On the front of hotel development, in 2017, we opened more than three hotels every two days. Our hotel room inventory grew by 20% on a gross basis, or 15% net,” commented Ms. Jenny Zhang, Chief Executive Officer of China Lodging Group.\n“Our consistent track record of strong hotel openings and pipeline growth demonstrates robust demand for our brands. In 2017, we continued to strengthen our economy brands by rolling out new models and launch a few of midscale brands such as HanTing Premium, CitiGo and urban Manxin. Our refreshed models have received positive market feedback from guests and franchisees. Additionally, we have enriched our midscale brand portfolio by acquiring Crystal Orange and successfully integrated the Crystal Orange hotels into our network, which is expected to accelerate our growth and enhance our profitability in 2018. I’m also proud to announce that we have achieved a milestone of having over 100 million members in our loyalty program,” said Ms. Zhang. “Going forward, we will maintain our asset-light growth strategy and continue to invest in our brands and to improve our operational efficiency. We expect operational environment to continue its positive momentum and remain optimistic about outlook in 2018.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year of 2017 Financial Results (RMB in thousands) Q4 2016 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 2016FY 2017FY Revenues: Leased and owned hotels 1,290,575 1,857,846 1,718,840 5,212,405 6,343,279 Manachised and franchised hotels 367,983 506,720 483,026 1,411,156 1,786,660 Others 11,365 8,445 13,032 31,219 40,257 Total revenues 1,669,923 2,373,011 2,214,898 6,654,780 8,170,196 Less: business tax and related surcharges - - - (116,149 ) - Net revenues 1,669,923 2,373,011 2,214,898 6,538,631 8,170,196 Net revenues from leased and owned hotels 1,290,575 1,857,846 1,718,840 5,121,431 6,343,279 Net revenues from manachised and franchised hotels 367,983 506,720 483,026 1,386,526 1,786,660 Others 11,365 8,445 13,032 30,674 40,257 Note: Value-added tax (\"VAT\") has been implemented for hospitality industry to replace business tax in China, effective May 1, 2016.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results” set forth at the end of this release. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Company performance by excluding share-based compensation expenses that may not be indicative of Company operating performance. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Company performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used regularly by Company management in financial and operational decision-making. A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures excluding share-based compensation expenses is that share-based compensation expenses have been – and will continue to be – a significant recurring expense in the Company’s business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company believes that EBITDA is a useful financial metric to assess the operating and financial performance before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes, given the significant investments that the Company has made in leasehold improvements, depreciation and amortization expense that comprise a significant portion of the Company’s cost structure. In addition, the Company believes that EBITDA is widely used by other companies in the lodging industry and may be used by investors as a measure of financial performance. The Company believes that EBITDA will provide investors with a useful tool for comparability between periods because it eliminates depreciation and amortization expense attributable to capital expenditures. The Company also uses adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as EBITDA before share-based compensation expenses, to assess operating results of the hotels in operation. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expenses helps facilitate year-on-year comparison of the results of operations as the share-based compensation expenses may not be indicative of Company operating performance. Therefore, the Company believes adjusted EBITDA more closely reflects the performance capability of hotels. The presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by other charges and gains considered to be outside the ordinary course of business.\nThe use of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. Depreciation and amortization expense for various long-term assets (including land use rights), income tax, interest expense and interest income have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of EBITDA. Share-based compensation expenses have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted EBITDA. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of the results. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the depreciation and amortization, interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses and other relevant items both in the reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP financial measures and in the consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the performance of the Company.\nThe terms EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not defined under U.S. GAAP, and neither EBITDA nor adjusted EBITDA is a measure of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When assessing the operating and financial performance, investors should not consider these data in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s net income, operating income or any other operating performance measure that is calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company’s EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA – or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies – since such other companies may not calculate EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as the Company does.\nReconciliations of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, to the consolidated statement of operations information are included at the end of this press release.\nAbout China Lodging Group, Limited\nChina Lodging Group, Limited is a leading hotel operator and franchisor in China.
