Within WD Services, in addition to being awarded a third Work and Health Program contract, bringing total secured contract value under the program to approximately $195 million over five years, profitability continued to improve as a result of a lower corporate and shared services cost structure. Lastly our Matrix Investment continued to successfully convert its sales pipeline into new signed logos, positioning Matrix for another year of strong revenue growth in 2018. Matrix also announced and subsequently closed its acquisition of HealthFair. This positive momentum across all of our segments positions us well in 2018 for improved profitability and continued long-term value creation.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported revenue from continuing operations of $406.9 million, an increase of 5.5% from $385.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenue from continuing operations increased 3.4%.\nIncome from continuing operations, net of tax, for the twelve months of 2017 was $59.8 million, or $3.50 per diluted common share, compared to losses of $18.9 million, or $1.45 per diluted common share, in the twelve months of 2016. Income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the twelve months of 2017 includes a $29.6 million benefit due to the impact of the Tax Reform Act.

Since beginning to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 through March 5, 2018, the Company has repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock, or approximately 22% of the Company’s common stock outstanding at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015, for $166.2 million, or for an average price of $46.86 per share. As of March 5, 2018, $25.8 million of additional share repurchase capacity existed under this program.\nSegment Results\nFor analysis purposes, the Company provides revenue, expenses, operating income (loss), income (loss) from continuing operations, net of taxes, and Adjusted EBITDA on a segment basis. Segment results include revenue and expenses incurred by each segment, as well as an allocation of certain direct expenses incurred by Corporate on behalf of the segment. No direct expenses were incurred by Corporate on behalf of the Matrix Investment segment. The activities reflected in Corporate and Other include executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal, public reporting, certain strategic and corporate development functions, the results of the Company’s captive insurance company and elimination entries recorded in consolidation.\nNET Services\nNET Services revenue was $330.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 4.4% from $316.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income was $23.8 million, or 7.2% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $23.6 million, or 7.4% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in NET Services operating income in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 were $1.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of restructuring and related charges. NET Services Adjusted EBITDA was $28.7 million, or 8.7% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $28.8 million, or 9.1% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNET Services revenue was $1.32 billion for the twelve months of 2017, an increase of 6.8% from $1.23 billion for the twelve months of 2016. Operating income was $65.7 million, or 5.0% of revenue, in the twelve months of 2017, compared to $77.1 million, or 6.2% of revenue, in the comparable period of 2016. Included in NET Services operating income in the twelve months of 2017 and 2016 were $6.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of restructuring and related charges. NET Services Adjusted EBITDA was $85.3 million, or 6.5% of revenue, in the twelve months of 2017, compared to $92.4 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in the comparable period of 2016.\nThe year-over-year increase in NET Services revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increased revenue from new contracts including new MCO contracts in New York and new state regional contracts in Texas. Additionally, NET Services benefited from membership growth and rate increases on a number of existing contracts as well as retroactive rate increases to compensate for increased utilization experienced throughout the year on multiple MCO contracts. The year-over-year revenue increase was partially offset by reductions in revenue from contracts we no longer serve, including a contract with the state of New York. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was in line with the fourth quarter of 2016; benefiting from an expense reserve released upon the finalization of a contract amendment with a state customer, while being negatively impacted by the loss of the contract with the state of New York.\nWD Services\nWD Services revenue was $76.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 10.4% from $69.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenue increased 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income was $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 including a $2.0 million benefit from a favorable resolution of a contingency related to the acquisition of Ingeus, compared to a $32.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2016. WD Services operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 included impairment charges of $19.6 million. Included within WD Services operating income / loss in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 were restructuring and related costs of $1.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively. WD Services Adjusted EBITDA was $5.6 million, or 7.3% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 million, or negative 6.6% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWD Services revenue was $305.7 million for the twelve months of 2017, a decrease of 11.2% from $344.4 million in the twelve months of 2016. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenue declined 8.9% in the twelve months of 2017 versus the twelve months of 2016. Operating income was $2.0 million in the twelve months of 2017, compared to an operating loss of $39.5 million in the comparable period of 2016. WD Services operating loss in the twelve months of 2016 included impairment charges of $19.6 million. Included within WD Services operating income / loss in the twelve months of 2017 and 2016 were restructuring and related costs of $3.6 million and $11.5 million, respectively. WD Services Adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million, or 5.3% of revenue, in the twelve months of 2017 compared to $5.5 million, or 1.6% of revenue, in the comparable period of 2016.\nThe year-over-year increase in WD Services revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily related to increases in the offender rehabilitation contract together with growth in UK Health and Youth Services programs and increases from various employability programs outside of the UK, including in Australia, France and Canada. This was partially offset by the anticipated ending of referrals under the Work Programme contract in the UK. While WD Services has successfully secured contracts under the UK's Work and Health Programme with a combined total value of approximately $195 million over 5 years, revenues under these contracts were minimal in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was significantly higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 due to the benefits from the reduced headcount related to the start of the Ingeus Futures program at the end of 2016 as well as a reduction in IT and facility costs.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other incurred a $9.8 million operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to an operating loss of $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Included within Corporate and Other operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 were restructuring and related costs of $1.7 million. Included within operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 was an impairment charge of $1.4 million related to the sale of certain real estate assets. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA was negative $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to negative $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCorporate and Other incurred a $31.7 million operating loss in the twelve months of 2017, compared to a $29.0 million operating loss in the twelve months of 2016. Included within Corporate and Other operating loss in the twelve months of 2017 were restructuring and related costs of $1.7 million as well as $3.4 million of professional costs associated with focused strategic initiatives. Included within operating loss in the twelve months of 2016 was an impairment charge of $1.4 million related to the sale of certain real estate assets. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA was negative $29.2 million in the twelve months of 2017 compared to negative $25.6 million in the comparable period of 2016.\nThe year-over-year increase in the Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in cash settled stock-based compensation as a result of an increase in the Company’s stock price in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to a decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as a decrease in the benefits associated with favorable claims experiences on our reinsurance and self-insured programs. Included within Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 is $1.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of expense related to a share-based long-term incentive plan. No shares were distributed under this plan as the performance hurdles were not met. As such, as of December 31, 2017, we accelerated all remaining unrecognized compensation expense for the Holding Company long-term incentive plan.\nCorporate and Other included other income in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $5.4 million related to the settlement of a previously disclosed litigation related to a putative stockholder class action derivative complaint.\nMatrix Investment (Equity Investment)\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, Providence recorded a gain in equity earnings of $13.0 million and $13.4 million, respectively, related to its Matrix Investment. Included within the equity income is the impact on Matrix of the Tax Reform Act.\nAs Providence’s interest in Matrix is accounted for as an equity method investment, the following numbers are not included within the Company’s consolidated results of operations. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Matrix’s revenue was $52.5 million, an increase of 0.4% from $52.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Matrix’s operating income was $1.8 million, or 3.4% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a $0.2 million operating loss, or negative 0.4% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Included within Matrix’s operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.5 million of management fees paid to Matrix shareholders and acquisition costs of $0.4 million. Included within Matrix's operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $4.0 million of expense related to transaction bonuses paid to the Matrix management team as well as $2.4 million of other transaction related expenses. Matrix’s Adjusted EBITDA was $11.6 million, or 22.1% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $11.7 million, or 22.5% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the twelve months of 2017, Matrix’s revenue was $227.9 million, an increase of 9.7% from $207.7 million in the twelve months of 2016. Matrix’s operating income was $11.9 million, or 5.2% of revenue, for the twelve months of 2017, compared to $17.8 million, or 8.6% of revenue, for the comparable period of 2016. Included within Matrix’s operating income in the twelve months of 2017 was $2.7 million of transaction bonuses paid to the Matrix management team, $2.3 million of management fees paid to Matrix’s shareholders, $0.9 million of other transaction related expenses and acquisition costs of $1.3 million. Matrix’s Adjusted EBITDA was $51.7 million, or 22.7% of revenue, for the twelve months of 2017, compared to $51.7 million, or 24.9% of revenue, in the twelve months of 2016.\nMatrix had moderate year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2017 with Adjusted EBITDA margins impacted by lower prices.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Matrix had cash of $15.0 million and $193.1 million of term loan debt outstanding under its credit facility.\nOn February 16, 2018 Matrix completed its acquisition of HealthFair for $160 million plus an earn-out payment contingent upon HealthFair’s 2018 performance. The transaction combines Matrix’s expansive in-home capabilities with HealthFair’s national fleet of mobile health clinics equipped with advanced diagnostic capabilities. With the addition of HealthFair, Matrix’s network increases to more than 6,000 community-based providers across all 50 states, including over 1,700 nurse practitioners.\nHealthFair’s 2017 revenue was approximately $45 million. HealthFair expects significant growth in 2018 supported by several recently awarded national contracts with major health plans. The acquisition was funded through an increase in Matrix's outstanding debt and rollover equity from the seller of HealthFair. Providence and Frazier did not contribute additional equity to fund the acquisition. Following the transaction, Matrix had net debt of approximately $310 million with Providence retaining an ownership percentage of 43.6%.\nTax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) was enacted which reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% commencing in 2018. As a result of the decrease in rate, the Company remeasured its deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017, and recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $19.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, Matrix remeasured its deferred tax liabilities in connection with the Tax Reform Act, which resulted in additional equity income to Providence of $13.6 million. The Providence tax provision reflects tax expense of $3.4 million on this additional equity income. Thus, the total impact of tax reform is $29.6 million.\nInvestor Presentation and Conference Call\nProvidence will hold a conference call to discuss its financial results on Friday, March 9, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. ET.

For more information, please visit prscholdings.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjustments\nIn addition to the financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release includes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Segment-level Adjusted EBITDA for the Company and its operating segments, and Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the Company, which are performance measures that are not recognized under GAAP. EBITDA is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations, net of taxes, before: (1) interest expense, net, (2) provision (benefit) for income taxes and (3) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA before certain items, including (as applicable): (1) restructuring and related charges, (2) foreign currency transactions, (3) equity in net earnings or losses of investees, (4) certain litigation related expenses or settlement income, (5) gain or loss on sale of equity investments, (6) management fees and (7) certain transaction and related costs. Segment-level Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the company excluding the Adjusted EBITDA associated with corporate and holding company costs reported as our Corporate and Other Segment. Adjusted Net Income is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, before certain items, including (1) restructuring and related charges, (2) foreign currency transactions, (3) equity in net earnings or losses of investees, (4) certain litigation related expenses or settlement income, (5) intangible amortization expense, (6) gain or loss on sale of equity investments, (7) the impact of the Tax Reform Act, (8) excess tax charges associated with long term incentive plans, (9) the impact of adjustments on non-controlling interests, (10) transaction and related costs and (11) the income tax impact of such adjustments. Adjusted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income less (as applicable): (1) dividends on convertible preferred stock, (2) accretion of convertible preferred stock discount, and (3) income allocated to participating stockholders, divided by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. We utilize these non-GAAP performance measures, which exclude certain expenses and amounts, because we believe the timing of such expenses is unpredictable and not driven by our core operating results, and therefore render comparisons with prior periods as well as with other companies in our industry less meaningful. We believe such measures allow investors to gain a better understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing operations of our business. We consider our core operations to be the ongoing activities to provide services from which we earn revenue, including direct operating costs and indirect costs to support these activities. In addition, our net earnings in equity investees are excluded from these measures, as we do not have the ability to manage these ventures, allocate resources within the ventures, or directly control their operations or performance.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
