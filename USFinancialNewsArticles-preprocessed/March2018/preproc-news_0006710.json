    "text": "March 1 (Reuters) - VMware Inc, with which Dell Technologies Inc is considering a reverse-merger to be a public company again, reported a quarterly loss compared with a profit a year earlier as the business software maker took a charge of $970 million due to changes in the U.S. tax law.\nThe companyâ€™s net loss was $440 million, or $1.09 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, compared with a profit of $441 million, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue rose to $2.31 billion from $2.03 billion.\nEarlier this month, Dell Technologies Inc said it was considering a public offering of common stock or a combination with VMWare, in which Dell owns 80 percent stake.
