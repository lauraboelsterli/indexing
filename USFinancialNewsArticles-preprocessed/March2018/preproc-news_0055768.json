    "text": "5 COMMENTS China’s campaign against virtual private networks used to bypass its internet restrictions adds to the extra expenses—and headaches—for foreign companies doing business in the country.\nUnder rules that take effect Saturday , businesses can use only VPNs approved by the government. Business groups and consultants see the VPN changes as part of a broader campaign by Chinese authorities to tighten their chokehold over Chinese cyberspace.\nBefore the changes, the VPN rules “were extremely vague with little to no enforcement,” said the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and consulting firm Control Risks in a recent report, adding that China is moving to ban “everything that is not approved, registered, or reviewed by the government.”\nRelated Coverage China’s VPN Crackdown May Aid Government Surveillance (Jan. 17) Apple Removes Apps That Allowed China Users to Get Around Filters (July 29) China’s World: China Toys With an Internet Lockdown (July 25) Marco Gasparroni, head of Greater China operations at Exprivia Group, an Italian software and IT systems company that sells software for health-care, manufacturing and other sectors, said many clients have complained that connecting to websites outside of China or exchanging data with headquarters has become slower and more unstable since around last October.\nMr. Gasparroni said he recommends clients switch from a VPN to a dedicated line that provides direct connection between their Chinese subsidiary and headquarters.\nBut that is a costly option. For instance, a manufacturer with 300 to 500 employees would typically see their communications bills rise from around $5,000 a year to up to $70,000, he said.\nMany foreigners also use unauthorized VPNs to access websites blocked in China and were rattled by the looming initiative. China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology told reporters in January that the new measures “would not affect broader cross-border internet access by the general public.” The Ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nThe new VPN requirements are part of a broader law regulating the transmission of cross-border data. China’s cybersecurity law , which went into effect last year, has forced many businesses here to review their computer networks and operations.\nComplying with the cybersecurity law, along with adapting to new technologies in China, contributed to companies in mainland China and Hong Kong exceeding their global counterparts by almost 25% last year in spending on cybersecurity, said industry researcher PwC.\nThose expenses include conducting reviews of data and network assets and appointing senior staff to manage cybersecurity risks, said Lisa Li, a cybersecurity and privacy partner at PwC China.\nHarley Seyedin, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, said businesses might be spending more than they need to but don’t want to run the risk of violating the law.\n“Just to be safe, you do this; to be safe, you do that,” he said. “If things were more clear, you wouldn’t be spending that money.”\nAccording to a poll of 215 firms released by the American Chamber of Commerce in South China on March 1, cybersecurity regulations were the second-largest policy challenge facing companies in China, after the country’s tax policy.\nWhile there are no comprehensive numbers for compliance costs, individual companies have released figures that give a hint at the significance of these expenses.\nApple Inc. has said it is spending $1 billion to build a data center in the southwestern province of Guizhou to comply with rules stipulating that cloud data from Chinese consumers be stored in China.\nForeign auto makers operating in China are also considering building data centers in China, as some are concerned about whether they would be able to send certain types of data back to their home countries under the new law, a person familiar with the matter said.\n‘ Just to be safe, you do this; to be safe, you do that. ’ \n—Harley Seyedin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China Car makers collect vehicle-performance data from automobiles they sell through an onboard diagnostics system.\nAlso contributing to higher costs is the money being spent on outside consultants on compliance. British recruitment firm Hays expects demand for cybersecurity experts in China to reach record levels this year.\nBusiness consultants Control Risks and Kroll say they have seen higher demand for their cybersecurity services. Organizations have hired Control Risks to do preliminary evaluations of the law and implement initial compliance programs, said Sean Molloy, a Shanghai-based partner with the company.\nThe law brought increased awareness of cybersecurity in China, a silver lining as corporate security policies have struggled to keep pace with China’s rapid technological progress, said Paul Jackson, Asia-Pacific leader for Kroll’s cybersecurity and investigations practice.\n“Any time when new laws are introduced, it helps drive an opportunity for companies to sit down and benchmark where they are at currently,” Mr. Jackson said.\n—Chunying Zhang in Shanghai contributed to this article.\nWrite to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com and Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com",
