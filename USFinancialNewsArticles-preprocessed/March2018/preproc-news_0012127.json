    "text": "HOUSTON, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Sterling Group, a Houston-based middle market private equity firm, announced that its portfolio company, Construction Supply Group (\"CSG\"), has completed the acquisition of Zia Concrete Supply, a construction supply distributor operating out of Albuquerque, New Mexico since 1997. Construction Supply Group is a leader in the distribution of construction materials, accessories and tools, primarily for professional concrete and masonry contractors in the United States and Canada. The combined company has 74 branches with over 1,150 employees and offers over 70,000 SKUs to nearly 25,000 customers.\nZia Concrete Supply is the seventh acquisition by Sterling as a part of the Construction Supply platform. In late 2016, Sterling acquired Brock White Company, LLC, Border Construction Specialties, LLC and Stetson Building Products to form Construction Supply Group. The company later executed a carve-out of five Gerdau distribution branches and the acquisitions of Carter Waters and Brock White of Wisconsin, extending its footprint throughout the Midwest. Following the transaction, Zia Concrete Supply will be integrated into CSG's Southwestern business unit, Border Construction Specialties. \"Construction Supply Group is the ideal partner for us,\" said Mike and Grace Moore, Owners of Zia Concrete Supply. \"Their platform will allow us to better serve our customers in the New Mexico market, and we are excited to grow with the business.\"\n\"We look forward to partnering with Mike and Grace Moore and Zia Concrete Supply's employees as we expand our footprint across the Southwest into New Mexico,\" said Brian Saker, President of Border Construction Specialties. \"This acquisition furthers our goal of providing comprehensive service and product offerings to professional contractors across North America,\" said Mitch Williams, CEO of Construction Supply Group. Construction Supply Group will continue to seek further additions to its family of construction distribution businesses.\nAbout The Sterling Group\nFounded in 1982, The Sterling Group is a private equity investment firm that targets controlling interests in basic manufacturing, distribution and industrial services companies.
