    "text": "RALEIGH, N.C., March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Dropsource , the next-level mobile app development platform for visually creating data-driven, truly native enterprise mobile apps, has appointed Mike Dunn to the company's Board of Directors. Dunn brings more than two decades of strategic leadership experience as a core technologist, advisor, mentor, and investor working with both large technology companies and innovative startups. He joins existing board members, including Executive Chairman Bill Wilson , former FMI Corporation Chairman and CEO Chip Andrews, and Gregory Poole Equipment Company Chairman and CEO Greg Poole.\nDunn's impressive career spans multiple chief technology officer (CTO) roles at Dell, Time Warner, Encoda Systems, Hearst Interactive Media, TrueCar, and Mandt Media. He was also chief information officer (CIO) at VER. Dunn co-founded the LA Media Lab and is an active member of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n\"Every CIO and CTO today is being asked 'what's your mobile strategy?'\" said Dunn. \"The reality is it's still really complicated for enterprises to go from concept to production for their mobile solutions, without resorting to expensive and time-consuming outsourced development and support. What I see in Dropsource is a platform that solves this challenge, helping developers and business stakeholders collaborate more productively and creatively in the design and deployment phases. The end result is rock-solid native code and a mobile app that is always current with the latest operating systems. This means accelerated innovation and time to market which, for any enterprise, is a crucial differentiator.\"\n\"Mike will be an enormous asset to the Dropsource team,\" said Ben Saren, Dropsource CEO. \"He brings the strategic perspective of the enterprise buyer which is critical as we scale and mature our technology, evolve our roadmap, and deepen our go-to-market strategy. And he'll be an incredible mentor to our management and engineering team.\"\nAbout Dropsource\nDropsource is the next-level mobile app development platform for building data-driven, truly native enterprise mobile apps. With a low-code, configurable visual development platform, Dropsource helps developers solve more problems creatively while automating the mundane, and digital leaders deliver bold innovation faster, without sacrificing quality or performance.
