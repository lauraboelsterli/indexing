    "text": "Published: Mar 8, 2018 2:41 a.m. ET Share \nStephanie Clifford’s lawyer says order is invalid because underlying NDA is void Getty Images Adult film actress Stormy Daniels attends the 2018 Adult Video News Awards in Las Vegas in January. \nBy Michael Rothfeld Joe Palazzolo \nA lawyer for President Donald Trump last week obtained an emergency order from an arbitrator that temporarily restrained former adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford from discussing her allegations of an affair with Trump, according to a copy of the order reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \nAttorney Michael Cohen obtained the order after a representative for Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, said Cohen had breached a nondisclosure agreement she signed in October 2016, weeks before the presidential election. Clifford had agreed, in exchange for a payment of $130,000, not to publicly discuss her allegations that she had a sexual relationship with Trump in 2006 and 2007. \nRead: Stormy Daniels sues Trump over ‘hush agreement’ \nThe arbitration order, first reported by NBC News, became public a day after Clifford filed a lawsuit against Trump in Los Angeles County Superior Court asking a judge to declare the nondisclosure agreement invalid. In the suit, Clifford alleged that Cohen had initiated an arbitration proceeding in late February in a continuing effort to silence her. \nClifford’s attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Wednesday that the arbitration order has no force because the underlying nondisclosure agreement is void. He also said Clifford hadn’t been served with any notice of the proceeding or been given an opportunity to respond. “We don’t believe the order is worth the paper it’s printed on,” he said.",
