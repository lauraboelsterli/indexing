According to the new plan, the justice minister would have to seek the opinion of judges first before deciding whether to dismiss a court president, Law and Justice (PiS) party lawmaker Marek Ast said. “This is a step ... to ease the concerns presented by the European Commission,” Ast told Reuters. “We hope that the step will be positively received.” Reporting by Pawel Sobczak; Writing by Marcin Goettig; Editing by Kevin Liffey",
