    "text": "PARIS, March 30 (Reuters) - France does not anticipate launching any military operations in northern Syria that fall outside the international coalition’s fight against Islamic State, a French presidency source said on Friday.\nThe official’s remarks came a day after the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces said President Emmanuel Macron’s pledge of support to stabilise the region against Islamic State would include more troops.\nShortly before the Elysee official spoke, Turkey’s deputy prime minister said France’s offer of support for the Kurdish YPG militants, who form the largest contingent within the Syrian Democratic Forces, amounted to support for terrorists.
