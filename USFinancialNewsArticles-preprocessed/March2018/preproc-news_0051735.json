    "text": "0 COMMENTS U.S. government bonds strengthened Tuesday, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to its lowest level in seven weeks, amid continued jitters in the stock market and easing concerns about the potential for a more aggressive Federal Reserve.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.790%, compared with 2.843% Monday.\nYields, which fall when bond prices rise, declined steadily for much of the U.S. trading session before falling more steeply near the 3 p.m. settlement as stocks took a sharp turn lower.\nThough they staged a big rally Monday, stocks have been weighed down in recent weeks by broad concerns about rising trade tensions and specific worries related to technology companies such as Facebook Inc. That has helped bolster demand for safer assets such as Treasurys, which offer steady interest payments and essentially no credit risk.\nTraders piled into bonds Tuesday even as the Treasury sold $35 billion of five-year notes, part of a nearly $300 billion wave of issuance this week.\nThough new debt can sometimes weigh on the prices of outstanding bonds, analysts said larger forces were supporting the market, including growing confidence among investors about the direction of U.S. inflation and the Fed’s interest-rate policy.\nWhile investors started 2018 focused on the risk that inflation was poised to pick up momentum, recent data has eased some of those concerns. At the same time, investors have become more confident that Fed officials won’t raise interest rates more than two more times this year following their policy meeting last week.\nThe yield on the 10-year note started March at around 2.80%. It briefly topped 2.9% last week but has since eased back to the bottom end of its recent trading range.\nAt the moment, “there’s room for some short-term towards lower yields in the absence of any fundamental reason to do anything different,” said John Canavan, market analyst at Stone and McCarthy Research Associates.\nTuesday’s sale of five-year notes follows a $30 billion auction of two-year notes on Monday.\nThe amount of debt being sold by the Treasury is growing because of an expanding budget deficit. President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion budget Friday that boosts spending by more than $140 billion above limits set in 2011. That came after he signed a $1.5 trillion tax-cut package in December.\nWrite to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com",
