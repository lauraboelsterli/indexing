    "text": "NEW YORK & TRONDHEIM, Norway--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zedge, Inc. (NYSE AMERICAN:ZDGE) today announced results for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2018, the three months ended January 31, 2018.\nSecond Quarter FY 2018 Operational and Financial Highlights\n(Results are for the 2 nd quarter FY 2018 and are compared to the 2 nd quarter FY 2017 except where otherwise noted.)\nMAU (Monthly Active Users) for the last 30 days of the quarter increased 6.3% to 35.5 million from 33.4 million in the comparable period of 2017 driven primarily by strong growth in the emerging markets; Total installs at January 31, 2018 increased 24.3% to 306.2 million from 246.3 million; Quarterly revenue increased 18.4% to $3.04 million from $2.57 million; Average revenue per MAU derived from our apps (ARPMAU) increased 15.2% for the quarter to $0.0273 from $0.0237, the sixth consecutive quarter of improvement; Selling, General and Administration (SG&A) expense increased 11.8% to $2.59 million from $2.31 million. The FY18 spend included $469 thousand of costs incurred in connection with the launch of Zedge Premium and severance. Excluding those costs, SG&A would have decreased, mainly attributable to the cost reduction initiative implemented as of November 1, 2017; Loss from operations during the quarter was $122 thousand, compared to a loss of $338 thousand. Excluding severance, income from operations would have been $52 thousand; Zedge Premium, our marketplace offering that was launched on iOS in December 2017, is currently being rolled out on Android. Initial conversion rates specific to monetizable actions are positive; Net loss per share of $0.02 in the 2 nd quarter of FY 2018 compared to net loss per share of $0.03.\nManagement Remarks\n“Q2 2018 was a solid quarter for Zedge with continued improvements in revenue, user growth and ARPMAU. Zedge Premium, which was introduced to iOS users in December, is off to a good start with encouraging conversion rates, which, while it is still very early, have steadily been improving. Furthermore, Zedge Premium is close to being fully rolled out on Android giving us scale. As previously indicated, building the marketplace will be an iterative process and we are happy with the experience thus far,” said Tom Arnoy, CEO.\n“We grew MAU by more than 2 million in the past quarter with the overwhelming majority of this growth in the emerging markets. Our growth strategy calls for optimizing the product for both well developed economies where advertising rates and disposable income are higher as well as in emerging markets where we have access to an untapped market. To this end, we rolled out an Android Go compliant version of Zedge to capitalize on this segment. Android Go is a version of Google’s operating system crafted for low-end Android phones, which are becoming prevalent in certain emerging markets. Our goal is to use the combination of Zedge Premium, ongoing improvements in the flagship product and new content offerings to draw more users into the app resulting in continued user growth and improved monetization.”\nJonathan Reich, CFO and COO of Zedge, said, “Our focused approach continues serving us well. Year over year, SG&A increased 11.8% to $2.59 million from $2.31 million, primarily attributable to the costs incurred in connection with Zedge Premium and severance totaling $469 thousand. The cost cutting measures we implemented, including headcount reduction, have trimmed SG&A spend outside of those two items. We are excited by the opportunities that we see ahead of us, will continue investing propitiously in order to turn these into reality and manage our expenses to drive shareholder value.”\nFinancial Results by Quarter (in thousands of USD, other than Loss per Share and ARPMAU)\nQ2 Q2 % Change Q2 Q1 % Change FY '18 FY '17 DELTA FY '18 FY '18 DELTA Revenue $ 3,045 $ 2,572 $ 473 18.4 % $ 3,045 $ 2,659 $ 386 14.5 % Direct Cost of Revenue $ 356 $ 412 ($56 ) -13.6 % $ 356 $ 372 ($16 ) -4.3 % Total SG&A $ 2,586 $ 2,314 $ 272 11.8 % $ 2,586 $ 2,972 ($386 ) -13.0 % Depreciation & Amortization $ 225 $ 184 $ 41 22.3 % $ 225 $ 157 $ 68 43.3 % Loss from Operations ($122 ) ($338 ) $ 216 -63.9 % ($122 ) ($842 ) $ 720 -85.5 % Net (Loss)/Gain from FX & Other ($39 ) ($10 ) ($29 ) 290.0 % ($39 ) $ 8 ($47 ) -587.5 % Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 12 ($22 ) $ 34 -154.5 % $ 12 ($14 ) $ 26 -185.7 % Net Loss ($173 ) ($326 ) $ 153 -46.9 % ($173 ) ($820 ) $ 647 -78.9 % Loss Per Share (0.02 ) ($0.03 ) $ 0.01 -33.3 % ($0.02 ) ($0.08 ) $ 0.06 -75.0 % Total Current Assets Less Total Current Liabilities $ 4,353 $ 5,807 $ (1,454 ) -25.0 % $ 4,353 $ 4,242 $ 111 2.6 % MAU (Million) 35.5 33.4 2.1 6.3 % 35.5 33.4 2.1 6.3 % Total Installs (Million) 306.2 246.3 59.9 24.3 % 306.2 288.8 17.4 6.0 % ARPMAU $ 0.0273 $ 0.0237 $ 0.0036 15.2 % $ 0.0273 $ 0.0256 $ 0.0017 6.6 % Earnings Announcement and Supplemental Information\nZedge will host a conference call at 8:00 AM ET today, March 13, beginning with management’s discussion of results, outlook and strategy followed by Q&A with investors.\nTo participate in the call, please dial toll-free 1-888-317-6003 (US toll free) or 1-412-317-6061 (outside the U.S.) at least five minutes before the 8:00 AM Eastern start, ask for the Zedge earnings conference call, and enter the conference ID: 4461588\nThe call will be webcast through this URL: https://services.choruscall.com/links/zdge180313AmrTm8pl.html\nFollowing the call and continuing through Tuesday, March 20th, a call replay will be available through the Zedge investor relations website and by dialing 1-877-344-7529 (US toll free), or 1-412-317-0088 (outside the U.S) and entering the replay access code: 10117223\nForward Looking Statements\nAll statements above that are not purely about historical facts, including, but not limited to, those in which we use the words “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “target” and similar expressions, are within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
