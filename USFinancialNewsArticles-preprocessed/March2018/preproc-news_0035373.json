A package of the FedEx courier delivery services company is pictured in this June 8, 2017 illustration photo. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso/Illustration The move follows the completion of a pilot program spanning 47 locations within Walmart stores across six states, FedEx Office said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO - A Walmart store is seen in Encinitas, California, U.S. on April 13, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Walmart-based FedEx Office offers packing, shipping and printing services. Customers can also direct their packages to be held at any of these locations for up to five business days using FedEx delivery service. Deutsche Post AGâ€™s ( DPWGn.DE ) DHL earlier this month said it was launching a delivery service for online retailers in eight U.S. cities, as the German logistics company takes a swipe at dominant players UPS ( UPS.N ) and FedEx. FedEx shares were trading marginally up in light premarket trading on Tuesday. Reporting by Sanjana Shivdas and Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Anil D'Silva",
