Major cities along the Interstate 95 corridor saw much less. Philadelphia International Airport recorded about 6 inches, while New York City's Central Park saw less than 3 inches. The storm made traveling treacherous. Thousands of flights across the region were canceled. Tens of thousands of people were left without power. Published 12 Hours Ago The Associated Press Julio Cortez | AP Vehicles travel northbound over a snow-covered Interstate 287 during a snowstorm, Wednesday, March 7, 2018, in Morristown, N.J. \nResidents in the Northeast dug out from as much as 2 feet of wet, heavy snow Thursday, while utilities dealt with downed trees and electric lines that snarled traffic and left hundreds of thousands without power after two strong nor'easters in less than a week — all with possibility of another storm in the wings. \nWith many schools closed for a second consecutive day Thursday, forecasters tracked the possibility of yet another late-season snowstorm to run up the coast early next week. Getty Images A man looks at a branch that fell from heavy snow and landed on his friend's truck on March 7, 2018 in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \n\"The strength of it and how close it comes to the coast will make all the difference. At this point it's too early to say,\" said Jim Nodchey, a National Weather Service meteorologist. \"We're just looking at a chance.\" \nSnow was still falling Thursday in southern Maine, where the storm was expected to move on by midday. \nMore than 800,000 customers were without power in the Northeast, including some who have been without electricity since last Friday's destructive nor'easter. Thousands of flights across the region were canceled, and traveling on the ground was treacherous. show chapters 8:23 AM ET Wed, 7 March 2018 | 01:21 \nThere were multiple storm-related delays on Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's commuter rail, light rail and bus lines, and authorities were investigating after a train with more than 100 passengers on board derailed in Wilmington, Massachusetts. Nobody was hurt. The low-speed derailment was under investigation to determine if it was weather related. \nIn New Hampshire, Interstate 95 in Portsmouth was closed in both directions because of downed power lines. \nAmtrak suspended service between New York City and Boston until at least 11 a.m. Thursday. New York City's Metro-North commuter railroad, which had suspended service on lines connecting the city to its northern suburbs and Connecticut because of downed trees, restored partial service Thursday. \nMembers of the Northeastern University women's basketball team pushed their bus back on course Thursday after it was stuck in the snow outside a practice facility in Philadelphia. The Huskies were in the city to compete in the 2018 CAA Women's Basketball Tournament. The team posted a video of the feat on its Twitter account. \nSteve Marchillo, a finance director at the University of Connecticut's Hartford branch, said he enjoyed the sight of heavily snow-laden trees on his way into work Thursday but they also made him nervous. \n\"It looks cool as long as they don't fall down on you and you don't lose power,\" he said. show chapters 12:09 PM ET Wed, 7 March 2018 | 01:40 \nMontville, New Jersey, got more than 26 inches from Wednesday's nor'easter. North Adams, Massachusetts, registered 24 inches, and Sloatsburg, New York, got 26 inches. \nMajor cities along the Interstate 95 corridor saw much less. Philadelphia International Airport recorded about 6 inches, while New York City's Central Park saw less than 3 inches. \nThe storm was not as severe as the nor'easter that toppled trees, flooded coastal communities and caused more than 2 million power outages from Virginia to Maine last Friday. \nIt still proved to be a headache for the tens of thousands of customers still in the dark from the earlier storm — and for the crews trying to restore power to them. \nMassachusetts was hardest hit by outages, with more than 345,000 without service Thursday and Republican Gov. Charlie Baker closing all non-essential state offices. Republican Maine Gov. Paul LePage also closed state offices and encouraged residents to stay off roads \"unless it is an absolute emergency.\" \nIn New Jersey, the state's major utilities reported more than 247,000 customers without power a day after the storm. \nIn North White Plains, New York, 10 people were taken to hospitals with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning after running a generator inside a home, police said. All were expected to survive. \nIn Manchester Township, New Jersey, police said a teacher was struck by lightning while holding an umbrella on bus duty outside a school. The woman felt a tingling sensation but didn't lose consciousness. She was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. Playing",
