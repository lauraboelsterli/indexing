People attend the opening ceremony of world's first public Bitcoin monument, placed at a roundabout connecting two roads at the city centre in Kranj, Slovenia, March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Borut Zivulovic Weighing three tonnes and with a diameter of about seven meters the circular metal sculpture was unveiled next to the courthouse in Kranj, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital Ljubljana.

Kranj has a lot of companies dealing with high technology,” mayor Bostjan Trilar told Reuters. The monument was paid for by two local firms that use blockchain technology, a software company 3fs and digital currency exchange Bitstamp. Reporting By Marja Novak; editing by John Stonestreet",
