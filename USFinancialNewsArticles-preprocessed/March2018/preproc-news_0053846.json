A bird flies past the logo of National Stock Exchange (NSE) installed on the facade of its building in Mumbai, India, February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo \nThe broader NSE Nifty closed down 0.69 percent at 10,113.70, but posted a weekly gain of 1.16 percent. \nThe benchmark BSE Sensex ended 0.62 percent lower at 32,968.68, but gained 1.14 percent this week. \nThe indexes posted a monthly loss of about 3.6 percent, their steepest drop for the month of March since 2015. \nIndian markets will remain closed on Thursday and Friday for public holidays.
