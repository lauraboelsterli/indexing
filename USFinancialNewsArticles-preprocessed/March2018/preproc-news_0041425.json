    "text": "CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cintas Corporation (Nasdaq: CTAS) today reported results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nRevenue for the third quarter was approximately $1.59 billion, an increase of 26.6% over last year’s third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.8%. The organic revenue growth rates for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segments were 6.5% and 10.0%, respectively.\nOperating income for the third quarter of $200 million increased 4.2% from last year’s third quarter operating income of $192 million. Operating income was reduced $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and $9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services, Inc. (G&K) acquisition. Operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was also reduced by a one-time cash payment to Cintas employees following the enactment of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) which was signed into legislation by the President on December 22, 2017. The one-time cash payment to employees amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million.\nScott D. Farmer, Cintas’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are pleased to report strong third quarter financial results. Each business unit contributed substantial revenue gains. Operating income, excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses and the one-time cash payment to employees, increased 24.0% over last year’s third quarter, resulting in an operating margin of 15.7%. We also made solid progress on two significant long-term investments. The first is the acquisition of G&K. We have now closed 60, or 95%, of redundant operations and have converted 65% of G&K locations to Cintas operating systems. The second is the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. We continue to convert more operations to the system, 79 so far, and the roll-out remains on schedule. We will be a stronger company with this new technology.”\nMr. Farmer added, “The U.S. government recently passed a new tax law that will make U.S. companies more competitive globally. This tax reform is beneficial to our company, our shareholders, and many of our customers. We are happy to have shared this benefit with our employees, whom we call partners, in the form of a one-time cash payment. Cintas has accomplished much, and our motivated and engaged partners are one of the most important ingredients of our success.”\nNet income from continuing operations for the third quarter of approximately $296 million increased 152.9% from last year’s third quarter. Earnings per diluted share (EPS) from continuing operations for the third quarter were $2.66 compared to $1.06 for last year’s third quarter. Fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 third quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.06 from transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Fiscal 2018 third quarter EPS also included a negative impact of $0.24 from the one-time cash payment to employees. However, fiscal 2018 third quarter EPS included a positive impact of $1.59 from benefits under the new Tax Act, largely due to a one-time revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe following table provides a comparison of fiscal 2018 EPS to the comparable periods of fiscal 2017:\nEarnings Per Share Results Three Months Ended February 28, February 28, Growth vs. 2018 2017 FY 2017 EPS - continuing operations $ 2.66\n$ 1.06 G&K transaction and integration expenses 0.06 0.06 One-time cash payment to employees 0.24 - Benefit of the Tax Act (1.59\n)\n- EPS after above items $ 1.37\n$ 1.12 22.3 % Nine Months Ended February 28, February 28, Growth vs. 2018 2017 FY 2017 EPS - continuing operations $ 5.35 $ 3.42 G&K transaction and integration expenses 0.16 0.10 One-time cash payment to employees 0.24 - Benefit of the Tax Act (1.59\n)\n- EPS after above items $ 4.16 $ 3.52 18.2 % Mr. Farmer concluded, “The benefits of the U.S. tax reform legislation in our third fiscal quarter were significant. However, these benefits make difficult the comparability of our full fiscal year results to last year. As a result, we are providing specific guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.645 billion. Please keep in mind that our fourth quarter marks the anniversary of the G&K acquisition. We expect fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations to increase and be in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. This assumes a fourth quarter tax rate of 24.0%. This EPS guidance excludes future G&K transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisition. However, in the fourth quarter, we expect G&K transaction and integration expenses to be incurred as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition, and we estimate that they will total $10 million to $15 million.”\nAbout Cintas\nCintas Corporation helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers’ image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe and looking their best.
