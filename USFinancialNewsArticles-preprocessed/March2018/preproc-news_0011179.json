    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - IGM Resins, a Dutch manufacturer of materials for coatings, inks and adhesives, has been put up for sale by its private equity owner in a potential 500 million euro ($614 million) deal, people close to the matter said.\nNew York-based Arsenal Capital Partners has authorized investment bank Moelis ( MC.N ) to organize the auction, which is expected to launch in the coming weeks, the sources said.\nArsenal was not available for comment. Moelis declined to comment.\nPeers as well as private equity groups will be targeted in the sale, the sources said.\nIGM Resins’ rivals include Advent-owned Allnex, France’s Arkema ( AKE.PA ) and Netherlands-based DSM ( DSMN.AS ). It was unclear whether any of them would bid for the company.\nIGM Resins was founded in 1999 as a one-man chemical company start-up.\nIt produces photoinitiators, monomers, oligomers and additives. Arsenal bought a majority stake in 2012.\nIn 2016, IGM bought a BASF ( BASFn.DE ) unit making photoinitiators, which are used in radiation-curing formulations in various industries.\nReporting by Ludwig Burger and Arno Schuetze; editing by Tom Balmforth\n ",
