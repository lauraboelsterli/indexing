Soccer Football - Premier League - Everton vs Brighton & Hove Albion - Goodison Park, Liverpool, Britain - March 10, 2018 Everton's Phil Jagielka gestures Action Images via Reuters/Craig Brough An own goal by Gaetan Bong and Turkish forward Cenk Tosun’s strike sealed the victory as Everton won their third straight game at Goodison Park. Skipper Jagielka was impressive on his return to the starting 11 from injury and alongside fellow centre-back Michael Keane formed a solid partnership that helped end Brighton’s five-game unbeaten league run. “They were a big team – we had to defend the box quite well but thankfully we did that from start to finish and from front to back,” he told the club’s website (www.evertonfc.com). “We got a bit of momentum during the game. We got the fans involved – putting Brighton under pressure, getting a lot of corners, having a few shots on target and winning tackles. This is what we, as players, must look to do in every single game. “Hopefully we can get a bit of momentum now. We need to finish the season off as strong as possible and put down a few markers for the start of next season.” Everton, who have climbed to ninth in the table, take on relegation-threatened Stoke City on Saturday.
