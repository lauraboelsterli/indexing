The S&P 500 rose 0.13 percent to 2,724.62 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.35 percent to 7,356.09.\nAmong bigger movers, shares in Target fell 5.6 percent after the big-box retailer reported lower-than-expected profit for the holiday quarter.\nQualcomm dropped more than 3 percent after a U.S. government national security panel said it identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Broadcom Ltd’s $117 billion bid for the chipmaker.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,701 to 1,098. On the Nasdaq, 1,692 issues rose and 1,144 fell.\n“There’s a big narrative saying I’m going to be risk neutral and so the markets are going to oscillate,” said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado.
