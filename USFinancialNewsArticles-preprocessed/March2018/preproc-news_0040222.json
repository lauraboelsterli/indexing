    "text": "CUPERTINO, Calif., March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Workspot, the leader in cloud-native VDI, today announced that Andre Leibovici, Barry Phillips and Harry Labana have joined the Workspot Advisory Board.\nClick to Tweet : .@Workspot is excited to welcome @andreleibovici @barryphillips07 @harrylabana to the Workspot Advisory Board! #VDI #Azure #DesktopCloud\nLeibovici is the field chief technology officer and vice president of solutions and alliances for Datrium. Phillips is the chief marketing officer of Maxta, former chief marketing officer at Panzura and former Citrix delivery center group vice president and general manager. Labana is the former vice president of management services and strategy for VMware and the former chief technology officer at Citrix.\nWith 50 years of collective experience in areas including cloud infrastructure services; end user computing; data synchronization; and Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) application delivery, they extend the advisory board's influence to the next level. Each member's vast experience will contribute significantly in shaping the solution, driving go-to-market strategies and developing new vertically focused customer and partner engagement strategies.\nAmitabh Sinha, CEO and co-founder of Workspot, said: \"We are excited to have Andre, Barry and Harry join the Workspot Advisory Board at a time when Workspot's Desktop Cloud is experiencing accelerated deployments of Windows 10 desktops and NVIDIA GPU-powered workstations on Microsoft Azure. These three members will add fresh and complementary perspectives to our business and will be invaluable to Workspot as we continue our high-growth trajectory.\"\nAndre Leibovici, Workspot Advisory Board Member, said: \"Being directly involved with end user computing since early days and having a critical eye towards deployment models, security and user experience, I have seen Desktop-as-a-Service solutions disappoint over the years, for various reasons. Over the last five years, I have witnessed Workspot pioneer a cloud-native and multi-tenant cloud desktop solution that ultimately eliminates cost and complexity while delivering exceptional user experience directly from Microsoft Azure and providing secure access to resources that still reside in corporate datacenters. With a low-friction cloud service and no-risk engagement model, Workspot has positioned itself for rapid growth.\"\nBarry Phillips, Workspot Advisory Board Member, said : \"Having worked closely with many AEC customers, I understand firsthand the business value of cross-site employee collaboration with CAD and BIM applications. Most AEC customers tried VDI as a solution to enable distributed employees to work as one project team but ran into performance and/or implementation issues. I joined the Workspot Board of Advisors for exactly this reason – Workspot has the performance required for the most demanding AEC applications but also the simplicity and economics that make it ideal for any firm.\"\nHarry Labana, Workspot Advisory Board Member, said : \"For over 20 years as a customer and vendor, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges of legacy VDI complexity that impede execution and add to deployment costs. I have learned that modern, cloud-native VDI can't be successful using existing architectures and service models that deliver slow time-to-value and continue to burden IT with escalating implementation costs. As a result, after false starts, the industry is witnessing new approaches to cloud-native VDI growing at 10 times the pace of traditional VDI solutions. From the very beginning, Workspot has focused on a cloud-native architecture and simplicity to reduce customer friction. Now, this is coupled with an industry-first delivery of cloud-based Windows 10 desktops via their no-risk customer engagement model that gets you up and running quickly and allows users to scale deployments using the power and performance of Microsoft Azure. I am excited to help the team in their next phase of growth.\"\nAbout Workspot\nWorkspot is an insanely simple, turnkey cloud service for securely delivering Windows 10 desktops, apps and workstations to any device from Microsoft Azure. We feature innovative, no-risk engagement contracts, free deployment services and flat rate subscription pricing – including Microsoft Azure infrastructure.
