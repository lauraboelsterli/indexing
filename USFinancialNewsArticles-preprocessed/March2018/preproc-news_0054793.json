Adjusted EBITDA is the financial metric utilized by management to analyze the performance of the Company as a whole and each of our reportable segments, respectively. This measure isolates the amount of income generated by our core operations after the incurrence of corporate, general and administrative expenses. Management also uses this measure to determine the contribution of our core operations to the funding of our corporate resources utilized to manage our operations and our non-operating expenses including debt service and acquisitions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of LMA fees, is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining compliance with certain covenants in our Credit Agreement.\nIn deriving this measure, the Company excludes from Adjusted EBITDA items not related to core operations and those that are non-cash including: depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gain or loss on the exchange or sale of any assets or stations, early extinguishment of debt, local marketing agreement fees, expenses relating to acquisitions, restructuring costs, reorganization items and non-cash impairments of assets.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA, although not a measure that is calculated in accordance with GAAP, is commonly employed by the investment community as a measure for determining the market value of a media company and comparing the operational and financial performance among media companies. Management has also observed that Adjusted EBITDA is routinely employed to evaluate and negotiate the potential purchase price for media companies and is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining compliance with certain covenants in our Credit Agreement. Given the relevance to our overall value, management believes that investors consider the metric to be extremely useful.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net (loss) income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the Company’s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be defined or calculated differently by other companies, and comparability may be limited.\nThe following tables reconcile net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Radio Station\nGroup Westwood One Corporate\nand Other Consolidated GAAP net (loss) income $ (296,452 ) $ 1,286 $ 89,050 $ (206,116 ) Income tax benefit — — (170,191 ) (170,191 ) Non-operating (income) expense, including net\ninterest expense (1 ) 130 23,350 23,479 LMA fees 2,747 — — 2,747 Depreciation and amortization 8,730 5,490 409 14,629 Stock-based compensation expense — — 191 191 Loss on sale of assets or stations 86 — — 86 Reorganization items, net — — 31,603 31,603 Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 335,909 — — 335,909 Acquisition-related and restructuring costs — 1,134 16,241 17,375 Franchise and state taxes — — 140 140 Adjusted EBITDA $ 51,019 $ 8,040 $ (9,207 ) $ 49,852\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2016 Radio Station\nGroup Westwood One Corporate\nand Other Consolidated GAAP net (loss) income $ (561,459 ) $ 1,801 $ 15,981 $ (543,677 ) Income tax expense — — (51,059 ) (51,059 ) Non-operating (income) expense, including net\ninterest expense — (104 ) 34,268 34,164 LMA fees 2,473 — — 2,473 Depreciation and amortization 13,290 5,521 433 19,244 Stock-based compensation expense — — 545 545 Loss (gain) on sale of assets or stations 1,462 — (2 ) 1,460 Impairment of intangible assets 603,149 — — 603,149 Acquisition-related and restructuring costs — (2,232 ) 812 (1,420 ) Franchise and state taxes — — 3 3 Gain on early extinguishment of debt — — (8,017 ) (8,017 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 58,915 $ 4,986 $ (7,036 ) $ 56,865\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Radio Station\nGroup Westwood One Corporate\nand Other Consolidated GAAP net (loss) income $ (178,410 ) $ 25,635 $ (53,790 ) $ (206,565 ) Income tax benefit — — (163,726 ) (163,726 ) Non-operating expense (income), including net\ninterest (income) expense (6 ) 537 126,648 127,179 LMA fees 10,884 — — 10,884 Depreciation and amortization 38,734 21,836 1,669 62,239 Stock-based compensation expense — — 1,614 1,614 (Gain) loss on sale of assets or stations (2,523 ) — 24 (2,499 ) Reorganization items, net — — 31,603 31,603 Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 335,909 — — 335,909 Acquisition-related and restructuring costs — 3,026 16,466 19,492 Franchise and state taxes — — 558 558 Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — 1,063 1,063 Adjusted EBITDA $ 204,588 $ 51,034 $ (37,871 ) $ 217,751\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Radio Station\nGroup Westwood One Corporate\nand Other Consolidated GAAP net loss $ (356,198 ) $ (11,071 ) $ (143,451 ) $ (510,720 ) Income tax benefit — — (26,154 ) (26,154 ) Non-operating expense, including net interest\nexpense 13 122 135,967 136,102 LMA fees 12,824 — — 12,824 Depreciation and amortization 54,071 31,178 2,018 87,267 Stock-based compensation expense — — 2,948 2,948 Gain on sale of assets or stations (95,667 ) — (28 ) (95,695 ) Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 603,149 1,816 — 604,965 Acquisition-related and restructuring costs — 939 878 1,817 Franchise and state taxes — — 530 530 Gain on early extinguishment of debt — — (8,017 ) (8,017 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 218,192 $ 22,984 $ (35,309 ) $ 205,867\nSource: Cumulus Media Inc.",
