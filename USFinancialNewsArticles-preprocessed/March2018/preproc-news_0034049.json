    "text": "HUNTLEY, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Life Spine, a medical device company that designs, develops, manufactures and markets products for the surgical treatment of spinal disorders, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given 510(k) marketing clearance to the PLATEAU-LO Insert and Rotate Spacer System.\n“PLATEAU-LO is my go-to spacer for micro-invasive lumbar interbody fusions. The oblique lordosis and vast array of footprints cater to the wide variety of patient anatomies I see in my practice. I also find that the bulleted tip allows for very simple insertion, and the insert and rotate feature allows for restoration of disc height. These features are essential for good patient outcomes,” said Rebecca Kuo, MD of Joliet, IL.\n“PLATEAU-LO is another great addition to our already robust interbody platform. By combining PLATEAU-LO with our AVATAR ® Percutaneous Screw System and the CENTRIC ® -T Pedicle-Based Retractor System it shows our keen interest in innovation around micro-invasive procedures and providing our customers with multiple options for optimal patient care,” said Mariusz Knap, Vice President of Marketing and Business Development for Life Spine.\nPLATEAU-LO is available in PEEK material and is offered in 7° and 12° lordosis and multiple footprints options.\nKey Features and Benefits of the system are:\nChamfered corners allow for ease of insertion and distraction Oblique lordosis to better match patient anatomies and pathologies Bullet tip simplifies insertion Large, open graft windows maximize visibility and bone graft containment Aggressive tooth pattern prevents graft migration\nAbout Life Spine\nLife Spine is dedicated to improving the quality of life for spinal patients by increasing procedural efficiency and efficacy through innovative design, uncompromising quality standards, and the most technologically advanced manufacturing platforms. Life Spine, which is privately held, is based in Huntley, Illinois.
