GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Trump fires Tillerson, a moderate; replaces him with hawkish spy chief Pompeo U.S. President Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday after a series of public rifts over policy on North Korea, Russia and Iran, replacing his chief diplomat with loyalist CIA Director Mike Pompeo. • Trump eyes tariffs on up to $60 billion Chinese goods; tech, telecoms, apparel targeted U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said on Tuesday. • China Jan-Feb factory output, investment stronger than expected China’s industrial output expanded faster than expected at the start of the year, suggesting the world’s second-biggest economy has sustained solid momentum despite a crackdown on polluting industries and a campaign to reduce risks in the financial system. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,395.50, down 0.3 percent from previous close. • The Indian rupee is likely to edge higher against the dollar as tame U.S. inflation data and the ouster of the U.S. Secretary of State weighed on demand for the greenback. • Indian government bonds are likely to edge higher tracking a fall in U.S. Treasury yields after U.S. retail inflation cooled in February, easing concerns over a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes this year. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.60 percent - 7.65 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street’s major indexes fell on Tuesday as the dismissal of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the possibility of additional U.S. import tariffs against China dragged down stocks across sectors. • Asian shares eased amid fears of rising U.S. protectionism as U.S. President Donald Trump fired his Secretary of State, regarded as a moderate in his administration, and eyes hefty tariffs on Chinese imports. • The U.S. yield curve flattened on Tuesday as longer-dated bonds fell on strong demand for 30-year securities at auction, and on earlier news that February consumer price data cooled, suggesting the anticipated pickup in inflation is likely to be gradual. • Oil prices edged up after posting two days of declines at the start of the week. • Gold prices were largely steady on a weaker dollar following U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s sudden dismissal and after consumer price data pointed towards a path of gradual hikes in U.S. interest rates.
