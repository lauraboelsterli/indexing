    "text": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Several Chinese firms have expressed interest in acquiring coal-fired plants Greece’s power utility Public Power Corp. (PPC) will divest to comply with an EU court ruling, the company’s chief executive said on Thursday.\nAthens has agreed with its foreign creditors that PPC, which is 51 percent state-owned, will sell plants equal to about 40 percent of its capacity after a European court ruled the utility had abused its dominant position in the coal market.\nAsked by reporters whether there were many Chinese investors interested in the plants, PPC’s Chief Executive Officer Manolis Panagiotakis said “quite a few”.\nIn a market test conducted by the European Commission’s directorate general for competition, fifteen investors have expressed interest in acquiring the plants.\nAthens is expected to pass relevant law by April in order for PPC to launch a tender by June.\n“We hope there are no obstacles and, indeed, we launch the tender in June,” Panagiotakis said.\nPPC has hired PwC and HSBC as consultants on the sale, he added.\nThe units that will be sold are Meliti I and the yet-to-be-built Meliti II in northern Greece along with another two units in the southern Greek town of Megalopolis.\nReporting by Angeliki Koutantou; Editing by Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
