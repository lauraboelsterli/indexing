    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The chairman of the British parliament’s foreign affairs committee said on Monday the nerve agent attack on a former Russian agent in southern England looked like state-sponsored attempted murder and he expected Moscow to be blamed.\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May delivers a speech about her vision for Brexit, at Mansion House in London, Britain, March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Brady/Pool Lawmaker Tom Tugendhat said the poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, looked “awfully like it was state-sponsored attempted murder”.\nPrime Minister Theresa May will chair a meeting of the country’s National Security Council later on Monday to discuss the incident.\n“We’re expecting the prime minister to make an announcement soon and frankly I would be surprised if she did not point the finger at the Kremlin,” Tugendhat told BBC radio.\nReporting by Michael Holden; editing by Guy Faulconbridge\n ",
