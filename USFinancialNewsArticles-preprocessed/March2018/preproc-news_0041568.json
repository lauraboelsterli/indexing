    "text": "56 COMMENTS The animosity in American society these days is disturbing. I know that U.S. history is littered with examples of factionalism, but I cannot recall a period during my own life when people felt such unmitigated anger at each other—when so much outrage seemed to be directed across party lines. The word “liberal” can summon up an outpouring of ire from one person, while the name “ Trump ” can throw another into a fit.\nAs a university dean and professor, I think it is my duty to encourage conversation, as opposed to vituperative name-calling. This is easier said than done. Yet I am pleased to report a recent positive experience. \nI hold monthly gatherings with students in my office. I call them Dean’s Teas, though little tea is drunk. My goal, as the group discusses a controversial issue or current event, is to allow different points of view to emerge. This isn’t always successful. Sometimes everyone present is of the same mind, and we end up reinforcing each other’s opinions. Sometimes an unpleasant stalemate emerges. Last month, however, we had a discussion that I think epitomized civil discourse across different points of view.\nIt began with an innocuous topic. Since our local football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, had recently won the Super Bowl, I proposed discussing the subsequent fanfare: both the celebration directly after the game and the parade held a few days later. Seven students offered stories of what they did and saw after the victory. We all initially agreed that it was a glorious time for our city, with goodwill emanating from everyone.\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images We were basking in civic pride when a latecomer to the group mentioned his sense that an alcohol-fueled crowd, no matter how happy, is a pretty scary thing. He noted that the Super Bowl celebrations eventually devolved into chaos and a certain amount of violence. This observation changed the tenor of the discussion. The students now acknowledged that their experience after the game was not absolutely positive. Several said they eventually went home to avoid the unruly crowds. One admitted she had felt afraid. Others reported seeing destruction and police who were helpless in the face of a deluge of drunken people.\nFrom there we moved into a discussion of groupthink, which we admitted had been our initial tendency in discussing the Eagles’ victory. This led to a conversation about party politics. It turned out there were a range of viewpoints represented: an engineering student who backed President Trump as a voice for the unheard, a political-science major who had left the Republican Party and become an ardent Democrat after a tour of duty with the U.S. Marines in Iraq, a Republican business student who was focused on economic policy, an education major and strong Christian whose politics were unclear, a digital-media student with libertarian views, a biology major whose family had voted for Mr. Trump but who had opposed him because of his crudeness and sexism, a psychology major who missed President Obama and wished he had done more. (These were my impressions; I don’t know if the students would say I am characterizing them correctly.)\nAlthough the students had differing perspectives, they felt free to speak their minds with openness and respect toward one another. Perhaps because we had just revised our view of a noncontroversial subject, the Super Bowl celebration, we could see how serious issues might have multiple angles as well. At the end, we all agreed that though we were opposed to some of the opinions voiced in the group, we understood better where they were coming from and didn’t feel the welling of anger that we might have otherwise felt.\nThis strikes me as a significant breakthrough. The most destructive aspect of our current politics, I am convinced, is not the position that the other side holds but the anger that this generates in those with different views. That anger is corrosive and dehumanizing. It is the force tearing America apart. \nThe great 19th-century philosopher and psychologist William James eloquently addressed this problem in “The Gospel of Relaxation,” a lecture published in 1899: “There is . . . no better known or more generally useful precept in the moral training of youth, or in one’s personal self-discipline, than that which bids us pay primary attention to what we do and express, and not to care too much for what we feel.” A few lines later he added: “In order to feel kindly toward a person to whom we have been inimical, the only way is more or less deliberately to smile, to make sympathetic inquiries, and to force ourselves to say genial things. One hearty laugh together will bring enemies into a closer communion of heart than hours spent on both sides in inward wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable feeling.”\nThis is not an easy directive to follow when we are convinced that the other side is profoundly wrong. But moving away from anger and recognizing the multifaceted nature of how people act and express themselves, as James suggests, can provide an opening for a “hearty laugh”—and from there, perhaps, sympathy and even compromise. \nMs. Cohen is a dean and English professor at Drexel University.",
