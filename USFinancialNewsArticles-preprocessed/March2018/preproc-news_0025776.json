    "text": "NEW YORK, WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of United Community Bancorp (\"UCBA\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: UCBA) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Civista Bancshares, Inc. (\"CIVB\") (NASDAQ: CIVB). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will be entitled to receive $2.54 in cash and 1.027 shares of CIVB for each share of UCBA they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether UCBA's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, the acquisition is a deliberate and financially compelling deal that offers CIVB numerous benefits, including:\nImproved footprint in the 5 largest marketplaces in Ohio; Entrance into the Cincinnati Metropolitan Services Area with access to UCBA's five area branches; and Increased scale and growth acceleration.\nFinally, the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings per share in 2018.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether UCBA's shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects.
