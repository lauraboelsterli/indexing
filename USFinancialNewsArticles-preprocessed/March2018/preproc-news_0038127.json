    "text": "19 COMMENTS Message to Hillary Clinton : Over the last 10 years of marriage, this white woman has convinced her husband, a Harvard Law School-educated former Al Gore and John Kerry supporter, to vote Republican (“ Hillary Clinton Leans Out ,” Review & Outlook and Jason Willick’s op-ed “ What Happened to the Common Man? ,” both March 14). It wasn’t pressure that did it, but the soundness of the ideas and policies we’ve spent the last decade discussing. I’d like to vote for a woman presidential candidate, but I certainly will never put my support behind any woman candidate with such a prejudiced and condescending attitude toward those who disagree with her. Learn some respect, lady. President Trump, you need to learn some, too.\nAnne Proano\nCleveland\nI’m a married white woman who didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton because I don’t identify with enabling wives who stand behind their philandering husbands as she did. To say that women in this day and age would vote due to “ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son . . . believes you should” is egregiously insulting to all women.\nAndrea Gaito, M.D.\nBasking Ridge, N.J.\nMrs. Clinton attributes her loss to browbeaten wives, James Comey, deplorables, phases of the moon and the entrails of albino prairie dogs—everything but her own campaign conduct and leftist agenda. Look in the mirror, Hillary. You lost. Get over it.\nSheila M. Barrett\nElk Grove Village, Ill.",
