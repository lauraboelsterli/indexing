    "text": "Q4 2017 Revenue Increases 30%, Drives 107% Growth in Adjusted EBITDA 1\nTORONTO, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Spin Master Corp. (\"Spin Master\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: TOY; www.spinmaster.com ), a leading global children's entertainment company, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The Company's full Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three month period and the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 are available on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ) and posted on the Company's web site at www.spinmaster.com/financial-info.php .\n\"Our excellent performance in the fourth quarter capped off another year of significant revenue and profitability growth for Spin Master\" said Anton Rabie, Spin Master's Chairman and Co-CEO. \"Our Spin Master team performed exceptionally well globally and our investments in talent are driving positive results. We continue to be active on the acquisition front. In Q4 we acquired the Perplexus brand, an innovative game we have distributed since 2013. On March 5 th , we agreed to acquire Gund, a plush toy business that is best known for its iconic teddy bears. Gund has a 120-year history as a market leader and toy industry pioneer widely known for its high quality and innovative design. We are excited about our expansion into the infant toy and specialty gift categories.\"\nQ4 2017 Financial Highlights as compared to the same period in 2016 2\nRevenue of US$440.9 million increased 30.3% from US$338.4 million In Constant Currency 1 terms, revenue increased by 27.6% Gross Product Sales 1 increased 28.6% to US$483.9 million, compared to US$376.2 million, driven by sales of Hatchimals, Luvabella, and Cardinal games, which more than offset declines in Air Hogs and Zoomer Gross Product Sales 1 increased just under 17% in North America, 34% in Europe and 94% in the Rest of World. International Gross Product Sales 1 on a combined basis were 40.8% of total Gross Product Sales 2 , increasing from 34.8% in 2016 Other Revenue, which primarily reflects merchandising royalty and television distribution income from products marketed by third parties using Spin Master's owned intellectual property, as well as app revenue from Toca Boca and Sago Mini, was US$30.0 million compared to US$12.3 million Gross profit increased 33.1% to US$228.9 million, representing 51.9% of revenue, compared with US$172.0 million, or 50.8% of revenue Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\"), excluding share-based compensation expenses associated with equity participation agreements and the grants of restricted share units to employees at the initial public offering, represented 44.9% of revenue compared to 46.6%. SG&A declined as a percentage of revenue, due to lower marketing and product development costs, offset by higher selling and warehousing and distribution costs Net income was US$20.0 million, or US$0.21 per share, compared with US$2.7 million, or US$0.03 per share Adjusted Net Income 1 was US$25.5 million, or US$0.25 per share, compared to US$9.3 million, or US$0.09 per share Adjusted EBITDA 1 was US$47.3 million compared with US$22.9 million in 2016; Adjusted EBITDA Margin 1 increased to 10.7% compared to 6.8%, reflecting the increase in gross profit and lower SG&A Free Cash Flow 1 was US$18.4 million compared to US$(3.9) million On November 30, 2017 the Company acquired certain assets related to the Perplexus brand for approximately $9 million. Spin Master has distributed Perplexus since 2013. Spin Master will now own the global intellectual property rights to the Perplexus game portfolio. Perplexus is included in the Activities, Games and Puzzles and Fun Furniture business segment.\n\"We are very pleased with our execution in 2017 against Spin Master's four growth strategies,\" said Ben Gadbois, Spin Master's President & COO. \"Anchored by our global, collaborative innovation capabilities and the discipline of our 36 month brand innovation pipeline, we delivered breakthrough, category-defining products with global appeal such as Hatchimals Surprise, Soggy Doggy and Luvabella. We are seeing the results of our efforts to increase sales in existing and new markets. International sales continued to grow and our new direct markets in Australia, China and Central and Eastern Europe, exceeded our expectations. \"\n\"In 2017 we continued to expand and develop our capabilities in the entertainment and content area,\" said Ronnen Harary, Spin Master's Co-CEO. \"This drove strong revenue growth as well as growth in our licensing and merchandising revenue. We have continued to build our entertainment team and are now poised to further develop our core franchises including PAW Patrol and Rusty Rivets as well as introduce exciting new content in 2018 and 2019, including Abby Hatcher: Fuzzly Catcher and the relaunch of Bakugan.\"\nQ4 2017 Gross Product Sales 1 by Business Segment (US$ millions)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\n% Change\nActivities, Games & Puzzles and Fun Furniture\n$131.5\n$109.5\n20.0\n%\nRemote Control and Interactive Characters\n$198.7\n$92.6\n114.7\n%\nBoys Action and High-Tech Construction\n$36.7\n$34.8\n5.6\n%\nPre-School and Girls\n$102.4\n$125.1\n(18.2)\n%\nOutdoor\n$14.6\n$14.2\n2.7\n%\nGross Product Sales 1\n$483.9\n$376.2\n28.6\n%\nOther Revenue\n$30.0\n$12.3\n144.6\n%\nSales Allowances 1\n$73.0\n$50.1\n45.8\n%\nRevenue\n$440.9\n$338.4\n30.3\n%\nQ4 2017 Business Segment Gross Product Sales 1 as compared to the same period in 2016\nGross Product Sales 1 in the Activities, Games & Puzzles and Fun Furniture segment increased 20% in Q4, primarily driven by sales of the Cool Maker branded products, Dr. Dreadful, the games portfolio, which includes Cardinal and Marbles, and Etch A Sketch, offset by decreases in Marshmallow. Gross Product Sales 1 in the Remote Control and Interactive Characters segment increased 114.7% in Q4, primarily due to sales of Hatchimals, Hatchimals Colleggtibles and Luvabella, offsetting a decline in Air Hogs and Zoomer. Gross Product Sales 1 in the Boys Action and High-Tech Construction segment increased 5.6% in Q4, primarily due an increase in sales of Tech Deck as well as Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean licensed products, offset by decreased sales of licensed products associated with the 2016 movie properties Angry Birds and Secret Life of Pets. Gross Product Sales 1 in the Pre-School and Girls segment decreased 18.2% in Q4, with decreases in Brightlings, Chubby Puppies, Power Puff Girls licensed products and PAW Patrol. The decrease in PAW Patrol in Q4 was primarily related to timing due to a revenue shift from Q4 2017 to Q1 2018. Gross Product Sales 1 in the Outdoor segment increased 2.7% in Q4, driven by products under the Swimways, Kelysius and Coop brands.\n2017 Full Year Results as compared to the same period in 2016\nRevenue of US$1,551.3 million increased 34.4% from US$1,154.5 million In Constant Currency 1 terms, revenue increased by 33.7% Gross Product Sales 1 increased 32.1% to US$1,657.0 million, compared to US$1,254.6 million, driven by sales of Hatchimals, PAW Patrol, Luvabella, and the games portfolio, which included Cardinal and Marbles, offsetting declines in Zoomer, Air Hogs, and Secret Life of Pets and Angry Birds licensed products Gross Product Sales 1 increased 27.8% in North America, 35.7% in Europe and 51.5% in the Rest of World.

Spin Master is best known for award-winning brands including Zoomer®, Bakugan®, Erector® by Meccano®, Hatchimals®, Air Hogs® and PAW Patrol®.

Non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA (i.e., net earnings before borrowing costs, taxes and depreciation and amortization) excluding one time or other non-recurring items that do not necessarily reflect the Company's underlying financial performance, including share based compensation expenses, foreign exchange gains or losses, restructuring costs, public offering costs and write downs, among other items. Adjusted EBITDA is used internally as the key benchmark for incentive compensation and by management as a measure of the Company's profitability.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA Margin to evaluate the Company's performance compared to internal targets and to benchmark its performance against key competitors.\nAdjusted Net Income is calculated as net income excluding one time or other items that do not necessarily reflect the Company's underlying financial performance including foreign exchange gains or losses, restructuring costs, the accounting effect of the phantom equity expense and write downs, among other items and the corresponding impact these items have on income tax expense. Management uses Adjusted Net Income to understand the underlying financial performance of the business on a consistent basis over time.\nConstant Currency represents Revenue and Gross Product Sales results that are presented excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The current period and prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the US dollar are translated using consistent exchange rates, rather than using the actual exchange rate in effect during the respective periods. The difference between the current period and prior period results using the consistent exchange rates reflects the changes in the underlying performance results, excluding the impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nFree Cash Flow is calculated as cash from operations before changes in working capital less capital expenditures plus any cash used in brand or business acquisitions. Capital expenditures include expenditures on assets such as property, plant, equipment (primarily expenditures of tooling) and the production of television properties. Management uses the Free Cash Flow metric to analyze the cash flow being generated by the Company's business.\nGross Product Sales represent sales of the Company's products to customers, excluding the impact of marketing, incentive and Sales Allowance adjustments. Changes in Gross Product Sales are discussed because, while Spin Master records the details of such Sales Allowances (in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale in order to calculate revenue, such Sales Allowances are generally not associated with individual products, making revenue less meaningful when comparing its product category and geographical segment results to highlight trends in Spin Master's business.\nSales Allowances represent marketing and sales credits requested by customers relating to factors such as co-operative advertising, contractual discounts, negotiated discounts, customer audits, volume rebates, defective products, and costs incurred by customers to sell the Company's products and are booked as a reduction to Gross Product Sales. Management uses Sales Allowances to identify and compare the cost of doing business with individual retailers, different geographic markets and amongst various distribution channels.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Free Cash Flow and Gross Product Sales are important supplemental measures of operating performance and highlight trends in the core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Free Cash Flow, Gross Product Sales and Sales Allowances allow for assessment of the Company's operating performance and financial condition on a basis that is more consistent and comparable between reporting periods. The Company believes that lenders, securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use these non-IFRS financial measures in the evaluation of issuers.\nThe following tables presents a reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, and Cash from (used in) Operations to Free Cash Flow for the three month period and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
