SAIC’s performance reflects the fundamental execution of our business strategy for sustained profitable growth,\" said SAIC CEO Tony Moraco. “Strategic investments in our markets and capabilities are driving growth as we remain focused on improving our profitability and effectively deploying capital to enhance shareholder value in fiscal year 2019.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2018: Summary Operating Results\nThree Months Ended Year Ended February 2,\n2018\nPercent\nchange\nFebruary 3,\n2017\nFebruary 2,\n2018\nPercent\nchange\nFebruary 3,\n2017\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues $ 1,128 10 % $ 1,024 $ 4,454 — % $ 4,442 Operating income 62 5 % 59 256 (3 )% 263 Operating income as a percentage of revenues 5.5 % -30 bps 5.8 % 5.7 % -20 bps 5.9 % Adjusted operating income (1) 72 22 % 59 269 (1 )% 273 Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues 6.4 % 60 bps 5.8 % 6.0 % -10 bps 6.1 % Net income 51 46 % 35 179 25 % 143 EBITDA (1) 74 4 % 71 301 (4 )% 314 EBITDA as a percentage of revenues 6.6 % -30 bps 6.9 % 6.8 % -30 bps 7.1 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) 83 17 % 71 313 (3 )% 322 Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues 7.4 % 50 bps 6.9 % 7.0 % -20 bps 7.2 % Diluted earnings per share $ 1.16 51 % $ 0.77 $ 4.02 29 % $ 3.12 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 84 35 % $ 62 $ 217 (21 )% $ 273 Free cash flow (1) $ 77 33 % $ 58 $ 195 (24 )% $ 258 (1) Non-GAAP measure, see Schedule 5 for information about this measure.\nRevenues for the quarter increased $104 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to revenue on new contracts supporting NASA, the U.S. Army, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ($60 million) and increased orders within our supply chain portfolio ($53 million). The Company’s internal revenue growth (1) for the fourth quarter was 10.3%, the highest quarterly growth since the Company's inception.\nRevenues for the fiscal year increased $12 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to revenue on new contracts supporting NASA, the U.S. Army, and the EPA ($156 million), increased orders within our supply chain portfolio ($56 million) and higher revenue on platform integration programs ($31 million). These increases were partially offset by one additional week in the prior year ($88 million) and completion of contracts and other net decreases across our portfolio ($143 million), including the loss of an IT integration contract supporting the DHS ($46 million). The Company’s internal revenue growth (1) for the fiscal year was 2.5%, the highest annual growth since the Company’s inception.\nOperating income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 5.5% for the three months ended February 2, 2018 as compared to 5.8% in the comparable prior year period primarily due to lower net favorable changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method and restructuring costs incurred in the current quarter. These decreases were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs as we continue to drive efficiencies in our operating structure.\nOperating income for the fiscal year decreased $7 million to 5.7% of revenues, down from 5.9% of revenues in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower net favorable changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method and restructuring costs in fiscal 2018. Lower net favorable changes in estimates were largely driven by investments and increased costs on platform integration programs supporting the U.S. Marine Corps combined with prior year write-ups on certain programs supporting federal civilian agencies. These decreases were partially offset by lower SG&A costs.\nNet income for the quarter increased $16 million from the comparable prior year period primarily as the result of lower income tax expense due to the effect of the federal corporate tax rate change ($17 million) and higher operating income.\nNet income for the fiscal year increased $36 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower income tax expense as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ($22 million), a one-time benefit from the effect of the federal corporate tax rate change ($17 million) and lower interest expense. These increases were partially offset by lower operating income.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) as a percentage of revenues for the quarter was 7.4%, compared to 6.9% for the prior year quarter due to lower SG&A costs as we continue to drive efficiencies across our operating structure, offset by lower net favorable changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal year decreased to 7.0% of revenues, compared to 7.2% in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower net favorable changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of- completion method. These drivers were partially offset by lower SG&A costs in the current year.\nDiluted earnings per share was $1.16 for the quarter. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter was 43.8 million shares. Diluted earnings per share was $4.02 for the year. Diluted earnings per share for the year was positively impacted by the accounting change related to ASU 2016-09 by $0.49. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the year was 44.5 million shares.\n(1) Non-GAAP measure, see Schedule 5 for information about this measure.\nCash Generation and Capital Deployment\nTotal cash flows provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter were $84 million. The $22 million increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a net reduction in working capital investments in Marine Corps platform integration and IT services programs ($27 million) and lower payments for income taxes ($8 million), partially offset by delayed collections on our supply chain portfolio.\nTotal cash flows provided by operating activities for the year were $217 million, a decrease from the prior year, primarily due to the timing of customer collections ($125 million), partially offset by an extra week of payroll in the prior year period ($30 million), a net reduction in working capital investments in Marine Corps platform integration and IT services programs ($18 million) and excess tax benefits for stock based compensation in the current year ($22 million).\nDuring the quarter SAIC deployed $58 million of capital, consisting of $36 million in plan share repurchases (478 thousand) under SAIC’s previously announced share repurchase program, $14 million in cash dividends and an $8 million term loan repayment. For the year, cash dividends were $54 million, plan share repurchases totaled $150 million (approximately 2.0 million shares) and we made $25 million of term loan repayments. Share repurchases since the inception of the program in 2013 were $499 million (approximately 9.1 million shares).\nQuarterly Dividend Declared\nSubsequent to fiscal year-end, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.31 per share of the Company’s common stock payable on April 27, 2018 to stockholders of record on April 13, 2018. SAIC intends to continue paying dividends on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.\nNew Business Awards\nNet bookings for the quarter were approximately $0.6 billion, which reflects a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.5. Net bookings for the year were approximately $6.7 billion, which reflects a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.5. SAIC’s estimated backlog of signed business orders at the end of fiscal 2018 was approximately $10.2 billion of which $2.0 billion was funded.\nSAIC was awarded the following contracts during the quarter:\nNotable Protect Awards (maintaining our existing contract base):\nThe Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO CBD): The Department of Defense awarded SAIC a prime position on the $8.27 billion JPEO CBD multiple-award, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity Joint Enterprise-Research, Development, Acquisition, Production and Procurement (JE RDAP) contract.

SAIC segregates backlog into two categories, funded backlog and negotiated unfunded backlog. Funded backlog for contracts with government agencies primarily represents contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts, and does not include the unfunded portion of contracts where funding is incrementally appropriated or authorized by the U.S. government and other customers even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years. Funded backlog for contracts with non-government agencies represents the estimated value of contracts which may cover multiple future years under which SAIC is obligated to perform, less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. Negotiated unfunded backlog represents the estimated future revenues to be earned from negotiated contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or authorized, and unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential task orders expected to be awarded under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) schedules or other master agreement contract vehicles.\nSchedule 5:\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(Unaudited)\nThis schedule describes the non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating our financial information, they should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations, definitions, and how we believe these measures are useful to management and investors are provided below. Other companies may define similar measures differently. Internal Revenue Growth\nThree Months\nEnded\nYear Ended February 2, 2018 (in millions) Prior year period's revenues, as reported (1) $ 1,024 $ 4,442 Prior year period's revenues performed by former Parent (1 ) (9 ) Estimated impact of 53rd week — (88 ) Revenues of acquired business for the pre-acquisition prior year period — — Prior year period's revenues, as adjusted (1) 1,023 4,345 Current year period's revenues, as reported 1,128 4,454 Internal revenue growth (2) $ 105 $ 109 Internal revenue growth percentage 10.3 % 2.5 % We utilize internal revenue growth (or internal revenue contraction if negative) to evaluate revenue growth after the completion of acquisitions and other adjustments identified as impacting year over year comparability. Internal revenue growth is calculated by comparing our reported revenues for the current year to the reported revenues for the prior year comparable period adjusted to include any pre-acquisition historical revenues of acquired businesses. We adjust current and prior year revenue to exclude the impact of revenue performed by our former parent company, Leidos Holdings, Inc. (“former Parent”) since revenues on pre-separation joint work are recorded equal to cost and are expected to decline over time. For fiscal 2017, a 53-week fiscal year, we have also adjusted revenue to exclude the estimated impact of the additional week in order to facilitate comparison to the current year period, which is a 52-week fiscal year. We estimate the revenue impact of the additional week by dividing first quarter fiscal 2017 revenues by the number of days in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and multiplying that amount by the number of additional days in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We believe that adjusting fiscal 2017 revenues to reflect the impact of the additional week improves comparability since differences in the number of days generally have a direct impact on the amount of revenues earned in our business during the respective periods. We believe internal revenue growth provides management and investors with useful information in assessing trends on how successful the Company has been at growing revenues of our base business and the businesses that we acquire.\n(1) Fiscal 2017 amounts reflect the impact from an immaterial restatement, see Schedule 6 for information.\n(2) Non-GAAP measure, see above for definition.\nSchedule 5 (continued):\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income\nThree Months Ended Year Ended February 2,\n2018\nFebruary 3,\n2017 (1)\nFebruary 2,\n2018\nFebruary 3,\n2017 (1)\n(in millions) Net income $ 51 $ 35 $ 179 $ 143 Interest expense 12 11 44 52 Interest income (1 ) — (1 ) — Provision for income taxes — 14 35 69 Depreciation and amortization 12 11 44 50 EBITDA (2) $ 74 $ 71 $ 301 $ 314 EBITDA as a percentage of revenues 6.6 % 6.9 % 6.8 % 7.1 % Restructuring costs 10 — 13 — Acquisition and integration costs — — — 10 Depreciation included in restructuring costs and acquisition and integration costs (1 ) — (1 ) (2 ) Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 83 $ 71 $ 313 $ 322 Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues 7.4 % 6.9 % 7.0 % 7.2 % Operating income $ 62 $ 59 $ 256 $ 263 Operating income as a percentage of revenues 5.5 % 5.8 % 5.7 % 5.9 % Restructuring costs 10 — 13 — Acquisition and integration costs — — — 10 Adjusted operating income (2) $ 72 $ 59 $ 269 $ 273 Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues 6.4 % 5.8 % 6.0 % 6.1 % EBITDA is a performance measure that is calculated by taking net income and excluding interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income are performance measures that exclude restructuring and acquisition and integration costs that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. The restructuring costs excluded relate to the Company's plan to restructure certain aspects of its operations. This is the only significant restructuring since we began operating as an independent company over four years ago. The acquisition and integration costs relate to the Company’s significant acquisition of Scitor. We believe that these performance measures provide management and investors with useful information in assessing trends in our ongoing operating performance and may provide greater visibility in understanding the long-term financial performance of the Company.\n(1) Fiscal 2017 amounts reflect the impact from an immaterial restatement, see Schedule 6 for information.\n(2) Non-GAAP measure, see above for definition.\nSchedule 5 (continued):\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nFree Cash Flow\nThree Months Ended Year Ended February 2,\n2018\nFebruary 3,\n2017\nFebruary 2,\n2018\nFebruary 3,\n2017\n(in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 84 $ 62 $ 217 $ 273 Expenditures for property, plant, and equipment (7 ) (4 ) (22 ) (15 ) Free cash flow (1) $ 77 $ 58 $ 195 $ 258 Free cash flow is calculated by taking cash flows provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant, and equipment. We believe that free cash flow provides management and investors with useful information in assessing trends in our cash flows and in comparing them to other peer companies, many of whom present a similar non-GAAP liquidity measure. This measure should not be considered as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes.\n(1) Non-GAAP measure, see above for definition.\nSchedule 6:\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nCORRECTION OF FISCAL 2017 REVENUES\n(Unaudited)\nSubsequent to the issuance of the Company’s financial statements for the third quarter ended November 3, 2017, management determined that a portion of the revenues recognized on a contract with multi-customer funding sources had not been contractually earned. As a result, the Company's revenues for fiscal 2017 were overstated.
