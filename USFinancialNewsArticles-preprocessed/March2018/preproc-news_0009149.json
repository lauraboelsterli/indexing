    "text": "March 5, 2018 / 5:33 AM / in 6 hours UK February car sales fall 2.5 percent - preliminary industry data Reuters Staff 1   British new car registrations fell by 2.5 percent in February from a year earlier, continuing a downward trend, according to preliminary data released by an industry body on Monday FILE PHOTO: Vauxhall cars are seen for sale at a car show room near Vauxhall's plant in Luton, Britain, March 6, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo - RC141D841000 The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) will release the final registration numbers at 0900 GMT. The dip follows January data showing an even larger year-on-year fall of about 6 percent. The SMMT said the January decline was partly attributable to consumers being deterred from buying diesel models that politicians have targeted because of concerns over air quality.
