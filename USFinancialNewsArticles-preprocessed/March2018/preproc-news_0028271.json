FILE PHOTO: Builders construct modular Space4 homes on a Persimmon development in Coventry, February 22, 2017. Picture taken February 22, 2017. REUTERS/Darren Staples /File Photo Devlin will step down as chairman of pub operator Marston’s ( MARS.L ) and as the senior independent director of the Football Association on May 1 and start as Persimmon chairman on June 1. He is also chairman designate of bookmaker William Hill ( WMH.L ). In December Persimmon’s then chairman Nicholas Wrigley and the chairman of the company’s remuneration committee Jonathan Davie quit, recognising their mistake in not putting a cap on the incentive plan. That scheme has since been reined in but originally could have seen the firm’s top management, including Chief Executive Jeff Fairburn, make a profit of more than 200 million pounds on share options.
