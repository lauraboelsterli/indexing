    "text": "MONTREAL (Reuters) - Air Canada said its airport systems, check-in and customer call centres were back online on Monday afternoon, after a network-wide computer outage led to flight delays and affected its operations, including booking and plane departures.\nFILE PHOTO - An Air Canada Boeing 777 is refuelled at Sydney airport after being given the all clear to resume its journey to Vancouver July 28, 2011. REUTERS/Tim Wimborne “We’re expecting some flight delays but we’re getting everyone on their way,” the carrier said in a statement.\nIt is not yet clear what caused the outage.\nEarlier, Air Canada said in a statement its technology teams were working to identify and repair the issue, and it was also implementing temporary measures to maintain a limited operation.\n“Today’s computer issues have had a wide impact on our customers and we apologize for any inconvenience,” Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines at Air Canada, said in the statement.\nCalgary International Airport said on Twitter that Canada’s largest carrier “is experiencing a network outage nationwide, and departing passengers are being checked in manually, which is causing a bit of congestion in the terminal.”\nVancouver International Airport said in a statement that the outage was “causing delays.”\nReporting By Allison Lampert; editing by Grant McCool and Susan Thomas\n ",
