    "text": "TORONTO, March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bloom U.S Income & Growth Fund (TSX:BUA.UN) (the Fund) announces the following distributions:\nRecord Date Payment Date Distribution per unit\nClass A Class U April 30, 2018 May 15, 2018 $0.05 US$0.05 May 31, 2018 June 15, 2018 $0.05 US$0.05 June 29, 2018 July 16, 2018 $0.05 US$0.05 July 31, 2018 August 15, 2018 $0.05 US$0.05 August 31, 2018 September 17, 2018 $0.05 US$0.05 September 28, 2018 October 15, 2018 $0.05 US$0.05 Since the Fund’s inception in March 2013, the Fund has paid cash distributions of C$2.92 per Class A Unit and US$2.92 per Class U Unit.\nIn addition, the Fund announces the removal, effective April 1, 2018, of the service fee portion of the management fee paid by the Fund. The service fee is 0.4% of net asset value per annum. The Fund is making this change in recognition of an industry trend, exhibited by the actions of fund managers when launching new funds, by the input of investment advisors and by comments from securities regulators, away from the historical practice of paying service fees. The removal of the service fee will reduce the management fee paid and will thereby positively impact the Fund’s management expense ratio.\nClass A unitholders are reminded that the Fund has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) providing Class A unitholders with the ability to automatically reinvest their distributions and benefit from the compound growth from this reinvestment. Please contact your Investment Advisor or financial institution to enrol in this DRIP.\nFor further information please contact Unitholder Information at 416-861-9941 or 1-855-BLOOM18 or visit www.bloomfunds.ca\nCommissions, management fees and other expenses may all be associated with investment funds. Please read the Fund’s publicly filed documents which are available from SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Investment funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\nSource:Bloom U.S. Income & Growth Fund",
