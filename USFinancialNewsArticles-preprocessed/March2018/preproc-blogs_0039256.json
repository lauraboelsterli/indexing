Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with candidates who participated in the last presidential election, at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia March 19, 2018. Yuri Kadobnov/POOL via Reuters Putin, in an address to the nation after his victory in an election last Sunday was confirmed, said though it would be irresponsible to promise that all shortcomings would be fixed immediately. He said there was a role in Russia for debate about the authoritiesâ€™ actions, but there was no place for irresponsible populism by Kremlin opponents.
