Citigroup Inc. chief Michael Corbat’s pay jumped 48%, to $23 million. James Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co., shown here, was paid $29.5 million in 2017, just a hair shy of his high of $30 million in 2007. \nBy Telis Demos \nThe average banker bonus in New York City was $184,220 last year, the biggest annual haul for Wall Street employees since before the financial crisis. \nThose bonuses, which totaled $31.7 billion, up 17% from 2016, tracks with a broader rebound for bank stocks last year, boosted by the prospects of rising interest rates, faster growth and deregulation. (The bonuses tracked here don’t include stock options or other forms of deferred pay, which often make up the bulk of Wall Street’s bigger bonuses.) \nThe jump, the largest in percentage terms since 2013, continues a long rebound for New York City securities-industry bonuses from their postcrisis nadir in 2008, when they averaged just over $100,000, according to the annual report by the Office of the New York State Comptroller. Last year’s average payout was just shy of the high of $191,360 in 2006. \nFederal efforts to rein in pay by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies have been dialed back under President Donald Trump, whose appointees have sought to take a lighter touch on banking regulation. \nAnd: Valeant CEO compensation drops, was 138 times typical worker’s pay in 2017 \nAnother factor driving bonuses may be Wall Street learning to squeeze more from a smaller number of workers through the use of technology. Employment in the securities industry JPM, +0.53% GS, -0.05% MS, +0.22% C, +0.32% in New York was 176,900 last year, down slightly from 2016. \nStill, roughly one out of 10 jobs in New York City is directly or indirectly related to Wall Street, said Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.",
