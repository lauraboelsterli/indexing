    "text": "ATLANTA, March 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kobiton , the mobile application testing company, has appointed Frank Moyer to CTO and Chris du Toit to CMO. Moyer and du Toit are the latest additions to the Kobiton management team. Kevin Lee joined as CEO last year, and the company is actively recruiting new sales, marketing and engineering talent.\nKobiton is ramping up in response to business and consumer demand for mobile applications that perform well on any device. Kobiton’s mobile cloud platform, which came out of beta last year, allows mobile testers and developers to perform manual and automated testing of mobile applications on thousands of physical iOS and Android device configurations to ensure that bugs are caught and resolved quickly. Early customers include a large big-box office retailer and a rising athletic wear company.\nMoyer comes to Kobiton from marketing software company Skroot, where he was co-founder and CEO. Before Skroot he was an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), a startup accelerator that helps launch Georgia-based technology startups. Prior to ATDC Moyer was President and CEO at GeoIQ, a provider of geospatial analytics software for US government and commercial markets, that was acquired by ESRI. Moyer graduated from Columbia University.\nDu Toit joins Kobiton from Jacada, where he was CMO for two years and a product director for 11. Du Toit also founded Object Alliance Corporation, a technology consulting company specializing in web and enterprise systems architecture and implementation. He earned a law degree from Concord Law School in 2010.\n“Frank and Chris are excellent additions to the Kobiton team,” says Lee. “Both have experience building a software business from the ground up and will provide tremendous leadership and direction in our product and marketing efforts. We’re excited to add their skills as we take the next step in establishing Kobiton as the best platform for developers building modern mobile applications.”\nAbout Kobiton\nKobiton is a powerful mobile device cloud that allows companies to more effectively manage the devices they own and access the real devices they want.
