    "text": "LAS VEGAS, March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nevada Gold & Casinos, Inc. (NYSE MKT:UWN) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended January 31, 2018. The Company will host a conference call at 4:30 PM ET (1:30 PM PT) today to discuss these results and provide a corporate update.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2018, net revenue increased to $18.1 million compared to $17.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily driven by a $0.4 million increase in Washington, partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease from Club Fortune Casino. Operating expenses were $17.5 million compared to $18.4 million in the prior year period, which included a $1.1 million impairment loss. Operating income was $0.6 million compared to an operating loss of $0.5 million in the prior year period. The Company recorded a non-cash tax expense adjustment of $0.3 million as a result of the new corporate tax rate. Net income was $0.2 million compared to net loss of $0.7 million in the prior year period.\nNet revenues from the Washington state gaming operations were $13.6 million compared to $13.2 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to repositioning one location as a poker only operation. Poker revenues increased $0.3 million while other gaming revenue was unchanged for the period, despite removing 10 tables as a result of the poker move. Marketing expenses increased $0.2 million in the quarter related to the repositioning, and coupled with increased wages, caused Adjusted EBITDA to decrease to $1.5 million compared to $1.6 million in the prior year period.\nClub Fortune net revenues were $3.3 million compared to $3.5 million in the prior year. A slot hold variance of approximately 50 basis points was the primary reason for both the revenue and EBITDA declines. Adjusted EBITDA was $0.4 million compared to $0.6 million in the prior year.\nSouth Dakota revenues were $1.2 million in both periods, and Adjusted EBITDA was unchanged at $0.1 million.\nCorporate expenses were $0.6 million, comparable to the prior year. On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 million compared to $1.4 million in the prior year period.\n\"Our strategic poker repositioning in Washington has performed well, and as we reduce our target marketing in support of this move, we expect increased EBITDA contributions from the Washington portfolio,” stated President and CEO Michael Shaunnessy. “Club Fortune was up against a strong prior year comparable, and a lower slot hold hampered the current year’s performance.”\nThe Company paid down $1.3 million in debt during the quarter. The unrestricted cash balance at January 31, 2018 was $8.6 million, and total outstanding borrowing was $9.3 million.\nDuring the third quarter the Company did not purchase any shares. Since inception of the share repurchase program, approximately 1,085,000 shares have been acquired at a cost of approximately $2.3 million.\nFor the nine month period of fiscal 2018, net revenues were $56.1 million compared to $54.6 million in fiscal year 2017. Operating expenses were $54.1 million, compared to $54.7 million in the prior period, which included the $1.1 million impairment charge. Operating income was $2.0 million compared to an operating loss of $0.1 million in fiscal 2017. Net income was $1.0 million compared to net loss of $0.6 million in the prior year.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call today at 4:30 PM ET (1:30 PM PT).

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, change in swap fair value, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charges, write-offs of project development costs and acquisition expenses, litigation charges, non-cash stock grants, non-cash employee stock purchase plan discounts, amortization of deferred rent, and net losses/gains from asset dispositions. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account greater or less than expected hold percentages in the gaming operations. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it is a required component of financial ratios reported by us to our lenders, and it is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties, in addition to and not in lieu of, U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") results to compare to the performance of other companies that also publicize this information. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA reconciliations for the three months and nine months ended January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 are shown below:\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nFor the three months ended January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 Net income (loss) $ 193,327 $ (683,046 ) Adjustments: Net interest expense and change in swap fair value 42,545 8,418 Income tax expense 397,861 189,738 Depreciation and amortization 538,907 756,606 Stock compensation 14,760 1,787 Loss on disposal of assets 308 42,574 Impairment of goodwill - 1,101,471 Amortization of deferred rent 8,027 8,946 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,195,735 $ 1,426,494\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nFor the nine months ended January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 Net income (loss) $ 956,305 $ (636,596 ) Adjustments: Net interest expense and change in swap fair value 298,747 290,253 Income tax expense 718,496 212,592 Depreciation and amortization 1,848,490 2,306,628 Acquisition expenses - 113,900 Stock compensation 89,438 117,363 Loss on disposal of assets 5,773 56,490 Impairment of goodwill - 1,101,471 Amortization of deferred rent 6,076 30,899 Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,923,325 $ 3,597,030 Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
