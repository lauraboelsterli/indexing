    "text": "March 27, 2018 / 7:08 AM / Updated 33 minutes ago Moss Bros reports fall in annual profit on supply issues   (Reuters) - Apparel retailer and tailoring services provider Moss Bros Group Plc ( MOSB.L ) on Tuesday reported a drop in annual profit due on tough retail environment and supply issues and said retail comparable sales in the start of the new financial year also declined. The groupâ€™s profit before tax fell 6.1 percent to 6.7 million pounds for the year ended Jan. 27, hurt by significant stock shortages and poor implementation of a project to consolidate suppliers, it said. Retail like-for-like sales were down 6.7 percent in the first eight weeks of the new financial year, the retailer said. Reporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri",
