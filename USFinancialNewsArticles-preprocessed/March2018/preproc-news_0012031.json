    "text": "March 4, 2018 / 4:15 AM / Updated 17 hours ago Tennis - Tsurenko fights back to defend Acapulco title Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - Ukraine’s Lesia Tsurenko battled back from the brink of defeat to successfully defend her Mexican Open title with a 5-7 7-6(2) 6-2 victory over Stefanie Voegele in the final in Acapulco on Sunday. FILE PHOTO - Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 8, 2017 Ukraine’s Lesia Tsurenko in action during her third round match against Slovakia’s Magdalena Rybarikova REUTERS/Toby Melville Swiss Voegele was only three points from clinching the match in two sets but Tsurenko forced a tiebreak and it was nearly all one-way traffic from there as the Ukrainian took command in a nearly three-hour battle of attrition. After dominating the tiebreak to even up the contest, the 28-year-old world number 40 waltzed through the final set to secure the fourth title of her career. “It’s such a special tournament for me, winning here for the second time,” Tsurenko said.“This is just an unbelievable feeling for me to be here.” Reporting by Andrew Both, editing by Nick Mulvenney",
