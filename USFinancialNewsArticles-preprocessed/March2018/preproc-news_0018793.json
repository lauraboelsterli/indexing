[NASDAQ: NIHD] today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. For the quarter, the Company generated consolidated operating revenues of $189 million, a consolidated operating loss of $40 million and consolidated adjusted OIBDA loss of $18 million. The Company's consolidated adjusted OIBDA excludes the impact of non-cash asset impairments, restructuring charges and other unusual items. For the full year, the Company generated consolidated operating revenues of $870 million, a consolidated operating loss of $272 million and consolidated adjusted OIBDA loss of $55 million. Capital expenditures were $21 million for the quarter and $51 million for the full year.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Nextel Brazil reported a significant improvement in its 3G/4G subscriber results, with 26,800 3G/4G net subscriber additions, a 59,100 increase compared to the third quarter of 2017. In addition, 3G/4G churn for the fourth quarter was 3.47%, a 57-basis point decrease compared to the third quarter of 2017. Subscriber migrations from its iDEN network to its 3G/4G network were 23,500, the highest quarterly level reported for 2017. The Company expects the improving net subscriber addition and average monthly churn rate trends for 3G/4G experienced in the fourth quarter to continue in the first quarter of 2018.\n\"The improved subscriber results reported for the fourth quarter reflect the continued efforts we have been making to enhance our customers' experience while providing them with a very competitive and attractive offer,\" stated Roberto Rittes, Chief Executive Officer of Nextel Brazil. \"We are expecting a further reduction in 3G/4G churn in the first quarter, giving us confidence that we can drive meaningful 3G/4G subscriber growth in 2018, which should lead to increasing 3G/4G revenues. At the same time, we are continuing to maintain discipline around our spending and remain focused on capturing additional cost reduction opportunities. Entering 2018, we are energized and excited to execute on our plan for the year.\"\nNextel Brazil's key financial metrics for 2017 were largely in line with 2016. Average monthly service revenue per subscriber (ARPU) was $19, cost per gross addition (CPGA) was $97 and cash cost per user (CCPU) was $18. For the fourth quarter, Nextel Brazil reported ARPU of $18, CPGA of $102 and CCPU of $17.\nAt year-end, the Company's sources of funding totaled $371 million, including $211 million of unrestricted cash and short-term investments, $110 million of cash held in escrow to secure indemnification obligations in connection with the sale of Nextel Mexico and $50 million in cash pledged as collateral to secure certain performance bonds in Brazil. The Company recovered substantially all of the cash securing these performance bonds in January 2018.\nThe Company recently reached an agreement with the Mexican tax authorities on $73 million in previously escrowed funds related to the audits of Nextel Mexico's income tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011. The Company expects to recover some of that amount in the next few months. The Company is continuing to work with the Mexican tax authorities to settle the open non-income tax-based audits and accelerate the release of the remaining escrow.\n\"We ended the year with a healthy liquidity position,\" stated Dan Freiman, Chief Financial Officer of NII Holdings. \"With the completion of the loan amendments that we recently announced, which take near-term pressure off our liquidity, as well as recent encouraging operating trends, we are positioned to grow our 3G/4G subscriber base this year. We believe this growth will pay back in the form of higher revenues and adjusted OIBDA in 2019 and beyond.\"\nThe Company announced the following outlook for 2018:\nTotal 3G/4G net subscriber additions of 300,000 or more; Moderately better consolidated adjusted OIBDA than the amount reported in 2017, but still negative; and A similar level of capital expenditures as the amount reported in 2017.\nThe Company's consolidated adjusted OIBDA outlook for 2018 excludes an expected positive impact from the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" or ASC 606, on January 1, 2018.\nWith the completion of the loan amendments and improvements to the Company's liquidity and outlook, management is finalizing its assessment of whether substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern has been resolved.\nAdditional details regarding the Company's results, including the Company's conclusion on its assessment of going concern and a more detailed explanation on local currency operating metrics, will be included in the Company's 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the coming days.

Consolidated adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization, or adjusted OIBDA, represents consolidated operating income before depreciation expense, amortization expense, material asset impairments, severance costs associated with publicly announced restructuring plans and other material non-recurring or unusual charges. Consolidated OIBDA and consolidated adjusted OIBDA are not measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, may not be similar to consolidated OIBDA and consolidated adjusted OIBDA measures of other companies and should be considered in addition to, but not as substitutes for, the information contained in our statements of operations. We believe that consolidated OIBDA and consolidated adjusted OIBDA provide useful information to investors because they are indicators of our ongoing operating performance, especially in a capital intensive industry such as ours, since they exclude items that are not directly attributable to ongoing business operations. Consolidated OIBDA and consolidated adjusted OIBDA can be reconciled to our consolidated statements of operations as follows (in millions):\nNII Holdings, Inc.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nConsolidated operating\nloss\n$\n(40.0)\n$\n(57.3)\n$\n(272.2)\n$\n(1,526.9)\nConsolidated depreciation\n4.0\n9.4\n22.2\n135.4\nConsolidated amortization\n3.6\n4.0\n15.0\n37.0\nConsolidated operating loss before depreciation and amortization\n(32.4)\n(43.9)\n(235.0)\n(1,354.5)\nReversal of accrued tax contingency\n—\n—\n—\n(8.1)\nAsset impairment charges\n3.8\n23.6\n67.3\n1,349.4\nRestructuring charges\n10.6\n20.5\n112.4\n35.4\nConsolidated adjusted operating (loss) income before\ndepreciation and amortization\n$\n(18.0)\n$\n0.2\n$\n(55.3)\n$\n22.2\nAverage Monthly Revenue Per Handset/Unit in Service (ARPU)\nAverage monthly revenue per subscriber unit in service, or ARPU, is an industry term that measures service revenues, which we refer to as subscriber revenues, per period from our customers divided by the weighted average number of subscriber units in commercial service during that period. ARPU is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, may not be similar to ARPU measures of other companies and should be considered in addition, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our statements of operations. We believe that ARPU provides useful information concerning the appeal of our rate plans and service offerings and our performance in attracting and retaining high value customers.

The CCPU calculation excludes material asset impairments, severance costs associated with publicly announced restructuring plans and other material non-recurring or unusual charges and is calculated as follows (in thousands, except CCPU):\nNextel Brazil\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nUS$\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n104.9\n$\n141.2\n$\n485.9\n$\n523.8\nLess: selling and marketing expenses\n(29.7)\n(36.0)\n(108.5)\n(116.5)\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n75.2\n105.2\n377.4\n407.3\nCost of service\n90.1\n96.2\n374.7\n364.6\nCustomer retention costs and other\n1.4\n2.0\n5.9\n7.3\nTotal\n$\n166.7\n$\n203.4\n$\n758.0\n$\n779.2\nCash Cost per User\n$\n17\n$\n19\n$\n18\n$\n17\nNextel Brazil\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nBRL R$\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n340.1\n$\n465.1\n$\n1,547.8\n$\n1,818.0\nLess: selling and marketing expenses\n(96.3)\n(119.2)\n(346.0)\n(401.4)\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n243.8\n345.9\n1,201.8\n1,416.6\nCost of service\n292.6\n316.6\n1,194.2\n1,297.4\nCustomer retention costs and other\n4.6\n6.7\n18.7\n25.1\nTotal\n$\n541.0\n$\n669.2\n$\n2,414.7\n$\n2,739.1\nCash Cost per User\n$\n55\n$\n61\n$\n59\n$\n59\nImpact of Foreign Currency Fluctuations\nThe following table shows the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain financial measures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2017 by (i) adjusting the relevant measures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 to levels that would have resulted if the average foreign currency exchange rates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 were the same as the average foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017; and (ii) comparing the actual and adjusted financial measures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 to the similar financial measures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 to show the percentage change in those measures before and after taking those adjustments into account. The amounts reflected in the following table for operating income before depreciation and amortization on a consolidated basis and segment earnings for Nextel Brazil, before the adjustments for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are based on the calculations contained elsewhere in these non-GAAP reconciliations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The average foreign currency exchange rates for each of the relevant currencies during each of the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are included in the notes to the table below. The information reflected in the following table is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our statements of operations. We believe that these calculations provide useful information concerning our relative performance for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 by removing the impact of the significant difference in the average foreign currency exchange rates in effect for those periods.\nNII Holdings, Inc.\n(dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n4Q 2016\nActual\n4Q 2016 Adjustment (1)\n4Q 2016 Normalized\n(1)\n4Q 2017\nActual\n4Q 2016\nto 4Q 2017\nActual B(W)\nGrowth (2)\n4Q 2016\nto 4Q 2017\nNormalized\nB(W) Growth\n(3)\nConsolidated:\nOperating revenues\n$\n248,440\n$\n3,057\n$\n251,497\n$\n188,870\n(24)%\n(25)%\nAdjusted operating income (loss)\nbefore depreciation and amortization\n175\n93\n268\n(18,057)\nNM\nNM\nNextel Brazil:\nOperating revenues\n$\n248,409\n$\n3,057\n$\n251,466\n$\n188,847\n(24)%\n(25)%\nAdjusted operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization\n7,534\n93\n7,627\n(15,863)\nNM\nNM\nNM-Not Meaningful\nNII Holdings, Inc.\n(dollars in thousands)\nYear Ended December 31,\nYTD 2016\nActual\nYTD 2016 Adjustment\n(1)\nYTD 2016 Normalized\n(1)\nYTD 2017\nActual\nYTD 2016\nto YTD 2017\nB(W) Growth\n(2)\nYTD 2016\nto YTD 2017\nNormalized\nB(W)\nGrowth (3)\nConsolidated:\nOperating revenues\n$\n985,046\n$\n92,622\n$\n1,077,668\n$\n869,767\n(12)%\n(19)%\nAdjusted operating income (loss)\nbefore depreciation and amortization\n22,232\n5,554\n27,786\n(55,245)\nNM\n(299)%\nNextel Brazil:\nOperating revenues\n$\n984,878\n$\n92,622\n$\n1,077,500\n$\n869,661\n(12)%\n(19)%\nAdjusted operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization\n59,053\n5,554\n64,607\n(31,071)\n(153)%\n(148)%",
