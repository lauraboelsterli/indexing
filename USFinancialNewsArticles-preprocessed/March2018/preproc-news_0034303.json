    "text": "RED BANK, N.J., March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ZAIS Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZAIS) (\"ZAIS\"), today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. ZAIS conducts substantially all of its operations through ZAIS Group, LLC (\"ZAIS Group\"). ZAIS Group provides investment advisory and asset management services to private funds, separately managed accounts, structured vehicles and, until October 31, 2016, ZAIS Financial Corp. (\"ZFC REIT\"), a publicly traded real estate investment trust (collectively, the \"ZAIS Managed Entities\"). References to the \"Company\" herein refer to ZAIS, together with (where the context requires) its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nA summary of the Company's results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are set forth below. All dollar amounts are presented in millions, with the exception of figures presented on a per share basis.\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nU.S. GAAP\nNet income/(loss)\n$2.2\n$5.9\n$(1.2)\n$(3.8)\nNet income/(loss) per diluted weighted average share outstanding applicable to ZAIS Group Holdings, Inc.\n$0.00\n$0.29\n$(0.31)\n$(0.37)\nNet income/(loss) before income taxes\n$2.2\n$5.9\n$(1.2)\n$(3.8)\nNon-U.S. GAAP\nNet income/(loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group)\n$(0.1)\n$6.1\n$(6.7)\n$(7.3)\nNet income/(loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) per diluted weighted average share outstanding\n$0.00\n$0.29\n$(0.31)\n$(0.37)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$0.0\n$7.5\n$(5.0)\n$(1.9)\nThe consolidated financial statements include non-controlling interests of the members of ZAIS Group Parent, LLC (\"ZGP\") (the \"ZGP Founder Members\") which represent Class A Units of ZGP held by the ZGP Founder Members. ZGP, a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of ZAIS, is the sole member, and owns all of the equity, of ZAIS Group.\nCONSOLIDATED U.S. GAAP RESULTS\nOperating Results – Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nThe Company recorded U.S. GAAP net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 of $2.2 million compared with U.S. GAAP net income of $5.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $3.7 million in U.S. GAAP net income was primarily driven by a decrease in revenues of $6.7 million offset by a decrease in expenses of $1.0 million and an increase in other income of $2.0 million. The U.S. GAAP results include the results of funds and structured financing entities which are consolidated by the Company (the \"Consolidated Funds\").\nTotal revenues decreased by $6.7 million primarily due to a $6.5 million decrease in management fee income and a $1.6 million decrease in incentive fee income, offset by an increase of $0.3 million in reimbursement revenue and an increase of $1.0 million in income of Consolidated Funds.\nWhen excluding the October 2016 receipt of a one time $8.0 million termination fee in connection with the termination of the management agreement between ZAIS REIT Management LLC, a consolidated subsidiary of ZAIS Group, and ZFC REIT, management fee income increased from the prior year's quarter primarily due to the increase in the number of CLOs managed by ZAIS.\nIncentive fees decreased by $1.6 million primarily due to lower performance related to ZAIS Managed Entities that crystalized incentive fees during the respective quarters.\nReimbursement revenue increased by $0.3 million due to the reimbursement from certain ZAIS Managed Entities for research and data services expenses incurred by ZAIS Group during the fourth quarter of 2017 and paid directly to vendors by ZAIS Group. Income of Consolidated Funds related to ZAIS Zephyr A-6 LP's (\"Zephyr A-6\") investments in unconsolidated ZAIS managed CLOs increased by $1.0 million.\nTotal expenses decreased by $1.0 million primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in compensation and benefits offset by a $0.9 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses and a $0.4 million increase in expenses of Consolidated Funds. Compensation and benefits decreased primarily due to a $1.1 million decrease in equity compensation expense relating to the reduction in outstanding equity compensation awards resulting from the cancellation in December 2016 of all of ZGP's Class B-0 Units held by certain employees in consideration of the receipt by such employees in substitution therefor (as elected by each employee) of RSUs (which fully vested on March 17, 2017) or the right to receive cash (which was paid on March 22, 2017) and a $1.2 million decrease primarily due to reduced bonus expense. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $0.9 million primarily due to an increase of $0.3 million in expenses relating to research and data services borne by ZAIS Group and paid directly by ZAIS Group to vendors which are reimbursable from certain ZAIS Managed Entities and an increase of $1.0 million relating to legal fees primarily related to the Strategic Review and transaction costs offset by a net decrease of $0.4 million in other general and administrative costs.\nOther income increased by $2.0 million primarily due to a $1.2 million increase in net gain (loss) on Consolidated Funds' investments related to Zephyr A-6 and a $0.8 million decrease in net loss on beneficial interest of consolidated collateralized financing entity which relates to Zephyr A-6's investment in ZAIS CLO 5.\nOperating Results – Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe Company recorded U.S. GAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $(1.2) million compared with a U.S. GAAP net loss of $(3.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $2.6 million in U.S. GAAP net loss was primarily driven by a decrease in expenses of $3.7 million offset by a decrease in revenues of $0.8 million and a decrease in other income of $0.3 million.\nCONSOLIDATED NON-U.S. GAAP RESULTS\nPlease see the discussion of \"Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\", including the definitions of net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA, and reconciliations of such non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to the respective U.S. GAAP net income (loss) measures for the periods discussed above at the end of this press release.\nThe Company's U.S. GAAP net income (loss) and non-U.S. GAAP measures of income (loss) may fluctuate materially depending upon the performance of ZAIS Managed Entities as well as other factors. Accordingly, the U.S. GAAP net income (loss) and non-U.S. GAAP measures of income (loss) in any particular period should not be expected to be indicative of future results.\nLIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash and cash equivalents of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities, of $41.6 million and no debt obligations.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nThe Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Supplemental Information – December 31, 2017, is available on ZAIS's website at www.zaisgroupholdings.com . To access the information, go to the \"ZAIS Shareholders\" section of the website.\nUSE OF NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), this press release includes certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information, including net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA (and per share measures). Net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) excluding the consolidating effects of the Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) excluding consolidating effects of the Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group, equity-based compensation, severance, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses and foreign currency translation adjustments.\nThe Company believes that providing investors with this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, gives investors greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. However, because net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA are incomplete measures of the Company's financial performance and involve differences from net income (loss) computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the Company's net income (loss) computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.\nZAIS GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.
