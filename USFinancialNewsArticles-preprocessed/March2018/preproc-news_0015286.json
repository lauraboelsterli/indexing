    "text": "NEWTON, Mass., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acer Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:ACER), a pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and ultra-rare diseases with critical unmet medical need, today reported financial results for the quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017 and provided an update on the Company’s recent corporate developments.\n“We accomplished a lot in 2017 that sets the stage nicely for us to deliver on multiple significant milestones anticipated in 2018. We believe that by going public, hiring several key executives and raising enough capital to fund our current operating requirements through the end of this year, we are now in a position to finalize the critical activities over the next few months required to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for EDSIVO™ in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS),” said Chris Schelling, CEO and Founder of Acer. “We are also working very closely with the vEDS community to better understand their needs and to learn how we can best partner with them going forward. Collectively, we are exploring how Acer can begin supporting initiatives that help strengthen patient advocacy and establish centers of excellence, accelerate diagnosis and optimize patient care, and sponsor additional research collaborations with leading experts in vEDS.” Mr. Schelling continued, “Beyond vEDS, we look to advance and expand our pipeline with the goal of bringing multiple products to patients with serious ultra-orphan diseases over the next several years.”\n2017 and Recent Highlights\nAnnounced positive results from the pivotal clinical trial of EDSIVO™ (celiprolol) for the treatment of vEDS. Our retrospective source-verified analysis of the trial data, including the primary and secondary endpoints, confirmed the data from a previously published randomized controlled clinical study of celiprolol (1) . We plan to discuss these key data during a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. Closed merger with Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. and common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market in the third quarter of 2017 Raised $28.3 million in 2017 through an underwritten public offering and the private placement of securities Expanded management team and independent board directors Ended 2017 with $15.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt, which we believe is sufficient to fund our current operating and capital requirements through the end of 2018\nUpcoming Milestones\nPotential publication of celiprolol vEDS Patient Registry data. The manuscript is currently under peer review, and if accepted, may be published by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Targeting a pre-NDA meeting, which may consist of one or more consults, with the FDA in the second quarter of 2018 Anticipate submitting an NDA to the FDA for EDSIVO™ for the treatment of vEDS at the end of the first half of 2018 Continuing pre-commercial activities for EDSIVO™ Making additional senior-level commercial and medical affairs hires this year, as well as continuing to build out the commercial team and add other core personnel later this year\nFinancial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017\nCash position. Cash and cash equivalents were $15.6 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2016.\nResearch and Development Expenses. expenses were $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. expenses were $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our research and development expenses continue to be primarily focused on spending for clinical development, regulatory, and manufacturing services related to EDSIVO™.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $2.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses were $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in expenses is primarily due to an increase in pre-commercial activities related to EDSIVO™ and professional services costs.\nNet Loss. Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $4.2 million, or $0.63 loss per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.87 loss per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $14.2 million, or $3.84 loss per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $6.7 million, or $2.73 loss per share (basic and diluted) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor additional information, please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed today with the SEC.\nAbout Acer Therapeutics\nAcer, headquartered in Newton, MA, is a pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of therapies for patients with serious rare and ultra-rare diseases with critical unmet medical need. Acer’s late-stage clinical pipeline includes two candidates for severe genetic disorders: EDSIVO™ (celiprolol) for vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), and ACER-001 (a fully taste-masked, immediate release formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate) for urea cycle disorders (UCD) and Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD). There are no FDA-approved drugs for vEDS and MSUD and limited options for UCD, which collectively impact approximately 7,000 patients in the U.S. Acer’s product candidates have clinical proof-of-concept and mechanistic differentiation, and Acer intends to seek approval for them in the U.S. by using the regulatory pathway established under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) that allows an applicant to rely at least in part on third-party data for approval, which may expedite the preparation, submission, and approval of a marketing application.\nFor more information, visit www.acertx.com .\nReferences\n(1) Ong KT, et al.
