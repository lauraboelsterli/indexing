Tenkman most recently served as the firm’s COO and has been with the firm since 2014. During his tenure, the firm has more than doubled in size with over 170 employees, 90 clients and in excess of $60 billion in assets under administration, making it one of the largest independent providers in the U.S. mutual fund industry. Tenkman has over 25 years of financial services industry experience, including most recently in various leadership positions at a global custodian bank in their fund services division.\n“Ultimus is a leader in the U.S. mutual fund servicing space and I’m excited to not only be part of a great team but to also continue to help us grow and provide value to our clients as we move forward,” said Tenkman. “We possess an incredible depth of industry knowledge at Ultimus and are well positioned for additional growth.”\nIn 2017, Ultimus hired industry veterans Bill Tomko, Director of Fund Servicing, and Dina Tantra, Director of Fund Administration and Compliance, adding to its executive team and providing additional bench strength. Both Tomko and Tantra will continue to report to Tenkman in his new role.\nSeger commented, “As we have grown, Bob and I wanted to make sure we kept an emphasis on our client centric model. Putting Gary in this position absolutely reinforces that. It also allows both Bob and I to devote more time to long-term strategic initiatives.”\nDorsey concluded, “We are excited about the future at Ultimus and are glad to have Gary’s leadership as we move forward.”\nAbout Ultimus Fund Solutions\nUltimus Fund Solutions provides highly customized and comprehensive middle and back office services to investment advisers.
