FILE PHOTO - Tom Williams, Airbus Executive Vice President Programmes, delivers his speech during the Airbus annual press conference in Colomiers, near Toulouse, January 13, 2014. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau Tom Williams, chief operating officer of the planemaking business of Europe’s largest aerospace company, said Airbus ( AIR.PA ) is strongly committed to its British factories as long as they can be run with the same efficiency as before. “We are coming to quite a momentous event. The important message we try to put across to ministers is we are only a year away now; the clock’s running pretty fast,” Williams said in a video conveyed to Airbus’s 14,000 UK staff via YouTube. Due to long lead times, Airbus is facing immediate decisions on whether to increase spending on parts in order to build up an extra buffer stock to cope with potential disruption when Britain leaves the European Union on March 29, 2019, he said.
