    "text": "PHOENIX, March 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mobivity Holdings Corp. (OTCQB:MFON), makers of the award-winning re•currency platform that increases customer visits and spend in restaurants, retail, and personal care brands, today announced that strong revenue growth is projected in the first half of 2018. The Company expects 2018 first half revenues to grow at least 75% over first half 2017 revenues.\nDennis Becker, Mobivity Chairman and CEO, commented, “The first meaningful commercial deployment of our re•currency platform and service offering deployed a little over 24 months ago in 2016. We’ve since seen an increase in our customers’ investments in re•currency. Throughout 2017, Mobivity’s minimum total contract values grew to more than $19 million, an increase of more than 260% over our minimum total contract values of $5.3 million in 2016. Additionally, our average contract term has also increased 250% year over year, from 1 year to nearly 2.5 years. More recently, some of our customers have begun to publicize the amazing results they achieved with re•currency. Increasing contract values, term lengths, and market awareness of how our technology delivers results, is creating strong momentum going into 2018. We also believe that our current revenue trajectory will propel the company to cash-flow breakeven by the end of the year.”\nThe Company has also recently appointed Charles B. Mathews as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Mathews has more than 25 years of accounting and management experience serving in CFO roles for a variety of publicly traded companies. Mr. Mathews is a Certified Public Accountant and holds a B.A. degree in Business Administration from Alaska Pacific University and an M.B.A. degree from Arizona State University. Mr. Mathews succeeds Christopher Meinerz who has left the Company to pursue other interests.\n\"Charles has extensive experience spearheading the financial reporting and operations of several publicly traded companies, including companies listed on national exchanges such as NASDAQ, AMEX, and TSX,\" said Dennis Becker, Mobivity's Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe we’re poised for significant growth and Charles’ experience will be instrumental in elevating our financial operations to the next level.\"\n\"The opportunity to join a company with a rare combination of household name customers, like Subway and Baskin-Robbins, and ground-breaking technology was irresistible,\" said Mathews. \"I’m very excited to apply my experience in helping to drive Mobivity’s growth.\"\nAdditionally, the Company announced preliminary financial results for the year ending December 31, 2017. Full 2017 financial results are expected to be published in the Company’s Annual Report via 10-K filing.\n2017 Highlights:\nNet loss decreased to $5.9M, a 38% improvement over a net loss of $9.5M in 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased to $2.4M through December 31, 2017, a 23% decrease as compared to $3.1 million during the same period in 2016.\n2017 revenues were $8.6 million, an increase of 2% compared to 2016.\nOperating expenses declined slightly to $11.6 million in 2017 versus $11.8 million in 2016.\nThe Company had $460,000 of unrestricted cash at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2016.\nSubscribers to Mobivity powered mobile marketing campaigns grew to 9.7 million unique consumers in 2017, an increase of approximately 24% compared to 2016.\nAbout Mobivity\nBrick and mortar stores struggle to manage customer connections in a digital world.
