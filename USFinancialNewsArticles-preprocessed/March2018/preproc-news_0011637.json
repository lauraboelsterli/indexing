The price represents a discount of 4 percent to the stockâ€™s Monday closing price on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nBombardier, which considered bankruptcy in 2015, announced a turnaround plan focused on improving profit margins and shedding billions of dollars in debt.\nCredit Suisse, National Bank Financial, UBS and TD Securities are the underwriters for the stock offering.\n$1 = 1.2968 Canadian dollars Reporting by Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ",
