    "text": "March 5, 2018 / 1:48 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago IAAF CEO Gers quits after less than 18 months in job Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - IAAF chief executive officer Olivier Gers has resigned less than 18 months into his role to allow the global governing body of athletics to pursue a different commercial strategy, he said in a statement on Monday.
