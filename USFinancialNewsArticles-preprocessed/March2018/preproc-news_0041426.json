    "text": "NOVI, Mich., March 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Hino Trucks announced several organizational changes today as part of its overall growth plans in the U.S. Earlier this month, Hino Trucks unveiled its first ever class 8 truck for the North American market by launching its Hino XL Series. In late 2017, Hino announced the purchase of a new manufacturing facility in Mineral Wells, West Virginia to accommodate the production of the new XL Series, and to meet the growing demand for its current class 6 and 7 line-up of conventional trucks. Additionally, Hino broke ground on a new state-of-the-art U.S. corporate headquarters in Novi, Michigan back in August 2017.\n\"As we execute our plan to expand our product line up, increase our sales, and provide the Hino advantage to a growing number of dealers and customers in the U.S., we also need to strengthen our team to support the growth,\" noted Yoshinori Noguchi, President and CEO of Hino Trucks.\nThe first organizational change to note is that Yoshinori Noguchi, in addition to his role of CEO of North America, is promoted to Executive Vice President of Hino Motors, Ltd. Mr. Noguchi's 18 years of international experience will serve Hino well as they continue to expand globally.\nGeorge Daniels is appointed to a newly created role of Executive Advisor. In his new role, George will support senior management through the completion of the new building and ensure a successful launch of the Hino XL Series, while stepping away from some of the day-to-day responsibilities of his current role.\nGlenn Ellis is promoted to Senior Vice President, Customer Experience. Glenn will lead the Marketing and Dealer Operations, Product Planning and Service Operations organizations.\nBob Petz is promoted to Senior Vice President, Vehicle and Parts Sales. Bob will lead the Sales, Logistics and Parts Operations organizations.\nBoth Glenn and Bob have been with Hino Trucks for over 13 years and will report to Mr. Noguchi.\nJohn Donato is promoted to Vice President, Parts Operations. John will have responsibility for all parts related activities including the Parts Sales organization and Parts Distribution Centers (PDCs) and report to Bob Petz.\nLastly, John Musial is promoted to Vice President, Service Operations. John will head up Hino's Service, Warranty and Training organizations and will report to Glenn Ellis.\n\"I feel very strongly that the team we have put in place will guide the Hino Team and dealer network to provide our customers with the Ultimate Ownership Experience,\" added Noguchi.\nABOUT HINO TRUCKS:\nHino Trucks, a Toyota Group Company, assembles, sells, and services a lineup of Class 4-8 diesel commercial trucks in the United States.
