    "text": "Millionaire Survey China has fewer rich lawmakers but their fortunes have grown The Hurun Report, China's version of the Forbes rich list, found 152 super-wealthy delegates to the National People's Congress and its advisory body, which are set to meet next week in Beijing. The group's collective wealth, however, swelled to 4.1 trillion yuan ($650 billion), up by nearly a fifth from 3.5 trillion yuan the previous year. The report also underlines fears about the political fortunes of China's elite under President Xi Jinping, who's carrying out a marathon corruption crackdown. Published 6 Hours Ago Xaume Olleros | Bloomberg | Getty Images Ma 'Pony' Huateng, chairman and chief executive officer of Tencent Holdings Ltd. \nMembers of China's billionaire-studded ceremonial legislature are even richer than last year. \nIt's all the more remarkable considering the number of super rich lawmakers dropped by about a quarter, according to wealth compiler Hurun Report, China's version of the Forbes rich list. \nHurun's report released Friday found 152 super-wealthy delegates to the National People's Congress and its advisory body, which are set to meet next week in Beijing . \nThat's down from the 209 who attended last year's session of the rubber-stamp parliament. \nThe group's collective wealth, however, swelled to 4.1 trillion yuan ($650 billion), up by nearly a fifth from 3.5 trillion yuan the previous year. \nTycoons with fortunes from traditional businesses like mining, autos and real estate share space on Hurun's list with entrepreneurs who made their money from internet services, smartphones and glass for the devices, highlighting the evolving nature of China's economy, the world's second biggest. \nThe report also underlines fears about the political fortunes of China's elite under President Xi Jinping , who's carrying out a marathon corruption crackdown. The latest victims include a low-profile oil tycoon reportedly detained for questioning and the founder of Chinese insurer Anbang, Wu Xiaohui, whom authorities plan to prosecute for financial offenses. \nXi is set to begin a second-five year term as president at the parliament's meeting starting March 5. NPC delegates are expected to approve the Communist Party's plan to remove presidential term limits, giving Xi, who has taken control of an unusually wide range of political and economic tasks, even more power. \nHoogewerf said while the ranks of superrich lawmakers have thinned out, he hasn't seen anything to indicate Chinese entrepreneurs are \"losing confidence in the business environment.\" \nDelegates are chosen every five years, most recently this year. High turnover between last year's group and the new NPC attendees is one big reason for the ranking's changes, said Hoogewerf. He added that delegates don't have nearly the same power that members of congress or senators have in other legislatures. \nHeading the list is Pony Ma Huateng, CEO of internet giant Tencent , operator of China's ubiquitous WeChat/Weixin chat app, with a net worth of $47 billion. \nThe second richest NPC member is Li Shufu, chairman of Geely , one of China's biggest independent automakers. It owns Sweden's Volvo, stakes in Malaysia's Proton and British sports car maker Lotus, and recently acquired nearly 10 percent of Germany's Daimler . His fortune is estimated at $17 billion. \nThe youngest member is Liu Ruopeng, founder of advanced materials maker Kuang-Chi, which also owns a New Zealand jetpack maker. Hurun says he's worth $2.6 billion. \nAmong the few women on the list, Zhou Qunfei is one of China's wealthiest. She made a $10 billion fortune through her company Lens Technology, which makes glass for smartphones and tablets. Related Securities",
