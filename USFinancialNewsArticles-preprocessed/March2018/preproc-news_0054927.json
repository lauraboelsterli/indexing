    "text": "RICHMOND, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE: APLE) (the “Company”) today announced that the Company has established a written trading Plan (“Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of its common shares in open market transactions. This Plan was established under the Company’s existing share repurchase program. The Plan, entered into on March 29, 2018, is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which will allow the Company to repurchase shares through a designated broker at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so by securities laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Because repurchases under a 10b5-1 plan are subject to certain pricing, market and volume parameters, there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares, if any, that will be repurchased under the Plan. In addition, the timing of share repurchases under the Plan and the overall repurchase program will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors and may be suspended by the Company at any time.\nAbout Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE: APLE) is a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns one of the largest portfolios of upscale, select-service hotels in the United States.
