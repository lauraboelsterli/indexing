    "text": "Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview Wednesday with Recode's Kara Swisher that if the FBI iPhone privacy case \"came up again, we would fight again.\"\nCook referred to the case two years ago when the Federal Bureau of Investigation asked Apple for access to the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter, Syed Farook. The technology giant refused to help the FBI, citing issues of data privacy. Cook called the request \"chilling.\"\nThe debate sparked a wide discussion over government interference in a technology company's data. Law enforcement argued the data would help solve terrorist cases. Technology companies rebutted, stating that without encryption, iPhone users will become easier victims to hackers.\nThe case was dropped after the Department of Justice was able to access the iPhone. Reports suggested a third party unlocked it.\nCook also criticized the data privacy practices of Facebook in the same interview.",
