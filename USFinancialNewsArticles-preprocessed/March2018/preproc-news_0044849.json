Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “continue”, “expect”, “estimate”, “may”, “plan”, “outlook”, “future” and “project” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable and may also relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies. In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements concerning the timing of the merger; the business plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of the public company once the transaction is complete, and Intermex’s estimated and future results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, industry environment and potential growth opportunities. These statements are based on FNTE’s or Intermex’s management’s current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events.\nSuch forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside FNTE’s or Intermex’s control that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors include, but are not limited to, (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; (2) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of FNTE or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; (3) the ability of the public entity to meet NASDAQ’s listing standards following the merger; (4) the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations of Intermex as a result of the announcement and consummation of the merger transactions; (5) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with suppliers and retain its management and key employees; (6) costs related to the proposed business combination; (7) changes in applicable laws or regulations; and (8) the possibility that Intermex may be adversely affected by other economic, business, regulatory and/or competitive factors. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements can be found in FNTE’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which are available, free of charge, at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov ., and will also be provided in the registration statement on Form S-4 and FNTE’s proxy statement/prospectus when available. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and FNTE and Intermex undertake no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nAdditional Information about the Merger and Where to Find It\nIn connection with the proposed merger, FNTE has filed with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus (which is included in a registration statement on Form S-4 ). When completed, FNTE will mail a definitive proxy statement/prospectus to its stockholders in connection with FNTE’s solicitation of proxies for the special meeting of FNTE stockholders to be held to approve the merger and related transactions.
