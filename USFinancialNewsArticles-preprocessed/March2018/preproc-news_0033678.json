    "text": "Bitcoin bounces back above $8,800 after a 'very positive' G-20 cryptocurrency meeting Bitcoin prices headed toward $9,000 after finance ministers discussed cryptocurrency at a G-20 meeting in Argentina Tuesday. \"The spirit of the discussion was very productive and I agree that everybody left very pleased,\" says Federico Sturzenegger, governor of the Central Bank of Argentina. The cryptocurrency is up 20 percent from this weekend's lows. CNBC.com Anthony Wallace | AFP | Getty Images A woman touches an ATM machine for digital currency Bitcoin in Hong Kong on December 18, 2017. \nBitcoin prices recovered toward $9,000 after regulators had \"productive\" discussions on cryptocurrency at a G-20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Tuesday. \n\"The spirit of the discussion was very productive and I agree that everybody left very pleased,\" Governor of the Central Bank of Argentina Federico Sturzenegger, said during a press conference Tuesday. \"It was a very good meeting.\" \nCryptocurrency discussions happened during a closed door session earlier Tuesday, a spokesperson from the G-20 told CNBC. \nBitcoin prices jumped about $300, to $8,834 after the press conference. The digital currency was trading near $8,500 ahead of the meeting Tuesday, according to CoinDesk, and has recovered more than $1,200 from its low over the weekend. \nItaly's central bank went a step further and told reporters after the meeting that cryptocurrencies pose risks but should not be completely banned, according to Reuters. \n\"My understanding is that there was an acceptance of continuing to work also on the stability side with the idea that this doesn't imply barring it,\" Ignazio Visco, the governor of the Bank of Italy, told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, according to Reuters. \nDiscussions inside the room \"devoted a lot of time\" to crypto assets, and the group agreed regulation needs to keep up with the technology's fast pace, Argentina's Sturzenegger said. \nThe Argentine central banker described an anonymous poll taken in the room at the beginning of the meeting of finance ministers, asking whether or not crypto assets should be included in multilateral discussions. \nThe results showed \"very strong the support they have to be added in multilateral issues,\" Sturzenegger said, especially because of their potential as a \"channel for the funding of terrorism for money laundering.\" \nThe money laundering issue and has raised flags for other global regulators. \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at hearing before the Senate Banking Committee in late January that the department is paying particular attention to cryptocurrencies' potential use by criminals. \n\"I want to make sure that these are not used by bad guys, that they don't turn into Swiss numbered bank accounts,\" Mnuchin said, adding that the department wants to \"make sure consumers understand the issues surrounding cryptocurrencies.\" \nThe former Goldman Sachs executive told CNBC in Davos that \"in the U.S., our regulations [state that] if you're a bitcoin wallet, you're subject to the same regulations as a bank.\" \nBitcoin prices began recovering after an announcement by the Financial Stability Board Sunday. The global watchdog took a cautious tone in a letter to G-20 members Sunday, and said that \"crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time.\" \nOther global regulators had reportedly planned to call for more global cooperation ahead of Tuesday's G-20 meeting. \nJapanese representatives had reportedly said they would encourage G-20 counterparts to step up anti-money laundering efforts for cryptocurrencies, according to Reuters , which cited a government official with direct knowledge of the matter. \nEuropean Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said at February roundtable in Brussels that virtual exchanges and wallet providers should be under the \"Anti-Money Laundering Directive,\" adding that the comissission would \"continue to monitor these markets together with other stakeholders, at EU and international level, including in the G-20.\" \nSome in the bitcoin community want to police from within. \nEarly bitcoin bulls Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss submitted a proposal earlier in March to create a self-regulating body known as the Virtual Commodity Association. The non-profit is meant to police digital currency markets, prevent fraud, and develop industry standards, according to the press release. \nBitcoin's one-month performance \nSource: CoinDesk \nBitcoin prices have fallen more than 25 percent in the past month, according to CoinDesk. The digital currency was trading above $11,000 in February, and dropped nearly 10 percent following the Securities and Exchange commission announcement that crypto exchanges must register with agency earlier in March.",
