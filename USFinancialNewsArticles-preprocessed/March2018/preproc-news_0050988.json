    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., March 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Netlist, Inc. (NASDAQ: NLST) today announced the appointment of Rahul Advani as Vice President of Marketing. In this role he will lead the company's strategic marketing initiatives.\nDr. Advani brings more than 15 years of global senior marketing and strategic planning experience to Netlist. He most recently served as Director, SSD Products and Memory Program Office at Microsemi where he was responsible for marketing and strategic planning, including management of NAND and DRAM vendor relationships. Prior to Microsemi, Dr. Advani served in various strategic marketing roles at Micron Corporation and at Intel Corporation. Dr. Advani holds a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Cornell University and a Ph. D in Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nC.K. Hong, Netlist's President and Chief Executive Officer said, \"Rahul is a leader who brings extensive experience in product marketing, customer management and ecosystem development. He has successfully executed numerous product plans, and we believe he will be instrumental in our efforts to broaden customer relationships and bring our next-generation hybrid memory and storage class memory products to market.\"\nAs an inducement material to Dr. Advani entering into employment with Netlist, Netlist's Compensation Committee approved the grant to Dr. Advani of an option to purchase up to 300,000 shares of its common stock with an exercise price of $0.24 per share, which is equal to the closing price of Netlist's common stock on the grant date of the option. The option has a term of 10 years from its grant date and will generally be forfeited if not exercised before the expiration of the term. The shares subject to the option will vest in 16 quarterly installments over four years, subject to Dr. Advani's continued service for Netlist on each vesting date. The option will be granted outside Netlist's Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, but will be subject to terms substantially similar to those of non-qualified stock options granted under such plan. This description of the inducement grant to Dr. Advani is in satisfaction of the disclosure requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).\nAbout Netlist\nNetlist provides high-performance modular memory subsystems to customers in diverse industries that require enterprise and storage class memory solutions to empower critical business decisions.
