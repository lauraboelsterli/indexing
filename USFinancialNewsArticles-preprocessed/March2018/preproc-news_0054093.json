    "text": "0 COMMENTS The trust of the late entrepreneurs who brought the Cambridge Diet to the U.S. is listing an oceanfront estate in Pebble Beach, Calif., for $37 million.\nLocated on 17-Mile Drive, the 2.8-acre compound dates back to the mid-1920s and was designed by George Washington Smith, who was best known for his Spanish Colonial Revival style, said listing agent Shelly Mitchell Lynch of Carmel Realty Co.\nThe home looks out at the ocean as well as Point Lobos, and stone steps lead down to the water’s edge. Photo: Ryan Rosene The 15,418-square-foot main house reflects the architecture of southern Spain in its tile roof, large central courtyard and carved wooden ceilings. The main house has five bedrooms, six full baths and seven half baths. The home looks out at the ocean as well as Point Lobos, and stone steps lead down to the water’s edge.\nThe property, known as Villa Eden del Mar, also includes a 1,806-square-foot guesthouse and a two-bedroom caretaker’s house. There is a detached office, and a covered walkway connects the main house to the 3,651-square-foot gym.\nThe seller is the trust of the late diet and fitness entrepreneurs, Jack and Eileen Feather. Mr. Feather died in December at age 90. Mrs. Feather died in 2016 at 89. The couple bought the property in 1972, said their son, John Feather.\nOriginally from Omaha, Neb., the Feathers moved to California, where they started a gym and then expanded to a chain of salons, a mail-order company and later introduced a liquid diet called Cambridge Plan International, Mr. Feather said. He said the family is no longer affiliated with the diet, now known as Cambridge Weight Plan.\nMs. Lynch shares the listing with Bill Mitchell, also of Carmel Realty Company.\nWrite to Sarah Tilton at sarah.tilton@wsj.com\nMore Private Properties\nJennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez Buy $15.3 Million New York Apartment March 28, 2018 Home of the Late Philadelphia Flyers Owner Ed Snider Sells for $35 Million March 27, 2018 Renowned Ballerina’s Hamptons Home Listed for $37 Million March 26, 2018",
