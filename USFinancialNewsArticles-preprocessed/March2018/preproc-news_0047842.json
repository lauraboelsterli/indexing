    "text": "March 27, 2018 / 1:23 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Ukraine's Naftogaz to hold talks with Gazprom in April - statement Reuters Staff 1 Min Read KIEV, March 27 (Reuters) - Ukrainian state-owned energy firm Naftogaz on Tuesday said it would hold further talks with Russia’s Gazprom in April after recent negotiations failed to end a disagreement over an international court’s ruling in Naftogaz’s favour. “Gazprom’s refusal to honour valid arbitration awards by an internationally valued and respected commercial arbitration tribunal seriously questions Gazprom’s trustworthiness as a partner to the European gas industry,” it said.
