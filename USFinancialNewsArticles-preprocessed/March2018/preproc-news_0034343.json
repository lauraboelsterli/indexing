(“ Alabama Graphite ” or the “ Corporation ”) (TSX-V: CSPG ) (OTCQB: CSPGF ) (FRANKFURT: 1AG ) is pleased to announce that the Corporation has received a final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia approving the acquisition by US-based Westwater Resources, Inc. (“ Westwater ”) (NASDAQ: WWR ), through a wholly-owned subsidiary, of all of the issued and outstanding securities of Alabama Graphite by way of a Plan of Arrangement (the “ Arrangement ”).\nPresident Tyler Dinwoodie commented, “We are very pleased to be in receipt of the Final Order from the BC Supreme Court, which represents an important milestone for the Corporation as we continue to move towards the completion of the Plan of Arrangement transaction. CEO Dr. Gareth Hatch and I are pleased to be joining Westwater, as we move forward and rapidly accelerate our business strategy for Alabama Graphite to become the first American pure-play battery-graphite manufacturer in the United States.”\nAs previously announced, securityholders of Alabama Graphite approved the Arrangement at a special meeting of securityholders held on March 9, 2018, with 97.24% of securities and 96.86% of common shares voted at the special meeting voting in favour of the Arrangement. As such, completion of the Arrangement remains subject only to: (i) the final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange; (ii) the approval of the shareholders of Westwater, which will be sought at their annual meeting to be held on April 19, 2018; and (iii) the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions customary in transactions of this nature, as described in Alabama Graphite’s management information circular dated February 7, 2018 (the “ Circular ”) and including the condition that no action or circumstance will occur that would result in a Material Adverse Effect (as such term is defined in the Circular). Assuming the satisfaction or waiver of these conditions, the Arrangement is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018.\nFurther information about the Arrangement is set out in Circular, which is available on the Corporation’s website at www.alabamagraphite.com and has been filed under Alabama Graphite’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of\nALABAMA GRAPHITE CORP.\nGareth P.

The forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management and reflect Alabama Graphite’s current expectations. When used in this press release, the words “estimate”, “project”, “belief”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “expect”, “plan”, “predict”, “may”, “will” or “should” and the negative of these words or such variations thereon or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of Alabama Graphite. Completion of the Arrangement is subject to a number of conditions which are typical for transactions of this nature. Failure to satisfy any of these conditions, the emergence of a superior proposal or the failure to obtain the approval of the shareholders of Westwater, as well as the final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, may result in the termination of the definitive agreement with Westwater setting out the terms and conditions of the Arrangement.\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or other future events, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date that statements are made, and Alabama Graphite undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements (unless required by law) if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change. Investors are cautioned against attributing undue certainty to forward-looking statements.\nAlabama Graphite has also assumed that the material factors and assumptions will not cause any forward-looking statements to differ materially from actual results or events. However, the list of these factors and assumptions is not exhaustive and is subject to change and there can be no assurance that such assumptions will reflect the actual outcome of such items or factors.\nNEITHER THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATION SERVICE PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THE CONTENT OF THIS NEWS RELEASE.\nCONTACT\nAlabama Graphite Corp.\nTyler W.
