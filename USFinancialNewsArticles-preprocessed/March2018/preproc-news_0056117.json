    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 8:34 AM / Updated 32 minutes ago China's money rates rise on net drain, quarter-end cash demand Reuters Staff 7 Min Read SHANGHAI, March 30 (Reuters) - China's primary money rates moved higher this week as demand for cash rose at the quarter's end, and as the central bank drained liquidity from markets for a second consecutive week. At 0745 GMT on Friday, the volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, was 3.0717 percent. That is nearly 37 basis points higher than the previous week's closing average rate of 2.7036 percent. The Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) for the same tenor rose to 2.9166 percent, up 7 basis points from 2.8464 percent the previous week. The one-day or overnight rate stood at 2.7779 percent and the 14-day repo at 4.5070 percent. Amid what it called \"reasonable and appropriate\" cash conditions in the market, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) skipped open market operations for a sixth straight session on Friday. This week, the central bank drained a net 160 billion yuan ($25.5 billion) from the market. During the previous week, it drained 320 billion yuan. The effect on the net drain on rates was compounded by rising demand for cash as banks prepared for the macroprudential assessment (MPA), a quarterly health check by the PBOC. \"Until now, we've seen relatively large demand for cash to cross into the next quarter,\" a trader at an Asian bank in Shanghai said on Friday afternoon. FALLING NCD YIELDS A sharp fall over the past two weeks in rates on negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs), a popular form of interbank debt, indicated that banks were far from squeezed for cash. The yield on 3-month AAA-rated NCDs, the most common tenor and rating, was at 3.9763 percent on Thursday, down more than 72 basis points since March 16. A fixed-income portfolio manager in Shanghai said the fall in NCD rates reflected slower issuance in the last days of March, sufficient market liquidity and a broader flight to quality amid talk of a United States-China trade war. That slower issuance came at the end of a quarter characterized by a spike in outstanding NCDs, with net issuance at its highest level since the first quarter of 2017. As of Thursday evening, banks had issued 2.18 trillion yuan worth of NCDs in March, according to a Reuters analysis of official data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. That is nearly equal to a record 2.2 trillion yuan in September 2017. The value of outstanding NCDs also stood at a record high as of Thursday evening, contrary to expectations that the inclusion of NCDs in large banks' MPAs from 2018's first quarter would limit issuers' enthusiasm for the instruments. In the latest move to control the NCD market, China's regulators moved this week to limit investment in them by bond funds, in what analysts said was a move to reduce concentration risk.
