    "text": "MALVERN, Pa., March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Seeking a leader who will drive growth and continue the company's focus on lifelong learning that engenders high levels of engagement and execution excellence, Jerry Acuff, Delta Point's CEO and founder, has named Matt Murphy to replace him as President.\nAs Acuff explains, \"Murphy's experience in brand consulting, sales training and leadership development combined with his ability to effectively partner with clients and internal colleagues will ensure the company's future and overall growth.\" He adds, \"Matt has always been and continues to be a powerful voice in support of Delta Point's core philosophies including selling by Thinking Like a Customer, the criticality of valuable business relationships, and training sales managers how to coach and teach selling in real time.\"\nSince beginning his career as a sales specialist for AstraZeneca, Murphy has excelled in leading teams to identify, leverage and optimize sales opportunities. During the last three years of his seventeen-year career at AstraZeneca, Matt was responsible for leading the development and execution of the training curriculum for the 2,000-plus member sales/sales leadership team in the cardiovascular and metabolic business unit. Murphy earned recognition for shaping regional brand strategies, creating alignment and optimizing resources based on his cross-company efforts in preparation for the successful launch of three brands.\nMurphy left AstraZeneca in June 2011, joining Delta Point as Executive Account Director. His commitment to excellence and leadership ability lead to his promotion to Vice-President, and according to Acuff, \"those same qualities are what will make him a successful President.\" Acuff will continue in his role as CEO and will work closely with Murphy on strategic decisions and client relations as Delta Point seeks to expand its industry influence.\nAbout Delta Point, Inc.\nDelta Point focuses on identifying and diagnosing those small changes that can make a big difference in driving brand sales. We are most effective in helping organizations that are launching a new product and can't afford to fail; facing new, heavy, or generic competition; challenged with a complex message; or when sales results are not what they should be. Delta Point acknowledges the significance of the sales organization—the first line sales manager and the sales professional—because even with the right strategy and messages, much of the brand's success is based on how the sales professional performs when in front of the customer. Organizational sales excellence requires a commitment across the commercial organization—of Marketing, Sales, Leadership, and Training—and this is exactly where Delta Point can make a difference.\nContact:\nJerry Acuff, CEO\nDelta Point, Inc.\n480-296-9972\nE-mail: 191743@email4pr.com\nhttp://www.deltapoint.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/former-astrazeneca-leader-becomes-president-of-delta-point-inc-300613190.html\nSOURCE Delta Point, Inc.",
