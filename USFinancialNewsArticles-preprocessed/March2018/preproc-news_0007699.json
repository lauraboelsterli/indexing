    "text": "Members of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) voted in favor of a coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives on Sunday, opening the way to a new government for Europe's largest economy.\nTwo thirds of the membership backed the deal, a party official said -- a wider margin than many had expected -- ending more than five months of political uncertainty after an inconclusive election.\nThe result is set to hand long-serving chancellor Merkel a fourth term in office at a time when the European Union is looking to its largest country for leadership on a host of economic and security issues.\nIt clears the way for a re-run of the \"grand coalition\" that has governed Germany since 2013.\nActing SPD leader Olaf Scholz said at the party's Berlin headquarters: \"The vast majority of SPD members followed the party leadership's suggestion.\"\n\"We now have clarity: the SPD will join the next German government,\" he added.\nScholz had said on Saturday turn-out in the poll had been \"very, very high\" after an intense internal campaign that pitted the party's pro-coalition leadership against its more radical youth wing, which campaigned for \"No\".\nThe SPD initially planned to go into opposition after a disastrous result in September's election, but agreed to negotiate with Merkel's conservatives after talks with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmentalist Greens on a three-way tie-up collapsed in November.\nThey thrashed out a coalition agreement which SPD leaders hailed for its commitments to strengthening the EU and giving them some key government roles Merkel could be sworn in as Chancellor by mid-March.",
