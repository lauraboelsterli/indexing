On the creative side, Shannon Murphy has joined the agency as Associate Creative Director.\nCommenting on the appointments, TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York CEO Rob Schwartz said:\n\"Lawson is a natural leader, and really understands the intricacies of what our clients want and need as a global brand and business.

It's a pleasure and privilege to welcome these leaders into the fold in New York.\"\n\"It's also a pleasure and privilege to work alongside Tara Hagan,\" he added. \"In her two years with TBWA, she has impressed and influenced clients, prospects and fellow employees at every turn. As Director of Digital Strategy and Content Planning, she'll have the opportunity to spread and grow that influence in two essential areas of our business.\"\nAt Huge, Lawson Waring previously served as the most senior account lead and chief liaison for several top agency clients, including Comcast, EA, ExxonMobil, Pizza Hut, and QVC. Prior to Huge, he also had stints at Tribal DDB, where he led ExxonMobil and (RED) as Group Account Director, and R\\GA, where he honed his digital chops overseeing all digital marketing efforts for the SC Johnson family of brands, including Scrubbing Bubbles, Glade, Windex, OFF, Drano, Pledge, and Ziploc. Waring spent the bulk of his early career with The Martin Agency, where he gained valuable experience working across an array of accounts over a 10-year period, such as Walmart, Hanes, Olympus, and Castrol.\nAlberto Botero comes to TBWA from FCB Global, where he was Vice President of Analytics. A former developer and engineer by trade, Botero brings with him more than 15 years of experience in data analytics and technology. Prior to FCB, he served as Director of Analytics at Geometry Global and as Associate Director of Analytics and Accountability at R/GA, working primarily with Nike Digital Sport.

She came to TBWA in 2015 as Director of Business Analytics before shifting into a Content director role. Her keen understanding of B2B and business strategy has been recognized across the TBWA global network, and has been instrumental working on several pieces of business, including Intel, African telecom brand MTN, Intuit Quickbooks, and TD Bank.\nShannon Murphy joins the agency as Associate Creative Director/Copywriter, working primarily on Accenture.
