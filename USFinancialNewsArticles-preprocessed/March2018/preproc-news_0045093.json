    "text": "BALLERUP, Denmark, March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- LiqTech International, Inc. (NYSE: American LIQT), a clean technology company that manufactures and markets highly specialized filtration technologies, filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on March 23, 2018.\nAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn conjunction with the filing of our Annual Report for the 2017 Fiscal Year, we have filed the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, Gregory & Associates, LLC along with our audited financial statements, which are available on the Company's website at www.liqtech.com and in printed form to our shareholders free of charge upon request.\nPursuant to the disclosure requirements of the NYSE American Company Guide Section 610(b), the Company is reporting that its audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, contain an audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm that includes an explanatory note related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. As previosuly announced, the Company has agreed upon a framework to sell an estimated 95 filtration systems to a marine scrubber manufacter during the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years. We believe that sales of filtration systems for marine scrubbers and other applications, along with our cash on hand will sustain our operations for the foreseeable future, but we may need to raise additional funds through public or private sales of equity or debt securities.\nABOUT LIQTECH INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nLiqTech International, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is a clean technology company that for more than a decade has developed and provided state-of-the-art technologies for gas and liquid purification using ceramic silicon carbide filters, particularly highly specialized filters for the control of soot exhaust particles from diesel engines and for liquid filtration. Using nanotechnology, LiqTech develops products using proprietary silicon carbide technology. LiqTech's products are based on unique silicon carbide membranes which facilitate new applications and improve existing technologies. In particular, LiqTech Systems A/S ( www.provital.dk ), the Company's subsidiary, has developed a new standard of water filtration technology to meet the ever increasing demand for higher water quality. By incorporating LiqTech's SiC liquid membrane technology with its longstanding systems design experience and capabilities it offers solutions to the most difficult water pollution problem.\nFor more information, please visit www.liqtech.com\nFollow LiqTech on LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/company/liqtech-international\nFollow LiqTech on Twitter: https://twitter.com/LiqTech\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements.\" Although the forward-looking statements in this release reflect the good faith judgment of management, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.
