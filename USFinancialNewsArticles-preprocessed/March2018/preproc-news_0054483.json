    "text": "- Record Year on All Key Financial Performance Metrics\n- Management to Host Webcast on March 29, 2018 to Discuss Q4 2017 and Full Year 2017 Operating Results\nLAS VEGAS, CV Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) (the “Company”, “CV Sciences”, “our” or “we”) announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nQ4 2017 and 2017 Full Year - Operating Highlights\nRecord Q4 2017 Sales of $7,242,000 , an increase of 126% compared to Q4 2016 Record Q4 2017 Gross Profit of $5,213,600 , an increase of 187% compared to Q4 2016 Record Full Year 2017 Sales of $20,679,200 , an increase of 87% compared to full year 2016 Record Full Year 2017 Gross Margin of $14,488,700 , an increase of 107% compared to full year 2016 Record Full Year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,067,200 , an improvement of $5,040,500, a 170% increase when compared to full year 2016 Record Total 2017 Cash Flow from Operations of $3,615,000, an improvement of $5,519,700, a 276% increase when compared to full year 2016 Increased Retail Channel Distribution to 1,548 Stores as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 57% compared to December 31, 2016 Strong Progress in Drug Development Division including preclinical progress with CVSI-007, the Company’s patent pending synthetic-based cannabidiol, which will be co-administered with nicotine to provide treatment options for smokeless tobacco use and addiction, currently a multibillion market with no currently FDA-approved drugs available to help patients.\nSales for Q4 2017 were $7.2 million and $20.7 million for the full year 2017 demonstrating the Company’s continued organic expansion into all sales channels including the natural product retail, wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. The Company’s natural product retail channel now includes more than 1,500 locations nationwide. CV Sciences plans to continue developing new sales channels and is encouraged by the strength of its branded products as evidenced by SPINS ® Scan data, which positions the Company as the #l selling hemp product line in the natural products industry.\nGross profit for Q4 2017 was $5.2 million and $14.5 million for the full year 2017 and indicates the Company’s ability to expand sales while maintaining strong gross margins.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 was $2.1 million and shows strong operating leverage from the Company’s significant investment in inventory, product development, systems, marketing and distribution.\n“We ended 2017 with tremendous momentum by hitting record metrics for Q4 and an overall impressive and record year. Our operating performance further validates our ability to grow profitably and generate cash flow,” said Joseph Dowling, CFO of CV Sciences. “In every aspect, we set new financial performance records and laid the groundwork for continued profitable growth. On the drug development side, we continue to make steady progress in advancing CVSI-007 - our proprietary lead drug candidate - which addresses the multibillion dollar smokeless tobacco use and addiction market.”\nFinancial highlights for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are presented below:\nFor the years ended December 31, YOY Change Financial Highlights 2017 2016 $ % GAAP Measures: Product Sales, net $ 20,679,200 $ 11,060,600 $ 9,618,600 87% Gross Profit 14,488,700 6,997,600 7,491,100 107% Cash Generated from Operating Activities 3,615,000 (2,053,700 ) 5,668,700 276% Non-GAAP Measure (unaudited): EBITDA $ (4,208,000 ) $ (12,029,600 ) $ 7,821,600 65% Adjusted EBITDA 2,067,200 (2,973,300 ) 5,040,500 170% Balance Sheet and Liquidity Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had unrestricted cash of $2,013,000 and total cash of $2,792,000. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company increased its total cash position by $1,734,000. Stockholders’ equity amounted to approximately $16.4 million as of December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCV Sciences focuses on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its business relationships and its resulting operating performance and financial position. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (net income [loss], minus interest income, plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization), further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash expenses and other adjustments as set forth below. CV Sciences management presents Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important measure of performance and it is a meaningful financial metric in assessing operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that management believes are not representative of the Company’s core business, such as certain non-cash items and other adjustments. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The term “Adjusted EBITDA” is not defined under GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. CV Sciences management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental information.\nA reconciliation from the Company’s net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is detailed below:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 2016 Net loss $ (4,897,139 ) $ (14,141,298 ) Interest income (2 ) (27,658 ) Interest expense 506,384 1,086,793 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 35,400 857,400 Depreciation of property & equipment 147,395 195,167 EBITDA (4,207,962 ) (12,029,596 ) EBITDA Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense (1) 3,419,799 3,274,034 Gain on collection of notes receivable (2) - (379,486 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (3) 188,822 - Gain on derivative liability (4) (248,875 ) (147,200 ) Royalty buy-out (5) 2,432,000 - Impairment of inventory (6) - 3,562,459 Impairment of PhytoSPHERE goodwill and intangible assets (7) - 2,746,512 Bad debt expense (8) 483,407 - Total EBITDA Adjustments 6,275,153 9,056,319 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,067,191 $ (2,973,277 ) (1) Represents stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and stock grants awarded to employees, consultants and non-executive directors based on the grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\n(2) Represents gain on collection of note receivable.\n(3) Represents loss on extinguishment of debt.\n(4) Represents the gain on changes in derivative liabilities.\n(5) Represents the share-based royalty buy-out associated the CanX acquisition.\n(6) Represents the impairment expense of certain raw material inventory.\n(7) Represents the impairment expense associated with acquired goodwill and intangible assets.\n(8) Recognition of the write-off of certain Company’s accounts receivable during 2017.\nFor further discussion of the Company’s financial results for the years ended December 31, 2017, please refer to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related Management’s Discussion and Analysis, which can be found at www.cvsciences.com or EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2018.\nManagement to Host Financial Results Conference Call\nThe Company is scheduled to host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results at 1:15 p.m.PDT/4:15 p.m. EDT on Thursday, March 29, 2018.\nCV Sciences’ CFO Joseph Dowling will lead the call to provide an operational and financial summary of the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.
