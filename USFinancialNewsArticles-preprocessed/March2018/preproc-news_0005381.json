    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif., Pacific Ethanol, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEIX), a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels and high-quality alcohol products in the United States, reported its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nNeil Koehler, Pacific Ethanol’s president and CEO, stated: “In 2017, we strengthened our platform by further diversifying our product mix with the acquisition of ICP and gaining efficiencies through consolidating 250 million gallons of ethanol and high-quality alcohol production at one site in Pekin, Illinois. We remain focused on reducing costs at all of our facilities, optimizing the profitability of our marketing business, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.\n“In 2018, we are seeing an improvement in production margins with exports off to a strong start and demand for transportation fuels increasing as we approach the summer driving season. With our success in enhancing our operations and marketing performance we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these promising trends.”\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to 2016\nNet sales were $395.3 million, compared to $441.7 million.

Cash and cash equivalents were $49.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $64.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to 2016\nNet sales were $1,632.3 million, compared to $1,624.8 million.

The pass code will be 1883448.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement believes that certain financial measures not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") are useful measures of operations. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as unaudited net income (loss) attributed to Pacific Ethanol before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, asset impairments, purchase accounting adjustments, fair value adjustments, and depreciation and amortization expense. A table is provided at the end of this release that provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management provides this non-GAAP measure so that investors will have the same financial information that management uses, which may assist investors in properly assessing the company's performance on a period-over-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other measure of performance under GAAP, or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP.\nAbout Pacific Ethanol, Inc.\nPacific Ethanol, Inc.
