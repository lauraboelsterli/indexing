    "text": "Move over, grandma and grandpa. Your Millennial grandkids reported losing money to financial scams last year than you did, new government data shows.\nIn all, 40% of Americans in their twenties who reported fraud in 2017 indicated they lost money to the schemes, the Federal Trade Commission said last week in its annual databook of consumer complaints.\nThe percentage surpassed the 18% of U.S. consumers 70 or older who reported they lost money to fraudsters last year, the FTC said.\nMore from USA Today:\nBarbie releasing 17 new dolls, from Frida Kahlo to Chloe Kim, for International Women's Day\nNatty Boh unveils new beer for summer: Crab Shack Shandy\nThese are the 10 best and worst states for women\nHowever, the median loss reported by adults in their seventies was $621, and for those aged 80 or over it was $1,092. Both age groups reported a higher median loss than the $400 for those aged 20-29, the data showed.\nThe findings emerged from the first year in which the federal watchdog agency broke out consumer complaint data by age groups .\nOverall, the data includes 2017 complaints reported by 2.68 million consumers, down from the 2.98 million who reported fraud, identity theft and other consumer problems in 2016.\nConsumer complaints about debt collections declined year over year in 2017 but still remained the top complaint category with 23% of all reports. The number of debt collection reports was due in part to complaints submitted by a data contributor who collects them via a mobile app, the FTC said.\nIdentity theft represented the second biggest complaint category, with nearly 14% of all reports. Credit card fraud was the most common type of identity theft that consumers reported, followed by tax fraud.\nImposter scams, frauds when someone pretends to be a government official, a loved one in trouble, or someone else, were the third most common complaint. Consumers reported they lost more money to imposter scams — $328 million in all — than any other type of fraud, the report showed.\nMilitary consumers reported losing the most to imposter scams, with $16 million in all.\n\"While we received fewer overall complaints in 2017, consumers reported losing more money to fraud than they did the year before,\" Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement issued with the data. \"This underscores the importance of the FTC's work in educating consumers and cracking down on the scammers who try to take their money.\"",
