    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Colo., March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gaia , Inc. (NASDAQ:GAIA) (the “Company”), a conscious community and media company, today announced that it has priced its underwritten registered public offering of 2,333,333 shares of its Class A common stock at a price to the public of $15 per share. In addition, the Company granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount, up to an additional 350,000 shares of Class A common stock to cover over-allotments, if any. All shares to be sold in the offering will be offered by the Company. The offering is expected to close on March 26, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nIn connection with the offering, certain directors and executive officers of the Company agreed to purchase in the aggregate 134,733 shares of Class A common stock in the offering.\nThe total gross proceeds from the offering are expected to be approximately $35 million. After deducting the underwriters’ discount and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, the net proceeds are expected to be approximately $32.3 million. These amounts assume no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital.\nB. Riley FBR, Inc. is acting as the sole book-running manager for the offering. Lake Street Capital Markets will serve as lead manager, and Dougherty & Company will serve as co-manager for the offering. Roth Capital Partners acted as an adviser to the Company.\nThe shares of Class A common stock described above are being offered by the Company pursuant to a registration statement (File No. 333-213895) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which has been declared effective. The preliminary prospectus supplement related to the offering and accompanying base prospectus have been filed with the SEC and are available on the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov . Copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the final prospectus supplement, when available, may be obtained from B. Riley FBR, Inc., Attention: Prospectus Department, 1300 17 th St. North, Ste. 1300, Arlington, VA 22209, email: prospectuses@brileyfbr.com , telephone: (800) 846-5050.\nBefore investing, interested parties should read the preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the Company has filed or will file with the SEC for more complete information about the Company and the offering. This announcement shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the common stock, nor shall there be any sale of the Class A common stock in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would not be permitted.\nAbout Gaia\nGaia is a global video streaming service and community that provides curated conscious media in three primary channels—Seeking Truth, Transformation and Yoga—to its 400,000 subscribers in over 170 countries.
