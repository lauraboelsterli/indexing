FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of the Sydney offices of Goldman Sachs in Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo Sky News reported on Wednesday that the U.S. investment bank and the British medical charity have tabled a 1.2 billion pound bid for about 5,500 premises owned by National Rail, the British state-backed entity which is independently run. Goldman Sachs and Wellcome Trust declined to confirm details of the bid. “Wellcome Trust and Goldman Sachs have submitted a non-binding indicative offer for the commercial estate of Network Rail,” a spokeswoman for Wellcome Trust said in an emailed statement. A spokesman from Goldman Sachs confirmed the news but declined to comment further. Reporting by Sarah Young; additional reporting by Emma Rumney; editing by Costas Pitas and Susan Fenton",
