    "text": "President Donald Trump is doing the right thing by proposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur told CNBC on Friday.\nTrump announced Thursday that the U.S. will impose a 25 percent tariff for steel and a 10 percent tariff for aluminum as early as next week.\n\"Regions like my own have been heavily harmed by this very unreciprocal trade across the board, almost in every sector. Steel has been particularly hard hit,\" said Kaptur, who represents Ohio's 9th District in the northern part of the state.\n\"We cannot afford to lose the steel production platform of this country. So we have to find our way through the thicket and begin to rebuild critical industries just as we've done with our automotive industry,\" she said on \" Power Lunch .\"\nGetty Images Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) Trump's proposal has sparked fears of a trade war and rising consumer prices.\nNobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller told \"Power Lunch\" that he wonders if Trump will start raising other tariffs.\n\"Even if he doesn't there will be other countries who will retaliate and they'll get bigger. This is really like a first shot in a war and that's what is worrisome,\" he said.\nProponents, however, believe the tariffs are needed to help level an unfair playing field.\n\"We have to have markets that are open and free. When markets become controlled or the United States becomes a dump market and jobs are wiped out and entire platforms are wiped out, we lose our defense industrial base,\" Kaptur said.\nShe is not alone among her Democratic colleagues in supporting Trump's tariff proposal.\nSen. Sherrod Brown , D-Ohio, said Thursday, \"This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating.\"",
