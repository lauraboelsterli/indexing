    "text": "Jack Eichel scored the tiebreaking goal with 10:23 remaining in the third period Monday night as the Buffalo Sabres posted a 3-2 victory over the host Toronto Maple Leafs, whose team-record 13-game home winning streak was halted.\nEichel snapped a 2-2 tie by taking the lead pass from Jason Pominville near the neutral. He skated through the slot and lifted a backhander from below the right faceoff circle under Fredrik Andersen’s legs while absorbing contact from defenseman Nikita Zaitsev.\nEichel also scored Buffalo’s first goal and recorded his fifth multi-goal game of the season and 15th career. It was his first two goals since returning March 17 from a 15-game absence due to an ankle injury and he matched his career high by scoring his 23rd and 24th goals.\nDefenseman Casey Nelson also scored while Zemgus Girgensons recorded two assists as Buffalo snapped a four-game losing streak.\nPatrick Marleau scored a power-play goal late in the second period as the Maple Leafs lost at home for the first time since Jan. 22. Marleau also set up Nazem Kadri’s 30th goal shortly before breaking the tie.\nChad Johnson made 39 saves for Buffalo.\nAndersen made 24 saves, including a post-to-post stop on Eichel in the second period.\nEichel helped create a turnover by Auston Matthews and then scored his first goal. He poked the puck away from Matthews in the right corner and skated through the slot where he waited for the centering pass from Girgensons. After he gained possession, he did a move on Andersen and lifted his 23rd goal over his left shoulder.\nToronto tied the game with 2:29 left in the second when Kadri lifted a backhanded pass from Mitch Marner over Johnson moments after a turnover by Marco Scandella behind the net.\nMarleau scored 71 seconds later when he swept in a loose puck after Johnson could not handle the rebound of Matthews’ shot and was out of position to stop Marleau.\nThe Sabres tied it when Nelson lifted a slap shot from the point over into the net 7:56 into the third after Andersen saves on Scott Wilson and Johan Larsson from near the net. Toronto challenged for goaltender interference, but the call stood.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
