    "text": "BERLIN, March 26 (Reuters) - Facebook’s use of data it culls from partner websites is under investigation in Germany, the head of its cartel office said, as its justice minister summoned executives from the under-fire social media network to a meeting over privacy concerns.\nCartel Office President Andreas Mundt told Tagesspiegel newspaper that users were largely unaware how much information flowed to the social network when they visited third-party websites with Facebook integration.\nThe office was working on the basis of possible abuses stemming from “the collection and assessment of data from third-party sources outside Facebook,” he said in an interview, extracts from which were published on Monday.\nA Facebook spokesman gave no immediate comment.\nThe firm is at the centre of a storm over allegations that data from millions of its users was improperly used by consultants Cambridge Analytica to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.\nIn Germany, where memories of two 20th-century totalitarian surveillance states make privacy issues especially sensitive, Justice Minister Katarina Barley met with Facebook executives to air concerns.\nThe ministry has scheduled a news conference for Monday afternoon.\n“Interfaces to other web pages allow data to flow to Facebook,” Mundt said. “That happens even if you don’t click the ‘Like’ button, but load a website with one embedded,” he added, saying users were often unaware of this.\nThe cartel office is already examining whether the network is abusing what Mundt called its “market-controlling position”.\nReporting by Thomas Escritt Editing by Michael Nienaber and John Stonestreet\n ",
