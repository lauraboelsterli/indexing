The volume traded was 15.09 billion as of the last full trading day. ** As of 04:03 GMT, 29.18 ** The Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day moving average and below its 200-day moving average. ** In Hong Kong, the sub-index of the Hang Seng index tracking energy shares dipped 0.7 percent while the IT sector fell 0.7 percent. The top gainer on Hang Seng was China Resources Land Ltd up 1.64 percent, while the biggest loser was Hengan International Group Company Ltd which was down 2.28 percent.\nReporting by Samuel Shen, Luoyan Liu and John Ruwitch; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ",
