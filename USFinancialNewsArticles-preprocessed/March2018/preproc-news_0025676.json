    "text": "Former A+E Networks Chief Abbe Raven to Assume Interim Chairman Responsibilities While Successor Search Is Launched\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hearst and The Walt Disney Company today announced that A+E Networks President and Chief Executive Officer Nancy Dubuc has decided to step down from her role, effective April 16, 2018. Abbe Raven, chairman emeritus and former CEO of A+E Networks, who retired from the company in 2015 after 33 years, will return as acting chair to oversee the transition until a replacement is named.\nIn a joint statement, Steven R. Swartz, president and CEO of Hearst, and Ben Sherwood, co-chair, Disney Media Networks and president, Disney|ABC Television, said: “In her roughly 20 years at A+E Networks, Nancy played a major role in building the success of A&E, HISTORY and Lifetime, and we thank her for her leadership. We are also very grateful to Abbe, a former CEO of the company and one of A+E’s first employees, for agreeing to return on a temporary basis as acting chair.”\nNancy Dubuc Statement:\n“For nearly 20 years, I have called A+E Networks home and the team has been an extended part of my family. Together, we have had the privilege to build some of the most iconic brands in media. Every step of my career, I have had the opportunity to learn and grow from some of the most inspiring and innovative minds at A+E and in both the creative and business community. I could not be prouder of what we achieved together.\n“Anyone who knows me well, knows I am an entrepreneur, creator, rebel and disruptor at heart. I have a famous neon sign in my office that blares ‘Who dares wins.’ After 20 years at A+E the hardest thing will be to leave the people and company I love. But, as a creative executive and leader, and to stay true to my personal mantra, I need my next dare and my next challenge.\n“I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to our owners at Hearst and The Walt Disney Company for their unwavering support and belief in me over my long career here. I’d especially like to thank Steve and Ben for supporting my decision to write my next chapter.\n“I have supreme confidence in the brave storytellers and management team at A+E and I will always be rooting for and watching proudly from the sidelines—even as I head off to my next adventure.”\nAbbe Raven Statement:\n“Nancy and I have worked together for almost 20 years, and I have seen the tremendous accomplishments and innovation she has brought to A+E—from its creative content, to attracting award-winning talent and the digital and studio businesses she has nurtured. A+E is a special place with extraordinary and talented people. I look forward to helping the Board and leading the talented A+E teams during this transition.”\nAbout A+E Networks\nA+E Networks® is an award-winning, global media content company offering consumers a diverse communications environment ranging from linear channels to websites, gaming, watch apps and educational software.
