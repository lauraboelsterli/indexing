    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Rajeev Sinha has joined Burns & McDonnell in its Business & Technology Solutions Group as the firm continues to add expertise to help utilities, manufacturers and other industrial clients leverage their data to solve business challenges.\nSinha, a project manager, works with clients on enterprise systems integration , part of a comprehensive suite of services offered by Burns & McDonnell to deliver efficiency, consistency and increased productivity for a wide range of users.\n\"Rajeev's experience in delivering data management and enterprise architecture design will provide our clients with an ability to meet their most challenging operational problems, and streamline their business outcomes, while enhancing our comprehensive solution offerings,\" says Chris Underwood, general manager of Business & Technology Solutions at Burns & McDonnell. \"Our in-depth understanding of our clients' business coupled with a robust systems integration offering is a key differentiator and we're excited to add Rajeev to our team.\"\nSinha comes to Burns & McDonnell with more than 15 years of experience, having worked early in his career as a developer at Oracle — engineering key functionalities in the company's suite of enterprise applications — before moving into functional consulting roles. Since 2006 he's been integrating enterprise software systems for clients in oil and gas, manufacturing and other industrial sectors. He recently led a project that streamlined $1 billion of annual capital budget approval, enabling the process to be completed in six weeks rather than three months. This saved the manufacturer money, enabled plant improvement projects sooner and offered better ongoing visibility into capital spending. He has worked on various projects related to strategic planning, setting IT investment road maps, and implementing business process improvements focused on maximizing IT investments in project-driven organizations.\nAt Burns & McDonnell, he adds his experience to a team already skilled in technology consulting and other software solutions. Enterprise systems integration allows clients to accelerate deployment of capital, drive organizational efficiency and optimize process systems, facilities and operations.\n\"I enjoy the challenge,\" says Sinha, who works nationwide from the Houston office of Burns & McDonnell. \"This is a great opportunity to make a difference, to apply my best practices knowledge across multiple industries and to optimize IT/OT investments for clients by delivering integrated system solutions.\"\nFor photos and support materials, please visit our MEDIA KIT .\nAbout Burns & McDonnell\nBurns & McDonnell is a family of companies made up of more than 6,000 engineers, architects, construction professionals, scientists, consultants and entrepreneurs with offices across the country and throughout the world.
