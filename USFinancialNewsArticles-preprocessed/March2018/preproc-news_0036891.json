    "text": " 33 AM / Updated 34 minutes ago Reading part ways with manager Jaap Stam   (Reuters) - Reading parted company with manager Jaap Stam on Wednesday after a string of disappointing results that has left the second-tier club languishing in 20th place in the 24-team Championship, three points above the relegation zone. Soccer Football - Championship - Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Reading - Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton,   Reading manager Jaap Stam gestures Action Images/Peter Cziborra The former Manchester United and Netherlands defender took charge of Reading last season, leading the team to a third-placed finish, but missed out on promotion to the Premier League after losing to Huddersfield Town in the playoff final. Stam’s fate was sealed after a dismal run of one win in his last 18 league games, culminating in a 3-2 defeat at Norwich City on Saturday. Their next game is not until March 30 at home to Queens Park Rangers. Reading announced the decision on their website (www.readingfc.co.uk), saying majority shareholders Yongge Dai and Xiu Li Dai had deemed the change necessary after “careful consideration”. “We would like to thank Jaap for his hard work and commitment to the club, in particular noting what he achieved in a memorable first season in club management, and we wish him the very best of luck,” the club said in a statement.
