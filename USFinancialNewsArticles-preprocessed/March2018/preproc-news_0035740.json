The bodies were recovered from a mass grave and DNA tests had confirmed them to be the construction workers who went missing from the Iraqi city of Mosul, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj told parliament. “With full proof I can say these 39 are dead,” the minister said. The government had for years said it would only declare the men dead once it had full evidence. Reporting by Malini Menon; Writing by Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Robert Birsel",
