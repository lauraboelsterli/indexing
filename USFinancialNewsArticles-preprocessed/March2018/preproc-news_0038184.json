    "text": " 20 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago BP to drill first deepwater oil well in Mexican block in 2020 Reuters Staff 1 Min Read MEXICO CITY, March 20 (Reuters) - British oil major BP will drill its first deepwater exploration well at a block it operates in the southern Gulf of Mexico during the third quarter of 2020, according to a plan approved Tuesday by Mexican oil regulator CNH. The four-year exploration plan for the block located in the Gulf’s Salina Basin is also expected to lead to an investment of $199.5 million and add up to 75 million barrels of oil equivalent in reserves, according to the CNH. Norway’s Statoil and France’s Total are equity partners in the BP-led consortium, which won the development rights to the block in Mexico’s first-ever deepwater oil auction in late 2016.
