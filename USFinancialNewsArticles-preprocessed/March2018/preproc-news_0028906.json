    "text": "0 COMMENTS Amazon is voluntarily recalling about 260,000 of its AmazonBasics portable battery chargers due to potential fire and chemical burn risks, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nThe portable power bank’s battery can overheat and ignite, posing fire and burn dangers, according to the recall alert posted on the commission’s website Tuesday.\nThe recall comes after Amazon received 53 reports of the power banks overheating in the U.S., including one report of chemical burns due to contact with battery acid and four reports of property damage, including fire and smoke damage, the recall note said.\nAmazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box. Consumers should immediately unplug and stop using the recalled power banks and contact Amazon to find out how to return the item and receive a full refund. All known purchasers are being contacted directly by the company, according to the recall note.\nThe recall involves six versions of AmazonBasics’ portable lithium-ion battery chargers, with product ID numbers B00LRK8EVO, B00LRK8HJ8, B00LRK8I7O, B00LRK8IV0, B00LRK8JDC or B00ZQ4JQAA printed on the back.\nThe portable battery chargers were sold on Amazon.com , AMZN -0.64% Amazon Bookstores and Amazon Pop-Up Stores from December 2014 through July 2017 for between $9 and $40. The manufacturer is Guoguang Electric Co. Limited, of China.\nCustomers affected can contact Amazon, by calling 855-215-5134 or online at amazonpowerbank.expertinquiry.com .\nWrite to Aisha Al-Muslim at aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com",
