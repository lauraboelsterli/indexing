Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON, March 29 (Reuters) - Barclays has agreed to pay $2 billion for allegedly causing billions of dollars of losses to investors by engaging in a fraudulent scheme to sell residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. \nThe department said the firm misled investors about the quality of the mortgage loans backing those deals and committed violations of mail fraud and bank fraud. According to the Justice Departmentâ€™s statement, Barclays disputes the allegations. Reporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Eric Beech",
