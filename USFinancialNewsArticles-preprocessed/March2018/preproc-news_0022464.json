    "text": "March 12, 2018 / 2:35 PM / Updated 21 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-Toronto stocks edge up, following global markets higher Reuters Staff 2 Min Read March 12 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose modestly on Monday, buoyed by improved risk appetite in global markets but declines in energy shares and gold producers capped gains as commodity prices fell. * At 10:08 a.m. EDT (1408 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 15.53 points, or 0.1 percent, at 15,593.34. * The energy group retreated 0.3 percent, weighed by Suncor Energy Inc, which fell 0.7 percent to C$41.47, and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, down 0.2 percent at C$38.83. * U.S. crude prices were down 1.1 percent at $61.39 a barrel, erasing earlier gains on expectations that U.S. output will rise this year. * The gold subsector further pressured the market, falling 0.3 percent as investors sold gold amid stronger risk appetite. Iamgold Corp fell 2.9 percent to C$6.34, while Eldorado Gold Corp lost 3.1 percent to C$1.41. * The losses in the commodity-related sectors were offset by a better tone in global markets as world stocks surged to a two-week high. * In Toronto, financial shares helped support the market, with the sector up 0.2 percent. Bank of Nova Scotia was one of the biggest lifts on the index, edging up 0.4 percent to C$81.03. * The TSX posted two new 52-week highs and three new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were 32 new 52-week highs and nine new lows. Volume on the TSX index was 21.19 million shares. (Reporting by Leah Schnurr in Ottawa Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",
