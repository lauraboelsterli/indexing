For example, the states with the lowest incomes tend to be in the Southern and Midwest regions while the highest incomes are located in the Northeast and the West.\nHowever, there's also a correlation between the cost of living and incomes in every state. For example, Mississippi is the state with the lowest cost of living and the lowest average household income. Meanwhile, DC has the highest average household income and the No. 2 highest cost of living behind Hawaii. This makes sense — in order to afford their state's high cost of living, DC residents need higher incomes than other Americans to pay for expenses.\nMethodology: GOBankingRates sourced all incomes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis and the American Association of University Women. \nLike this story?
