    "text": "Tech Guide Smugglers used drones to bring $79.8 million worth of iPhones into China. They just got busted Customs officers in Shenzhen busted a group of criminals using drones to smuggle 500 million yuan ($79.8 million) worth of smartphones from Hong Kong, according to state media. Authorities arrested 26 suspects who used drones to fly two 200-meter cables between Hong Kong and the mainland to transport refurbished iPhones. Those iPhones had a total value of 500 million yuan, according to the Legal Daily. Published 11 Hours Ago Reuters \nCustoms officers in southern China's technology hub Shenzhen busted a group of criminals using drones to smuggle 500 million yuan ($79.8 million) worth of smartphones from Hong Kong to Shenzhen, the official Legal Daily reported on Friday. \nAuthorities arrested 26 suspects who used drones to fly two 200-meter (660-feet) cables between Hong Kong and the mainland to transport refurbished iPhones with a total value of 500 million yuan, the paper said in a report on the crackdown by Shenzhen and Hong Kong customs. \n\"It's the first case found in China that drones were being used in cross-border smuggling crimes,\" the Legal Daily reported, citing a news conference held by Shenzhen customs on Thursday. \nThe smugglers usually operated after midnight and only needed seconds to transport small bags holding more than 10 iPhones using the drones, the report quoted customs as saying. \nThe gang could smuggle as many as 15,000 phones across the border in one night, it said. \nRegulating the use of drones has become an important task for China, the world's largest manufacturer of consumer drones. \nChina published strict rules last year to tackle incidents of drones straying into aircraft flight paths, including requiring owners of civilian drones to register craft up to a certain weight under their real names. \nShenzhen customs was quoted by the Legal Daily as saying it would closely monitor new types of smuggling with high-tech devices and enhance their capability with technical equipment, including drones and high-resolution monitors, to detect smuggling activity.
