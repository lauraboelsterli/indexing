So there is cost inflation, but it’s manageable,” he told Reuters, describing the group’s outlook as positive.\nMondi has also embarked on a 750 million euro project to increase capacity at its paper mills and secure organic revenue from 2019 onwards by catering to higher demand in container and corrugated packing and some areas of consumer packaging.\n“With regards to M&A, we are active. We look at a number of opportunities, but even if none of them materialise we have this huge capex programme ... which will secure our organic growth from 2019 on,” he said.\nOswald also said that changing trends in packaging demand would benefit Mondi, pointing to growing pressure on businesses to reduce unnecessary packaging and the use of plastics.\n“One way to reduce packaging is to move it from rigid packing, such as glass, metals or rigid plastics packaging,” he said, adding that flexible packaging such as that made by Mondi usually requires only a fifth of the material of rigid alternatives and cuts energy costs.\nShares in the group, which also announced a 9 percent increase in full-year ordinary dividend to 62 euro cents per share, rose 1.7 percent to 303.90 South African rand in Johannesburg and were up 1.1 percent at 18.61 pounds by 0947 GMT in London.
