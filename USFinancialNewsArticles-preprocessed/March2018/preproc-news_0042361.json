    "text": "MEXICO CITY, March 25 (Reuters) - Mexican retailer Grupo Comercial Chedraui has reached a deal with ACON Investments to acquire Texas-based grocery store chain Fiesta Mart, the company said in a statement on Sunday.\nThe acquisition of Fiesta Mart’s 63 locations strengthens Chedraui’s presence in the U.S. retail market focused on Mexican-American consumers, a fast-growing segment of the market.\nThe company made the purchase through its U.S. unit Bodega Latina, and the price of the acquisition reflects 0.2 percent of the firm’s projected 2018 sales and 6.6 percent of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EDITDA) for the year, the statement added.\nThe companies did not disclose the purchase price.\nReporting by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ",
