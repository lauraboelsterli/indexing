FILE PHOTO: Rupert Stadler, Chairman of the Board of Management of Audi, gestures during a presentation at the 88th International Motor Show at Palexpo in Geneva, Switzerland, March 6, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Volkswagen’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) luxury division last July said 850,000 diesel models with 6-cylinder and 8-cylinder engines needed an update of their engine-management software to bring emissions into line with legal limits. The affected models also include vehicles from the VW brand and Porsche. “There will be further recalls,” Stadler told journalists on Friday, without providing further details. The KBA has to date issued 6 recall notifications affecting 156,000 cars. Reporting by Irene Preisinger; Writing by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Maria Sheahan",
