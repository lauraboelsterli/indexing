    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Net profit at Italian coffee maker Massimo Zanetti ( MZB.MI ) rose 8 percent last year helped by fiscal reform in the United States, which lowered taxes the group pays overseas.\nThe owner of Segafredo, Chock full o‘Nuts and Puccino coffee brands said on Wednesday full-year net profit came in at 18.1 million euros as taxes more than halved at 4.85 million euros ($6 million). Nearly half of Zanetti’s sales are in the U.S.\nIn 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose nearly 10 percent year-on-year to 75 million euros, net of non-recurring costs of 6.3 million euros\nlinked to restructuring operations in Portugal, Spain and Italy.\nThe group expects revenue to rise between 2 and 4 percent and adjusted EBITDA to grow between 5 and 8 percent this year.\nSales in 2017 were up 4.2 percent at current exchange rates but volumes of sold ground coffee fell 1.3 percent.\nReporting by Francesca Landini, editing by Giulia Segreti\n ",
