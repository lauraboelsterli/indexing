    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean government official said disclosing details of actions taken by currency authorities is likely to ease concerns about the country being labeled a “currency manipulator” by the United States.\n“Disclosing the details is likely to take some steam off (the review),” a government official told Reuters.\nHe asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nSouth Korea, along with China, avoided the currency-manipulator label in twice-yearly U.S. Treasury report, but was kept on a currency “monitoring list”.\nThe finance ministry said the ongoing discussions with the U.S. about currency policies are separate from KOREA-U.S. FTA talks.\nReporting by Cynthia Kim; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ",
