    "text": "1 COMMENTS U.S. government bond prices rose again Wednesday as shaky trading in global stocks increased investors’ appetite for the safety of government debt.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.777%, compared with 2.790% Tuesday.\nYields, which fall as bond prices rise, have largely slid over the past week, as sharp swings in stocks from the U.S. to Europe to Hong Kong have sent investors into the safety of assets that tend to fare well during periods of market volatility.\nThe yield on the 10-year note took a leg lower early Wednesday after the government said the U.S. trade deficit widened to $75.4 billion in February, slightly more than economists had expected and up from a revised $75.3 billion in January.\nThe 10-year yield then pared much of its decline for the day after the Treasury Department’s auction of 7-year notes—the latest in a series of nearly $300 billion of issuance this week—was met with tepid demand.\nThe government auctioned off $29 billion of 7-year notes at a yield of 2.27%, 1.7 basis points above where the yield traded before the auction. And the bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of overall demand, clocked in at 2.34, below the average of 2.54, according to BMO Capital Markets.\nConcerns that a wave of new debt could weigh on the prices of outstanding bonds had kept many investors on edge heading into the week. Still, Treasurys managed to hold their ground, with the yield on the 10-year note notching its fourth decline in five trading sessions.\nContinued swings in the stock market should keep pressure on bond yields heading into quarter-end, analysts say, even as many investors believe a pickup in inflation will ultimately stall the bond rally.\n“While the bond market is not likely to regain its horns anytime soon, it does indicate how vulnerable the equity market is to bad news, and how quickly investors will seek the safety of U.S. Treasurys when that bad news hits the tape,” said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James.\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com",
