    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas & HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Venado Oil and Gas, LLC (“Venado”) and KKR today announced that they have closed on the acquisition of the operated and non-operated Eagle Ford assets of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE: COG) for a purchase price of $765 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. Venado and KKR acquired interests which include approximately 303 gross/203 net wells and 74,400 net acres situated primarily in the Eagle Ford oil window of South Texas (Atascosa, Frio, and LaSalle counties). During the fourth quarter of 2017, the assets produced 15,656 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (85% oil, 5% natural gas and 10% NGLs).\nVenado CEO Scott Garrick stated, “The Cabot acquisition is a high-quality asset positioned in the oil fairway of the Eagle Ford. The combination of a strong production base and an attractive inventory of future drilling locations fit well with our disciplined business model of operating with free cash flow while supporting long term growth. We look forward to implementing our leading edge drilling and completion designs in one of the best producing basins in the country.”\nDavid Rockecharlie, Member and Head of Energy Real Assets for KKR, commented, “We are excited to continue to build a first-in-class Eagle Ford asset position alongside Scott and his team.

Garrick added, “I am very pleased about what the Venado and KKR partnership has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. We will continue to execute on our Eagle Ford pure-play strategy to consolidate premier liquids-rich assets.”\nThe Venado partnership is principally funded by KKR’s Energy Income and Growth Fund I (“EIGF”).
