The video shows a U.S. Marshall shooting dead, racketeering defendant and gang member Siale Angilau as he attacks a testifying witness. The Department of Justice had wanted to suppress the video for fear it would spark a wave of gang-related retaliation. Rough cut (no reporter narration).   \nDramatic video of a deadly 2014 courthouse shooting in Salt Lake City has been released after a long court battle by the Utah Media Coalition.
