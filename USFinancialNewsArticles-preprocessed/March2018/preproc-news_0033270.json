In an environment of increasing change and complexity, we have maintained a steady charge-off rate, demonstrating the creditworthiness of our customers, and the capabilities and reliability of our advanced credit risk assessment technology. At of the end of 2017, our 90+ delinquency rate was 1.14%, lower than the third quarter’s 1.22%.”\n4 “M6+ charge-off rate’’ refers to, with respect to on- and off-balance sheet loans originated during a specified time period, which we refer to as a vintage, the total outstanding principal balance of the loans that become over six months delinquent during a specified period, divided by the total initial principal of the loans originated in such vintage.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results:\nOperating revenue increased from RMB1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 to RMB1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to the substantial increase in financial service income, in particular interest and financial services income.\nFinancial services income increased by 62.3% from RMB556 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to RMB902 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in loan balance, which was in turn driven by increases in the number of active customers and the average outstanding principal balance of loans per customer.\nLoan facilitation and servicing fees increased by 668% from RMB 24.9million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to RMB191 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to the significant growth in off-balance sheet loans.\nFunding cost increased by 47.5% from RMB151 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to RMB222 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our funding debts to fund on-balance sheet loans originated on our platform.\nProcessing and servicing cost increased by 77.9% from RMB38.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to RMB68.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and personnel related costs, an increase in fees to third-party payment platforms, an increase in credit assessment cost, and an increase in risk management expenses.\nProvision for credit losses increased by 102% from RMB93.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to RMB189 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to the increase in the average outstanding principal balance of on-balance sheet loans.\nGross profit increased by 79.5% from RMB242 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to RMB434 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by 8.7% from RMB118 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to RMB108 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in advertising cost.\nResearch and development expenses increased by 47.2% from RMB45.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to RMB67.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to the increase in payroll and related expenses as a result of an increase in the headcount.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 105% from RMB27.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to RMB56.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to the increase in payroll expenses and the increase in share-based compensation expenses allocated to general and administrative expenses. In addition, we incurred an increase in professional service fees.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB100 million, compared to a net loss of RMB12.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB126 million, representing an increase of 436% from RMB23.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results:\nOperating revenue increased from RMB4.3 billion in 2016 to RMB5.6 billion in 2017. This increase was primarily due to the substantial increase in financial services income.\nFinancial services income increased by 92.9% from RMB1.6 billion in 2016 to RMB3.0 billion in 2017. This increase was primarily due to the increase in the principal balance of loans.\nLoan facilitation and servicing fees increased by 599% from RMB 54.2million in 2016 to RMB379 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to the significant growth in principal balance of off-balance sheet loans.\nFunding cost increased by 61.1% from RMB492 million in 2016 to RMB792 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our funding debts to fund on-balance sheet loans originated on our platform.\nProcessing and servicing cost increased by 95.9% from RMB114 million in 2016 to RMB224 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and personnel related costs as we increased the headcount of processing and servicing personnel, an increase in fees to third-party payment platforms, an increase in credit assessment cost, and an increase in risk management expenses. These increases reflected the significant growth in the volume of credit applications and in loan servicing requirements.\nProvision for credit losses increased by 159% from RMB237 million in 2016 to RMB612 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to the increase in the average outstanding principal balance of on-balance sheet loans during these periods. In addition, as we had continued to improve our credit assessment and risk management capabilities as well as to enhance our collection efforts, we gradually expanded our customer base to improve our profit, while maintaining credit risks at a reasonable level.\nGross profit for 2017 was RMB1.3 billion, representing an increase of 119% from 2016.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 7.8% from RMB376 million in 2016 to RMB406 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses as a result of an increase in the salary and benefit level for the employees and share-based compensation expenses allocated to sales and marketing expenses, offset by a decrease in advertising cost.\nResearch and development expenses increased by 84.8% from RMB127 million in 2016 to RMB235 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses, an increase in rental and depreciation expense allocated to research and development expenses, an increase in share-based compensation expenses and an increase in technical service fee.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 133% from RMB87.4 million in 2016 to RMB204 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll, an increase in share-based compensation expenses allocated to general and administrative expenses and related expenses as a result of an increase in the headcount of general and administrative personnel and an increase in the salary and benefit level for the employees. In addition, we incurred an increase in professional service fees, rental expenses and other general corporate-related expenses as a result of our business growth in 2017.\nNet income for 2017 was RMB240 million, compared to a net loss of RMB118 million in 2016.\nAdjusted net income for 2017 was RMB389 million, compared to a net loss of RMB39.6 million in 2016.\nPlease click here to view our vintage curve: http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/79fff7e2-75db-40e0-abc7-5bd0c715bfb5\nConference Call\nThe Company’s management will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern time on March 20, 2018 8:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong time on March 20, 2018.\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nUnited States (toll free): 1 845 675 0437 or 1 866 519 4004 International: 65 6713 5090 Hong Kong (toll free): 800 906 601 or 852 3018 6771 China: 400 6208 038 or 800 8190 121 Participants should dial-in at least 5 minutes before the scheduled start time and use the following passcode: 6668577.\nAdditionally, a live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company’s investor relations website at http://ir.lexinfintech.com .\nA replay of the conference call will be accessible approximately two hours after the conclusion of the live call until March 27, 2018, by dialing the following telephone numbers:\nUnited States (toll free): 1 855 452 5696 or 1 646 254 3697 International: 61 2 8199 0299 Replay Access Code: 6668577 About LexinFintech Holdings Ltd.\nLexinFintech Holdings Ltd.

The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted net (loss)/income as net (loss)/income excluding share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible loans and investment-related impairment, and we define non-GAAP EBIT as net (loss)/income excluding income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses, interest expense, net and investment-related impairment.\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures because it is used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net (loss)/income enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible loans and investment-related impairment. Non-GAAP EBIT, on the other hand, enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of income tax expense, interest expense, net, share-based compensation expenses and investment-related impairment. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate investors’ assessment of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net (loss)/income and non-GAAP EBIT is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible loans, income tax expense, interest (income)/expense, net and investment-related impairment have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net (loss)/income and non-GAAP EBIT. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nExchange Rate Information Statement\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB6.5063 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board on December 29, 2017.
