    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clover Health , a health insurance company using data and technology to fill gaps in care and improve health outcomes, today announced the addition of three new executives to its leadership team. Andrew Toy joined as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Pritam Baxi as Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Varsha Rao as Chief Operating Officer (COO). In addition to these executive hires, Clover announced it will more than double its engineering team by the end of the year and extend the team to its New Jersey office in order to build deeper integration between technology and clinical operations.\n“I'm excited to welcome Pritam, Andrew and Varsha to Clover's leadership team because they each embody traits that are critical to our organization: strong business instincts, deep curiosity, extensive leadership experience, and a passion for our mission,” said Vivek Garipalli, Co-Founder and CEO, Clover Health. “We have ambitious goals for the coming years, and the addition of these three highly talented and visionary people will enable us to achieve them and position Clover to become the most impactful health company on the planet.”\nClover's new CTO, Andrew Toy, joins from Google where he coordinated enterprise activities for the Android team and ran Machine Learning, Enterprise Search and Analytics for the G-Suite team. Before that, he was the CEO and co-founder of Divide, a company focused on creating a split between work and personal data on mobile devices, which was acquired by Google in 2014. At Clover, Toy will be responsible for overseeing engineering, data science, product, IT and security, and driving the vision for how technology and analytics can improve the lives of Clover's members.\nToy will also oversee the growth and expansion of Clover's Engineering team to New Jersey. Clover's technology platform aggregates member data and identifies when a patient is most at-risk. Using clinical indicators, a team of nurse practitioners, social workers and care management professionals are able to provide direct intervention to members. By growing a team of engineers in New Jersey where Clover's clinical teams are primarily based, technology development at the company will be driven by even tighter feedback loops between the people creating the technology and those using it.\nCFO Pritam Baxi came to Clover after spending three years with Sears Holdings, where he managed multiple teams across finance, member experience and operations. Prior to Sears, he spent 15 years at Amazon where he held a variety of finance and operations roles and was instrumental in helping to manage the Worldwide Operations Finance function and North American logistics for the company during its time of rapid growth. At Clover, Baxi will be focused on responsibly scaling the company and ensuring the company continues to offer the best benefits while keeping costs low for members.\nIn addition, Les Granow will be moving into the role of Chief Accounting Officer. Granow is an accomplished senior financial executive and has been serving in the CFO role at Clover since July 2016. He will now bring his wealth of accounting expertise and financial leadership to this specialized position.\nCOO Varsha Rao previously served as the Head of Global Operations at Airbnb, where she sat on the executive team and managed vacation rentals, supplier growth, and market expansion around the world, including the company's growth initiative in Asia. She also oversaw the company's focus on trust and safety, and customer experience. Before Airbnb, she held executive roles at LivingSocial and oldnavy.com , and was co-founder and co-CEO of the cosmetics company, eve.com . Since joining Clover late last year, she has been focused on ensuring operational excellence across the company's core insurance business and overseeing the Member Experience and Growth teams.\nBy adding three new c-level executives to its leadership team, Clover ensures it's well positioned to deliver on its mission of improving lives and establishing a world-class insurance company.\nExecutive Comments\n“One of the reasons I decided to join Clover is because of the company's unique opportunity to create a true virtuous cycle of technology and health outcomes positively reinforcing each other. Over time, our data and technology platforms will create a fundamentally differentiated business and member experience that no other company in this industry will be able to keep up with, and I look forward to setting the standard for innovation in healthcare.”\n-- Andrew Toy, CTO\n“I fundamentally believe we are on the cusp of the healthcare revolution in terms of the way we are driving toward improving our members' well-being and care through the services we provide. Joining Clover reminds me of the time when I joined Amazon back in 1999 when e-commerce was taking off. I believe Clover is in a similar situation where the need to create disruption and drive change in the healthcare space is foundational and will push the boundaries of what is possible.”\n-- Pritam Baxi, CFO\n“I was inspired to join Clover because it has the potential to be the most impactful health company on the planet by investing heavily in building the operational discipline of a world-class insurance company, while simultaneously providing an unprecedented level of compassion and care for our members.”\n-- Varsha Rao, COO\nAbout Clover Health\nClover Health is a healthcare technology company building a platform to collect, structure and analyze longitudinal health and behavioral data. The company uses its platform to create products that improve health outcomes and lower health-related costs for Medicare beneficiaries. Earning trust and becoming a valued partner in our members' health is Clover's key to success.
