    "text": " 34 a.m. ET Share \nHigher steel prices benefit companies, but industry groups criticized the White House plans \nBy Getty Images Rolled steel coils at a mill of German steel producer Salzgitter AG. \nEuropean steel producers and traders are divided about President Donald Trump’s plan to impose steep tariffs on the commodity. \nMr. Trump on Thursday pledged to introduce tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imported to the U.S. to address what he described as a trade imbalance benefiting other countries. Foreign-owned companies that produce steel in the U.S. or use local steel generally welcomed the measures while companies that produce steel outside the U.S. and export their products to the country criticized the measures. \nDon’t miss: Here’s what the 30 Dow industrials companies say about a potential trade war \nSteel trader Klöckner & Co. SE, KLKNF, +12.33% based in Duisburg, Germany, said it expects the measures to boost earnings at its U.S. unit. \n“This is good…when steel prices go up, so does our gross profit,” Chief Financial Officer Gisbert Rühl said in an interview. \nHigher steel prices benefit companies like Klöckner because steel traders charge their customers a slight markup on the market price of the commodity for their services. Klöckner generates annual revenue of around $3.5 million in the U.S.",
