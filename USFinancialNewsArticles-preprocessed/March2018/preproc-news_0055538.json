    "text": "BEIJING, March 30 (Reuters) - Shanghai copper prices edged up on Friday as the dollar weakened, making metals cheaper for holders of other currencies, but were set to post their steepest quarterly drop since 2013 after recent fears of a U.S.-China trade war spooked markets. The London Metal Exchange is closed on Friday and Monday for the Easter holiday. FUNDAMENTALS * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 0.5 percent at 49,900 yuan ($7,949.91) a tonne by 0220 GMT. * SHFE COPPER: Shanghai copper is on course to lose 11.2 percent this quarter. That would mark its worst quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2013, with a 5.8 percent drop in March alone - its worst month since November 2015. * SHFE ALUMINUM: The most traded May aluminium contract on the ShFE was down 0.9 percent at 13,665 yuan a tonne. It earlier touched 13,630 yuan a tonne, and is on track for its worst quarter since the second quarter of 2010 after winter supply cuts in China were below expectations. * CHILE: A union representing the majority of workers at Codelco's Radomiro Tomic mine in Chile has rejected a final offer for a new labour contract, forcing a period of government-facilitated mediation, the company said on Thursday. * CODELCO: Chile's state copper company Codelco said on Thursday it produced 1.734 million tonnes of copper in 2017, its second highest output ever, despite persistently low ore grades at its ageing mines. * RIO: Swiss prosecutors on Thursday confirmed they were checking whether \"questionable payments\" to an ex-Mongolian finance minister were linked to Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mining project, adding the Anglo-Australian mining company was \"not an accused\". * ALUMINIUM: Japan's aluminium industry on Thursday called for the United States to scrap import tariffs on aluminium, claiming that they are against international rules and pose a serious problem for the industry and global trade and economic growth. * DRC: International mining firms including Glencore and <Randgold RRS.L> on Thursday proposed a sliding scale for royalty rates on key commodities mined in Democratic Republic of Congo as an alternative to a windfall tax. * For the top stories in metals and other news, click or MARKETS NEWS * Stocks steadied on Thursday, after a woeful week for major technology companies, even as global equities careened towards their first quarterly drop in two years.
