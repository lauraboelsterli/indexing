    "text": "ISELIN, N.J., March 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlesex Water Company (“Middlesex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:MSEX) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Operating Results\nConsolidated Net income for 2017 increased $0.1 million as compared to 2016. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for 2017 were $1.38, which are the same results reported in 2016.\nOperating revenues decreased to $130.8 million, down from $132.9 million in 2016. The $2.1 million revenue decline was caused by unfavorable weather patterns in New Jersey and Delaware throughout the spring and summer months of 2017, as well as nonrecurring emergent bulk water sales to New Jersey municipal systems in 2016. A 4.2% growth in our regulated customer base in Delaware helped to offset some of the lower overall average customer usage.\nOperations and maintenance expenses for 2017 decreased $0.9 million from the same period in 2016 due to lower retirement benefit plan costs and liability insurance costs of $1.8 million. Somewhat offsetting these lower costs were increased costs to produce and treat water, make repairs to our mains in the Middlesex system and other operating expenses.\nMiddlesex President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis W. Doll said, “Our employees remained focused in 2017 on further improving our service delivery capabilities through continued investments in infrastructure for enhanced reliability, safety and resiliency. To recover increased capital and operating costs prudently invested in our Middlesex System, we filed for an increase in annual operating revenues of $15.3 million with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in October 2017. As we work towards a favorable outcome, we are ever mindful of the need to balance a fair and reasonable rate structure with our commitment to delivering safe, adequate and proper water service,” added Doll.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the three month period ended December 31, 2017, operating revenues were $31.5 million, down slightly from $31.8 million for the same period in 2016. Operations and maintenance expenses were $16.1 million, down from $17.3 million for the same period in 2016 due primarily to lower employee related costs. Net income increased to $5.3 million from $3.2 million for the same period in 2016.\nQuarterly Dividend Declared\nAs previously announced in January 2018, the Board of Directors of Middlesex Water Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22375 per common share which was paid on March 1, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2018. The Company has paid cash dividends continually since 1912 and increased its dividend for the forty-fifth consecutive year in 2017.\nAbout Middlesex Water Company\nMiddlesex Water Company, organized in 1897, is a water utility serving customers in central and southern New Jersey and in the State of Delaware.
