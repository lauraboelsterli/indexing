Opener Dean Elgar, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers and captain Faf du Plessis were all out cheaply after Australia had set South Africa 417 runs to win.  102 and nine wickets for the match in a rare high point for the home team. South Africa, as had been the case in their first innings, set off briskly in their chase but any hope of resistance diminished when   for just nine runs. Hashim Amlaâ€™s arrival at the crease brought about an immediate bowling change as Australian skipper Steve Smith   added another as he trapped Amla leg before wicket for eight runs.     The remaining home hopes evaporated when du Plessis was   Aiden Markram struck five fours as he went to lunch 38 not out, along with Theunis de Bruyn on two. Australia have been in command for most of the test after scoring 351 in their first innings and then bowling South Africa out cheaply for 162 on a slow wicket.
