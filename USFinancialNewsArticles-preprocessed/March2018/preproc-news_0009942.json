Men sit in a damaged truck in the besieged town of Douma in eastern Ghouta in Damascus, Syria, March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Geert Cappelaere told a news conference in Geneva that there was no sign of agreement on further convoys to serve the rest of the enclave’s 400,000 people, nor any agreement on evacuation for some 1,000 people in dire medical need.
