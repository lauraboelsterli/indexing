    "text": "HONG KONG, March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sharing Economy International, Inc. (\"SEII\" or \"the Company\") (NASDAQ: SEII) today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, EC Assets Management Limited (\"EC Assets\"), has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Icon Properties, regarding a potential acquisition of the Qliq Damansara Hotel, which is located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nThe Qliq Damansara Hotel is a hip, contemporary hotel situated in the Golden Triangle of Petaling Jaya, the heart of a bustling commercial area with some of the trendiest lifestyle and shopping areas, arts and culture, sports and business districts. The hotel comprises 219 guest rooms in 24 levels. For more information visit http://www.qliqhotels.com .\n\"The Qliq Damansara Hotel is an ideal candidate to convert into a co-working and co-living community,\" said Parkson Yip, COO of SEII. \"The plan is to convert unutilized spaces into more efficiently-used co-working spaces and some lower-cost co-living spaces. This can provide greater flexibility to our business club members and guests. Our concept of the co-working and co-living community is to provide a 24/7 operating complex which provides a full suite of services that fits the global business environment that we live in today. With the help of advanced technologies in communications and collaboration, more and more people are working cross-regionally with peers who are physically located in other time zones. A 24/7 co-working and co-living community can provide individuals with the convenience of fulfilling their living needs on-site, at any time, while focusing on their work. Since they are working and living in the same complex, they can go directly to their leisure activities after work without the hassle of commuting. We will continue to seek similar candidates for co-working and co-living complexes through acquisitions or partnerships in other locations.\"\nThere can be no assurances that the parties may enter into any agreement to do a transaction, and even if an agreement is entered into, there can be no assurances that such transaction will be consummated.\nAbout Sharing Economy International Inc.\nSharing Economy International Inc., through its affiliated companies, designs, manufactures and distributes a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry.
