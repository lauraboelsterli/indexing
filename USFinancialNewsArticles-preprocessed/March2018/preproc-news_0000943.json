Spot gold prices rose 0.50 percent to $1,322.76 per ounce.\nBy 7:05 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis down 207 points, S&P 500 e-minis down 14 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis down 58 points.\nWall Street fell for the first time in 11 months in February, hit by worries that rising interest rates and bond yields would cool the economy and finally begin to draw money out of equities after an almost decade-long rally.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cooled speculation that the U.S. central bank was set to accelerate with monetary tightening on Thursday by saying there were no signs the world’s largest economy was overheating.\nBut New York-Fed chief William Dudley sent another shock through markets later in the day by saying that he regarded four rate hikes this year as in line with the“gradual” definition the Fed has been giving to markets.\nUntil this week, interest rate futures were pricing in only three hikes.\nOn a thin day for data, the University Of Michigan consumer sentiment index is expected at 10 a.m. ET.\nThe day’s biggest earnings release is J.C. Penney Co Inc , expected to report a rise in fourth-quarter same-store sales after a strong holiday season.\nAmong stocks, Smith & Wesson maker American Outdoor slumped 14 percent after giving a weak forecast for its fourth quarter starting in February.\nGap Inc soared 9 percent in premarket trading after the clothing retailer topped fourth quarter estimates.
