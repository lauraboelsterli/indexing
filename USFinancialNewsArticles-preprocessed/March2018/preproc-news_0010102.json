It’ll add a little bit to inflation. But I think it’s more an uncertainty,” Brown added.\nWorld stocks and emerging markets fell for the fifth straight day on Monday, with investors also worrying that Italian voters had flocked to anti-establishment and far-right groups in record numbers and had delivered a hung parliament.\nInvestors dumped stocks in favor of traditional safe havens including gold and the Japanese yen, with gold touching a near one-week high on Monday.\n“Markets’ inability to regain confidence is likely to keep stocks defensive,” First Standard Financial Chief Market Economist Peter Cardillo said.\nBy 8.25 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 38 points, S&P 500 e-minis down 8.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 1.5 points.\nOn a thin day for economic data, a U.S. non-manufacturing activity index report, scheduled to be released by the Institute of Supply Management, is slated for 10 a.m. ET.\nShares in chipmaker Qualcomm dipped 1.6 percent after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ordered the company to postpone an annual shareholder meeting, giving it more time to resist efforts by Broadcom Ltd to force through a $117 billion merger.\nShares of Clearside Biomedical jumped 55 percent after the drug developer’s eye drug met the main goal in a late-stage study.\nEurope’s second-biggest insurer XL Group Ltd rose 30 percent in premarket trading after being acquired by France’s AXA for $15.3 billion.
