    "text": "Taxes Federal court orders EPA to implement smog rules A California district court ruled that the agency needs to move ahead to carry out the 2015 Ozone Standards and designate areas in the country that do not meet them. The EPA has until April 30 to comply. Courts have blocked several attempts by the EPA and U.S. Interior Department to suspend regulations curbing methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure. Published 17 Hours Ago Reuters Getty Images Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the mission of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on December 7, 2017 in Washington, DC. \nA federal court on Monday ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to implement protections against smog set in 2015, the agency's latest defeat in court as it rolls back environmental regulations. \nThe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that the agency led by Administrator Scott Pruitt needs to move ahead to carry out the 2015 Ozone Standards and designate areas in the country that do not meet them. \nThe EPA has until April 30 to comply. \nPruitt \"has failed to perform a non-discretionary duty imposed\" to designate areas of the country that do not meet the standards set for levels of ozone, the main component in smog, the court order said. \nEPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said in an email: \"We look forward to working with co-regulators to continue the designations process for the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone; we are evaluating the information provided by governors in February 2018 as part of that process.\" \nPruitt last June initially intended to stall the Oct. 1 deadline by one year, but quickly reversed course the next day, without saying whether he would honor the Oct. 1 deadline. \nSixteen state attorneys general as well as a coalition of environmental groups sued to force Pruitt to meet the deadline and implement the smog standards. \nSmog exacerbates conditions like asthma, especially in children and senior citizens. \nCourts have blocked several attempts by the EPA and U.S. Interior Department to suspend regulations curbing methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure. \nLast June, the EPA restored a mercury protection rule after being sued by the Natural Resources Defense Council. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, one of the AGs who sued the administration, said on Monday he will keep \"a close eye\" on whether EPA complies with the order.",
