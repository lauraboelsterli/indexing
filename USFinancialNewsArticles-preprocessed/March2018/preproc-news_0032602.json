Motion Picture Academy President John Bailey speaks at the Foreign Language Film nominees cocktail reception in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., March 2, 2018. REUTERS/David McNew Citing unnamed sources, The Hollywood Reporter and Variety reported that the Academy had received three claims of sexual harassment against John Bailey on Wednesday and began an investigation. They did not give details. Neither the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nor a representative for Bailey returned requests for comment. Bailey, 75, a movie director and cinematographer, was elected president of the Academy in August 2017. The Variety report came two weeks after the annual Oscar ceremony, where the sexual misconduct scandal that has rocked Hollywood was a key topic.
