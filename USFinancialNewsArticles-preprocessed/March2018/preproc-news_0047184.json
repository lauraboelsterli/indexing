Britain's Houses of Parliament is seen reflected in a large puddle in Westminster in London, Britain, January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson \n“You will see them very soon, we have put together quite a strong package,” Wallace told the BBC. “In the near future, in the next few weeks or months is when you’ll see it.” \nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said last year that counter-terrorism laws need to be updated to keep pace with modern online behaviour and to address the issue of online radicalisation.
