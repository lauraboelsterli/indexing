    "text": "March 26th, 2018 South America \nPeru’s new President Martin Vizcarra promised to fight corruption “at any cost,” two days after his predecessor was toppled by a sprawling graft scandal and constant clashes with the opposition-run Congress. \nAs the outgoing president’s former vice president, Vizcarra said he would form a completely new cabinet but asked for all lawmakers to help him restore the public’s trust in institutions, which had been damaged by the political crisis. \n“Enough,” said Vizcarra, a former governor of a small mining region, as he began his inauguration speech to Congress. \n  reuters.com",
