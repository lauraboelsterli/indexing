(Nasdaq:LWAY), the leading U.S. supplier of kefir cultured dairy products, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“This past year, we navigated a rapidly-changing dairy industry landscape and continued to make important progress against the innovation and commercialization priorities of our strategic initiatives. Many of these products are already gaining momentum and contributed to our 2017 financial results,” said CEO Julie Smolyansky. “The recent introduction of Lifeway’s Plantiful, our first non-dairy, plant-based probiotic beverage made with kefir cultures; Elixir, our organic, non-dairy, probiotic sparkling beverage; and Lifeway’s Organic Skyr reflect our vision for a diversified portfolio of health-focused products under the Lifeway name.”\nThe release of The Kefir Cookbook this month created media and merchandising opportunities for the brand that are unique to the category. We are working to take advantage of this positive press and increased awareness to introduce new consumers to the history, culture, and soul behind our unique and expanding product line. Lifeway’s focus on creating new consumers in expanded demographic sets will be a key priority within our 2018 strategy.\n“Our ability to leverage the Lifeway brand and quickly introduce on-trend health and wellness products continues to be a competitive advantage, despite marketplace challenges. Our ongoing capital and strategic investments, combined with our recent successful product introductions, position us well to continue to grow our core business and reach new customers,” Smolyansky added.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Highlights:\n(dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net sales $ 26,257 $ 30,188 $ 118,893 $ 123,879 Gross profit % 19.5 % 28.5 % 25.8 % 28.3 % Net Income (Loss) $ (1,749 ) $ 481 $ (346 ) $ 3,479 Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share $ (0.11 ) $ 0.03 $ (0.02 ) $ 0.22 Effective Tax Rate 46.4 % 58.6 % 57.0 % 38.3 %\nNet Sales by Product Category:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 In thousands $ % $ % Drinkable Kefir other than ProBugs $ 90,514 76 % $ 96,782 78 % Cheese 11,516 10 % 11,007 9 % Cream and other (a) 6,527 5 % 6,114 5 % ProBugs Kefir 4,537 4 % 6,722 5 % Other dairy 4,138 4 % 1,279 1 % Frozen Kefir (b) 1,661 1 % 1,975 2 % Net Sales $ 118,893 100 % $ 123,879 100 %\n(a) Includes cream byproducts and other non-dairy products for resale (b) Includes Lifeway Kefir Shop sales About Lifeway Foods, Inc.\nLifeway Foods, Inc.
