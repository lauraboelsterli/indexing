    "text": "Press Release\nSource: Sanofi (EURONEXT: SAN) (NYSE: SNY)\nSanofi Announces Receipt of Antitrust Clearances in Connection with the Acquisition of Ablynx\nParis (France) - March 1, 2018 - Sanofi announced today that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the \"HSR Act\") has expired and that Sanofi has received clearance from the Federal Cartel Office of Germany (the \"FCO\") in accordance with the Act Against Restraints of Competition, applicable to Sanofi's proposed acquisition of Ablynx NV (\"Ablynx\").\nOn January 29, 2018, Sanofi and Ablynx announced they had entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Sanofi will launch public offers to acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares (including shares represented by American Depositary Shares), warrants and convertible bonds of Ablynx (the \"Offers\"). As a result of the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the clearance from the FCO, the condition to the Offers relating to antitrust approvals has been satisfied.\nThe consummation of the Offers remains subject to other conditions, including the tender of shares representing at least 75% of the outstanding shares of Ablynx at the end of the initial acceptance period.\nThe Offers have not yet commenced. The Offers are still expected to be launched by the beginning of the second quarter 2018.\nAbout Sanofi\nSanofi is dedicated to supporting people through their health challenges.

Forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"plans\", \"will be\" and similar expressions. Although Sanofi's and Ablynx's management each believes that the expectations reflected in such are reasonable, investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Sanofi and Ablynx, that could cause actual results and developments to those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things, risks related to Sanofi's and Ablynx's ability to complete the acquisition on the proposed terms or on the proposed timeline, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the possibility that competing offers will be made, other risks associated with executing business combination transactions, such as the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully, that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that the expected benefits of the acquisition will not be realized, risks related to future opportunities and plans for the combined company, including uncertainty of the expected financial performance and results of the combined company following completion of the proposed acquisition, disruption from the proposed acquisition making it more difficult to conduct business as usual or to maintain relationships with customers, employees, manufacturers, suppliers or patient groups, and the possibility that, if the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the proposed acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, the market price of Sanofi's shares could decline, as well as other risks related to Sanofi's and Ablynx's respective businesses, including the ability to grow sales and revenues from existing products and to develop, commercialize or market new products, competition, including potential generic competition, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including future clinical data and analysis, regulatory obligations and oversight by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or the EMA, including decisions of such authorities regarding whether and when to approve any drug, device or biological application that may be filed for any product candidates as well as decisions regarding labelling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of any product candidates, the absence of a guarantee that any product candidates, if approved, will be commercially successful, risks associated with intellectual property, including the ability to protect intellectual property and defend patents, future litigation, the future approval and commercial success of therapeutic alternatives, and volatile economic conditions. While the list of factors presented here is representative, no list should be considered a statement of all potential risks, uncertainties or assumptions that could have a material adverse effect on the companies' consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The foregoing factors should be read in conjunction with the risks and cautionary statements discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the AMF made by Sanofi and Ablynx, including those listed under \"Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in Sanofi's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016, and those listed under \"Disclaimer\" in the current reports on Form 6-K filed by Ablynx with the SEC. The speak only as of the date hereof and, other than as required by applicable law, Sanofi and Ablynx do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements.\nAdditional Information for US investors\nThe tender offer for the outstanding ordinary shares (\"Shares\"), American Depositary Shares issued by J.P.
