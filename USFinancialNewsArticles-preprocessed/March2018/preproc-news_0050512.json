    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 3:06 PM / Updated an hour ago Outcry grows over Venezuela jail riot, 68 killed Tibisay Romero 2 Min Read \nVALENCIA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Anguished relatives of some 68 people killed in a riot and fire in the cells of a Venezuelan police station demanded explanations on Thursday while rights groups and opposition politicians blamed leftist President Nicolas Maduro for overcrowding in the country’s notoriously violent jails. Relatives of inmates at the General Command of the Carabobo Police react as they wait outside the prison in Valencia, Venezuela March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins \nDeadly riots are common in Venezuela’s lawless prisons, where inmates often openly wield machine guns and use drugs. But the death toll in the decrepit city of Valencia, once a thriving industrial hub, in Wednesday’s riot was particularly shocking. \nIn Geneva, the United Nations human rights office called on authorities to carry out a speedy investigation and to provide reparations to victims’ families. \n“We urge the Venezuelan authorities to carry out a prompt, thorough and effective investigation to establish the cause of these deaths, provide reparations to the victims’ families, and, where applicable, identify and bring those responsible to justice,” the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement voicing concern at prison conditions.
