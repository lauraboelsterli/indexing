    "text": "6 Hours Ago | 00:46 \nA Japanese start-up is making a hover backpack to augment one's jumping ability. It's being developed by students at the University of Tokyo. \nThe backpack has a series of rotors that provide enough downward thrust to help the wearer jump higher and longer than humanly possible, giving the user a moon-walk type experience. \nThe Lunavity team says the device could be used to replace wheelchairs, jump across streets and more realistically, just for fun to improve your slam dunks.
