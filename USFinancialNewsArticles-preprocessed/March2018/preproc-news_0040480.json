(NASDAQ:ICAD), an industry-leading provider of advanced image analysis, workflow solutions and radiation therapy for the early identification and treatment of cancer, today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nTotal revenue of $7.9 million, up 14% year-over-year Gross profit of $5.3 million, or 68%, excluding a one-time charge related to a $1.0 million inventory reserve GAAP Net Loss of $(4.2) million, or $(0.26) per share, including a non-cash goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charge of approximately $(2.0) million Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA loss of $(1.3) million\nFull-Year 2017 Highlights:\nTotal revenue of $28.1 million, up 7% year-over-year Gross profit of $19.2 million, or 68%, excluding a $1.0 million inventory reserve GAAP Net Loss of $(14.3) million, or $(0.87) per share, including a non-cash goodwill, intangible, and long-lived asset impairment charge of approximately $(6.7) million Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA loss of $(4.8) million Cash and cash equivalents of $9.4 million at December 31, 2017\nSubsequent Event:\nIn March of 2018, the Company amended the terms of its credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. The amendment was required following the Company’s decision to cease offering its skin subscription service model to customers in early 2018. The amendment, among other things, modifies: the debt covenants, the second term loan advance revenue milestone and maturity date, the line of credit and the final payment amount.\n“The fourth quarter was our strongest of the year from a revenue standpoint, as we closed out 2017 with particularly strong product revenue performance in our Artificial Intelligence detection software business,” said Ken Ferry, Chief Executive Officer of iCAD, Inc. “The fourth quarter’s most significant catalyst was growing sales of PowerLook Tomo Detection software, the first Artificial Intelligence software product based on machine and deep learning that is commercially available for the detection of breast cancer on 3D mammograms. We remain focused on maximizing the commercial potential for this key product, and customer feedback continues to be highly positive.”\n“Following a comprehensive review of market dynamics and our own internal cost and revenue projections, we announced early in 2018 our intention to cease offering the subscription service model to customers in our skin brachytherapy business,” continued Mr. Ferry. “We believe that long-term profitable growth in this business is achievable through a more traditional capital sales business model whereby customers buy the systems from us and directly coordinate the required clinical resources to deliver patient treatments. These customers will still contract with iCAD annually for X-ray source and service contract support. We remain bullish on this market and, following this strategic shift, we believe we are well-positioned to leverage the strong interest we are seeing from new potential capital customers. Our commercial strategy that focuses on capital sales will now include the targeting of cancer centers, which are particularly attractive because there are over 1,700 such centers across the U.S.”\n“In our cancer detection business, we recently received CE Mark approval and launched the second version of our PowerLook Tomo Detection software product at the European Congress of Radiology (ECR) in Vienna. We believe that our Artificial Intelligence-based software platform will be the basis for continued innovation in the development of a broad roadmap of Artificial Intelligence solutions built on machine and deep learning,” concluded Mr. Ferry.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue: Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 14% to $7.9 million from $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting a 44% increase in product revenue and a 9% decrease in service revenue.\nIn $000's Three months ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change % Change Product revenue $ 4,329 $ 3,011 $ 1,318 44 % Service revenue 3,573 3,917 (344 ) (9 )% Total Revenue $ 7,902 $ 6,928 $ 974 14 % Cancer detection revenue, which includes revenue from our digital mammography, breast density, and CT CAD platforms, as well as the associated service revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $1.1 million, or 26%, to $5.2 million, as compared to $4.2 million in the same period in 2016. The year-over-year detection results were negatively impacted by the inclusion of $0.5 million in MRI revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016. The MRI assets were divested in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding MRI revenue, quarterly cancer detection revenues increased by $1.5 million, or 40%, year-over-year. Therapy revenue, which includes Xoft® Axxent® Electronic Brachytherapy System® product sales, as well as the associated service revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2017, decreased by $0.1 million, or 4%, to $2.7 million, from $2.8 million in the same period of 2016. Therapy revenue was lower due primarily to a $0.3 million decrease in therapy product revenue associated with lower average selling prices realized on international distribution sales. Total company revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017, excluding the impact of MRI revenues, increased 22% to $7.8 million from $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn $000's Three months ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change % Change Detection revenue Product revenue $ 3,679 $ 2,102 $ 1,577 75 % Service revenue 1,565 2,070 (505 ) (24 )% Detection Revenue $ 5,244 $ 4,172 $ 1,072 26 % Therapy revenue Product revenue $ 650 $ 909 $ (259 ) (28 )% Service revenue 2,008 1,847 161 9 % Therapy Revenue $ 2,658 $ 2,756 $ (98 ) (4 )% Total Revenue $ 7,902 $ 6,928 $ 974 14 % Gross Profit: Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.3 million, or 55% of revenue, compared with $4.5 million, or 65% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit was due to a $1.0 million inventory reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to our exit from the skin subscription business. Excluding this charge, gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.3 million, or 68%.\nOperating Expenses: Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $0.7 million to $8.5 million from $7.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was entirely driven by a non-cash impairment charge of $2.0 million related to the goodwill and long-lived assets of the therapy segment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charge, total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased to $6.5 million, representing a $1.3 million decrease year-over-year.\nGAAP Net Loss: Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $(4.2) million, or $(0.26) per share, compared with a net loss of $(3.3) million, or $(0.20) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The $0.9 million year-over-year increase in our net loss was driven primarily by the $2.0 million goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charge and the $1.0 million inventory reserve, which were partially offset by incremental gross profit of $0.8 million and a decrease in operating expenses of $1.3 million.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA: Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined below, was a loss of $(1.3) million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $(2.0) million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Please refer to the section entitled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable GAAP Measures” and the accompanying financial table included at the end of this release for a reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA results for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFull-Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue: Total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, increased 7% to $28.1 million from $26.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, reflecting a 29% increase in product revenue, which was partially offset by an 8% decrease in service revenue.\nIn $000's Twelve months ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change % Change Product revenue $ 13,554 $ 10,471 $ 3,083 29 % Service revenue 14,548 15,867 (1,319 ) (8 )% Total Revenue $ 28,102 $ 26,338 $ 1,764 7 % Cancer detection revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, increased by $1.2 million, or 7%, to $18.3 million, as compared to $17.1 million in the same period in 2016. Excluding the impact of MRI revenues in each of the twelve month periods, Cancer detection revenue increased by $3.0 million, or 20%, year-over-year. Therapy revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, increased by $0.6 million, or 6%, to $9.8 million, from $9.2 million in the same period of 2016. The increase in therapy revenue was due to a 6% increase in product revenue and a 6% increase in service revenue. Total Company revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, excluding the impact of MRI revenues, increased 15% to $27.6 million from $24.0 million in the same period of 2016.\nIn $000's Twelve months ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change % Change Detection revenue Product revenue $ 11,649 $ 8,682 $ 2,967 34 % Service revenue 6,661 8,451 (1,790 ) (21 )% Detection Revenue $ 18,310 $ 17,133 $ 1,177 7 % Therapy revenue Product revenue $ 1,905 $ 1,789 $ 116 6 % Service revenue 7,887 7,416 471 6 % Therapy Revenue $ 9,792 $ 9,205 $ 587 6 % Total Revenue $ 28,102 $ 26,338 $ 1,764 7 % Gross Profit: Gross profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, decreased by $0.3 million to $18.2 million, or 65% of revenue, from $18.5 million, or 70% of revenue, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit was due to the $1.0 million inventory reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to our exit from the skin subscription business. Excluding this charge, gross profit in 2017 was $19.2 million, or 68%.\nOperating Expenses: Total operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, increased $3.9 million to $32.3 million from $28.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The year-over-year increase reflects the net impact of the goodwill, intangible, and long-lived asset impairment charge ($6.7 million) and the gain on the sale of the MRI assets ($2.5 million). Excluding the net impact of the goodwill, intangible, and long-lived asset impairment charge and the gain on the sale of MRI assets, total operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, decreased $0.3 million to $28.2 million from $28.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The year-over-year decrease, after taking into account the impact of the goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charge and the gain on the sale of the MRI assets, reflects a decrease in engineering and product development expenses, lower amortization and depreciation charges, partially offset by an increase in marketing and sales costs and general and administrative expenses.\nGAAP Net Loss: Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $(14.3) million, or $(0.87) per share, compared with net loss of $(10.1) million, or $(0.63) per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The $4.2 million year-over-year increase in net loss was driven primarily by the $6.7 million goodwill, intangible, and long-lived asset impairment charge and the $1.0 million inventory reserve, which were partially offset by incremental gross profit of $0.7 million, lower operating expenses of $0.3 million and the $2.5 million gain on the sale of the MRI assets.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA: Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined below, was a loss of $(4.8) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $(5.3) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Please refer to the section entitled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable GAAP Measures” and the accompanying financial table included at the end of this release for a reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA results for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents: As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $9.4 million, compared with $8.6 million as of December 31, 2016.\nConference Call\niCAD management will host a conference and live webcast call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results and provide a Company update.

An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nWhile management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying performance of the Company's business operations, investors are reminded to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and management may utilize other measures to illustrate performance in the future. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and, therefore, such non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation. They should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The reconciliations of these historic non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Set forth below is a reconciliation of the Company's \"Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\" (Unaudited) (In thousands except for per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Net Loss $ (4,235 ) $ (3,316 ) $ (14,256 ) $ (10,099 ) Interest Expense 73 4 124 63 Other income (15 ) (1 ) (18 ) (10 ) Stock Compensation 583 659 3,656 2,307 Depreciation 196 309 994 1,322 Amortization 101 230 495 983 Tax (benefit)/expense 10 21 (18 ) 76 Gain on sale of MRI assets - - (2,508 ) - Goodwill and long-lived asset impairment 1,993 - 6,693 - Loss on sale of Assets - - - 1 Gain from acquisition settlement - - - (249 ) Acquisition related - 80 70 281 Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA $ (1,294 ) $ (2,014 ) $ (4,768 ) $ (5,325 ) Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Net Loss $ (4,235 ) $ (3,316 ) $ (14,256 ) $ (10,099 ) Adjustments to Net Loss: Gain on sale of MRI assets - - (2,508 ) - Loss on sale of Assets - - - 1 Goodwill and long-lived asset impairment 1,993 - 6,693 - Gain from acquisition settlement - - - (249 ) Acquisition related - 80 70 281 Non-GAAP Adjusted Net (Loss)/Income $ (2,242 ) $ (3,236 ) $ (10,001 ) $ (10,066 ) Net (Loss)/Income per share GAAP Net (Loss)/Income per share $ (0.26 ) $ (0.20 ) $ (0.87 ) $ (0.63 ) Adjustments to Net (Loss)/Income (as\ndetailed above) 0.12 0.00 0.26 - Non-GAAP Adjusted Net (Loss)/Income per share $ (0.14 ) $ (0.20 ) $ (0.61 ) $ (0.63 ) Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. However, management believes that in order to understand the Company's short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items, when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and/or impact on continuing operations. Management also uses results of operations before such items to evaluate the operating performance of the Company and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in the Company's ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of the Company's ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management's ability to make useful forecasts. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to its peers and competitors.\nManagement defines \"Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\" as the sum of GAAP Net Loss before provisions for interest expense, other income, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, tax expense, gains/losses on sale of assets, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment, gain from acquisition settlement, and acquisition related expenses. Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to be an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business and a good measure of its historical operating trends, in particular the extent to which ongoing operations impact the Company's overall financial performance.\nManagement excludes each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to that excluded item:\nStock-based compensation expense: excluded as these are non-cash expenses that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the Company's business, and also because the total amount of expense is partially outside of the Company's control as it is based on factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expense is incurred. Amortization of acquired intangibles: acquisition-related expenses are reported at the time acquisition costs are incurred, and purchased intangibles are amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, these items are not considered by management in making operating decisions, and management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations. Thus, including such charges does not accurately reflect the performance of the Company's ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred. Interest expense: The Company excludes interest expense which includes interest from the facility agreement, interest on settlement obligations and interest on capital leases, from its non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA calculation. Gain on sale of MRI assets relates to the gain realized on the sale of the MRI assets. The Company excludes this item as it is not considered by management in making operating decisions, and management believes that such items do not have a direct correlation to future business operations. Goodwill and long-lived asset impairment relates to impairment of the therapy business. It is excluded as management believes that such non-cash charges do not have a direct correlation to future business operations. Thus, including such charges does not accurately reflect the performance of the Company's ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred. Litigation and settlement related: These expenses consist primarily of settlement, legal and other professional fees related to litigation. The Company excludes these costs from its non-GAAP measures primarily because the Company believes that these costs have no direct correlation to the core operations of the Company. Acquisition related: relates to professional service fees due to acquisitions. The Company does not consider these acquisition-related costs to be related to the organic continuing operations of the acquired businesses and are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired assets.\nOn occasion in the future, there may be other items, such as significant asset impairments, restructuring charges or significant gains or losses from contingencies that the Company may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management.\nSource:iCAD, Inc.",
