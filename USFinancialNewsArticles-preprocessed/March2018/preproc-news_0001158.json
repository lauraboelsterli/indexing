    "text": "LOS ANGELES & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Colony NorthStar, Inc. (NYSE:CLNS) and subsidiaries (collectively, “Colony NorthStar,” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 and certain financial updates.\nFourth quarter 2017 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(368.1) million, or $(0.69) per share, and full year 2017 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(333.1) million, or $(0.64) per share, which included a $375 million write-down of goodwill and intangibles related to our retail investment management business Fourth quarter 2017 Core FFO of $95.1 million, or $0.16 per share, and FFO of $(295.5) million, or $(0.51) per share Declared and paid a fourth quarter 2017 dividend of $0.27 per share of Class A and B common stock, for an aggregate post-merger 2017 dividend of $1.05 per share, which was more than covered by our full year Core FFO and taxable income The Company’s Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2018 cash dividend of $0.11 per share of Class A and Class B common stock targeting an annualized dividend of $0.44 per share to approximate estimated 2018 taxable income and net cash flow, excluding gains The Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new $300 million common stock repurchase program\n“2017 was, on balance, a disappointing year for Colony NorthStar,” said Richard B. Saltzman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our financial results were not as robust as anticipated based upon continuing negative headwinds in healthcare, retail broker-dealer distribution, and less than expected returns in our residual real estate private equity secondaries and CDO portfolios. However, we achieved more than expected on the strategic front in terms of asset and platform sales, refinancings, synergies, and general streamlining, all with the goal of simplifying our business and emphasizing a few select areas of growth prospectively. In 2018, we will continue to be a net seller of non-core assets with a conservative bias to protect liquidity for further deleveraging, potential stock repurchases, and select investments in growth areas that are consistent with turbo-charging our investment management business. As announced today, we have reset our dividend to approximate expected taxable income and net cash flow, excluding the contribution of gains, and we expect to be in a position to grow the dividend in the future.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Highlights\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company completed $632 million of asset monetizations for an aggregate $4.9 billion of asset monetizations in 2017 furthering its goal to simplify its business and balance sheet The Company has exceeded, on a run-rate basis, its original annual synergies target of $115 million (which includes stock compensation savings) by approximately $35 million, or 30%, and its original annual cash synergies target of $80 million by approximately $15 million, or 20% During the fourth quarter 2017, the Company and its share of affiliates raised approximately $280 million of third-party capital from institutional clients and retail investors achieving its annual target of $2.0 billion for the full year 2017 During the fourth quarter 2017, the Company and funds managed by the Company invested and agreed to invest $379 million comprised of $195 million and $184 million, respectively, and for the full year 2017, the Company and funds managed by the Company invested and agreed to invest $2.8 billion comprised of $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively Subsequent to the fourth quarter 2017: Successfully listed Colony NorthStar Credit Real Estate, Inc.

The Company’s equity interest in the consolidated Healthcare Real Estate segment was approximately 71% as of December 31, 2017. The healthcare portfolio earns rental and escalation income from leasing space to various healthcare tenants and operators. The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for rent and expense reimbursements to be paid in monthly installments. The healthcare portfolio also generates operating income from healthcare properties operated through management agreements with independent third-party operators, predominantly through structures permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, or RIDEA.\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, this segment’s net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(17.7) million, Core FFO was $17.5 million and consolidated NOI was $76.8 million. In the fourth quarter 2017, healthcare same store portfolio sequential quarter to quarter comparable revenue declined (3.2)% and net operating income declined (1.0)% primarily attributed to lower occupancy in senior housing operating properties and hurricane Harvey expenses not covered by insurance and increased labor costs, offset by lower bad debt expense. Compared to the same period last year, fourth quarter 2017 same store revenue growth was 1.6% and net operating income declined (1.7)% primarily attributable to hurricane Harvey expenses not covered by insurance and increased labor costs. Healthcare same store portfolio is defined as properties in operation throughout the full periods presented under the comparison and included 416 properties in the sequential quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons.\nThe following table presents NOI and certain operating metrics by property types in the Company’s Healthcare Real Estate segment:\nConsolidated CLNS OP Same Store NOI Share NOI (1) Consolidated NOI Occupancy % (2) TTM Coverage (3) ($ In millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2017 Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 Q3 2017 9/30/17 6/30/17 Senior Housing - Operating $ 15.8 $ 11.2 $ 15.8 $ 18.7 87.4 % 87.8 % N/A N/A Medical Office Buildings 13.3 9.4 13.4 13.7 82.9 % 83.5 % N/A N/A Triple-Net Lease: Senior Housing 15.2 10.8 15.2 14.6 82.9 % 82.3 % 1.4x 1.4x Skilled Nursing Facilities 27.3 19.3 27.3 25.4 82.1 % 82.2 % 1.2x 1.2x Hospitals 5.2 3.7 5.2 5.3 58.4 % 61.5 % 2.5x 3.0x Healthcare Total/W.A. $ 76.8 $ 54.4 $ 76.9 $ 77.7 82.8 % 82.9 % 1.4x 1.5x (1) CLNS OP Share NOI represents fourth quarter 2017 Consolidated NOI multiplied by CLNS OP’s ownership interest as of December 31, 2017.

Total third-party capital commitments were in excess of $1.1 billion compared to cumulative balance sheet contributions of $750 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company continues to own a 100% interest in the related operating platform.

The Company’s hotels typically experience seasonal variations in occupancy which may cause quarterly fluctuations in revenues and therefore sequential quarter to quarter revenue and EBITDA result comparisons are not meaningful. Hospitality same store portfolio is defined as hotels in operation throughout the full periods presented under the comparison and included 167 hotels in the year to year comparison.\nThe following table presents EBITDA and certain operating metrics by brands in the Company’s Hospitality Real Estate segment:\nSame Store Consolidated CLNS OP Share Avg.

(“NorthStar I”) and NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc. (“NorthStar II”) in an all-stock transaction. In connection with the closing, CLNC completed the listing of its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CLNC.” The combination creates a permanent capital vehicle, externally managed by the Company, with approximately $5.1 billion in assets and $3.3 billion in equity value as of September 30, 2017 on a pro forma basis. The Company owns 37% of CLNC and earns an annual base management fee of 1.5% on stockholders’ equity and an incentive fee of 20% of CLNC’s core earnings over a 7% hurdle rate.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $26.9 billion of third-party AUM pro forma for the public listing of CLNC compared to $41.7 billion as of September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of our interest in The Townsend Group (“Townsend”), which represented $14.8 billion of AUM as of September 30, 2017.

Key terms of the amendment include, among other terms: (1) the restructuring of the base management fee, which changed from a fixed base fee to a variable fee based on EPRA NAV (as defined in NRE’s public filings with the SEC); (2) modification of the incentive fee, which changed from being based on CAD (as defined in NRE’s public filings with the SEC) per share to 20% over the excess of the Total Stockholder Return (as defined in NRE’s public filings with the SEC, and subject to a high water mark established when an incentive is realized) over a cumulative 10% annual hurdle rate; and (3) reduction of term from an initial 20 year term to a five year term.

In connection with the waiver, the Company agreed that for all matters submitted to a vote of NRE’s stockholders, to the extent the Company owns more than 25% of NRE’s common stock, the Company will vote the excess shares in the same proportion that the remaining NRE shares not owned by the Company are voted. The amendments to NRE’s management agreement and the ownership waiver were approved by a strategic review committee formed in 2017 by NRE's Board of Directors.\nNorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. Management Agreement Amendment\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company agreed to amend and restate its management agreement with NHI effective January 1, 2018.

The Company's calculations of FEEUM may differ materially from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.\nFunds From Operations (“FFO”) and Core Funds From Operations (“Core FFO”)\nThe Company calculates funds from operations (\"FFO\") in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Included in FFO are gains and losses from sales of assets which are not depreciable real estate such as loans receivable, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as well as investments in debt and other equity securities, as applicable.\nThe Company computes core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") by adjusting FFO for the following items, including the Company’s share of these items recognized by its unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures: (i) gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate within the Other Equity and Debt segment, net of depreciation, amortization and impairment previously adjusted for FFO; (ii) gains and losses from sales of businesses within the Investment Management segment and impairment write-downs associated with the Investment Management segment; (iii) equity-based compensation expense; (iv) effects of straight-line rent revenue and straight-line rent expense on ground leases; (v) amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease values; (vi) amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premiums and discounts; (vii) unrealized fair value gains or losses on derivatives and foreign currency remeasurements; (viii) acquisition-related expenses, merger and integration costs; (ix) amortization and impairment of finite-lived intangibles related to investment management contracts and customer relationships; (x) gain on remeasurement of consolidated investment entities and the effect of amortization thereof; (xi) non-real estate depreciation and amortization; (xii) change in fair value of contingent consideration; and (xiii) tax effect on certain of the foregoing adjustments.\nFFO and Core FFO should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income as indications of operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity, nor as indications of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including funds available to make distributions. FFO and Core FFO should not be used as supplements to or substitutes for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s calculations of FFO and Core FFO may differ from methodologies utilized by other REITs for similar performance measurements, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other REITs.\nThe Company uses FFO and Core FFO as supplemental performance measures because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs. The Company also believes that, as widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs, FFO and Core FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare its operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO and Core FFO exclude depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of the Company’s properties that resulted from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of its properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact the Company’s results from operations, the utility of FFO and Core FFO as measures of the Company’s performance is limited. FFO and Core FFO should be considered only as supplements to GAAP net income as a measure of the Company’s performance.\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”) / Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”)\nNOI for healthcare and industrial segments represents total property and related income less property operating expenses, adjusted for the effects of (i) straight-line rental income adjustments; (ii) amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease adjustments to rental income; and (iii) other items such as adjustments for the Company’s share of NOI of unconsolidated ventures.\nEBITDA for the hospitality real estate segment represents net income from continuing operations of that segment excluding the impact of interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization.\nThe Company believes that NOI and EBITDA are useful measures of operating performance of its respective real estate portfolios as they are more closely linked to the direct results of operations at the property level. NOI also reflects actual rents received during the period after adjusting for the effects of straight-line rents and amortization of above- and below-market leases; therefore, a comparison of NOI across periods better reflects the trend in occupancy rates and rental rates of the Company’s properties.\nNOI and EBITDA exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, which are based on different useful life estimates depending on the age of the properties, as well as adjust for the effects of real estate impairment and gains or losses on sales of depreciated properties, which eliminate differences arising from investment and disposition decisions. This allows for comparability of operating performance of the Company’s properties period over period and also against the results of other equity REITs in the same sectors. Additionally, by excluding corporate level expenses or benefits such as interest expense, any gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt and income taxes, which are incurred by the parent entity and are not directly linked to the operating performance of the Company’s properties, NOI and EBITDA provide a measure of operating performance independent of the Company’s capital structure and indebtedness.\nHowever, the exclusion of these items as well as others, such as capital expenditures and leasing costs, which are necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company’s properties, and transaction costs and administrative costs, may limit the usefulness of NOI and EBITDA. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of U.S. GAAP net income (loss) which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, the Company’s methodology for calculating NOI involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with other companies.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss the financial results on Thursday, March 1, 2018 at 7:00 a.m. PT / 10:00 a.m. ET.
