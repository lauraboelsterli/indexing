    "text": "MEXICO CITY, March 27 (Reuters) - Mexican industrial group Mexichem said on Tuesday its Brazilian unit has reached a cease and desist agreement with Brazil’s antitrust agency, Cade, over alleged breaches of competition rules, and will pay 95.1 million reais ($28.6 million) in compensation.\nIn a statement, the Mexican group said Cade notified Mexichem in 2016 of the suspected violations, which concerned former employees during the 2003-09 period.\nBy way of the agreement, Mexichem’s Brazil unit undertook to pay compensation of 95.1 million reais within a 240-day window, it said. Cade also imposed penalties on former staff who worked at the company in the period under investigation.\nMexichem did not give details of the latter sums. ($1 = 3.3278 Brazilian reais) (Writing by Dave Graham Editing by Leslie Adler)\n ",
