    "text": "TORONTO, March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avidian Gold Corp. (TSX-V:AVG) (the “Corporation” or “Avidian”) is pleased to announce the following internal management restructuring to capitalize on the strengths and experience of Directors and Officers that are currently active in the Corporation. The appointments focus on optimizing technical and financial strengths as well as increasing the Corporation’s profile in both the domestic & international markets.\nEffective March 20, 2018, Mr. James Polson, currently a Director of the Corporation, has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Polson is an MBA graduate of the University of Western Ontario, Richard Ivey School of Business and studied Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering at both the University of Tasmania and Deakin University in Australia. Prior to his current posting he was CEO of a Hong Kong based Construction and Mining Services company and co-founder of AIDD Group. AIDD went on to become the leading international mining service group in the Northeast and Central Asian regions, offering a broad range of services from basic exploration drilling through to contract mining and HSE training and certification services. Mr. Polson, who resides in Hong Kong, will greatly enhance Avidian’s exposure to the far east and European markets as well as bring additional strength to the marketing, strategic vision and sustainability practices of the corporation.\nMr. Dino Titaro, who resides in Toronto and is currently a Director, will remain as President and continue to oversee the corporate and technical aspects of the Corporation. Mr. Titaro is a geologist with an MSc degree in economic geology from the University of Western Ontario and has over 35 years of international experience in the mining and exploration sector as well as corporate public company experience. He is co-discoverer of two gold deposits; a European gold-copper deposit that contains a measured plus indicated resource of 7.1 Moz Au and 1.4 billion pounds of copper, that is in the permitting stage, and a 1.0 Moz gold deposit in Brazil that is currently in production. He is a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 and is registered as a P.Geo in Ontario. He currently sits on the board of directors of Yamana Gold Inc, a publicly listed TSX mining company as well as two private resource exploration/development companies.\nAvidian also wishes to announce that Mr. David Anderson, currently a Director, has been appointed as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Anderson has over 40 years’ experience in the exploration industry and was a founding shareholder of Quantec Geoscienes Ltd, QGX Ltd. a junior exploration company focused on mineral exploration in Mongolia and Antares Minerals Inc. a junior exploration company focused on Argentina and Peru. Both QGX and Antares were sold to major mining companies after successfully discovering economic mineral deposits.\nMr. Giulio Bonifacio remains as a Director. Mr. Bonifacio has over 30 years of experience in senior executive roles in the mining industry. Mr. Bonifacio is the founder and director of Nevada Copper. Mr. Bonifacio was the President and CEO of Nevada Copper from 2006 to February 2018. Among his many accomplishments Mr. Bonifacio has raised directly over $600 million through equity and project debt financings for projects of merit as well as being involved in corporate transactions aggregating in excess of a billion dollars. Mr. Bonifacio has led efforts at every stage of development from exploration, development, permitting and construction. Mr. Bonifacio is a Chartered Professional Accountant with extensive experience and knowledge of operations, capital markets, project finance and mergers & acquisitions. Mr. Bonifacio has held previous senior executive roles with Getty Resources Limited, TOTAL Energold Corp., an energy and gold producer, and Vengold Inc., a gold producer, prior to founding Nevada Copper in 2005.\nMr. Victor Bradley continues as a Director and interim CFO until a replacement CFO is appointed. Mr. Bradley is a chartered accountant with more than 50 years’ experience in the mining industry. Over the past 30 years Vic has founded, financed and operated several mining and advanced stage exploration and development companies, including Yamana Gold Inc., Aura Minerals Inc. and Nevoro Inc.
