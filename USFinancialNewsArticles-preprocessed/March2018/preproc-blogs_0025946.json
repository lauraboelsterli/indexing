    "text": "The best-performing social media stock of 2018 isn't the group's long-standing leader Facebook or the resurgent Snap , but Twitter .\nShares of Twitter have run up nearly 50 percent year to date, practically doubling Snap's 24 percent year-to-date gain and leaving shares of Facebook, up less than 5 percent, in the dust.\nTwitter's stock is also the best performer for the past 12 months. In the last year, shares of Twitter have climbed over 130 percent. Facebook's stock gained a little over 30 percent over the same time frame.\nShares of Snap, a photo-messaging app which has struggled since its initial public offering in March 2016, have declined 10 to 15 percent since the IPO.\nFounded in 2006, the San Francisco-based Twitter has gotten a serious boost from President Donald Trump , who frequents its platform to spread his message.\nShares of Twitter were down roughly 3.5 percent as of 2 p.m. ET on Tuesday, hovering around $34 a share. The downtrend began on Monday after the company suspended several popular accounts , some with millions of followers, for violating its new anti-spam rules .\nProgramming Note: For more on Twitter, watch CFO Ned Segal's interview on \"Mad Money\" tonight at 6 p.m. ET.",
