    "text": " 16 p.m. ET Share \nIT services giant finds itself subject of bidding war \nBy Dana Mattioli Doug Cameron \nCACI International Inc. has made a roughly $7.2 billion bid to buy CSRA Inc. in an attempt to break up the information-technology provider’s sale to General Dynamics Corp. \nCACI CACI, +2.14% has offered $44 per share in cash and stock, according to a person familiar with the situation. That would top the $40.75-a-share all-cash deal CSRA CSRA, -0.05% agreed to last month with General Dynamics GD, +0.06% that has yet to close. \nIt isn’t clear what CSRA’s reaction to the bid is and whether CACI will ultimately prevail. \nIt would be a big bite for Arlington, Va.-based CACI, which has a market value of just under $4 billion even after its shares closed at an all-time high Friday. It could have a difficult time outgunning General Dynamics, a major aerospace-and-defense contractor with a market value of $66 billion.",
