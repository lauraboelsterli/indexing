    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 6:37 AM / Updated 30 minutes ago Hilton Food's 2017 sales volume up on Seachill acquisition, tie-ups Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - British meat packer Hilton Food Group ( HFG.L ) on Wednesday said revenue rose over 10 percent in 2017 as recent tie-ups and an acquisition helped it notch higher sales volume for the period. \nThe company, which supplies to supermarkets such as Tesco, Ahold, Albert Heijn and ICA Grupen, said sales volumes rose 10.4 percent to 303,881 tonnes aided by the Seachill deal and on tie-ups with partners in Portugal and Australia. \nHilton bought Seachill - a UK-based fish processor - for 80.8 million pounds in October last year. \nSales volume in Portugal rose after the company entered into a joint venture with food retailer Sonae Modelo Continente in January, Hilton Food said. \nThe company is also restructuring its Australia joint venture with Woolworths ( WOW.AX ) and expects to take full ownership of its two existing plants there from July 1. \nRevenue for the period rose 10.1 percent to 1.36 billion pounds, the company said. \nHilton said sales momentum has continued into 2018 and operating performance in the early months of 2018 has been in line with its expectations. \nShares in the company were trading 3.3 percent higher at 796 pence at 0716 GMT.
