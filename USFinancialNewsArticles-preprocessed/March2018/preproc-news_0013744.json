    "text": "Melody Hahm | CNBC Rick Perry \nU.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Wednesday said his country's relationship with Canada and Mexico could become \"uncomfortable\" during negotiations over their free trade agreement. \nPerry made his comments during a panel with Canadian Minister James Gordon Carr and Mexican Secretary of Energy Pedro Joaquin Coldwell at CERAWeek by IHS Markit in Houston. \nThe United States' relationship with both countries has come under strain as negotiations over NAFTA stretch out and President Donald Trump threatens to slap broad sanctions on steel and aluminum. \n\"Competition is an uncomfortable thing, and relationships are uncomfortable from time to time. Incredibly close relationships are uncomfortable from time to time, and we work our way through those,\" he said. \n\"As we renegotiate NAFTA there are going to be some uncomfortable things, but we realize at the end of this, we are so much stronger together than we are divided.\" \nPerry said the energy industry, leveraging the continent's substantial oil and gas reserves, can create a North American strategy that is powerful around the world. \nTo be sure, the White House hinted on Wednesday that any steel and aluminum tariffs could include carve-outs for Mexico and Canada. \nThe ministers frequently evoked their close relationship, but there was an undercurrent of tension as the threat of trade war and the prospect of NAFTA's collapse loomed over the panel. \nCarr appeared to allude to that tension in his opening remarks. \n\"We come to Houston every year, and we meet in between. The three of us have been on panels together virtually all over the world. It's something which you never want to end but politics being what they are, I don't know how many more we'll have,\" he said. \nCarr said there is perhaps no better example of how a free trade agreement is in the interest of all the countries than the energy sector. \nNorth American energy markets are closely intertwined. Canada ships nearly all of its crude oil exports to the United States, and Mexico's appetite for natural gas has driven a boom in U.S. pipeline shipments in recent years. \nCarr, in an appearance on CNBC, noted that the three countries are dependent on each other and create jobs for each other. He stressed that the U.S. and Canada are allies and major trading partners. \n\"We are absolutely joined, integrated,\" he said, \"which is healthy for all three countries.\" \nHe declined to comment on whether the United States' threats on tariffs are a tactic to push trade talks. \n\"I wouldn't want to speculate on the tactics of the negotiators,\" he said. \nCanada believes the current NAFTA agreement is very good, but it could be refreshed, Carr said.
