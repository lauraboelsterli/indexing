These figures confirm Bitfarms’ market-leading position as the largest and most profitable known cryptocurrency miner in North America. As we look forward, we believe we can substantially increase our financial performance through the addition of 3 – 4 new computing facilities in 2018. In total, it is my hope that we have nearly 100 MW of installed capacity by the end of 2018 which we plan to fund through a combination free-cash flow reinvestment and the proceeds from the current financing we are marketing in Canada,” said Emiliano J. Grodzki, Chief Strategy Officer.\n“It will be an exciting year for Bitfarms and we continue to gain momentum. Our development pipeline is stronger than ever, and our near-term public listing is a major achievement for our team. During the last 56 days of 2017, our operations produced over $200,000 in daily revenue when you include cryptocurrencies in inventory. We have since grown our installed capacity, and each day we are seeing more and more opportunities for growth and integration,” said Wes Fulford, Chief Executive Officer.\nClosing of Merger with Blockchain Mining Ltd.\nThe Company is pleased to report, that its counsel in Israel has confirmed the Israeli Securities Association (“ISA”) has no additional comments on the Disclosure Document which will include these financial results and be filed today. This will allow Blockchain Mining Ltd. and Backbone Hosting Solutions Inc. to complete their merger following a shareholder vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting in Tel Aviv on March 29 th , 2018.\n“It has been an honor to work with this exceptional team of founders over the past few months. Together, we navigated significant obstacles to deliver value to our combined shareholders. Bitfarms will soon officially embark on life as a public company, accessing the capital markets and furthering their mission to power global blockchains with sustainable energy. I look forward to supporting this mission in whatever way I can and wish the company and its founders all the best. I would like to personally thank our legal advisors in Israel, Zitvar & Galor, our legal advisors in Canada, Peterson McVicar LLP, the Nexia Freidman LLP team in Montreal, and Eran Mazor and Tal Levi in Israel for their relentless work during the past few months. I would also like to thank the Israeli Securities Association for working closely and patiently with our company to understand this complex nascent industry. The ISA regulators took the time to learn how to regulate this transaction while recognizing the desire and right of our shareholders to proceed with it. Contrary to press reports, the ISA and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange have shown themselves to be a world-class destination for Fintech. It is my hope that more transactions like this will take place, creating economic prosperity and jobs for the State of Israel. Following the closing of this deal, I will officially be leaving the board marking the end of my 8-year journey in Israeli capital markets. When I acquired control of Cidav Printed Circuits in 2010, its share price was 1.50 NIS per share. Today, BLCM’s share price is 18.00 NIS reflecting a CAGR of 36.4% over 8 years. I am proud of this track record in what was my first foray into the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and would like to thank the long-term shareholders who believed in my leadership and stood by our company,” said Roy Sebag, the current Chief Executive Officer and a director of Blockchain Mining Ltd.\nAbout Blockchain Mining Ltd.\nBlockchain Mining Ltd.

The transaction cannot close until the required shareholder approval is obtained. There can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed as proposed or at all.\nInvestors are cautioned that, except as disclosed in the Company’s regulatory disclosures to be prepared in connection with the transaction, any information released or received with respect to the transactions described herein may not be accurate or complete and should not be relied upon. Trading in the securities of the Company should be considered highly speculative.\nNo stock exchange, securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved or disapproved the information contained herein. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has neither approved nor disapproved the contents of this press release.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThis news release contains non-IFRS financial measures; the Company believes that these measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of its business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating its business. Although management believes these financial measures are important in evaluating the Company's performance, they are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies. For certain non-IFRS financial measures, there are no directly comparable amounts under IFRS. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be viewed as alternatives to measures of financial performance determined in accordance with IFRS. Moreover, presentation of certain of these measures is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of the adjustments thereto provided herein have an actual effect on the Company's operating results.\nIFRS Accounting treatment recognizes revenue once cryptocurrency tokens are transferred to a fiat currency such as US dollars. Therefore, coins mined but not yet sold are not recorded as revenue for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nGross Mining Margin is a Non-IFRS measure. Gross Mining Margin is defined as the revenues from the mining of digital currencies less direct cash costs, being operating and maintenance costs. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, it is helpful to investors to use the Gross Mining Margin to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flows and service debt.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains certain “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws that are based on expectations, estimates and projections as at the date of this news release.
