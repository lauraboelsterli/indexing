    "text": "LAS VEGAS, MGM Resorts International (the \"Company\" or \"MGM Resorts\") (NYSE:MGM) today announced that it will purchase 10 million shares of its common stock from Tracinda Corporation (\"Tracinda\") at $36.24 per share, a 1.5% discount to the market closing price on March 9, 2018, for a total aggregate amount of $362.4 million. Following the purchase, Tracinda will own approximately 27.2 million shares, or 4.8% of the Company's outstanding common stock.\n\"With our larger scale development projects soon coming to completion, today's announcement underscores our confidence in the Company's meaningful cash flow trajectory and commitment to a balanced capital allocation strategy,\" said Jim Murren, Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts. \"This strategy includes prudently investing in attractive growth opportunities and returning excess capital to shareholders while maintaining a strong credit profile, which we believe will maximize shareholder value.\"\nThe repurchase is expected to occur on March 15, 2018 and will be made pursuant to the terms of the Company's $1.0 billion stock repurchase program, of which $310.1 million will remain following the transaction.\nAs of March 8, 2018, there were approximately 566.7 million shares of the Company's common stock outstanding.\nABOUT MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL\nMGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) is an S&P 500® global entertainment company with national and international locations featuring best-in-class hotels and casinos, state-of-the-art meetings and conference spaces, incredible live and theatrical entertainment experiences, and an extensive array of restaurant, nightlife and retail offerings.
