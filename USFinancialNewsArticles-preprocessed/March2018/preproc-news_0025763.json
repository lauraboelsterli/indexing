REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo The company, which is based in Singapore but majority-owned by Bank of China ( 601988.SS ), reported a record net profit of $587 million for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, up from $418 million a year ago, as it grew its fleet. The result was 13 percent higher than the average estimate of $519.5 million of 10 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. BOC Aviation in January had said its earnings would benefit by $88 million to $93 million due to U.S. tax cuts. “Our industry continues to exhibit good health, with stable borrowing costs, robust demand for new aircraft and strong underlying airline customer profits all contributing to the aircraft operating leasing sector’s growth,” BOC Aviation CEO Robert Martin said in a statement. The company’s net lease yield was relatively steady at 8.4 percent, from 8.5 percent as of June 30 as its fleet of owned and managed aircraft grew to 318 as of Dec. 31 from 284 the prior year. The 74 jets delivered in 2017 were the most delivered by Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ) and Boeing Co ( BA.N ) to any aircraft operating lessor last year, BOC Aviation said. Asian lessors are investing billions of dollars to expand in a sector that offers long-term and dollar-based revenue, underscoring the region’s importance to an industry that makes up about 40 percent of the world’s airline fleet. Analysts say a fall in aircraft leasing rates and tight returns for lessors highlight some of the challenges faced by an industry that has emerged as a significant new asset class in recent years. The majority of BOC Aviation’s aircraft are deployed with Asian airlines, with Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd ( 0293.HK ) and Indonesia’s Lion Air Group among its main customers.
