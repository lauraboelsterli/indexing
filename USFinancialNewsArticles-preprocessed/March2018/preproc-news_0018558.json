    "text": "SINGAPORE, March 8 (Reuters) - Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-hailing firm, Grab, is in advanced negotiations to buy parts of Uber Technologies Inc’s business in the region and offer a stake in itself, said a source with knowledge of the talks, in a move that would mark Uber’s pullback from its global expansion.\nSoftBank Group Corp’s emergence as Uber’s largest shareholder in January through a multi-billion dollar funding with a group of investors had increased the possibility of a consolidation with Grab, industry sources had previously said.\nGrab declined to comment while Uber did not immediately respond to Reuters’ queries.\nDuring a visit to India last month, Uber’s CEO pledged to continue investing aggressively in Southeast Asia.
