    "text": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Triple-S Management Corporation (NYSE: GTS), a leading managed care company in Puerto Rico, today announced its fourth quarter 2017 results.\nQuarterly Consolidated and Other Highlights and Subsequent Events\nNet income of $24.2 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, versus net income of $12.0 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the prior-year period; Adjusted net income of $22.1 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, versus adjusted net income of $3.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, a year ago, reflecting the ongoing improvements in the Company's Managed Care operations and the estimated decrease in utilization of medical services caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The net impact of the recent hurricanes represented approximately $0.46 of the improvement in the quarter's adjusted earnings per share; Operating revenues of $706.8 million, a 1.7% decrease from the prior-year period, reflecting lower premiums in the Property & Casualty and Managed Care segments; Consolidated operating income of $41.1 million compared to an operating loss of $1.5 million in the prior-year period; Consolidated loss ratio of 78.2%, driven primarily by lower utilization in Managed Care with a medical loss ratio (\"MLR\") of 80.9%; The Company's Board authorized a $25.0 million expansion of its existing $30.0 million Class B share repurchase program. Under the repurchase program, during the fourth quarter of 2017, 322,381 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $7.7 million. Thus far during 2018, the Company has repurchased an additional 225,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $5.3 million. As of February 27, 2018, including the expansion, $29.4 million of capacity remain in the program.\n\"Our fourth quarter results benefited from lower claims in Managed Care due primarily to the aftereffects of Hurricane Maria, but was also characterized by continued progress of the ongoing initiatives in our Managed Care operations,\" said Roberto Garcia-Rodriguez, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We have made significant improvements to our technology, claims processing and clinical operations. As a result of our expanded relationship with Optum, we expect to further improve our infrastructure throughout 2018, which should ultimately provide our customers with upgraded service while allowing us to achieve additional efficiencies and make our products more competitive and attractive over the long-term.\"\n\"There has been significant progress with respect to Puerto Rico's recovery from the hurricanes over the past few months,\" continued Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez. \"As of late February, potable water was at 99% of capacity, power generation stood at 84% of average, and telecommunications bandwidth has been essentially repaired throughout the island. While there is still work left to return all Puerto Ricans to some sense of normalcy, we believe Puerto Rico is much closer to being fully operational once again and we continue to closely work hand-in-hand with our providers to ensure they are fully functional. We have also been encouraged by the recent Congressional action to support the hurricane recovery with $16 billion in overall federal funding and address the Island's Medicaid cliff with $4.8 billion and a 2-year 100% FMAP federal contribution.\"\n\"Although our providers continue to face certain operational challenges, the vast majority of healthcare services now up and running, so it has been back to the normal course of business for Triple-S over the past couple of months,\" added Mr. Garcia-Rodriguez. \"Looking into 2018, as Puerto Rico's infrastructure is rebuilt, we continue to take the steps necessary to stand out as the preeminent healthcare company in Puerto Rico, ensure that our Managed Care business once again drives our bottom line and create long-term value for our shareholders.\"\nSelected Consolidated Quarterly Details\nConsolidated premiums earned were $687.4 million, down 2.1% from the prior-year period. The decrease reflects lower premiums in the Managed Care segment, primarily due to the profit sharing accrual recorded in 2016 in the Medicaid business and the suspension of the HIP fee pass-through, as well as approximately $6.2 million of estimated reinsurance related costs in the Company's Property and Casualty segment, including estimates for catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement costs for the remainder of 2017. The decrease was partially offset by higher average premium rates in the Managed Care segment's Commercial and Medicaid businesses.\nConsolidated claims incurred were $537.3 million, down 9.6% year over year, mostly due to lower claims incurred across all businesses in the Managed Care segment, driven mainly by favorable fluctuations in prior-period reserve developments, the ongoing improvements in the Company's Managed Care operations and the utilization decrease caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Consolidated loss ratio of 78.2% improved 650 basis points from the prior-year period.\nConsolidated operating expenses of $128.4 million increased 1.6% from the prior-year period, while the operating expense ratio increased 70 basis points year over year to 18.6%. The increase in operating expenses reflects higher personnel costs, business promotion and hurricane-related expenses totaling approximately $12.8 million, partially offset by an $11.1 million decrease in the HIP fee due to the 2017 moratorium.\nConsolidated income tax expense was $17.9 million, an increase of $21.8 million from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting a significant increase in the Managed Care segment's taxable income, which has a higher effective tax rate than the Company's other segments.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the consolidated balance sheet reflects approximately $605 million within claim liabilities of unpaid estimated gross losses related to the hurricanes, as well as $613 million within premiums and other receivables of catastrophe-related losses recoverable from the Property and Casualty reinsurance program.\nSelected Managed Care Segment Quarterly Details\nManaged Care premiums earned were $633.8 million, down 0.9% year over year.\nCommercial premiums of $195.9 million declined 4.3% from the prior-year period, due to lower fully-insured member month enrollment and the suspension of $3.6 million in the HIP fee pass-through in 2017, partially offset by higher average premium rates.\nMedicare premiums of $246.8 million increased 5.2% year over year, largely reflecting an increase in member month enrollment of 28,000 lives, offset, in part, by a $3.8 million decline in additional risk score revenue adjustments and a reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates.\nMedicaid premiums declined 4.6% from the prior-year period to $191.1 million, primarily reflecting the 2.5% excess profit sharing accrual that increased 2016 premiums by $6.3 million, a membership decline of approximately 45,000 member months, and the suspension of $2.7 million in the HIP fee pass-through in 2017; offset in part by an average premium rate increase of approximately 9% that became effective July 1, 2017, following the Medicaid contract extension.\nManaged Care MLR of 80.9% improved 710 basis points from the prior year, mostly reflecting the estimated decrease in utilization caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria and favorable prior-period reserve developments. Excluding the impact of prior-period reserve developments, and moving the Medicare risk score revenue adjustments and other premium adjustments to the corresponding period, the Managed Care MLR would have been 82.5%, 260 basis points lower than the comparable metric a year ago. The estimated decrease in utilization related to the hurricanes lowered the segment's claims incurred and adjusted MLR by approximately $27 million and 430 basis points, respectively.\nManaged Care operating expenses were $95.2 million, down $0.7 million, or 0.7%, year over year, primarily reflecting the HIP fee decrease and mostly offset by an increase in personnel costs, hurricane-related expenses, provision for doubtful accounts and other general and administrative expenses, as discussed above.\nConsolidated Year-End Recap\nConsolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 2.1% year over year to $2.9 billion, primarily reflecting a $58.5 million decline in Managed Care segment premiums due to lower membership in the segment's Commercial and Medicaid businesses, the suspension of the HIP fee pass-through, and lower Medicare risk score revenue adjustments. Consolidated claims for the year were $2.4 billion, a 4.8% decline from the prior year, mostly due to lower claims in the Managed Care segment that were partially offset by increased claims in the Property and Casualty segment. The decrease in Managed Care claims primarily reflects lower claims incurred in all of the segment's businesses, driven by an enrollment decline in the segment's Commercial and Medicaid businesses and the decrease in utilization caused by the two hurricanes, as well as favorable fluctuations in the prior-period reserve developments in the Commercial and Medicare businesses.\nThe Property and Casualty segment's estimated net retained losses related to the hurricanes were approximately $14.8 million after the application of reinsurance. The consolidated loss ratio for 2017 was 83.2%, a 230 basis point improvement primarily driven by an MLR for 2017 of 85.6%, a decline of 300 basis points from the prior year. Consolidated operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $477.2 million and the operating expense ratio was 16.8%.\nAdjusted net income for full year 2017 was $45.5 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $3.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the prior year.\n2018 Outlook\nAs Puerto Rico continues to rebuild, utilization patterns, outward migration and the impact of reconstruction efforts remain somewhat unclear, and in February, the Puerto Rico government issued a request for proposal that will introduce significant changes to the island's Medicaid model by the fourth quarter of 2018. Given these market uncertainties, the Company believes it is premature to provide comprehensive full-year guidance at this time. Instead, it is providing full year 2018 directional guidance regarding its Commercial, Medicare Advantage and ancillary businesses, as well as operating expenses.\nIn the Company's Commercial business, the Company expects full-year at-risk member month enrollment to be between 3.7 million and 3.8 million, and MLR for the full year is expected to be between 80.5% and 82.5%.\nIn the Company's Medicare Advantage business, the Company anticipates full year member month enrollment to be between 1.35 million and 1.45 million, while MLR for 2018 is expected to be between 85% and 87%.\nThe Company's ancillary segments are expected to remain stable in terms of premiums earned. Life insurance premiums earned for 2018 are expected to be between $160 million and $164 million, while Property and Casualty premiums earned for 2018 are expected to be between $76 million and $80 million.\nOperating expenses for full year 2018 are expected to be between $530 million and $545 million, primarily reflecting the reinstatement of the HIP fee.\nConference Call and Webcast\nManagement will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.

Management believes that the use of this adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of realized investment gains and other non-recurring items impacting the Company's results of operations. This non-GAAP metric does not consider all of the items associated with the Company's operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, one should not consider these measures in isolation.\nINVESTOR RELATIONS:\nMr. Garrett Edson\nICR\n(787) 792-6488\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/triple-s-management-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-results-300606305.html\nSOURCE Triple-S Management Corporation",
