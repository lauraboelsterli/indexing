Area utilized (or revenue-generating space) increased by 66.4% Y-o-Y to 61,713 sqm as of December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016: 37,082 sqm). Area in service increased by 66.0% Y-o-Y to 101,258 sqm as of December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016: 60,982 sqm).

We started the year with 13 self-developed data centers in service or under construction and ended the year with 20. We maintained commitment rates at 90% plus. We further strengthened our relationships with key customers, such as Alibaba and Tencent, and established new strategic partnerships with highly influential industry players including CyrusOne in the US and the State Development & Investment Corporation in China. Looking forward, we see continued hyper-scale cloud growth, paving the way for new compute-intensive technologies which will require significant data center capacity. We are strongly positioned to capture this demand and create further value for our shareholders.”\n“We are proud to report our impressive financial results for 2017,” said Mr. Dan Newman, Chief Financial Officer of GDS Holdings. “For the full year, we continued to deliver our backlog, and grew our service revenue by over 58% and Adjusted EBITDA by over 89% year-on-year, both exceeding the high end of our revised guidance. At the same time, we continued to achieve increasing operating leverage with Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year climbing to 31.7%, compared with 25.6% for the prior year. Our existing projects are all fully financed and we have raised significant capital to underpin our expansion plans. Over the year, we successfully completed over US$600 million of total debt financing and re-financing, US$100 million of strategic equity investment by CyrusOne, and US$200 million from the recent follow-on equity offering. We entered 2018 with our largest ever backlog worth around $190 million in terms of annual recurring revenue and providing high visibility for our future growth.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB505.5 million (US$77.7 million), a 62.2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 and a 19.1% increase over the third quarter of 2017. Service revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB493.7 million (US$75.9 million), a 64.7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 and a 16.7% increase over the third quarter of 2017. The sequential increase in net revenue and service revenue was mainly due to the full quarter revenue contribution from additional area utilized in the previous quarter and the contribution from 11,134 sqm of net additional area utilized coming from both the backlog and the acquisition of Guangzhou 2 (“GZ2”) data center which we completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue from IT equipment sales was RMB11.8 million (US$1.8 million), compared with RMB11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB1.4 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nCost of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB387.3 million (US$59.5 million), a 64.3% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 and a 20.4% increase over the third quarter of 2017. The increase over the previous quarter was mainly due to an increase in utility costs as a result of higher area utilized by customers, an increase in depreciation and amortization costs and other related costs such as personnel and maintenance as a result of the completion of the Beijing 3 (“BJ3”), Shenzhen 4 (“SZ4”) Phase 1, and Shanghai 4 (“SH4”) data centers, as well as the acquisition of the GZ2 data center, and an increase in IT equipment cost due to more IT equipment sales, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGross profit was RMB118.2 million (US$18.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 55.7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 and a 15.1% increase over the third quarter of 2017. Gross profit margin was 23.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 24.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 24.2% in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin over the previous quarter was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization costs and other related costs as a result of new data centers coming into service.\nAdjusted Net Operating Income (“Adjusted NOI”) (non-GAAP) is defined as gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization, accretion expenses for asset retirement costs and share-based compensation expenses allocated to cost of revenue. Adjusted NOI was RMB227.2 million (US$34.9 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 61.1% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 of RMB141.0 million and a 12.5% increase over the third quarter of 2017 of RMB201.9 million.\nAdjusted NOI margin (non-GAAP) was 44.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 45.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016, and 47.6% in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease was mainly due to fixed costs of new data centers coming into service which are at an early stage of ramping-up.\nSelling and marketing expenses, excluding share-based compensation expenses of RMB5.6 million (US$0.9 million), were RMB16.9 million (US$2.6 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 6.7% decrease over the third quarter of 2017 of RMB18.1 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB4.7 million) and an 8.6% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016 of RMB18.5 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB1.4 million). The decrease over the previous quarter was primarily due to lower personnel expenses as a result of sales bonus adjustments booked in the quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, excluding share-based compensation expenses of RMB10.0 million (US$1.5 million), were RMB58.4 million (US$9.0 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 2.7% increase over the third quarter of 2017 of RMB56.8 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB7.2 million) and a 21.5% increase from the fourth quarter of 2016 of RMB48.0 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB4.6 million). The small increase over the previous quarter was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs.\nResearch and development costs were RMB2.5 million (US$0.4 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with RMB2.2 million in the fourth quarter 2016 and RMB2.1 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nNet interest expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB136.3 million (US$21.0 million), a 63.3% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 of RMB83.5 million and a 28.9% increase over the third quarter of 2017 of RMB105.7 million. The increase over the previous quarter was mainly due to an increase in total debt from RMB5,942.0 million to RMB6,651.2 million to finance data center capacity expansion, and a one-time debt issuance cost write-off related to debt facilities that were refinanced during the quarter. We also ceased to capitalize borrowing costs for our BJ3, SZ4 Phase 1 and SH4 data centers which commenced operation during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nForeign currency exchange loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB6.8 million (US$1.0 million), compared with a gain of RMB11.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a loss of RMB1.6 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nNet loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB116.5 million (US$17.9 million), compared with a net loss of RMB69.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a net loss of RMB90.3 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is defined as net loss excluding net interest expenses, income tax benefits, depreciation and amortization, accretion expenses for asset retirement costs and share-based compensation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was RMB154.9 million (US$23.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 68.4% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 of RMB92.0 million and an 15.9% increase over the third quarter of 2017 of RMB133.7 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) was 30.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 29.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 31.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease over the previous quarter was mainly due to fixed costs of new data centers coming into service which offset the operating leverage realized as existing data centers ramped up and on corporate overhead costs.\nBasic and diluted loss per ordinary share in the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB0.14 (US$0.02), compared with RMB0.19 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB0.12 in the third quarter of 2017.\nBasic and diluted loss per American Depositary Share (“ADS”) in the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB1.09 (US$0.17), compared with RMB1.54 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB0.95 in the third quarter of 2017. Each ADS represents eight Class A ordinary shares.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenue in 2017 was RMB1,616.2 million (US$248.4 million), a 53.1% increase from 2016. Service revenue in 2017 was RMB1,591.9 million (US$244.7 million), a 58.7% increase from 2016.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, net additional area committed was 19,678 sqm, including contributions from the GZ2 acquisition and from a significant pre-commitment by one of our largest customers for a new build-to-suit data center. The sales increase was driven by rapid cloud adoption and data growth in China leading to higher demand from cloud and large internet players, as well as significant new commitments from large enterprise and financial service institution customers.\nData Center Resources\nArea in service at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 was 101,258 sqm, compared with 60,982 sqm at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and 77,832 sqm at the end of the third quarter of 2017, an increase of 66.0% Y-o-Y and 30.1% Q-o-Q.

Listeners may access the call by dialing:\nUnited States: 1-845-675-0437 International: +65-6713-5090 Hong Kong: +852-3018-6771 China: 400-620-8038 Conference ID: 7569504 A telephone replay will be available approximately two hours after the call until March 20, 2018 by dialing:\nUnited States: 1-646-254-3697 International:\nHong Kong:\nChina: +61-2-8199-0299\n+852-3051-2780\n400-632-2162 Replay Access Code: 7569504 A live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company's investor relation website at investors.gds-services.com .\nNon-GAAP Disclosure\nOur management and board of directors use adjusted NOI, adjust NOI margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, establish budgets and develop operational goals for managing our business. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted NOI and adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure of our core operating performance.\nWe also present these non-GAAP measures because we believe these non-GAAP measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as measures of the financial performance of companies in our industry.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, cash flows or our liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flows used in operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures instead of their nearest GAAP equivalent. First, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted NOI, and adjusted NOI margin are not substitutes for gross profit, net income (loss), cash flows used in operating activities or other consolidated statements of operation and cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Second, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect the impact of net interest expenses, incomes tax benefits, depreciation and amortization, accretion expenses for asset retirement costs, and share-based compensation expenses, each of which have been and may continue to be incurred in our business.\nWe mitigate these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results” set forth at the end of this press release.\nExchange Rate\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“USD”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.
