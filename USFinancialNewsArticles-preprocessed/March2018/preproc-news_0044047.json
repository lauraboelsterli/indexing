    "text": "LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks and currencies started the week with healthy gains on signs of easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\nSouth African markets chalked up some of the biggest gains after the country averted a cut to its credit rating.\nAlarm over a possible trade war has rattled markets in recent weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped hefty tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and announced plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods on Thursday.\nHowever, investors were taking heart from reports that Washington and Beijing were working behind the scenes, with China signalling it was ready to talk. Meanwhile South Korea secured an exemption from the steel tariffs, helping to lift the mood across Asia.\nMSCI’s emerging market’s index rose 0.5 percent following steep falls in the previous trading session, with the benchmark suffering a more than 3 percent fall last week.\nMany Asian bourses racked up solid gains, with heavyweight South Korea rising nearly 1 percent and Hong Kong up 0.5 percent, while equities in much of emerging Europe and Turkey also rose.\n“The market is perceiving (reports on Washington and U.S. talking) as a step in the right direction,” said Vasileios Gkionakis, co-head of strategy research at UniCredit.\n“This is our central scenario, meaning that in the end, if we are going to see any retaliation, it will be more symbolic rather than meaningful. But sentiment remains fragile and we are still subject to plenty of headline risk.”\nBourses in mainland China remained under pressure.\nWith the dollar taking another step lower, emerging currencies also booked gains, with Russia’s rouble, Turkey’s lira and Mexico’s peso all strengthening around half a percent.\nSouth Africa’s rand gained 1 percent against the dollar to trade at its strongest level in a month after Moody’s on Friday affirmed its investment-grade credit rating and revised its credit outlook to stable from negative.\nThe agency said the recovery of institutions in Africa’s most industrialised economy would - if sustained - kick-start the economy as well as providing a stabilisation of fiscal strength. A downgrade would have seen South Africa cut from key bond indexes and could have triggered billions of dollars in outflows.\nDomestic bond markets also rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year sovereign issue at 7.89 percent - a level it last traded at three years ago. Costs of insuring exposure to the country’s external credit also fell.\n“As far as the South Africa-specific idiosyncratic factors are concerned, those are positive for the rand,” said UniCredit’s Gkionakis, predicting the rand could outperform its peers if the backdrop remained benign.\nThe local market’s focus this week will be on the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) interest rate decision on Wednesday.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1178.87 +6.77 +0.58 +1.76\nCzech Rep 1112.46 +4.74 +0.43 +3.18\nPoland 2244.71 -12.51 -0.55 -8.80\nHungary 37131.21 +190.84 +0.52 -5.70\nRomania 8663.34 +2.35 +0.03 +11.73\nGreece 789.86 +4.14 +0.53 -1.56\nRussia 1256.49 -4.95 -0.39 +8.84\nSouth Africa 49623.34 -131.86 -0.27 -5.54\nTurkey 17424.45 +821.63 +0.70 +1.81\nChina 3133.92 -18.84 -0.60 -5.24\nIndia 32921.08 +324.54 +1.00 -3.33\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.42 25.43 +0.05 +0.42\nPoland 4.23 4.22 -0.15 -1.31\nHungary 312.66 312.66 +0.00 -0.68\nRomania 4.66 4.66 +0.09 +0.46\nSerbia 118.53 118.25 -0.24 -0.11\nRussia 56.93 57.22 +0.52 +1.28\nKazakhstan 319.41 320.70 +0.40 +4.19\nUkraine 26.30 26.25 -0.19 +7.02\nSouth Africa 11.64 11.74 +0.85 +6.20\nKenya 100.85 100.85 -0.00 +2.23\nIsrael 3.49 3.48 -0.12 -0.27\nTurkey 3.97 3.98 +0.29 -4.56\nChina 6.28 6.31 +0.54 +3.65\nIndia 64.86 64.98 +0.19 -1.59\nBrazil 3.31 3.31 -0.04 -0.04\nMexico 18.44 18.51 +0.35 +6.52\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 324 -3 .05 7 87.20 1\nReporting by Karin Strohecker, additional reporting and graphic by Claire Milhench; editing by John Stonestreet\n ",
