    "text": "Strategic Acquisition to Further Bolster Multi-Cloud Capabilities of the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nutanix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTNX ), a leader in enterprise cloud computing, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Minjar, Inc. (“Minjar”), the maker of Botmetric, a service that provides customers with unified cost control and enhanced visibility into their workloads running in public clouds. Botmetric, along with Minjar’s other cloud solutions SmartAssist Assurance and SmartAssist Managed Cloud, help enterprises embrace the cloud effectively and optimize their multi-cloud environments for performance and cost. The closing of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301006336/en/\nNutanix Enterprise Cloud OS with Botmetric (Graphic: Business Wire)\nData from 451 Research shows that the future of IT is multi-cloud and hybrid, with 69 percent of respondents planning to have some type of multi-cloud environment by 2019. Yet the growth in multi- and hybrid cloud will make optimizing and analyzing cloud expenditure increasingly difficult 1 . As companies continue to leverage multiple cloud platforms within their broader infrastructure deployments, managing these deployments to avoid waste is critical, and spend management and cost containment are top priorities. Unused public cloud instances or workloads running in the public cloud that are better suited for the private cloud could cause large, unnecessary costs for organizations spending millions of dollars on the cloud. This could be better spent on business-driving activities. Through the Minjar acquisition, the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS will offer customers new capabilities to better manage their multi-cloud deployments.\nOnce the acquisition closes, Nutanix also plans to use Minjar’s technology to bolster its Nutanix Calm automation and lifecycle management product, as well as Xi Cloud Services, a native extension to the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS software. Nutanix Calm will take advantage of Botmetric’s cloud management platform, helping customers reduce costs, save time and bring reliability to multi-cloud management. Integrated with Nutanix Calm, Botmetric can increase visibility into the cost of cloud deployments across multiple platforms, allowing enterprises to optimize which workloads run in which cloud. It will also offer a real-time scan for cloud compliance designed to find risks and security violations so companies can identify and resolve potential cloud security threats before they turn into business challenges. Minjar’s public cloud expertise will also help accelerate and strengthen Nutanix Xi Cloud Services by streamlining and enhancing the customer experience.\n“As companies increasingly rely on the public cloud as part of their critical infrastructure, it’s imperative that they have full visibility into the cost, reliability and security of that infrastructure so that they can effectively manage and automate which workloads run where to maximize performance and ROI,” said Vijay Rayapati, Co-Founder and CEO of Minjar. “We’re so pleased to be joining the Nutanix family to add our technology to the leading edge Nutanix software stack so customers have a simple and elegant experience for managing their multi-cloud environments.”\n“Minjar is a pioneer that provides tangible benefits to enterprise customers on their multi-cloud journey,” said Sunil Potti, Chief Product and Development Officer, Nutanix. “As one of the earliest partners to the leading public clouds, the experience and insights garnered from multiple cloud-native deployments have enabled Minjar to build a robust offering in Botmetric. Minjar’s customer focus and philosophy of one-click simplicity is extremely well aligned with our own, and we are honored to soon welcome them to the Nutanix team. We are looking forward to offering our customers the full breadth of Minjar’s multi-cloud capabilities while deeply integrating them into our Enterprise Cloud OS.”\nMinjar and Botmetric customers can expect further communication from Nutanix following the closing of the acquisition.\nAdditional Resources\nExecutive Blog\nVideo: About Minjar\nHow Botmetric Enhances Nutanix\nPublic Cloud Usage Report from Botmetric\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains express and implied forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements relating to the trend for companies to leverage multi-cloud platforms, the closing of the Minjar acquisition, the impact of the Minjar acquisition to our business, our plans to introduce product features in future releases, including the integration of Botmetric into our offerings, our ability to successfully integrate Minjar and its employees and intellectual property, and our plans and expectations regarding other product features and technology that are under development or in process, and capabilities of such product features and technology.
