FILE PHOTO: Container boxes are seen at the Yangshan Deep Water Port, part of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, in Shanghai, China September 24, 2016. Picture taken September 24, 2016. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo \nChina’s overseas investment will reach $750 billion in the next five years, the foreign ministry said in a statement on its website, citing Wang at a conference in Vietnam. \nWang said China would widen market access and open up its financial sector. \nThe practices of unilateralism and protectionism would be a form of regression, and not only would they lead to a dead end, they would damage one’s own interests, he said. \n(This version of the story corrects to $8 trillion in first paragraph from $8 billion) Reporting by Beijing monitoring desk, editing by Larry King",
