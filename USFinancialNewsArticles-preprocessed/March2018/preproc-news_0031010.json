(OTCQX: ZDPY), a strategic real estate development firm whose primary mission is to identify, develop and lease sophisticated, safe and sustainable properties in emerging industries, including the licensed medical marijuana industry, today announced its financial results for the three and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2017.\nLetter to Shareholders\nManagement today published a shareholder letter, designed to further elaborate on the Company's strategy and recent progress. Interested parties may view this letter here .\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue decreased 2% to $533,000, compared to $543,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting a decrease in third party revenue due to the sale of a building in Tempe, AZ in March 2017, offset by an increase in revenues generated from related party leases. Operating expenses decreased 50% to $329,000, down from $652,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Income from operations was $204,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a loss from operations of $109,000 for the fourth quarter last year. Net income was $189,000, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(166,000), or $(0.01) per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash of $824,000, compared to $366,000 as of December 31, 2016.\nFull-Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue increased 14% to $2.1 million, compared to $1.9 million for the full-year 2016. Operating expenses decreased 33% to $1.4 million, down from $2.1 million for the full-year 2016. Inclusive of the one-time gain of approximately $832,000 on the sale of a property in Tempe, AZ. recognized in the first quarter of 2017, net income was $1.4 million, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(502,000), or $(0.03) per basic and diluted share, for the full-year 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities was $54,000 for the full-year 2017 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $3,100 for the full-year 2016.\n\"At the start of 2017 we expressed our optimism about achieving profitability through increased monthly rental revenue streams and lower operating expenses, and we achieved those goals with revenue growth of 14% and a reduction in our operating expenses of more than 30% to drive net income of $1.4 million and positive cash from operations for the full year,\" commented Bryan McLaren, Chief Executive Officer of Zoned Properties. \"Our 2017 accomplishments not only drove impressive financial results, but also laid the groundwork for us to further invest in other projects to replicate our successes and further drive value for our shareholders.\"\nSupplemental Information Regarding Current Portfolio of Rental Properties\nAt December 31, 2017\nTempe, AZ (a)\nGilbert,\nAZ *\nGreen\nValley,\nAZ\nChino\nValley,\nAZ\nKingman,\nAZ\nTotal\nTotal Rentable Sq.
