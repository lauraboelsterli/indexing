    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 2:10 AM / Updated 11 hours ago Warner to address media on Saturday over ball-tampering Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - David Warner, who has been identified as the instigator of a ball-tampering scandal that rocked the cricket world, will hold a media conference to discuss the issue on Saturday, Cricket Australia (CA) has said. \nA CA investigation found opener Warner had instructed junior batsman Cameron Bancroft on how to scuff up one half of the ball with sandpaper during the third test against South Africa. \nWarner suspended from international and state cricket for 12 months and banned from ever holding a leadership position in the test team. Bancroft was banned for nine months for his part, while axed skipper Steve Smith also received a one-year ban. \nDarren Lehmann said on Thursday he would step down as coach following this week’s match against South Africa. \nCA said on Friday that Warner, who arrived home separately from his former captain, would hold a formal media conference on Saturday. Local media said it would be held at New South Wales Cricket’s offices. \nBoth Bancroft and Smith gave tearful media conferences when they arrived back on Thursday. \nThe 31-year-old Warner has largely been silent since the scandal unfolded despite becoming the target of much of the blame by media, fans, former players and commentators. \nHe arrived back late on Thursday with wife and two daughters and briefly addressed a large number of local media.

Takes a lot guts to do what they did today ..” \nHe was less forgiving of Warner. \n“The revelations from Cricket Australia (CA) on Wednesday that he was the mastermind of the plot and had told Bancroft to cheat were damning,” he wrote in a column for The Telegraph in Britain.

REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko \n“The fact that he had also shown him how to do so by using sandpaper to scuff one side of the ball suggests to me that this was not the first time he had done it. \n“All that is a massive black mark against his name.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
