    "text": "Acquisition Advances Majestic’s Market Expansion Strategy\nRALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Majestic Kitchen & Bath Creations (“Majestic”) announced its acquisition of Wilmington, North Carolina-based Builder’s Glass & Hardware Inc. as part of its continued, strategic expansion plan to increase Majestic’s market share in the Carolinas. This investment enables Majestic to broaden its product portfolio and expand its customer base in Wilmington and along the coastline from Jacksonville, North Carolina to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\nKnown for its experience and service assurance, Majestic’s goal is to be a preferred, single-source provider that can scale with residential builders. With its acquisition of Builder’s Glass & Hardware, Majestic advances towards its goal by now offering customers across all of its locations in Raleigh, Wilmington and Greensboro, North Carolina robust capabilities.\nThis is the third acquisition by Majestic as it continues to advance its market presence in the Carolinas through strategic investments. In December 2017, the company acquired Piedmont Marble Inc. and Tiffany Marble & Glass Co., both located in Greensboro, and consolidated those operations and showrooms under the Majestic brand. Majestic’s market expansion strategy is being led by Scott Byers, a well-known business transformation executive, who was hired in September 2017 as the company’s president and chief executive officer.\n“We are extremely pleased to welcome the employees and customers of Builder’s Glass & Hardware to the Majestic team,” said Byers. “The addition of Builder’s Glass & Hardware into our portfolio falls perfectly in line with our growth strategy. We are focused on our goal to be the preferred, single-source provider of top quality products and professional installation services. This acquisition advances our efforts toward that goal.”\n“Builder’s Glass & Hardware is excited to join the Majestic team,” said Rick Crocker, president of Builder’s Glass & Hardware who will now lead Majestic’s Wilmington operations. “Majestic is known throughout the home building and renovation sectors for its high-quality products, service excellence and installation certainty. We saw a natural fit to combine our collective product mix, industry knowledge and service talents to become part of a brand that is recognized for setting high professional standards in our service category.”\nWithin the next two months, Builder’s Glass & Hardware personnel and inventory will integrate into Majestic’s existing Wilmington facility, located at 3317 Kitty Hawk Road, Suite 300, Wilmington, NC 28405.\nMajestic completed the acquisition on Wednesday, February 28. Additional terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.\nNEW MEDIA CONTENT:\nMajestic Kitchen & Bath Creations on Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MajesticKitchenandBathRaleigh/\nMajestic Kitchen & Bath Creations on LinkedIn\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/2198811/\nMajestic Kitchen & Bath Creations Blog\nhttp://www.gomajestic.com/blog/\nABOUT MAJESTIC KITCHEN & BATH CREATIONS:\nMajestic Kitchen & Bath Creations manufacturers and offers among the widest selection of granite, cultured marble, quartz, solid surface, stone and glass products, door hardware, locksets, storefront glass, shower enclosures, mirrors, closet shelving and kitchen and bath accessories in North Carolina with locations in Raleigh, Wilmington and Greensboro.
