    "text": "GMC will sell a new line of off-road packages for its trucks and SUVs that aims to take advantage of recent enthusiasm for dirt-worthy utility vehicles as the overall consumer shift toward SUVs and trucks continues unabated.\nThe AT4 package is positioned to lure customers away from competitors that have been raking in cash in recent years, such as Fiat Chrysler's successful Jeep brand, and the somewhat unexpectedly popular Ford Raptor off-road pickup, which began with a small team within Ford working with a modest budget.\nGMC unveiled the AT4 package on a GMC Sierra full-size pickup truck at an event in New York on Monday. It plans to sell the package across its line, GMC said.\nAmong other things, it includes a 2-inch factory-installed suspension lift, s tandard four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case, locking rear differential and skid plates, o ff-road-tuned shock absorbers, a few different wheel and tire options, and a s tandard 5.3 liter V-8 engine.\nGMC is typically known for selling trucks that share much of their DNA with Chevrolet, but offer high-end trims and other features. Chevrolet released an off-road-ready version of its mid-size Colorado pickup called the ZR2 in 2017.\nFord has also been ramping up its selection of more rugged vehicles with a planned Ford Bronco, and a still-unnamed smaller off-road SUV.\nWATCH: Here's why people are lining up to spend $100,000 on this SUV show chapters Hereâ€™s why people are lining up to spend $100,000 on this SUV 6:33 PM ET Thu, 1 March 2018 | 03:18",
