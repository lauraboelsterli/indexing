    "text": "WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- I.D. Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDSY), a leading provider of enterprise asset management technology, reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement Commentary\n“The fourth quarter represented a continuation of strong growth and operational momentum achieved over the last several quarters,” said I.D. Systems CEO Chris Wolfe. “More specifically, we achieved our third consecutive quarter of topline growth, improved profitability, as well as operating cash flow generation, which improved to $3.9 million in 2017. In fact, the company has been profitable on a non-GAAP earnings basis for the last three quarters.\n“Operationally, we strengthened our core business and diversified our offerings in the market. In our Industrial Truck division, we saw growth in OEM and independent dealer channel sales, in addition to expanding business with strategic enterprise accounts. Also, we completed system development and production readiness of our solution with Avis Budget Group. We are working to deploy the first 50,000 systems this year, which is in line with the initial phase of their stated plan to have a fully connected fleet by 2020.\n“Integration of Keytroller, which we acquired in August 2017 and is now part of our Industrial Truck division, is progressing ahead of plan, having already produced meaningful sales and product synergies. Our combined product strategy includes a new product being introduced this summer that is specifically designed for the mid- to smaller-site market. This new product’s features, pricing and ease of implementation will gain access to a new untapped market of more than five million industrial trucks worldwide. Our significant operational progress in 2017, combined with our strong balance sheet of $16.9 million in cash and investments and no debt, has established a solid foundation for us to leverage going forward.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue increased 21% to $11.2 million from $9.2 million in same year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to higher Rental Fleet revenue and Industrial Truck revenue.\nRecurring revenue increased by 2% to $4.5 million from $4.4 million in the same period a year ago.\nGross margin increased to 50.2% from 47.4% in the same period a year ago.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $5.9 million, compared to $5.3 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was due to the inclusion of expenses from Keytroller in the fourth quarter of 2017, which were absent in the same period a year ago.\nResearch and development expenses were $0.9 million, compared to $1.1 million in the same year-ago quarter.\nExcluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency translation losses, and acquisition-related expenses, non-GAAP net income totaled $200,000 or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, an improvement from non-GAAP net loss of $832,000 or $(0.06) per basic and diluted share in the same year-ago quarter.\nNet loss totaled $874,000 or $(0.05) per basic and diluted share, an improvement from a net loss of $2.1 million or $(0.16) per basic and diluted share in the same year-ago quarter.\nAt quarter-end, the company had $16.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared with net cash of $3.9 million in the same year-ago quarter.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue increased 11% to $41.0 million in 2017 compared to $36.8 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to higher Rental Fleet revenue and Industrial Truck revenue.\nRecurring revenue increased 4% to $18.8 million from $18.0 million in the same period a year ago.\nGross margin improved to 51.1% from 49.7% in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% to $21.1 million in 2017 from $20.1 million in 2016, principally driven by higher expenses related to the Keytroller acquisition.\nResearch and development expenses decreased 13% to $4.0 million in 2017 from $4.5 million in same year-ago period.\nExcluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency translation losses, and non-recurring items, non-GAAP net loss totaled $356,000 or $(0.02) per basic and diluted share, an improvement from a non-GAAP net loss of $2.9 million or $(0.22) per basic and diluted share in the same year-ago period.\nNet loss totaled $3.9 million or $(0.26) per basic and diluted share, an improvement from a net loss of $6.4 million or $(0.49) per basic and diluted share in the same year-ago period.\nNet cash provided by operations was $3.9 million, an improvement from net cash used in operations of $2.5 million in 2016.\nInvestor Conference Call\nI.D.

Systems provides certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income/loss and non-GAAP net income/loss per basic and diluted share. Reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared under current accounting standards, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of I.D. Systems’ current financial performance. Specifically, I.D. Systems believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. Because I.D. Systems’ method for calculating the non-GAAP measures may differ from other companies’ methods, the non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release to the nearest GAAP measures can be found in the financial tables included in this press release.\nAbout I.D.

Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to I.D. Systems’ beliefs, plans, goals, objectives, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions, and future performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond I.D. Systems’ control, and which may cause its actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
