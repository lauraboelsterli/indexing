Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are set forth in National Vision’s filings with the SEC, including its registration statement on Form S-1, as amended from time to time, and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017, under the caption “Risk Factors.” Any forward-looking statement in this release speaks only as of the date of this release. National Vision undertakes no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable securities laws.\nContacts\nNational Vision Holdings, Inc.\nKristina Gross, Director of Communications\n(470) 448-2355\nKristina.gross@nationalvision.com\nor\nNational Vision Holdings, Inc.\nDavid Mann, CFA, Vice President of Investor Relations\n(470) 448-2448\ninvestor.relations@nationalvision.com\nSource:National Vision Holdings, Inc.",
