    "text": "VANCOUVER, Canada, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nubeva Technologies Ltd. (the \" Corporation \"), formerly Sherpa Holdings Corp., is pleased to announce that it has completed its qualifying transaction (the \" Qualifying Transaction \") on February 28, 2018 pursuant to Policy 2.4 - Capital Pool Companies of the TSX Venture Exchange (\" TSXV \") and that the Corporation's common shares (the \" Common Shares \") will be listed at the opening of trading on March 2 under the ticker symbol \"NBVA\". The Common Shares will remain halted effective at the opening on March 2, 2018 and will commence trading at the opening on March 7, 2018, in accordance with the TSV's approval of the Qualifying Transaction.\nIn accordance with the previously announced merger agreement dated February 26, 2018 (the \" Merger Agreement \"), Sherpa USA Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, merged with Nubeva, Inc. (\" Nubeva \"). The Qualifying Transaction was structured as a reverse triangular merger under the Delaware General Corporation Law as a result of which Nubeva became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation.\nPrior to the completion of the Qualifying Transaction, the Corporation filed articles of amendment to, among other things: (a) effect a share consolidation (the \" Consolidation \") at a ratio of one (1) post-consolidation Common Share in the capital of the Corporation for each five (5) pre-consolidation Common Shares in the capital of the Corporation, (b) change its name (the \" Name Change \") to \"Nubeva Technologies Ltd.\", from \"Sherpa Holdings Corp.\" and (c) create restricted voting common shares in the capital of the Corporation (the \" Restricted Common Shares \"). The Restricted Common Shares will not be listed on the TSXV, and will be convertible into Common Shares on a one-for-one basis in certain events.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Corporation issued 37,164,085 Common Shares and 13,000,000 Restricted Common Shares.\nPrivate Placement\nIn conjunction with the Qualifying Transaction, Nubeva raised gross proceeds of C$10,100,020 in a private placement financing (the \" Private Placement \") of subscription receipts (the \" Subscription Receipts \") with Echelon Wealth Partners Inc. (the \"Lead Agent\" ) along with PI Financial Corp. (together with the Lead Agent, the \" Agents \") Pursuant to the Private Placement, Merger Agreement, the Subscription Receipts were converted into 13,032,284 Common Shares upon closing of the Qualifying Transaction. In connection with the Private Placement, the Agents received: (i) an advisory fee of C$60,000 and (ii) a case commission equal to 6.0% of the gross proceeds of the Private Placement. Nubeva further issued the Agents 1,010,002 warrants to purchase common shares in the capital of Nubeva (the \" Agent's Compensation Warrants \") equal to 6% of the securities sold pursuant to the Private Placement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Agent's Compensation Warrants were exchanged for 781,933 warrants to purchase Common Shares.\nOfficers and Board of Directors\nThe board of directors of the Corporation now consist of four directors, of which two are independent, all of whom have been appointed by Nubeva. In addition, the management of the Corporation has been replaced with Nubeva's management as set out below. Mr. Randy Chou, the CEO and President of the Corporation holds more than 10 percent of the issued and outstanding Common Shares.\nName\nOfficer\nRandy Chou\nPresident, CEO, Director and >10% shareholder\nGreig Bannister\nCTO and Director\nDavid Wu\nDirector\nDavid Warner\nDirector\nSteve Perkins\nCMO\nJuliet Jones\nCFO\nTSXV Acceptance\nThe Corporation has received acceptance from TSXV in respect of its Qualifying Transaction and related transactions including: (i) change in trading symbol to \"NBVA\", (ii) the Private Placement, (iii) the Consolidation, (iv) the Name Change and (v) the reclassification of Common Shares as a Tier 1.
