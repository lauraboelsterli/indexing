Completion of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nValchlor ® is the first and only FDA-approved topical formulation of mechlorethamine. It was launched in the U.S. at the end of 2013 and sales have grown from $11 million in 2014 to $35 million globally in 2017. In the U.S., approximately 15,000 patients are currently diagnosed with stage IA-IB MF-CTCL, qualifying it as a rare or orphan disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted it orphan drug designation. To date, limited treatment choices are available for those patients who can benefit from Valchlor ® through the reimbursement by a wide range of public and commercial payers.\nThe Group's U.S. subsidiary, Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc., will draw on its extensive experience in cancer care products' sales to market Valchlor ® in the U.S. and build upon the strong sales base it has already developed in the region.\nThe drug, known as Ledaga ® in EU was approved by the European Commission in March 2017, for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in adult patients for all stages and was granted orphan drug designation in 2012. In France, patients benefit from the drug under a temporary authorization for use (\"Autorisation Temporaire Utilisation\") program initiated during the second half of 2014.\nRiccardo Braglia, Helsinn Group Vice Chairman and CEO, commented: \"Helsinn is delighted to announce the acquisition of Valchlor ® /Ledaga ® , for the treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who have received prior skin-directed therapy. This is a discomforting disease which has a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Helsinn is committed to developing and marketing products designed to help people with cancer get the most out of every day and benefit from Valchlor ® , which is approved and marketed in the U.S. where limited treatment choices are available. We are excited to be adding this drug to our portfolio of products designed to offer appropriate cancer therapeutic and supportive care treatment options to patients. We are looking forward to bringing the drug to more patients worldwide\".\nRothschild S.p.A. acted as the sole financial adviser to Helsinn on the acquisition.\nTerms of the acquisition are not being disclosed.\nEND\nAbout Valchlor ® /Ledaga ®\nValchlor ® /Ledaga ® gel is an alkylating drug indicated for the treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-CTCL).

The cause of MF remains unknown and there are no curative treatments. MF has an indolent clinical course, slowly progressing from patches to thicker plaques and eventually to tumours over years or decades. Signs include rash, patch and plaques with severe itch. MF typically affects older adults (median age at diagnosis: 55-60 years) with male predominance. In the U.S., approximately 15,000 patients are affected by stage IA-IB MF-CTCL. Epidemiologic studies based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) databases have shown a threefold increase in CTCL incidence in the US during the last 25-30 years.\nAbout the Helsinn Group\nHelsinn is a privately owned pharmaceutical group with an extensive portfolio of marketed cancer care products and a robust drug development pipeline.
