    "text": "GREENWICH, Conn., March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FrontFour Capital Group LLC, together with its affiliates (\"FrontFour\" or \"we\"), a significant stockholder of ILG, Inc. (\"ILG\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ILG) that has nominated four highly qualified director candidates for election to ILG's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") at the Company's upcoming 2018 annual meeting of stockholders (the \"2018 Annual Meeting\"), today issued a public letter to the Board regarding FrontFour's ongoing concerns. The full text of the letter follows:\nMarch 15, 2018\nDear Members of the Board,\nWhile we were encouraged by ILG's formation of a Strategic Review Committee, we are also left with many questions and concerns. Specifically, despite delivering our formal nomination of director candidates in late January and our repeated attempts to engage in a dialog with the independent members of the Board, we have come to the realization that you are not interested in having a constructive dialog with us. During our latest discussion with your financial advisors earlier this week, we requested clarity on the record date and reiterated our desire to work with you toward a framework for fresh stockholder representation on the Board. Our request has gone unanswered. Now, with a looming record date for the 2018 Annual Meeting, we are left with no choice but to communicate our concerns via a public forum.\nTo begin, we have been advised that ILG has notified Broadridge Financial Solutions of three separate record dates for the 2018 Annual Meeting â€“ March 21 st , March 29 th and April 4 th . Knowledge of the record date is critical so that stockholders can take whatever steps may be necessary with their custodial banks and brokerage firms to ensure that they have the ability to vote their shares at the 2018 Annual Meeting. We are concerned that notifying the street of multiple record dates will confuse investors and may result in certain stockholders, particularly institutional investors that may need to re-call their shares, being disenfranchised at the 2018 Annual Meeting. We question why ILG provided notice of multiple record dates and demand that the Board immediately clarify the true record date for the 2018 Annual Meeting .\nIn addition, we are concerned with the manner in which the Company disclosed the strategic review process. We, along with many other investors, were confused as to why such an important announcement was only made at the end of CEO Craig Nash's prepared remarks during the Company's conference call on February 28 th rather than also being included in the press release issued on the same day. Why would the Company not want to maximize the dissemination of this very important information? In addition, in order to give comfort to the stockholder base that the Company intends to run a robust strategic review process, it is also unclear to us why the Company has not disclosed the members of the Strategic Review Committee.\nFurther, we believe that the addition of our director candidates to the Board and the Strategic Review Committee would bring added credibility to the strategic review process and benefit the Company's stockholders. As per your request, we would like nothing more than to make our nominees available to be interviewed provided that you are prepared to work constructively and in good faith with us to come to an amicable resolution regarding the composition of the Board and the Strategic Review Committee. However, it is difficult to work toward a mutually agreeable resolution given your refusal to directly engage with us.\nWhile we are willing to enter into a constructive dialogue with the Board to come to an amicable resolution, we are otherwise committed to seeking the election of our director candidates at the 2018 Annual Meeting.\nSincerely,\n/s/ Zachary R. George\n/s/ David A. Lorber\n/s/ Stephen E. Loukas\nZachary R. George\nPortfolio Manager\nDavid A. Lorber\nPortfolio Manager\nStephen E.
