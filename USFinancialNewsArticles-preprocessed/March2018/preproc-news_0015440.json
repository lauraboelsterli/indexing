The Company, issued and sold 1,363,636 shares of Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the \"Series D Preferred Stock\"), in a public offering. Each share of Series D Preferred Stock was sold to investors at an offering price of $16.50 per share. Net proceeds from the public offering totaled $21.21 million, which includes the impact of the underwriters' selling commissions and legal, accounting and other professional fees.\nOPERATIONS AND LEASING\nThe Company's leased percentage is 92.8% of GLA at December 31, 2017, including leases executed through January 10, 2018. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company executed 22 lease renewals totaling 77,498 square feet at a weighted-average increase of $0.41 per square foot, representing an increase of 2.99% over prior rates. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, Wheeler signed 11 new leases totaling approximately 41,906 square feet with a weighted-average rate of $8.89 per square foot. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company executed 112 lease renewals totaling 570,461 square feet at a weighted-average increase of $0.29 per square foot, representing an increase of 3.10% over prior rates. In December 2016, at the time of the Village of Martinsville acquisition, a decrease in rent was anticipated for the 23,523 square foot space occupied by Office Max. The renewal occurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 at a premium to the Company's underwritten rental rate at the time of acquisition. If adjusted to exclude the Office Max renewal the weighted-average increase on renewals for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 would total $0.36 per square foot, representing an increase of 3.91% over prior rates. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Wheeler signed 55 new leases totaling approximately 160,341 square feet with a weighted-average rate of $11.87 per square foot. Approximately 9.39% of Wheeler’s gross leasable area (\"GLA\") is subject to leases that expire during the year ending December 31, 2018. Of the GLA expiring during the year ending December 31, 2018, 47.6% of the GLA is subject to renewal options. In September 2017, the Company modified leases with two anchor tenants. The lease modifications include a reduction of lease term from 2028 to 2023 on 34,264 square feet and no change in the 2018 lease expiration term on 33,218 square feet. The overall weighted average base rent reduction is $5.59 per square foot.\nDIVIDENDS\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company paid dividends of approximately $3.2 million to the holders of shares of our Common Stock and OP Units and approximately $2.3 million to our holders of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company declared approximately $13.5 million in dividend payments to the holders of shares of our Common Stock and OP Units and approximately $9.2 million to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock.\nSAME STORE RESULTS\nSame-store NOI year-over-year growth for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.3% on a GAAP basis and (0.1)% on a cash basis. The same-store pool comprises the 3.2 million square feet that the Company owned as of January 1, 2016. Same-store results were driven by a decrease of 3.8% in property operating expenses primarily resulting from a decrease in real estate taxes, insurance and grounds and landscaping while property revenues remained relatively flat.\nACQUISITIONS\nSubsequent to the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company acquired an 887,917 square foot office and retail property located in Norfolk, Virginia known as JANAF for $85.65 million.\nDISPOSITIONS\nSubsequent to the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of the Chipotle ground lease at Conyers Crossing for a contract price of $1.27 million, resulting in a gain of $1.05 million with net proceeds of $1.16 million.\nCONFERENCE CALL DIAL-IN AND WEBCAST INFORMATION:\nThe dial-in numbers are:\nLive Participant Dial-In (Toll-Free): 877-407-3101\nLive Participant Dial-In (International): 201-493-6789\nThe conference call will also be webcast.

Wheeler’s portfolio contains well-located, potentially dominant retail properties in secondary and tertiary markets that generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns, with a particular emphasis on grocery-anchored retail centers. For additional information about the Company, please visit: www.whlr.us .\nA copy of Wheeler’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes the Company’s consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion & analysis of financial condition and results of operations, will be available upon filing via the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website ( www.sec.gov ) or through Wheeler’s website at www.whlr.us .\nDEFINITIONS\nFFO, AFFO, Pro Forma AFFO, Property NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Wheeler considers FFO, AFFO, Pro Forma AFFO, Property NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be important supplemental measures of its operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate and gains and losses from property dispositions, the Company believes that it provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from the closest GAAP measurement, net income.\nManagement believes that the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT’s definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company’s real estate assets. These items include, but are not limited to, nonrecurring expenses, legal settlements, legal and professional fees, and acquisition costs. Management uses AFFO, which is a non- GAAP financial measure, to exclude such items. Management believes that reporting AFFO and Pro Forma AFFO in addition to FFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investment community to use when evaluating the operating performance of the Company on a comparative basis. Management also believes that Property NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA represent important supplemental measures for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, as they are often used in calculating net asset value, leverage and other financial metrics used by these parties in the evaluation of REITs.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release may contain “forward-looking” statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When the Company uses words such as “may,” “will,” “intend,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate” or similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters, it is making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations discussed in the forward-looking statements.

Specifically, the Company’s statements regarding: (i) the future generation of financial returns from the acquisition of retail focused properties in secondary and tertiary markets; (ii) the Company's suspension of the Common Stock dividend and its ability to increase financial flexibility, strengthen the balance sheet and facilitate strategic initiatives from the cash savings generated by the suspension of the Common Stock and OP Unit dividend; (iii) the expected identification and implementation of strategic alternatives that could increase shareholder value are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. For these reasons, among others, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements in this press release.\nAdditional factors are discussed in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available for review at www.sec.gov .
