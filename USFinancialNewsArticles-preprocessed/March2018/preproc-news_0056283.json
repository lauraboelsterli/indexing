    "text": "0 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The first full week of witness testimony in the trial over the $85 billion merger of AT&T Inc. T 0.25% and Time Warner Inc. TWX 0.40% started with some bright spots for the Justice Department’s case against the deal, but the government hit potential bumps as the week drew to a close.\nOne of the Justice Department’s early witnesses was Dish Network Corp. executive Warren Schlichting, who runs Dish’s Sling TV, an internet-based pay-TV service for cord-cutting customers. His testimony was in line with one of the department’s central arguments against the merger: that AT&T, which owns the DirecTV satellite service, could disadvantage other pay-TV distributors if it owns Time Warner’s Turner networks like TBS, TNT and CNN.\nRelated \nDOJ and AT&T Clash Over Impact on Consumers of a Time Warner Deal (March 22) AT&T Targets DOJ Antitrust Chief in Time Warner Fight (Feb. 14) Justice Department Files Lawsuit Challenging AT&T-Time Warner Deal (Nov. 20, 2017) Mr. Schlichting testified that Turner networks are important for pay-TV lineups and that a postmerger AT&T is likely to raise Turner networks’ carriage fees and impose burdensome conditions on Dish and Sling, which in turn could hurt their ability to offer popular packages to budget-conscious consumers. It could even lead to blackouts of Turner content, he said.\nOn Thursday, the Justice Department’s case got murkier when it called to the stand John R. Hauser, a marketing professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Hauser testified about a study he conducted that showed that around 12% of customers would switch to a new pay-TV provider if their current one suffered a long-term blackout of the Turner networks.\nThe switching question is important for the Justice Department’s legal theory that AT&T could use Turner as leverage over rivals.\nIn his cross-examination of Mr. Hauser, Time Warner lawyer Peter Barbur said the study was a hypothetical exercise that ignored real-world evidence of how consumers have responded in past blackout situations.\nMr. Barbur also said the professor based his survey conclusions “on two groups of 400 respondents,” which he suggested wasn’t nearly enough of a basis on which to craft statistics that could be used to block a merger of this size.\nMr. Hauser said his switching estimates were accurate and based on long-accepted methodologies and a large-enough sample size.\nAt the end of Mr. Hauser’s testimony, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon expressed some skepticism about the data, asking if it was possible to know if survey respondents were telling the truth.\n“You have no way of knowing,” Judge Leon said, adding that the respondents “can just whip through it” instead of taking the questions as seriously as one would like on an issue of this magnitude.\nHe also said such surveys may be more effective at determining generically whether a consumer preferred one product over another, instead of what customers might do in a more complex situation in which Turner channels might be dropped from a pay-TV lineup.\nThe week ended with testimony from Comcast Corp. executive Greg Rigdon, who negotiates with programmers on the financial terms for carrying their channels. Mr. Rigdon was a Justice Department witness but his answers indicated Comcast didn’t have the same kind of concerns about the deal as other distributors like Dish.\nMr. Rigdon said Comcast, in two recent negotiations with Turner, agreed to raise the prices it would pay for the networks. Comcast’s decision to do so appeared to be based at least in part on internal studies suggesting the company could lose customers if it didn’t reach a Turner agreement. Those factors could boost the government’s argument that the Turner networks are “must-have” content.\nMr. Rigdon, however, declined to offer details on the internal studies in open court and part of his testimony took place in a closed session.\nIn other parts of his open testimony, Mr. Rigdon, under questioning by a Time Warner lawyer, said he didn’t expect Comcast would have more difficult negotiations with Turner and Time Warner if AT&T owned them. He also denied that Comcast would act in tandem with AT&T to dominate the industry.\nMr. Rigdon also was asked about the Justice Department’s MIT expert, and the Comcast executive said the professor’s estimates about the number of customers who might switch in a blackout could be higher than what past real-world experiences might indicate.\nThe case has moved fairly slowly so far, with only six witnesses taking the stand in five days.\nJudge Leon said that time is of the essence and told the parties to confer over the weekend and decide how many witnesses each side actually needs.\nAT&T and Time Warner extended their acquisition deadline to June 21 to give the judge time to reach a decision.\n—Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.\nWrite to Brett Kendall at Brett.Kendall@wsj.com",
