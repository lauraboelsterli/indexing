The volume traded in the previous trading session was 1.58 billion. ** At close, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 28.19 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Hang Seng index was 13.2 as of the last full trading day while the dividend yield was 2.8 percent.
