He joins McCann from 360i where he served as Chief Strategy Officer and head of the agency's business consulting practice as well.\n\"Lee is ideal for this role inasmuch as he has experience across and an insatiable love for all of the different flavors of strategy from brand to social to digital to media and beyond,\" said Suzanne Powers, Global Chief Strategy Officer of McCann Worldgroup. \"Given that he is also incredibly passionate about finding and nurturing teams and talent, he is that rare combination of being a superstar in his own right coupled with having deep leadership and team-building skills.\"\nIn his role as McCann North America's Chief Strategy Officer, Maicon will lead the agency's multi-disciplined strategic planning team, have responsibilities for the agency brand itself, and be a core member of both of the North American leadership team and the McCann Worldgroup Global Strategic Leadership Community.\nChris Macdonald, President of McCann Worldgroup North America, said, \"We're delighted to have someone of Lee's talent and experience joining us in North America to help us continue to drive our strategic and creative capabilities for our clients.

Born in Mexico and raised in Miami, he began his career as an account planner at the Hispanic marketing agency Conill Advertising and has subsequently worked in top strategy positions in both general-market and multicultural agencies as well as in PR. He joined 360i from Grey Group's Wing multicultural agency where he was Head of Strategy, and previously worked as Director of Strategy Planning at the DeVries Global PR agency. He has also held leading strategy positions at Berlin Cameron and Strawberry Frog as well as in the Hispanic marketing field at StarMedia Networks and Univision.\nAdded Devika Bulchandani, President of McCann New York: \"As we push our creative product to new boundaries we really welcome someone like Lee who has been at the forefront of our industry in developing brand strategies that are attuned to the dramatic changes affecting consumers, technology and marketing channels today,\"\nSaid Lee Maicon: \"I have always been inspired by the motto of 'Truth Well Told' and it's clear that McCann's impressive record helping major marketers build strong and meaningful brands has only accelerated strategic and creative momentum in recent years. I look forward to joining with Suzanne, Chris and Devika and their teams to continue this impressive trajectory.\"\nMcCann, recently named Adweek's U.S. Agency of the Year and No. 2 for the second straight year on Ad Age's Annual Agency A-List ranking, was also last year's most awarded Cannes agency in North America.
