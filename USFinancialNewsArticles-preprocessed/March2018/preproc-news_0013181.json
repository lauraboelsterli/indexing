    "text": "Former Associate CIO for Penn Medicine to lead company’s cybersecurity solution initiatives\nVIENNA, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merlin International, a leading cybersecurity solutions provider for government and commercial clients, announced today that they have promoted Brian Wells to Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Brian previously served the company as Director of Healthcare Strategy, executing the expansion of the company’s federally focused solution portfolio into the commercial space. In addition to continuing to lead the company’s healthcare strategy, in this new role Brian will be instrumental in acting as a liaison between sales and engineering to ensure that development efforts are aligned with market demand. With more than 35 years of leadership experience in the hospital, physician, academic, medical center and payer information systems areas, Brian is well positioned to lead the company’s cybersecurity initiatives in both the commercial and government markets.\n“We are fortunate to have Brian as part of the Merlin team and excited to advance him to the role of CTO,” stated David Phelps, Chairman and CEO of Merlin International. “His extensive background in all aspects of healthcare product development, informatics, infrastructure and management, and as a health care provider Associate CIO, gives him the experience and expertise to lead Merlin in delivering next generation cybersecurity solutions to the healthcare industry and other markets as we continue to grow market share.”\nPrior to joining Merlin, Brian spent 10 years as the Associate Chief Information Officer of Health Technology and Academic Computing for the University of Pennsylvania Health System / Perelman School of Medicine where he led a team of software developers focused on web applications, data integration and data warehousing analytics. He is a Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Fellow - in recognition of his leadership within HIMSS, experience in and contributions to the health IT industry - as well as a frequent speaker on panels and at conferences across the nation.\n\"I'm thrilled to continue to further my role within Merlin as part of its pioneering work toward improving healthcare industry cybersecurity readiness and facilitating the delivery of efficient, reliable and secure patient services in both government and commercial organizations,\" commented Wells.\nBrian will next appear at the HIMSS18 conference in Las Vegas where he will preview the findings of a Merlin sponsored Ponemon Institute survey of hospital and payer organization healthcare executives on their cybersecurity-related challenges and strategies ahead of its public release, March 12.
