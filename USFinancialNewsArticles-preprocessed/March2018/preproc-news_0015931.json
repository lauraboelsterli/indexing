    "text": "(Reuters) - Discount store operator Dollar Tree Inc ( DLTR.O ) on Wednesday reported disappointing holiday-quarter sales and issued a full-year profit forecast that was below expectations, as it spends more, sending its shares down as much as 16 percent.\nFILE PHOTO: A shopping cart is seen inside a Dollar Tree discount store in Garden City, New York, U.S., May 23, 2016. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo Driver shortages in the trucking industry coupled with rising wages for hourly retail workers in a tight labor market, have increased costs for brick-and-mortar retail chains, which are already pouring a lot of money into their online business.\nFocusing on customer service as a tool to one-up Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) has also forced many retailers to pay hourly workers higher wages or dole out bonuses, denting profits further.\nDollar Tree said it would spend $100 million of the benefit from a new corporate tax law to raise wages of hourly workers, give them more work hours and offer paid maternity leave for some employees, joining similar moves made by Walmart Inc ( WMT.N ) and Target Corp ( TGT.N ).\nBut as a result, rising wage actions and freight costs would hurt full-year profits by $68 million, the company said on a call.\n“We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on state’s increasing minimum wages and general average hourly rate increases. We have budgeted higher freight costs and diesel costs than a year ago,” Chief Financial Officer Kevin Wampler said on a post-earnings call.\nFor the full-year, Dollar Tree expects a profit of $5.25 to $5.60 per share, much lower than the average analysts’ estimate of $5.90 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe Chesapeake, Virginia-based company also reported same-store sales for the key holiday season that missed estimates, as shoppers did not spend as much as expected at its stores.\nAnalysts had expected sales to get a boost from the pay rises and one-off bonus payments that many companies have given to blue collar workers — Dollar Tree’s core customers — as a result of windfalls from changes to U.S. corporate tax rates.\nThe company’s results come a week after biggest rival Walmart Inc ( WMT.N ) reported a sharp drop in profit and online sales growth during the holiday period.\nNet income more than tripled to $1.04 billion, or $4.37 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, mainly due to a $583.7 million benefit from changes in the U.S. tax code.\nExcluding items, Dollar Tree earned $1.89 per share, while net sales rose 13 percent to $6.36 billion, both missing estimates.\nReporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Shounak Dasgupta\n ",
