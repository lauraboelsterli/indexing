    "text": "TOKYO, March 6 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose on Tuesday to snap a four-day losing run after Wall Street shares rallied overnight, with the dollar’s bounce lifting exporter shares.\nThe Nikkei ended the day up 1.79 percent at 21,417.76.\nThe index’s four-day run of losses reflected a slump in global risk sentiment after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminium last week.\nEquity markets rebounded, however, as fears of a global trade war ebbed somewhat as expectations rose that Trump would back down from imposing the tariffs.\nJapan’s big car exporters were supported by the dollar’s rebound versus the yen.\nHonda Motor Co rose 1.6 percent, Toyota Motor Corp gained 1 percent and Suzuki Motor Corp climbed 2.4 percent.\nPanasonic Corp gained 1.1 percent and Tokyo Electron added 2.85 percent.\nSteel shares also rose, with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal advancing 1 percent and JFE Holdings gaining 1.16 percent.\nThe largest percentage gainer in the Nikkei index was Japan Steel Works Ltd, which rose 9.05 percent.\nThere were 201 advancers on the index against 19 decliners.\nThe broader Topix was 1.27 percent higher at 1,716.30.\nThe dollar was at 106.205 yen, having recovered from a 15-month low of 105.240 plumbed on Friday.
