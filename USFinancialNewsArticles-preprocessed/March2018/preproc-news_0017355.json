    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey’s military and its rebel allies have besieged the northern Syrian town of Afrin and were nearing its town centre, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, in what would mark a major advance in Turkey’s military operation.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan addresses members of parliament from his ruling AK Party (AKP) during a meeting at the Turkish parliament in Ankara, Turkey, March 6, 2018. REUTERS/Umit Bektas Turkey launched its operation, dubbed “Olive Branch”, in northern Syria nearly seven weeks ago to sweep the Syrian Kurdish YPG from the Turkish border. Turkey sees the YPG as a terrorist group and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).\nOn Thursday, Turkish forces and their Free Syrian Army (FSA) allies seized control of the nearby town of Jinderes, state media reported. Turkey now controls five out of seven of the settlements in the northwest Afrin region, state media said.\n“Now the centre of Afrin is surrounded and our entry is imminent,” Erdogan said in televised speech in Ankara.\n“We are removing the last remaining obstacles standing before our besieging of Afrin city centre,” he said, adding there was still about six kilometres (3.7 miles) to go to reach Afrin from the outskirts of Jinderes.\nThe armed forces will push on after operations in Afrin and Manbij, further east, to sweep Syrian Kurdish fighters from the length of Turkey’ border with Syria, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday.\n“We are in Afrin today, we will be in Manbij tomorrow. The next day we will ensure that the east of Euphrates will be cleared of terrorist up to the Iraqi border.”\nErdogan’s repeated threats to push on to Manbij have caused complications with NATO ally the United States, which has its troops deployed in the area.\nTurkey has been infuriated by U.S. support for the YPG. Washington has backed the group in the fight against Islamic State.\nThe PKK, which has carried out a three-decade insurgency in Turkey’s mainly Kurdish southeast, is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, Turkey and the European Union.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu, Ece Toksabay and Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
