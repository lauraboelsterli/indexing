    "text": "Wall Street's eyes will be fixated on the Federal Reserve as Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivers his first news conference Wednesdy afternoon.\nWhile an interest rate hike is all but certain, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool , market participants will be focusing on other facets of the central bank's decision.\nStrategist Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management told CNBC's \" Trading Nation \" he will be watching for two main themes. Here's what to lookout for:\n• The FOMC meeting is the marquee market event this week, and it is widely expected that the committee will hike interest rates. The market will be watching the \"dot plot\" and Powell's tone in his remarks.\n• The Federal Reserve's dot plot is a measure put out by the Fed reflecting committee members' outlooks on what they consider appropriate monetary policy based upon the federal funds rate. This will be closely watched for any forward guidance for rate hikes over the next several years.\n• As for Powell's tone, the more upbeat he sounds about the state of the economy, the more of a threat this may serve equities.\n• Equity traders may take a hawkish tone as a signal of further rate hikes this year, potentially threatening stocks.\nBottom line: Since an interest rate hike is already widely expected, the market will be focusing on Powell's tone, as well as the dot plot, on Wednesday.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
