    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 2:10 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Rugby-Australia sevens captain Stannard hospitalised after 'one-punch' attack   \nSYDNEY, March 30 (Reuters) - Australia’s rugby sevens captain James Stannard has been hospitalised after being involved in a ‘one-punch’ attack in Sydney early on Friday. \nNew South Wales Police said in a statement that a 22-year-old man had been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm after a 35-year-old man had been punched in an alleged “unprovoked” attack. \n“The victim was taken to St Vincents Hospital where he is understood to be in a stable condition with head injuries,” the police added in their statement. \nRugby Australia (RA) later identified Stannard as the victim of the attack. \n“Rugby Australia is aware of an incident which has resulted in the hospitalisation of Australian men’s sevens player James Stannard in Sydney overnight,” RA said. \n“Rugby Australia is working with NSW Police to investigate the matter and will provide a further update later today.” \nStannard replaced the injured Lewis Holland as captain for the Commonwealth Games tournament on the Gold Coast. \nThe men’s tournament will be held on the final two days of the April 4-15 Games, with Australia drawn in Pool B with Samoa, Jamaica and England.
