GAAP operating income was $0.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 30, 2017 as compared to $3.8 million for the comparable prior year period. GAAP net income was $2.0 million, or net earnings $0.17 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.8 million, or a net earnings of $0.14 per diluted share, for the comparable prior year period.\nThe Company had adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter and for the full year fiscal 2017 of $2.5 million and $8.0 million, respectively. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to EBITDA (non-GAAP) and net income (GAAP) can be found on the fourth page of this press release.\nThe Company experienced $1.4 million in legal, office closures and other charges for the fifty-two week period ended December 30, 2017. These charges included costs relating to the closure of the Company’s Purchase, NY engineering and Edina, MN Information Technology offices, totaling approximately $0.8 million; severance to a senior executive of $0.3 million; legal fees of $0.2 million associated with the acquisition of an approximately 30 person engineering firm in Serbia; and other legal related and miscellaneous charges of approximately $0.1 million. The Company also experienced the following charges for the fifty-two week period ended December 30, 2017: $3.5 million in goodwill impairment charges associated with the Information Technology segment, $0.8 million for an increase to estimated contingent payments associated with prior year acquisitions in the Engineering segment, and $0.3 million for tax credit professional fees.\nRocco Campanelli, President and Chief Executive Officer of RCM Technologies, commented, “We are very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter of 2017 as revenue, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA grew by 15.5%, 5.8% and 24.4%, respectively, as compared to fourth quarter 2016. Our Specialty Health Care segment again set quarterly records for both revenues and gross profit, growing by 35.5% and 26.4%, respectively, over fourth quarter 2016, primarily from further growth in our school contracts. Our fourth quarter Engineering segment revenues grew by 12.8% as compared to fourth quarter 2016. Additionally, we made a small acquisition of an engineering firm in Belgrade, Serbia that we believe has significant potential for growth and diversification expansion for both our Engineering and IT segments. We look forward to carrying our fourth quarter momentum into fiscal 2018.”\nKevin Miller, Chief Financial Officer of RCM Technologies, added, “Further augmenting our focus on strong free cash flow generation, as a result of certain tax charges in fiscal 2017, we anticipate paying minimal federal income tax in 2018 and 2019. We continue to see improvement to our balance sheet with our lowest day’s sales outstanding in our trade accounts receivables in many years. Our strong balance sheet and fourth quarter increase in adjusted EBITDA allowed us to issue a special dividend of $1.00 per share in the fourth quarter. Since fiscal 2012, we have returned close to $80 million to our shareholders through special dividends and stock repurchases. We are proud of our record of being good stewards of capital for our shareholders.”\nConference Call\nOn Wednesday, March 7, 2018, RCM Technologies will host a conference call to discuss these results. The call will begin at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The dial-in number is (800) 285-6670.\nAbout RCM\nRCM Technologies, Inc. is a premier provider of business and technology solutions designed to enhance and maximize the operational performance of its customers through the adaptation and deployment of advanced information technology and engineering services.

Our management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful information for investors, shareholders and other stakeholders of our company in gauging our results of operations on an ongoing basis. We believe that EBITDA is a performance measure and not a liquidity measure, and therefore have provided a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of performance. In addition, Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA takes into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following unaudited table presents the Company's GAAP Net Income measure and the corresponding adjustments used to calculate “EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA”, Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen weeks and fifty-two weeks ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nThirteen Week Periods Ended Fifty-Two Week Periods Ended December 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 GAAP net income (loss) $251 ($216 ) $2,010 $1,758 Income tax (benefit) expense (3,606 ) 160 (2,255 ) 1,544 Interest expense 181 117 590 539 Depreciation and amortization 528 392 1,757 1,569 EBITDA (non-GAAP) ($2,646 ) $453 $2,102 $5,410 Adjustments Legal, office closures and other charges 1,447 1,283 1,447 1,283 Tax credit professional fees 259 - 259 - Change in contingent consideration - 285 781 285 Goodwill impairment 3,478 - 3,478 - Gain on foreign currency transactions (27 ) (2 ) (65 ) (11 ) Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $2,511 $2,019 $8,002 $6,967\nRCM Technologies, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(Unaudited)\n(In Thousands)\nThirteen Week Periods Ended December 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Net income (loss) $251 ($216 ) Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to cash\nprovided by (used in) operating activities 1,634 1,859 Changes in operating assets and liabilities Accounts receivable (4,141 ) (3,173 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets (523 ) (619 ) Net of transit accounts receivable and payable 359 102 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 995 1,456 Accrued payroll and related costs 668 861 Income taxes payable (1,128 ) (763 ) Total adjustments (2,136 ) (277 ) Cash used in operating activities ($1,885 ) ($493 ) Net cash used in investing activities (1,060 ) (102 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 4,795 541 Effect of exchange rate changes 176 30 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $2,026 ($24 )\nFifty-Two Week Periods Ended December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net income $2,010 $1,758 Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash\nprovided by (used in) operating activities 4,660 3,834 Changes in operating assets and liabilities Accounts receivable (459 ) 5,427 Prepaid expenses and other current assets (293 ) 1,228 Net of transit accounts receivable and payable (830 ) 966 Accounts payable and accrued expenses (318 ) (290 ) Accrued payroll and related costs 483 (1,473 ) Income taxes payable (182 ) 185 Total adjustments 3,061 9,877 Cash provided by operating activities $5,071 $11,635 Net cash used in investing activities (1,803 ) (831 ) Net cash used in financing activities (826 ) (11,556 ) Effect of exchange rate changes 130 46 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $2,572 ($706 )\nRCM Technologies, Inc.\nSummary of Selected Income Statement Data\n(Unaudited)\n(In Thousands)\nThirteen Week Period Ended December 30, 2017 Engineering Specialty\nHealth Care Information\nTechnology\nConsolidated Revenue $21,236 $22,104 $7,717 $51,057 Cost of services 15,745 16,750 5,758 38,253 Gross Profit $5,491 $5,354 $1,959 $12,804 Gross Profit Margin 25.9 % 24.2 % 25.4 % 25.1 %\nThirteen Week Period Ended December 31, 2016 Engineering Specialty\nHealth Care Information\nTechnology\nConsolidated Revenue $18,834 $16,318 $9,046 $44,198 Cost of services 13,323 12,082 6,687 32,092 Gross Profit $5,511 $4,236 $2,359 $12,106 Gross Profit Margin 29.3 % 26.0 % 26.1 % 27.4 %\nFifty-Two Week Period Ended December 30, 2017 Engineering Specialty\nHealth Care Information\nTechnology\nConsolidated Revenue $82,753 $71,316 $32,668 $186,737 Cost of services 60,352 53,801 24,197 138,350 Gross Profit $22,401 $17,515 $8,471 $48,387 Gross Profit Margin 27.1 % 24.6 % 25.9 % 25.9 %\nFifty-Two Week Period Ended December 31, 2016 Engineering Specialty\nHealth Care Information\nTechnology\nConsolidated Revenue $73,853 $59,783 $42,812 $176,448 Cost of services 54,182 44,091 31,145 129,418 Gross Profit $19,671 $15,692 $11,667 $47,030 Gross Profit Margin 26.6 % 26.2 % 27.3 % 26.7 % RCM Technologies, Inc.\n2500 McClellan Avenue\nPennsauken, NJ 08109\nTel: 856.356.4500\nFax: 856.356.4600\ninfo@rcmt.com\nwww.rcmt.com\nCorporate Contacts:\nRocco Campanelli\nPresident & CEO\nKevin D.
