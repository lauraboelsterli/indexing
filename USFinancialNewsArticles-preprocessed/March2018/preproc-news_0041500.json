    "text": "The owners of Manchester City are on the lookout for more soccer clubs to buy.\nCity Football Group currently owns Manchester City, New York City and Melbourne City soccer clubs. It also operates more than 20 teams across those cities.\nThe organization is 87 percent owned by Abu Dhabi United Group, with the remaining minority stake provided by China Media Capital consortium.\nTom Glick, chief commercial officer of City Football Group, told CNBC on Thursday that his firm wants more clubs to add to its stable.\n\"I think it is very likely we will do some more. We are looking at a number of places across the globe,\" he said.\nShaun Botterill | Getty Images Glick said China is a particular target for his firm because of its strengthening professional league, healthy TV audiences, and obvious government support.\n\"It is quite prescriptive from the perspective of boys and girls learning to play the game at the recreational level,\" he said.\n\"Adults learning to coach at a high level, building facilities, converting schools and all of this laddering-up to national team performance.\"\nThe sales strategist added that other countries including Korea, Japan, and India were all places where soccer was set for healthy growth.",
