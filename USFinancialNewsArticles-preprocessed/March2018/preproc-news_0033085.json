The company posted its second consecutive quarter of sequential revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and exceeded guidance for bookings and adjusted free cash flow while meeting guidance on all other metrics.\nHighlights of Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nBookings excluding Greater China were $140.8 million and Constant Currency Bookings were $145.9 million, both above guidance. GAAP Revenue was $107.3 million, in line with guidance. GAAP Gross Margin was 54.5%. Non-GAAP Gross Margin was 56.0%. GAAP Operating Expenses were $53.7 million. Non-GAAP Operating Expenses were $48.2 million, in line with guidance. GAAP Net Loss was $881,000. Adjusted EBITDA was $15.0 million, in line with guidance. GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $2.8 million. Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $4.8 million, above guidance. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted Free Cash Flow. For the full year 2017, Adjusted Free Cash Flow was up $59 million compared to 2016.\n2017 Highlights\nGrew total revenue backlog to $536.1 million as of the end of 2017, up 25% from $429.3 million the year prior. Completed multi-year business transformation. Launched strategic alliance with Microsoft to develop and market cloud-based solutions and services for the media and entertainment industry. Generated positive free cash flow.\nAvid Progressing on Strategic Growth Objectives\nEnterprise: During the fourth quarter, Avid signed several large multi-year commercial agreements. As of December 31, 2017, total licenses for the MediaCentral platform were approximately 53,700, up 26% year-over-year. Individual: Digital sales, primarily targeted at individual creative professionals, were up 24% year-over-year. Cloud-enabled software subscriptions are now over 93,500, up 54% year-over-year.\n“Our strategy is yielding improved financial results as customers are embracing our products and solutions,” said Jeff Rosica, Chief Executive Officer and President of Avid. “Looking ahead, I’m excited about the opportunity before us and our plan to continue to improve business performance, while further leveraging the unique position we’ve established, including our ability to lead customers and the industry into the cloud.”\n“We are pleased with our financial performance this year having met key objectives for 2017, including meeting or exceeding guidance on all metrics each quarter and delivering a substantial improvement in free cash flow generation,” said Brian E. Agle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Avid. “In the second half of 2017, our results showed improvement as we delivered two consecutive quarters of revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding the impact of pre-2011 amortization and elimination of implied PCS revenue. We look forward to building on this momentum in 2018, as we remain focused on growing revenue, managing expenses and further increasing free cash flow.”\nFirst Quarter and Full Year 2018 Guidance\nAvid’s first quarter and full year 2018 financial guidance is provided in the table below. This guidance reflects the expected estimated impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018. In 2018, the Company will be refining its guidance practices to focus only on Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Annual Free Cash Flow guidance will replace the Adjusted Free Cash Flow guidance previously provided quarterly.\nGuidance under ASC 606 (in $ millions) 2018 Q1 2018 Revenue $404 - $434 $95 - $105 Adjusted EBITDA $39 - $51 $3 - $9 Free Cash Flow (Annual) $2 - $14 The adoption of ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018 is estimated to unfavorably impact revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by $11 million and $2 million in 2018 and Q1 2018, respectively. A reconciliation of guidance under the ASC 606 and ASC 605 standards is provided for comparison purposes in the supplemental tables included in this press release.\nAll guidance presented by the Company is inherently uncertain and subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Avid’s actual future results of operations and cash flows could those shown in the table above. For a discussion of some of the key assumptions underlying the guidance, as well as the key risks and uncertainties associated with these forward-looking statements, please see “Forward Looking Statements” below as well as the Avid Technology Q4 2017 Business Update presentation posted on Avid’s Investor Relations website.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAvid includes non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, non-GAAP Operating Income (loss), non-GAAP Operating Expenses, non-GAAP Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Free Cash Flow conversion of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company also includes the operational metrics of bookings, revenue backlog and recurring revenue bookings in this release. Avid believes the non-GAAP financial measures and operational metrics provided in this release provide helpful information to investors with respect to evaluating the Company’s performance. Unless noted, all financial information is reported based on actual exchange rates. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in our Form 8-K filed today. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures in this release to the Company's comparable GAAP financial measures for the periods presented are set forth below and are also included in the supplemental financial and operational data sheet available on our investor relations webpage at ir.avid.com , which also includes definitions of the operational metrics.\nThe earnings release also includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow. Reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not included in the earnings release due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the excluded information, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible at this time. As a result, the Company is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts.\nConference Call\nAvid will host a conference call to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 on Thursday, March 15, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. ET.
