    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 10:18 AM / Updated 4 minutes ago Exxon leads oil majors in bids for Brazil's offshore reserves Marta Nogueira , Alexandra Alper 4 Min Read \nRIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp roared into Brazil’s prolific offshore oil fields again on Thursday, clinching eight blocks in partnership with other oil firms eager to lap up the country’s choice reserves ahead of presidential elections later this year. Logos of ExxonMobil are seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan April 4, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nExxon along with Petrobras and Qatar Petroleum Intl shelled out 2.8 billion reais ($844 million) for a block in Brazil’s offshore Campos basin as the American oil major seeks to replace dwindling reserves. \nChevron Corp, Repsol SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Statoil ASA also spent top dollar to lock down stakes in Brazilian offshore blocks, some of which may be part of the coveted pre-salt play, where oil is trapped under layers of salt beneath the ocean floor. \n“We are more confident in investment in Brazil, without a doubt,” said Carla Lacerda, Exxon’s top executive in Brazil, after the round. “We have lots of opportunities ahead. We are analyzing each round. We want a robust portfolio here.” \nExxon, which will operate six of eight blocks it won Thursday, took 10 blocks in a September round last year and a pre-salt block the following month. Decio Oddone, chief of Brazil's oil regulator ANP, and Brazil's state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA CEO Pedro Parente (L) attend a signature ceremony with oil companies that won the 14th auction for exploitation of oil and gas in Brazilian fields, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil January 29, 2018. REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes \nBefore that, it was among the few oil majors without a presence in the exploration of the vast offshore fields discovered off the Brazilian coast over the past decade. \nHigher oil prices and the need to replace shrinking reserves have boosted appetite among oil majors for costlier, higher-yield offshore ventures, though some projects are still seen as too pricey to be viable. \nThe offshore segment of the concession-style auction was a major success for Brazil’s cash-strapped government, which raked in more than 8 billion reais by placing a total of 22 blocks, compared with its forecast of 4.6 billion reais. It was unable to place any on-shore blocks.
