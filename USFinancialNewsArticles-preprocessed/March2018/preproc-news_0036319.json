Net loss attributable to Jefferies was $60.8 million for the first quarter ended Feb. 28, compared with a profit of $114.0 million a year ago. Net revenue for the quarter rose 3.2 percent to $821.2 million from last year. New York-based Jefferies, a unit of Leucadia National Corp , traditionally kicks off the earnings reporting season for investment banks. Its results are viewed as an indicator of big Wall Street banksâ€™ performance. (Reporting by Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",
