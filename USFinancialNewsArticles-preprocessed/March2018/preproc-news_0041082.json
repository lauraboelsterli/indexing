It’s a multibillion-dollar question facing ocean carriers, and there may be no good answer. The ship operators are bracing for new caps on sulfur emissions that go into effect in less than two years , the WSJ’s Costas Paris reports, and they’re considering whether to retrofit vessels with “scrubbers” which can cost up to $10 million or depend on cleaner fuels that are some 55% more expensive than current bunker charges. Maritime executives say the sulfur restrictions will cost the industry some $40 billion, which will likely be passed along to shipping customers through higher freight prices. With some doubting enough low-sulfur fuel will be available, many operators are turning to sulfur-trapping exhaust scrubbers. But even those may not be enough to meet stricter pollution caps expected in the future.\nThere may be caution flags in the trucking industry’s push toward consolidation. Heartland Express Inc. recently dismissed its auditor KPMG LLP after differences around the truckload carrier’s acquisition of a smaller operator, WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes, highlighting questions over the value that truckers place on the equipment and the businesses they acquire. Analysts say issues involving fleet valuation are growing more important as merger-and-acquisition activity heats up in the trucking market. Many fleet owners have reaped big gains from the new U.S. tax law, giving them cash to buy up other operators and bring in the trucks and drivers they need to take advantage of robust freight demand. Heartland’s acquisition has driven up the company’s operating expenses and tamped down margins. But the company also gained scale in the transaction, and that may be especially valuable in a market where demand is high and prices are rising.\nMore investment capital is heading into the trucking technology. A $50 million cash infusion into San Francisco-based KeepTruckin Inc. is part of the growing rush by venture funds into businesses aimed at streamlining connections between trucking companies, drivers and shipping customers. WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes the company is building out services around driver apps and electronic logging devices, and the money will back new products like a marketplace linking drivers to available cargo loads . That’s an offshoot of the information that comes with ELDs, in what experts say is an example of the greater efficiency and operating revenue that can come with new technology. Companies including Konexial and Convoy are offering similar benefits, and drawing their own investor interest in a trucking market that one KeepTruckin backer says has been “underserved by technology.”\nTRANSPORTATION\nPhoto: Getty Images Coal is still giving off heat in the mining world. Swiss mining and trading giant Glencore PLC added to its growing portfolio of coal assets with a $1.7 billion investment in a pair of Australian producers. The WSJ’s Scott Patterson writes that some big integrated mining giants such as Rio Tinto PLC have been backing away from coal, but Glencore is betting that demand will remain strong as some countries continue to rely on it for power plants . The backlash against coal among some mining companies is driven in part by concerns over its role as a fuel blamed for contributing to climate change. But its continued strength as a power source in Asia, India and other markets is helping to keep the stuff moving. The U.S. Energy Information Administration says U.S. coal exports soared 61% last year, and the Association of American Railroads estimates that may have contributed some 240,000 carloads to American freight rail networks.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ It’s like installing small refineries in approximately 60,000 vessels, and it’s not a very sensible way of doing things. ’\n—Soren Toft, chief operating officer at Maersk Line, on ship-exhaust scrubbers.\nNumber of the Day 2.6% Decline from January to February in the American Trucking Associations’ freight tonnage index.\nIN OTHER NEWS A man believed to have carried out package bombings in Texas and sent two devices through the FedEx Corp. system died in a confrontation with police .
