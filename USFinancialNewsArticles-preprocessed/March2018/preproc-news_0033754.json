    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 10:11 AM / Updated 34 minutes ago Kremlin to UK on spy attack allegations: Show evidence or apologise Reuters Staff 1 Min Read MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that London would either have to back up its assertions that Russia was behind the poisoning of a former spy and his daughter in Britain with evidence or apologise “sooner or later.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov speaks during a news briefing on the sidelines of the Russia-ASEAN summit in Sochi, Russia, May 19, 2016. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin Britain has accused Russia of being responsible for the use of a Soviet-era nerve agent called Novichok which was used to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters that Britain’s allegations were “difficult to explain... groundless and slanderous”. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday it was nonsense to think that Moscow was responsible for the attack. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Monday that Russia’s denials were “increasingly absurd.” Reporting and writing by Denis Pinchuk; Editing by Andrew Osborn",
