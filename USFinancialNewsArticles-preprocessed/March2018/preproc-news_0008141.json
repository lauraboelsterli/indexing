    "text": "makes lushly layered paintings by culling historical images she finds online—Egyptian masks, \nCaravaggio \npaintings, plants—and then composing her own mashups using Photoshop. Rather than clicking print, Ms. Imazu painstakingly oil paints canvases to match, a which-is-which strategy that Mr. Ritter calls “phenomenal.” Her gallery, Yamamoto Gendai, said her paintings, including 2017’s “Yellow Room with Playful Hearts,” will be offered for around $30,000. \nShahpour Pouyan, \nan Iranian artist who splits his time between Tehran and New York, plans to show a wooden machine he’s built that contains elements of a trebuchet and a guillotine, inventions that were once hailed for killing people more efficiently. Mr. Pouyan’s “Incarnation of the Body Politic” lacks the ropes and pulleys needed to function as a true murder weapon, but that’s also his point. \nThe artist is known for rethinking objects and artworks that evoke darker aspects of humanity, in part so he can reclaim a measure of power over the memories they left behind. \nAfter seeing a Persian miniature portrait of the 16th-century Shaybanid ruler \nMuhammad Khan \nat the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Mr. Pouyan painted his own intricate version of the miniature—but without the ruthless ruler, leaving behind only the leader’s tiny gold inkpot and books to float amid a brightly colored background. \nMr. Pouyan’s Dubai gallery, Lawrie Shabibi, will bring some of the artist’s recently reconfigured Persian miniatures, which typically sell for between $8,000 and $11,000, along with his killing machine, which will be offered for $70,000. \nOne of more politically potent artists using technology in the fair is \nTabita Rezaire, \naccording to Mr. Ritter. The French-Guyanese artist, based in Johannesburg, has recast herself as a “digital shaman,” making videos and immersive environments that aim to address—and heal—historic wounds inflicted on black women in Africa and elsewhere. \nHer 2016 installation “Sugar Walls Teardom” revolves around a pink gynecological chair, a nod to the medical experiments once performed on unanesthetized slave women in the U.S. before the Civil War and, a century later, the unsanctioned reproduction of a black Baltimore woman’s cervical cancer cells for medical research. Visitors who step close to the chair’s stirrups will be able to watch a 21-minute video positioned on a monitor nearby in which Ms. Rezaire calls for the soothing of wombs. Goodman Gallery said the piece will be offered for sale for around $25,500. \nAmong the 198 galleries at the fair, watch for other artists toying with technologies, old and new. Gagosian Gallery plans to debut a never-exhibited 2005 assemblage by video-art pioneer \nNam June Paik \nthat features a hand-painted sculpture of a “Lion” standing beneath a wooden arch—a temple-like shrine the artist rimmed with 28 television screens broadcasting footage of animals and flowers. Asking price: $1.5 million. \nWrite to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com",
