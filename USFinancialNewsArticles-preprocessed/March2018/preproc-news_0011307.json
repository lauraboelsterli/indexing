    "text": "HOUSTON, March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX) (“Quanex” or the “Company”) today announced its results for the three months ended January 31, 2018.\nBill Griffiths, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “First quarter results tracked the typical seasonality of our businesses; however, raw material price and labor inflation pressured margins across the board. We expect to recover some of the increase in raw materials prices in the coming months via contractual pass through or targeted price increases and we will work hard to cover the balance with operational efficiency improvements. Excluding eliminated products, our legacy fenestration business in the U.S. grew at 4.4% during the quarter, which compares favorably to Ducker’s latest window shipment estimate of 4.2% growth for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Similarly, underlying growth in our European Engineered Components segment was 5.4%. We generated positive free cash flow during the first quarter of 2018, which allowed us to pay down bank debt during the quarter of the year where we have historically had to borrow. Despite the recent gyrations in the stock market, the fundamentals for our business remain positive, and as such we are comfortable reaffirming our full year 2018 guidance and expect a strong second half of the year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results Summary\nThe Company reported the following selected financial results:\nThree Months Ended January 31, 2018 2017 Net Sales $ 191.7 $ 195.1 Net Income (Loss) $ 4.9 $ (3.7 ) Diluted EPS $ 0.14 $ (0.11 ) Adjusted Net Loss $ (1.5 ) $ (1.4 ) Adjusted Diluted EPS $ (0.04 ) $ (0.04 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 13.2 $ 13.0 (See Non-GAAP Terminology Definitions and Disclaimers section, Non-GAAP Financial Measure Disclosure table and Selected Segment Data table for additional information)\nThe slight decrease in net sales during the first quarter of 2018 was largely the result of portfolio rationalization and divestitures that occurred throughout 2017. The loss of revenues in the first quarter of 2018 associated with the aforementioned actions that took place in 2017 was somewhat offset by solid underlying growth in the North American and European Engineered Components segments. (See Sales Analysis table for additional information)\nThe increase in earnings was predominantly attributable to lower stock-based compensation expense and a $6.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, net tax benefit as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21% and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. The lower tax rate will be phased in over time since Quanex has an October 31 fiscal year-end. Including the net tax benefit realized in the first quarter of 2018, the Company estimates that its effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be approximately 9%, or approximately 24% excluding the net tax benefit. Quanex will continue to evaluate the impact of the tax reform through the remainder of fiscal 2018 .\nAs of January 31, 2018, the Company’s leverage ratio of Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA was unchanged at 2.3x. Quanex remains focused on generating Free Cash Flow to pay down debt and expects to end fiscal 2018 with a leverage ratio below 2.0x. (See Non-GAAP Terminology Definitions and Disclaimers section for additional information)\nRecent Events\nThe stockholders approved each of the following proposals voted on at the Company’s annual meeting held on March 1, 2018.\nElection of Directors – Robert R. Buck, Susan F. Davis, Joseph D. Rupp and Curtis M. Stevens were elected to serve as directors on the Quanex Board of Directors until the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2019 Advisory Vote Approving Named Executive Officer Compensation - the stockholders supported Quanex’s executive officer compensation structure Ratification of Appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as Independent Public Accountants – the stockholders ratified the Company’s appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as its independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2018\nAdditionally, Quanex’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share on the Company’s common stock, payable March 29, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call for Tuesday, March 6, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. ET (10:00 a.m. CT).

EBITDA (defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other, net) and Adjusted EBITDA (defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting inventory step-ups, transaction costs, gain/loss on the sale of fixed assets, and restructuring charges) are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company uses to measure operational performance and assist with financial decision-making. Net Debt is calculated using the sum of current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt, minus cash and cash equivalents. The leverage ratio of Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that Quanex believes is useful to investors and financial analysts in evaluating the Company’s leverage. In addition, with certain limited adjustments, this leverage ratio is the basis for a key covenant in Quanex’s credit agreement. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure calculated using cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company believes that the presented non-GAAP measures provide a consistent basis for comparison between periods, and will assist investors in understanding Quanex’s financial performance when comparing results to other investment opportunities. The presented non-GAAP measures may not be the same as those used by other companies. The Company does not intend for this information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nForward Looking Statements\nStatements that use the words “estimated,” “expect,” “could,” “should,” “believe,” “will,” “might,” or similar words reflecting future expectations or beliefs are forward-looking statements.
