Dowe III, Chairman.\nWilliam T. \"Tim\" Crosby, Major General (R) has become Chairman of UAVT's SAB.\nMG Crosby spent over 35 years in the Army in a variety of leadership roles. His last assignment in the Army was as the Program Executive Officer for Aviation in which he was responsible for all of the Army's aviation programs (both manned and unmanned). Prior to that, MG Crosby was the Program Manager for the Army's Cargo Helicopter (CH47) Program. Retiring in 2014, he founded Crosby Aerospace, LLC, which provides advisory services to companies in the aviation industry. He is also a member of the board of Columbia Helicopters.\nEdward M.

He became Advisory Council member for the Army's LOGCAP III and Future Combat Systems, and worked in the Defense Contract Management Agency. After retirement, he returned to government service as the Army's senior official managing procurement, spending $150 billion/year. He currently consults with ClientView Consulting, Framingham, MA.\nJames \"Russ\" Spray has a long and varied executive experience in aviation operations and management, executive administration, and contract negotiation.

Previously, as Chairman and CEO of Rocky Mountain Holdings, L.L.C., he reorganized and grew the company from $3 million in revenue with 7 aircraft to over $100 million per year with 90 aircraft. He served for five years as the founding Chairman of the Helicopter Association International's EMS Committee, was chairman and co-founder of the National EMS Operator's Forum, a founding member of the Board for the National Air Medical Foundation and sustaining member of the American Helicopter Society. Among numerous career awards and recognitions, Russ has recently received the Helicopter Association International's 2018 Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to the helicopter industry and was inducted into the Honorable Order of St. Michael for his specific contributions to US Army Aviation.\nRusty Weiger served the government more than 30 years, the last 7 with PEO Aviation as the Deputy Program Executive Officer.
