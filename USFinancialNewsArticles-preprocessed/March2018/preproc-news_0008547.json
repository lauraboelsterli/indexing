A group of women pose for a photo in front of a poster advertising the film \"Black Panther\" on its opening night of screenings at the AMC Magic Johnson Harlem 9 cinemas in Manhattan, New York, U.S., February 15, 2018. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly “Black Panther,” starring Chadwick Boseman as the king of a fictional African nation, now has a worldwide total of $897.7 million through Sunday.

In less than three weeks,“Black Panther” has become 47th highest grosser worldwide and the 10th highest domestic grosser of all time with $501.1 million. The blockbuster has grossed $12.9 million in Russia after going wide on Feb. 26, surpassing the entire runs for“Ant-Man,”“Captain America: Winter Soldier,”“Justice League” and“Wonder Woman.” In Japan,“Black Panther” opened as the top western release, earning $4.2 million.
