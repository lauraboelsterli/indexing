    "text": "BANGKOK, March 28 (Reuters) - State-owned Airports of Thailand Pcl (AOT) said on Wednesday that it plans to hold an auction for its duty concession this year and is considering single and multiple concessions.\n“We are considering four types of concessions,” AOT President Nitinai Sirismatthakarn said in a statement.\nThe types of concession include a master concession and multiple concessions based on product categories and locations.\nThe auction winner must be determined two years before the current concession expires in September 2020, Nitinai said.\nThe expansion of Suvarnabhmi airport will increase commercial and duty free space up for auction by around 70 percent. The new terminal is scheduled to open for service in September 2020.\nAOT, a beneficiary of the Thai tourism boom, has seen its shares surge 68 percent in the past year on expectations of higher revenue sharing in the new concession and expansion, analysts said.\nIts concession revenue in the three-month period to December 31, 2017, was 3.9 billion baht ($124.80 million), up 19 percent from a year ago.\nThe Thai government holds a 70 percent stake in AOT.\n$1 = 31.2500 baht Reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
