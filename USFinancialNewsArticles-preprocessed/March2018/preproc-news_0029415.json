    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE: WSM) announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a 10% increase in the company’s quarterly cash dividend to $0.43 per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on May 25, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 27, 2018. Additionally, the Board of Directors increased the amount available for repurchases under its existing stock repurchase program to $500 million.\nLaura Alber, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We value the continued support that our shareholders have shown to our company. Thanks to the hard work of our associates, we have consistently delivered profitable growth and strong cash flow. And once again, we are able to increase our quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program to further enhance returns to our shareholders.”\nThe increase to the stock repurchase program is effective as of March 14, 2018. As of January 28, 2018, there was approximately $214 million remaining for future repurchases under the company’s stock repurchase authorization. The company’s stock repurchase program authorizes the purchase of the company’s common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions, including through an accelerated repurchase program, at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability and other market conditions. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they do not fully materialize or are proven incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
