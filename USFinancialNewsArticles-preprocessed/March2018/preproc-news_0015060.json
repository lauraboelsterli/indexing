    "text": "March will roar in like a lion in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Friday and Saturday as a potent storm delivers a ferocious mix of howling winds, drenching rain, heavy snow and powerful waves.\nPower outages, coastal flooding, damaging wind gusts and flight delays are all likely as the nor'easter explodes off the New England coast.\nWinds are likely to be strong enough to lead to major airline delays from Chicago to Boston, and airlines are waiving change fees.\nHigh wind warnings and watches are already in effect all the way from northern Georgia to eastern Massachusetts.\nThe storm is expected to undergo explosive development known as bombogenesis, which is a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure of 24 millibars or more in a period of 24 hours or less, the Weather Channel said.\nRead more from USA Today:\nAirlines already waiving change fees for Friday nor'easter\nSouthwest Airlines raises drink prices starting today\nDick's pulled assault rifles after Sany Hook, too. It didn't last.\nThe storm will be the most powerful to hit the East since January's bomb cyclone, AccuWeather said.\nThe worst of the wind and coastal flooding will hit from eastern Massachusetts to southern Maine, AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Anderson said. Hurricane-force wind gusts of 75 mph are possible, the National Weather Service said.\nUp to two feet of heavy, wet snow will bury portions of New York and Pennsylvania. Strong winds are likely Friday afternoon and evening, with local whiteout conditions possible, the weather service said. Blizzard conditions are possible in portions of eastern Pennsylvania.\nThe Weather Channel named the system Winter Storm Riley.\nYet another storm could follow on its heels: \"Unfortunately, there is increasing potential for another major coastal storm by the middle of next week,\" the weather service said.\nThe West is also getting in on the wild weather action. A separate strong storm will bring snow and rain to the western U.S. later Thursday and into Friday.\nAuthorities warned motorists to stay off northern California mountain roads with the storm forecast to bring heavy snowfall, powerful winds and torrential rains at lower elevations Thursday, the Associated Press said.\n\"Totals will be measured in feet and mountain travel will become dangerous,\" the weather service tweeted. \"Travel is highly discouraged.\"\nOver six feet of snow is forecast in the highest elevations of the Sierra.\nIn southern California, a forecast of widespread showers raised concern about flash flooding later in the week in areas burned by wildfires, the AP said.",
