    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department accused Russia on Thursday of developing destabilizing nuclear weapons in violation of its treaty obligations after Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech unveiling a new array of nuclear weapons.\nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Putin’s speech showed Russia had violated its obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty. She also criticized an animated video played during his remarks, saying it appeared to depict an attack on the United States.\n“It was certainly unfortunate to have watched the video animation that depicted a nuclear attack on the United States,” Nauert told a news briefing.“We don’t regard that as the behavior of a responsible international player.”\nReporting by Arshad Mohammed; Writing by David Alexander; Editing by Eric Beech\n ",
