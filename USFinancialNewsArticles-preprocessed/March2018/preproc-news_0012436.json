A worker opens a truck at a distribution centre of German postal and logistics group Deutsche Post DHL in Obertshausen, Germany June 15, 2016. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski The group reported 2017 earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 3.74 billion euros (3.35 billion pounds), in line with its target of 3.75 billion, but slightly below the 3.789 expected in a Reuters poll. It said it expected EBIT of 4.15 billion euros for 2018 and forecast that would rise to over 5 billion euros in 2020.
