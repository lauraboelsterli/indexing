    "text": "College Game Plan It's now easier to qualify for the medical expense deduction A taxpayer with adjusted gross income of $50,000 would need a minimum of $3,750 in medical expenses to reach the temporary 7.5 percent threshold. That compares with $5,000 — $1,250 more — at a 10 percent floor, which will be in effect in 2019. About 8.8 million taxpayers used the deduction in 2015, saving themselves an aggregate $86.9 billion. Some qualifying expenses are more easily overlooked, including the cost of getting you and your dependents to doctor's appointments and the like. Published 2 Hours Ago CNBC.com \nIf you haven't checked whether your medical expenses could get you a tax break on your 2017 return, it might be worth the chore of digging through records and tallying up receipts. \nEven if this break hasn't been available to you in the past, a temporary expansion of the medical-expense deduction — coupled with ever-increasing health care costs — could translate into a writeoff. \n\"I'd say if you earn $150,000 or less, there's certainly a chance you could benefit from your medical expenses,\" said Bill Smith, managing director at CBIZ MHM's National Tax Office in Washington. \"And anyone with extraordinary expenses should check, too.\" yacobchu | Getty Images \nAs long as you itemize your deductions instead of taking the standard deduction, out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income — your earnings minus certain adjustments — could be deductible for both 2017 and 2018. In 2019, that floor will jump to 10 percent — where it previously was for most taxpayers. \nTo illustrate the difference this temporary drop can make: A taxpayer with adjusted gross income of $50,000 would need a minimum of $3,750 in medical expenses to reach the 7.5 percent threshold. That compares with $5,000 — $1,250 more — at a 10 percent floor. \nThe cost of health care has been on an upward trajectory for years. In 2016, the average amount spent on health care per person was $10,348, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That's up from $9,596 in 2012 and $7,700 in 2007. show chapters 10:07 AM ET Thu, 15 March 2018 | 01:01 \nWhile not all of the costs are necessarily borne by taxpayers — i.e., your employer might pay a share of your health insurance premiums — many out-of-pocket expenses count toward the deduction (more on that below). \nMost of the value of the tax break goes to middle-income taxpayers, based on the 2016 average per-person health care expenditure (see chart for illustration). \nIn 2015, about 8.8 million Americans used the tax break, saving themselves an aggregate $86.9 billion, according to the AARP Public Policy Institute. The research also shows that 49 percent of taxpayers who took the deduction had income below $50,000 and 69 percent earned less than $75,000.
