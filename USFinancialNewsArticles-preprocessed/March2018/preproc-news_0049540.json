    "text": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A number of oil exporting countries have suggested a six-month extension to the oil supply cut deal agreed by OPEC countries and non-OPEC crude producers, Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi speaks during news conference at the ministry of oil in Baghdad, Iraq November 27, 2017. REUTERS/Thaier Al-Sudani /File Photo OPEC and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed in November to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 as they try to finish clearing a global glut of crude while signaling a possible early exit from the deal if the market overheats.\nLuaibi did not say which countries have suggested a six- month extension of the agreement.\nReporting by Ahmed Rasheed; writing by Maher Chmaytelli, editing by Louise Heavens\n ",
