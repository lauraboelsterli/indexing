Pro forma basic and diluted net income per share reflects the changes in our share capital that occurred subsequent to our balance sheet date upon our initial public offering. Refer to the section \"Pro forma net income per share\" for further details.\n\"We are pleased to report strong full year 2017 results in our first reporting quarter as an NYSE-listed company,\" said Wang Huang, Chairman and CEO. \"Revenues grew by 31.6% in 2017 year-over-year and were driven by strong sales of Xiaomi wearable products and the launch of new products in our own Amazfit-branded product line. We sold over 1 million Amazfit products in 2017, which accounted for approximately 20% of our total revenue.\n\"Our investments in research and development bore fruit in 2017, and more importantly position us well for the future,\" Mr. Huang continued. \"As one example, our Amazfit Health Band was among the first commercially available ECG-enabled wearable products that was approved by the Chinese FDA, and allowed us to successfully enter the healthcare vertical. We continue to look for ways to further penetrate healthcare, public transportation, smart home and office, and mobile payment as part of our extensive product and service development.\n\"We are competitively well positioned and are excited about our prospects in 2018 as we further develop our Chinese presence and explore international market opportunities,\" Mr. Huang concluded. \"Our relationship with Xiaomi as its sole partner for smart wearables is strong, and we remain committed to developing cutting edge, affordable products under both the Xiaomi and Amazfit brands including the expected launch of the Mi Band 3 in 2018. In addition, we continue to identify ways to leverage relationships with millions of active users through the increased functionality of our products which serves to strengthen our brand in all markets we serve.\"\nDavid Cui, Chief Financial Officer, said, \"In addition to solid top-line results, we also reported robust growth in net income attributable to Huami Corporation for 2017, which reached RMB167.7 million, up 600.3% from 2016. Our gross margin for the year also showed healthy improvement climbing to 24.1% from 17.7% in 2016. Strong demand for the Mi Band 2 lengthened the product cycle, and benefits from supply chain efficiencies and economies of scale were the drivers for margin improvement. As we look to 2018 and expanding the products in our portfolio, we will do so with a keen eye on cost control and managing efficiencies.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues increased by 22.8% to RMB752.6 million (US$115.7 million) from RMB613.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to an increase in the sales of self-branded products.\nCost of revenues increased by 19.8% to RMB585.8 million (US$90.0 million) from RMB489.1million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Since its inception in 2013, Huami has quickly established its global market leadership and recognition by shipping millions of units of smart wearable devices. In the first nine months of 2017, Huami shipped 11.6 million units of smart wearable devices, more than any other company in the world. Huami has one of the largest biometric and activity databases in the global smart wearables industry. Huami's mobile apps work hand in hand with its smart wearable devices and provide users with a comprehensive view and analysis of their biometric and activity data. In addition to designing, manufacturing and selling smart bands and watches under its own Amazfit brand, Huami is the sole partner of Xiaomi, a leading mobile internet company and global consumer electronics brand, to design and manufacture Xiaomi-branded smart bands, watches (excluding children watches and quartz watches), scales and associated accessories.\nPro forma net income per share\nOur initial public offering and its accompanying restructuring of share capital were completed in Feburary 2018. We therefore separately present here the basic and diluted net income per share on a pro forma basis to reflect the changes in our share capital that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date, specifically including (i) the automatic conversion of all of our preferred shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017 into class B ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, (ii) the issuance of 12,064,825 class B ordinary shares to preferred shareholders immediately prior to our initial public offering, and (iii) the sale of 41,600,000 class A ordinary shares in the form of ADSs by us in our initial public offering\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nWe use adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. Adjusted net income represents net income excluding share-based compensation expenses, and such adjustment has no impacts on income tax.\nWe believe that adjusted net income helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that we include in net income. We believe that adjusted net income provides useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nAdjusted net income, should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net income, basic and diluted net income per share attributable to ordinary shareholders of Huami Corporation or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Adjusted net income, presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.
