His departure is seen strengthening the hands of those advocating a protectionist agenda.\nA steep 2.5 percent drop in oil prices following data that showed U.S. inventories had risen also weighed.\nAt 12:29 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 292.72 points, or 1.18 percent, at 24,591.4.\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.77 percent to 2,707.08 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.46 percent to 7,337.86.\nIn contrast, the Russell 2000 index, which tracks U.S. small-cap stocks, was up 0.11 percent as domestically focused companies are expected to benefit from a protectionist stance.\nWorries over the threat to global trade that U.S. moves would represent have dominated Wall Street trading for almost a week.\nSpokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the White House was on track to announce tariffs by the end of this week.\nWednesday’s losses were broad-based, but shares of manufacturing titans Boeing and Caterpillar were hit hard on worries about higher input costs and trade barriers outside the United States.\nAlso contributing to the losses were a set of weak results and forecasts from Dollar Tree and Ross Stores .\nDiscount store operator Dollar Tree slumped 16 percent after reporting disappointing holiday quarter results, while off-price retailer Ross Stores fell 5 percent after its full-year profit forecast came in largely below expectations.\nExxon dropped 2.8 percent as investors were disappointed about the company’s decision not to announce a share repurchase plan.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,798 to 992. On the Nasdaq, 1,436 issues rose and 1,395 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)\n ",
