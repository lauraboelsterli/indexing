    "text": "DALLAS, March 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MoneyGram (NASDAQ:MGI) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenue of $408.2 million declined 2% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis compared to fourth quarter 2016. Money transfer revenue results were primarily impacted by softness in the U.S. to U.S. business and slower growth in Africa, partially offset by the translation impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Moneygram.com grew 23% primarily from new customer acquisitions. Total Digital money transfer revenue grew 7% over fourth quarter 2016 as strong moneygram.com growth was partially offset by a decline in revenue from kiosks and global economic trends. Digital represented 14% of total money transfer revenue. Operating loss was $56.5 million, a decrease of $79.2 million when compared to fourth quarter 2016, driven by an $85.0 million accrual related to the company's deferred prosecution agreement (the \"DPA\"). As previously disclosed, the company and the government extended the DPA to provide both parties with additional time to discuss the company's compliance with the DPA. Included in fourth quarter expenses, the company recorded an $85.0 million accrual in connection with a possible resolution of these discussions, which is based on the facts and circumstances known at the present time. However, the company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of resolving these discussions, and no assurance can be given that future costs and payments made in connection with this matter will not exceed the amount currently recorded or that the government will not also seek to impose non-monetary remedies or penalties. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the government will not seek any other remedy, including criminal prosecution and financial penalties, in lieu of an extension of the DPA and monitorship. Net loss was $52.5 million and included a one-time income tax benefit from the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was offset by the tax impact of the DPA accrual. EBITDA was $(24.3) million, a decrease of $79.4 million as compared to fourth quarter 2016. Both net income and EBITDA were impacted by the accrual related to the DPA discussed above, $2.0 million of costs incurred in connection with the terminated merger with Ant Financial and an increase in direct monitor costs. Adjusted EBITDA was $71.3 million, a 10% increase on a reported basis and an 8% increase on a constant currency basis compared to fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.5% as compared to 15.5% for fourth quarter 2016. Diluted loss per share was $0.83 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.11 in the fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $25.7 million for the quarter.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue of $1,602.1 million declined 2% on a reported and constant currency basis compared to 2016. Moneygram.com grew 25% primarily from new customer acquisitions. Total Digital money transfer revenue grew 9% over the prior year as strong moneygram.com growth was partially offset by the aforementioned decline in revenue from kiosks and global economic trends. Digital represented 14% of total money transfer revenue. Net loss was $29.8 million as compared to net income of $15.9 million in 2016, and included the aforementioned income tax impact. EBITDA was $135.7 million and decreased by $85.7 million when compared to 2016 primarily due to the $85.0 million accrual related to the DPA, which also impacted net loss. Net loss and EBITDA included $12.7 million of costs incurred in connection with the terminated merger with Ant Financial. Adjusted EBITDA was $275.9 million, a 5% increase on a reported and constant currency basis compared to 2016. Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $105.1 million, an increase of $9.0 million from 2016. Ending cash and cash equivalent balance of $190.0 million at end of 2017 compared to $157.2 million at end of 2016.\n\"In 2017 we continued to make progress on our journey toward becoming a digitally-enabled customer-centric organization while further increasing investments in compliance enhancements to protect our customers,\" said Alex Holmes, MoneyGram's chairman and chief executive officer. \"Despite softness in top-line growth, our focus on efficiencies and profitability enabled us to achieve year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth.\"\nMr. Holmes continued, \"During the year, we increased our digital assets through moneygram.com , launched MobilePass, and strengthened our direct-to-account strategy. We entered 2018 with strong momentum and already launched moneygram.com in Spain and France and enhanced our digital money transfer offering through a pilot with Ripple and a partnership with GCash. We are proud of these accomplishments and are confident that by continuing to execute on initiatives to accelerate our digital transformation, optimize our physical network, focus on margin and become the leader in compliance, we will be well positioned for future value creation.\"\nThe company will provide financial guidance and operational information during its first quarter 2018 earnings call.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis communication contains which are protected as under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are not limited to historical facts, but reflect MoneyGram's current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events.

Lee Partners, L.P. on our Board of Directors; and uncertainties described in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of MoneyGram's public reports filed with the SEC, including MoneyGram's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in the is contained from time to time in MoneyGram's SEC filings. MoneyGram's filings may be obtained by contacting MoneyGram or the SEC or through MoneyGram's web site at corporate.moneygram.com or through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval System (EDGAR) at http://www.sec.gov . MoneyGram undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP, this news release and related tables include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including a presentation of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including agent signing bonus amortization), Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for certain significant items), Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, cash taxes and cash payments for capital expenditures and agent signing bonuses), constant currency measures (which assume that amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at rates consistent with those in the prior year), adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted net income. In addition, we present adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin for our two reporting segments. The following tables include a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are an indicator of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate and compare the operating performance and value of companies within our industry. Finally, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, constant currency, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted net income figures are financial and performance measures used by management in reviewing results of operations, forecasting, allocating resources or establishing employee incentive programs. Although MoneyGram believes the above non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors' understanding of its business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the accompanying GAAP financial measures.\nDescription of Tables\nTable One\n-\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nTable Two\n-\nSegment Results\nTable Three\n-\nSegment Reconciliations\nTable Four\n-\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nTable Five\n-\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS\nTable Six\n-\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nTable Seven\n-\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nTable Eight\n-\nCorrection of Prior Period Results\nAbout MoneyGram International\nMoneyGram is a global provider of innovative money transfer services and is recognized worldwide as a financial connection to friends and family.
