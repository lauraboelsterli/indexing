    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TearLab Corporation (OTCQB:TEAR) (TSX:TLB) (“TearLab” or the “Company”) today reported its consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. All dollar amounts are expressed in U.S. currency and results are reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles except where noted otherwise.\nRecent Highlights\nGrew quarterly revenue sequentially to $6.9 million, a $0.4 million increase compared to the third quarter of 2017 Reduced full year loss from operations by 26% compared to 2016, from $16.0 million to $11.8 million Expanded the U.S. active device base to 4,623 TearLab Osmolarity Systems Submitted a 510(k) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for potential clearance of the Tearlab Discovery™ Platform and received notice of acceptance from the FDA Raised $3 million in gross proceeds through a registered direct offering of 6,818,182 units for corporate and capital expenses Received approval from the Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) in Brazil to market the TearLab Osmolarity System Launched a new business model with the goal of reducing costs, maintaining current customers and annuity revenue base and focusing resources on the development and generation of clinical data for its next generation platform Cash position of $7.3 million as of December 31, 2017\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, TearLab’s net revenues were $6.9 million, down 3% from $7.1 million for the same period in 2016. A net total of 166 TearLab Osmolarity® Systems were added in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which 77 were under the Company’s Flex program and 45 were purchased outside of the United States.\nThe following table sets out the estimated annualized revenue per U.S. device and account analysis for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017:\nAnnualized Annualized Active Active Revenue Revenue Program Devices Accounts Per Device Per Account Purchased 902 794 $ 2,932 $ 3,331 Masters 1,694 211 $ 3,095 $ 24,846 Flex 2,027 763 $ 8,025 $ 21,319 Total 4,623 1,768 The Company’s reported net loss for the 2017 fourth quarter was approximately $4.0 million, or ($0.63) basic loss per share, compared to a reported net loss of approximately $4.3 million, or ($0.81) basic loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company’s reported net loss was negatively impacted by a non-cash charge of $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to both impairment of existing reader devices included in fixed assets and obsolete equipment based on the Company’s new business model and revised forecast of readers expected to be sold or placed in the future.\n“We were pleased to see sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 despite the implementation of our lower resource commercial model late in the quarter, which speaks to the health of our current customer and revenue base,” said Seph Jensen, TearLab’s Chief Executive Officer. “In addition, we were very pleased to have submitted the 510(k) package for clearance in the U.S of our TearLab Discovery™ System and are looking forward to working with the FDA to complete the review process. The Discovery Platform is critical to our success moving forward, and we took a number of other steps to position us to achieve clearance of the new platform, including the completion of a $3 million financing to support our operations and regulatory expenses as well as an amendment to our loan agreement with CRG to lower the minimum revenue levels in our debt covenants from 2017 forward, which we believe demonstrates their confidence in our technology platform. Our team remains determined to execute on our primary strategic initiatives while carefully managing expenses.”\nAbout TearLab Corporation\nTearLab Corporation ( www.tearlab.com ) develops and markets lab-on-a-chip technologies that enable eye care practitioners to improve standard of care by objectively and quantitatively testing for disease markers in tears at the point-of-care.
