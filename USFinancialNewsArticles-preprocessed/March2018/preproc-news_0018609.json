    "text": "Robert Covington scored 22 points, aided by five 3-point baskets, as the Philadelphia 76ers sizzled from the perimeter to defeat the Charlotte Hornets 128-114 on Tuesday night at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C.\nDario Saric added 19 points with four 3s, and Joel Embiid poured in 18 points.\nThe 76ers shot 16-for-33 on 3-pointers. Philadelphia didn’t have a 3-point basket in the last seven minutes, having done enough long-range damage by then.\nBen Simmons tacked on 16 points on 8-for-9 shooting from the field, and JJ Redick provided 14 points. Marco Belinelli and Ersan Ilyasova each had 11 points off the bench for Philadelphia.\nDwight Howard scored 30 points for the Hornets, hitting 12 of 17 shots from the field.\nNic Batum’s 12 points and Marvin Williams’ 11 points weren’t enough, as the four starters other than Howard combined for 33 points.\nTreveon Graham added 12 points, Frank Kaminsky had 11 and Jeremy Lamb supplied 10 points for the Hornets, who have lost four in a row following a five-game winning streak.\nHornets guard Kemba Walker, the team’s leading scorer, was 1-for-9 from the field, including 0-for-5 on 3-pointers. His field goal came with about 7 1/2 minutes remaining, pulling the Hornets to within 110-100.\nHoward, who made a buzzer 3-pointer to end the first half, scored the first five points of the second half to help the Hornets recover from what had been a largely ragged second quarter.\nThe 76ers, who lost three of their previous five games, finished the first half on a 21-11 spurt for a 71-59 lead.\nPhiladelphia shot 67.5 percent from the field in the first half, an offensive outburst that might have been bigger if not for nine turnovers. The 76ers had only five second-half giveaways.\nRedick was 3-for-4 on 3-pointers in the first half.\nThe 76ers’ most-recent victory also came against Charlotte, winning 110-99 last week at home.\nCharlotte had 28 first-half points from its reserves, accounting for nearly half of the points production.\nThis was Philadelphia’s second game of a four-game road stretch.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
