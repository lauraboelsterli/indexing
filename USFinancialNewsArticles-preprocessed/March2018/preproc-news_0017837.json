    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian state television on Wednesday said Syrian army units were attacking militant defenses in the rebel-held eastern Ghouta town of Mesraba with preparatory fire to secure the entry of infantry units, citing its correspondent there.\nIt broadcast live footage from the outskirts of Mesraba, whose capture would nearly cut the rebel enclave in two, showing very large clouds of smoke rising into the air behind a row of buildings along with the sound of a jet and the noise of blasts.\nWriting by Tom Perry; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
