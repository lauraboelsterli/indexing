    "text": "0 COMMENTS KeepTruckin Inc., a technology company that helps monitor drivers’ time behind the wheel, said it has raised $50 million to develop additional products and expand its sales and support staff.\nThe San Francisco-based business makes driver apps, software and electronic logging devices, or ELDs, that track compliance with federal limits on driving time and other data. Sales of such equipment have soared because of a mandate that took effect in December requiring their use in most big rigs . The rule is intended to reduce accidents linked to driver fatigue.\nBig carriers have used ELD-type devices for years, along with fleet management software that helps them monitor mileage and driver behavior, keep tabs on the location of their trucks, and use vehicles more efficiently.\nKeepTruckin’s products are aimed at the thousands of smaller fleets and independent truck drivers who, until recently, recorded their hours on paper logs and had little access to data on their operations.\n‘ Trucking is a huge industry but it’s been completely underserved by technology. ’\n—Sandy Miller, a general partner at IVP. In 2013, the company launched an ELD app that drivers could download for free. More recently, it rolled out technology and hardware to help fleets audit driver logs, track trucks in real time, optimize routes and automate tasks like fuel-tax reporting.\nKeepTruckin said it has a valuation of $500 million, and expects to hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue by the end of 2018. Last year, that measure grew to $40 million, up from less than $500,000 at the end of 2016.\nThe company’s Series C funding round, led by late-stage venture firm IVP, includes additional backing from existing investors Scale Venture Partners, Index Ventures and Google Ventures. The company raised $18 million in Series B funding in 2017 after taking in $8 million in a Series A round in 2015 and $2.3 million in seed funding in 2013.\nKeepTruckin plans to use new backing to build out products like a video-monitoring feature now in development that gives drivers feedback on their driving. The company also is working on a marketplace that will offer carriers information on available cargo loads that line up with driver locations and preferred routes.\n“We want to work with brokers and shippers to bring those loads to our drivers in a really targeted way,” said Shoaib Makani, the company’s cofounder and chief executive. “We know where the drivers are, how much time they have to drive, and their historical lane preferences.”\nKeepTruckin expects to have 400,000 trucks using its technology by the end of the year.\nIn January, it announced an agreement with freight broker Coyote Logistics, a United Parcel Service Inc. subsidiary, to offer its ELD technology at a discounted rate to Coyote’s network of carriers.\nAlso in Logistics\nTrucking Acquisitions Put New Spotlight on Fleet Values March 20, 2018 Chinese Shipyards See Surge in Orders, Margins Remain Thin March 19, 2018 Knight-Swift Buys Trucker Abilene Motor Express March 16, 2018 DHL Steps Back Into U.S. Package Delivery in Challenge to UPS, FedEx March 15, 2018 “The ELD mandate was the icing on the cake. Obviously it’s helping to drive adoption,” said Sandy Miller, a general partner at IVP, which has also invested in fleet-management software firms like Fleetmatics, now a subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc. “Trucking is a huge industry but it’s been completely underserved by technology.”\nKeepTruckin and other ELD providers had some glitches when the ELD mandate went into effect on Dec. 18, as a surge of new users overwhelmed servers and customer support lines .\nSince then, Mr. Makani said, the company has added support staff and expanded server capacity “by about five in order to handle what we anticipate will be a very substantial spike on April 1,” when full enforcement of the rule is scheduled to begin and vehicles without the devices may be removed from the road.\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com",
