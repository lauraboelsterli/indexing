Driven by outstanding performance of the Group, sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 10.6% over 2016 to US$6.1 billion for the eighth consecutive year. TTI generated solid growth in all core geographic regions fueled by exciting new product introductions and geographic expansion. Gross profit margin improved for the ninth consecutive year from 36.2% in 2016 to 36.7 % on positive contributions from operational productivity gains and volume leverage.

Working capital as a percent of sales continues to be very well managed and remained low at 16.5% and in a net cash position.
