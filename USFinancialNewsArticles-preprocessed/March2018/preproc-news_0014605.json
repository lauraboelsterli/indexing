    "text": "Published: Mar 7, 2018 1:19 p.m. ET Share Spotify House at the South By Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas, in 2016. \nBy Alexander Osipovich \nSpotify Technology SA has chosen electronic-trading firm Citadel Securities LLC to oversee its unusual debut at the New York Stock Exchange, people familiar with the situation said. \nThe music-streaming company SPOT, +0.00% settled on Citadel Securities as its designated market maker in recent days, the people said. Such DMM firms, also called specialists, help ensure the orderly trading of NYSE-listed stocks. Their role is especially important during key moments such as initial public offerings. \nBy winning Spotify, one of the biggest technology listings of recent years, Citadel Securities has notched a high-profile victory after it failed to win Snap Inc. SNAP, +2.67% , the biggest tech IPO of 2017. \nPeter Giacchi, the head of Citadel Securities’ DMM unit and a veteran of the NYSE’s historic trading floor in lower Manhattan, is the trader who will determine the opening price of Spotify shares, one of the people said. Giacchi didn’t respond to requests for comment. \nSpotify declined to comment. The Stockholm-based company could go public as soon as the week of March 26 through a process called a direct listing.",
