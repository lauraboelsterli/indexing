Cricket - South Africa vs Australia - First Test Match - Kingsmead Stadium, Durban, South Africa - March 4, 2018. Australia's Mitchell Starc celebrates the wicket of South Africa's Keshav Maharaj. REUTERS/Rogan Ward \nHis place in the team for the fourth test that started at the Wanderers on Friday was taken by Chadd Sayers. \nStarc was due to play in the IPL for the Kolkata Knight Riders, who paid US$1.5 million in the player auction for the injury-plagued left-arm seamer, but he became the third Australian to be withdrawn from the tournament this week. \nSteve Smith and David Warner had their IPL contracts torn up this week by the Rajasthan Royals and Hyderabad Sunrisers respectively after they were found guilty of ball tampering in the third test against South Africa at Newlands.
