    "text": "MIAMI, March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK) announced U.S. GAAP net income of $391 million, or $0.54 diluted EPS, for the first quarter of 2018, higher than U.S. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 of $352 million, or $0.48 diluted EPS. First quarter 2018 adjusted net income of $375 million, or $0.52 adjusted EPS, was higher than adjusted net income of $279 million, or $0.38 adjusted EPS, for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income excludes unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives and other net charges, totaling $16 million in net gains for the first quarter of 2018 and $73 million in net gains for the first quarter of 2017. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 of $4.2 billion were higher than the $3.8 billion in the prior year.\nCarnival Corporation & plc President and Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald stated, \"We are off to a strong start to the year achieving another quarter of record earnings on record revenues and exceeding the high end of guidance. This strong operational execution affirms our efforts to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth and exceed guest expectations once onboard. Our guest experience efforts, coupled with our ongoing marketing and public relations programs are clearly accelerating cruise demand across the board to drive cruise ticket prices higher.\"\nKey information for the first quarter 2018 compared to the prior year:\nGross revenue yields (revenue per available lower berth day or \"ALBD\") increased 9.2 percent. In constant currency, net revenue yields increased 3.9 percent for 1Q 2018, better than December guidance of up 1.5 to 2.5 percent. Gross cruise costs including fuel per ALBD increased 9.0 percent. In constant currency, net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD increased 1.0 percent, better than December guidance of up 2.0 to 3.0 percent, principally due to the timing of expenses between quarters. Changes in fuel prices (including realized fuel derivatives) decreased earnings by $0.04 per share, offset by an increase in earnings due to changes in currency exchange rates of $0.04 per share.\nHighlights from the first quarter include the signing of agreements with German shipbuilder Meyer Werft GmbH to build two new cruise ships that will be powered by liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\"). The first is designated for P&O Cruises (UK) to be delivered in 2022 with the second for AIDA Cruises in 2023. Also during the quarter, we continued to drive demand and cruise awareness with successful new marketing efforts: Carnival Cruise Line appointed Shaquille O'Neal as their new \"CFO,\" Chief Fun Officer; Cunard hosted the world premiere of \"The Greatest Showman,\" broadcasting the red carpet event live on Flagship Queen Mary 2; Costa Cruises launched a new international ad campaign featuring Shakira that will be aired in Southern Europe and P&O Cruises launched a new marketing campaign featuring UK celebrity Rob Brydon. Additionally, we launched the new prime time series La Gran Sorpresa on Univision and extended our original TV programming to Telemundo, which will now be featuring our popular Ocean Originals TV program, \"The Voyager with Josh Garcia.\"\n2018 Outlook\nAt this time, cumulative advanced bookings for the remainder of 2018 are in line with the prior year at higher prices. Since January, booking volumes for all future periods have been running ahead of prior year at higher prices.\nDonald added, \"The booking strength achieved during this year's wave season, outpacing even last year's record levels, demonstrates sustained strong demand for our world's leading cruise brands and delivers further confidence in our raised earnings guidance. We remain on track to achieve double-digit return on invested capital while continuing to return cash to shareholders through ongoing share repurchases and dividend growth.\" The company invested more than $250 million in share repurchases since the beginning of the quarter, bringing the cumulative total of repurchases to date to over $3.4 billion since late 2015.\nBased on current booking trends, the company expects full year 2018 net revenue yields in constant currency to be up approximately 2.5 percent compared to the prior year, in line with December guidance. The company expects full year net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD in constant currency compared to the prior year to be up approximately 1.0 percent, also in line with December guidance. Changes in fuel prices (including realized fuel derivatives) and currency exchange rates are expected to increase earnings by 0.10 per share compared to December guidance.\nTaking the above factors into consideration, the company expects full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.40 compared to December guidance of $4.00 to $4.30 and 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $3.82.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook\nSecond quarter constant currency net revenue yields are expected to be up approximately 2.5 to 3.5 percent compared to the prior year. Net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD in constant currency for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to increase by approximately 4.0 to 5.0 percent compared to the prior year. Based on the above factors, the company expects adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter 2018 to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.60 versus 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.52.\nSelected Key Metrics\nFull Year 2018\nSecond Quarter 2018\nYear over year change:\nCurrent\nDollars\nConstant\nCurrency\nCurrent\nDollars\nConstant\nCurrency\nNet revenue yields\nApprox 6.0%\nApprox 2.5%\n7.0 to 8.0%\n2.5 to 3.5%\nNet cruise costs excl. fuel / ALBD\nApprox 4.0%\nApprox 1.0%\n8.5 to 9.5%\n4.0 to 5.0%\nFull Year 2018\nSecond Quarter 2018\nFuel cost per metric ton consumed\n$443\n$436\nFuel consumption (metric tons in thousands)\n3,315\n830\nCurrencies (USD to 1)\nAUD\n$0.77\n$0.77\nCAD\n$0.77\n$0.76\nEUR\n$1.22\n$1.23\nGBP\n$1.40\n$1.40\nRMB\n$0.16\n$0.16\nThree Months Ended\nFebruary 28,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (in millions)\n$\n391\n$\n352\nAdjusted net income (in millions) (a)\n$\n375\n$\n279\nEarnings per share-diluted\n$\n0.54\n$\n0.48\nAdjusted earnings per share-diluted (a)\n$\n0.52\n$\n0.38\n(a)\nSee the net income to adjusted net income and EPS to adjusted EPS reconciliations in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures included herein.\nConference Call\nThe company has scheduled a conference call with analysts at 10:00 a.m. EDT (2:00 p.m. GMT) today to discuss its 2018 first quarter results.

ALBDs assume that each cabin we offer for sale accommodates two passengers and is computed by multiplying passenger capacity by revenue-producing ship operating days in the period.\n(b)\nIn accordance with cruise industry practice, occupancy is calculated using a denominator of ALBDs, which assumes two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can accommodate three or more passengers. Percentages in excess of 100% indicate that on average more than two passengers occupied some cabins.\nCARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nConsolidated gross and net revenue yields were computed by dividing the gross and net cruise revenues by ALBDs as follows:\nThree Months Ended February 28,\n(dollars in millions, except yields)\n2018\n2018\nConstant\nDollar\n2017\nPassenger ticket revenues\n$\n3,148\n$\n2,999\n$\n2,804\nOnboard and other revenues\n1,071\n1,038\n978\nGross cruise revenues\n4,219\n4,037\n3,782\nLess cruise costs\nCommissions, transportation and other\n(663)\n(621)\n(569)\nOnboard and other\n(140)\n(135)\n(125)\n(803)\n(756)\n(694)\nNet passenger ticket revenues\n2,485\n2,378\n2,235\nNet onboard and other revenues\n931\n903\n853\nNet cruise revenues\n$\n3,416\n$\n3,280\n$\n3,088\nALBDs\n20,461,582\n20,461,582\n20,024,045\nGross revenue yields\n$\n206.20\n$\n197.29\n$\n188.87\n% increase\n9.2\n%\n4.5\n%\nNet revenue yields\n$\n166.95\n$\n160.32\n$\n154.22\n% increase\n8.3\n%\n4.0\n%\nNet passenger ticket revenue yields\n$\n121.46\n$\n116.21\n$\n111.60\n% increase\n8.8\n%\n4.1\n%\nNet onboard and other revenue yields\n$\n45.50\n$\n44.11\n$\n42.62\n% increase\n6.8\n%\n3.5\n%\nThree Months Ended February 28,\n(dollars in millions, except yields)\n2018\n2018\nConstant\nCurrency\n2017\nNet passenger ticket revenues\n$\n2,485\n$\n2,374\n$\n2,235\nNet onboard and other revenues\n931\n906\n853\nNet cruise revenues\n$\n3,416\n$\n3,280\n$\n3,088\nALBDs\n20,461,582\n20,461,582\n20,024,045\nNet revenue yields\n$\n166.95\n$\n160.31\n$\n154.22\n% increase\n8.3\n%\n3.9\n%\nNet passenger ticket revenue yields\n$\n121.46\n$\n116.04\n$\n111.60\n% increase\n8.8\n%\n4.0\n%\nNet onboard and other revenue yields\n$\n45.50\n$\n44.27\n$\n42.62\n% increase\n6.8\n%\n3.9\n%\n(See Explanations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.)\nCARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)\nConsolidated gross and net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD were computed by dividing the gross\nand net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel by ALBDs as follows:\nThree Months Ended February 28,\n(dollars in millions, except costs per ALBD)\n2018\n2018\nConstant\nDollar\n2017\nCruise operating expenses\n$\n2,695\n$\n2,587\n$\n2,422\nCruise selling and administrative\nexpenses\n610\n587\n546\nGross cruise costs\n3,305\n3,175\n2,968\nLess cruise costs included above\nCommissions, transportation and other\n(663)\n(621)\n(569)\nOnboard and other\n(140)\n(135)\n(125)\n(Losses) gains on ship sales and impairments\n(16)\n(16)\nâ€”\nRestructuring expenses\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nOther\nâ€”\nâ€”\n1\nNet cruise costs\n2,485\n2,402\n2,275\nLess fuel\n(359)\n(359)\n(297)\nNet cruise costs excluding fuel\n$\n2,127\n$\n2,044\n$\n1,978\nALBDs\n20,461,582\n20,461,582\n20,024,045\nGross cruise costs per ALBD\n$\n161.51\n$\n155.16\n$\n148.24\n% increase\n9.0\n%\n4.7\n%\nNet cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD\n$\n103.92\n$\n99.84\n$\n98.81\n% increase\n5.2\n%\n1.0\n%\nThree Months Ended February 28,\n(dollars in millions, except costs per ALBD)\n2018\n2018\nConstant\nCurrency\n2017\nNet cruise costs excluding fuel\n$\n2,127\n$\n2,042\n$\n1,978\nALBDs\n20,461,582\n20,461,582\n20,024,045\nNet cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD\n$\n103.92\n$\n99.81\n$\n98.81\n% increase\n5.2\n%\n1.0\n%\n(See Explanations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.)\nCARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)\nThree Months Ended\nFebruary 28,\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2018\n2017\nNet income\nU.S. GAAP net income\n$\n391\n$\n352\nUnrealized (gains) losses on fuel derivatives, net\n(32)\n(72)\n(Gains) losses on ship sales and impairments\n16\nâ€”\nRestructuring expenses\nâ€”\nâ€”\nOther\nâ€”\n(1)\nAdjusted net income\n$\n375\n$\n279\nWeighted-average shares outstanding\n719\n728\nEarnings per share\nU.S. GAAP earnings per share\n$\n0.54\n$\n0.48\nUnrealized (gains) losses on fuel derivatives, net\n(0.05)\n(0.10)\n(Gains) losses on ship sales and impairments\n0.02\nâ€”\nRestructuring expenses\nâ€”\nâ€”\nOther\nâ€”\nâ€”\nAdjusted earnings per share\n$\n0.52\n$\n0.38\nExplanations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use net cruise revenues per ALBD (\"net revenue yields\"), net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measures of our cruise segments' and the company's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided along with U.S. GAAP gross cruise revenues per ALBD (\"gross revenue yields\"), gross cruise costs per ALBD and U.S. GAAP net income and U.S. GAAP earnings per share.\nNet revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD enable us to separate the impact of predictable capacity or ALBD changes from price and other changes that affect our business. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our revenue and cost performance as a supplement to our U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives not qualifying as fuel hedges are recognized currently in earnings. We believe that unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives are not an indication of our earnings performance since they relate to future periods and may not ultimately be realized in our future earnings. Therefore, we believe it is more meaningful for the unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and, accordingly, we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these unrealized gains and losses.\nWe believe that gains and losses on ship sales, impairment charges, restructuring and other expenses are not part of our core operating business and are not an indication of our future earnings performance. Therefore, we believe it is more meaningful for gains and losses on ship sales, impairment charges, and restructuring and other non-core gains and charges to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and, accordingly, we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these items.\nThe presentation of our non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or superior to the financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. It is possible that our non-GAAP financial measures may not be exactly comparable to the like-kind information presented by other companies, which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other companies.\nNet revenue yields are commonly used in the cruise industry to measure a company's cruise segment revenue performance and for revenue management purposes. We use \"net cruise revenues\" rather than \"gross cruise revenues\" to calculate net revenue yields. We believe that net cruise revenues is a more meaningful measure in determining revenue yield than gross cruise revenues because it reflects the cruise revenues earned net of our most significant variable costs, which are travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation, certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit and debit card fees.\nNet passenger ticket revenues reflect gross passenger ticket revenues, net of commissions, transportation and other costs.\nNet onboard and other revenues reflect gross onboard and other revenues, net of onboard and other cruise costs.\nNet cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD is the measure we use to monitor our ability to control our cruise segments' costs rather than gross cruise costs per ALBD. We exclude the same variable costs that are included in the calculation of net cruise revenues as well as fuel expense to calculate net cruise costs without fuel to avoid duplicating these variable costs in our non-GAAP financial measures. Substantially all of our net cruise costs excluding fuel are largely fixed, except for the impact of changing prices, once the number of ALBDs has been determined.\nReconciliation of Forecasted Data\nWe have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted gross cruise revenues to forecasted net cruise revenues or forecasted gross cruise costs to forecasted net cruise costs without fuel or forecasted U.S. GAAP net income to forecasted adjusted net income or forecasted U.S. GAAP earnings per share to forecasted adjusted earnings per share because preparation of meaningful U.S. GAAP forecasts of gross cruise revenues, gross cruise costs, net income and earnings per share would require unreasonable effort. We are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, the future movement of foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. While we forecast realized gains and losses on fuel derivatives by applying current Brent prices to the derivatives that settle in the forecast period, we do not forecast the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives because we do not believe they are an indication of our future earnings performance. We are unable to determine the future impact of gains or losses on ships sales, restructuring expenses and other non-core gains and charges.\nConstant Dollar and Constant Currency\nOur operations primarily utilize the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro and sterling as functional currencies to measure results and financial condition. Functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar subject us to foreign currency translational risk. Our operations also have revenues and expenses that are in currencies other than their functional currency, which subject us to foreign currency transactional risk.\nWe report net revenue yields, net passenger revenue yields, net onboard and other revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD on a \"constant dollar\" and \"constant currency\" basis assuming the 2018 periods' currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2017 periods' rates. These metrics facilitate a comparative view for the changes in our business in an environment with fluctuating exchange rates.\nConstant dollar reporting removes only the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations.\nConstant currency reporting removes the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations (as in constant dollar) plus the transactional impact of changes in exchange rates from revenues and expenses that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.\nExamples:\nThe translation of our operations with functional currencies other than U.S. dollar to our U.S. dollar reporting currency results in decreases in reported U.S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies and increases in reported U.S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U.S. dollar weakens against these foreign currencies. Our operations have revenue and expense transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. If their functional currency strengthens against these other currencies, it reduces the functional currency revenues and expenses. If the functional currency weakens against these other currencies, it increases the functional currency revenues and expenses.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carnival-corporation--plc-reports-record-first-quarter-earnings-300617971.html\nSOURCE Carnival Corporation & plc",
