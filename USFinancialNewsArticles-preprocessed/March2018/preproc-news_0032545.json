June futures on the S&P TSX index were up 0.16 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. Statistics Canada will release a report at 8:30 a.m. ET on January manufacturing sales, which are forecast to fall 0.8 percent, after a 0.3 percent dip in December. Data on foreign investment in Canadian securities for January is also scheduled for release around the same time. Canada’s main stock index erased most early gains to close little changed on Thursday, as increases in energy shares were offset by declines in metals. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were down 0.05 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were up 0.05 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were up 0.09 percent.
