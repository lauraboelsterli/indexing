The president named her at the same time he picked current CIA director Mike Pompeo to be his new secretary of state, replacing Rex Tillerson. \nIn a statement Tuesday, Haspel thanked Trump and said if confirmed, she looked forward to “providing President Trump the outstanding intelligence support he has grown to expect during his first year in office.”",
