    "text": "RENO, Nev., March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackRidge Technology International, Inc . (OTCQB: BRTI), a leading provider of next generation cyber defense solutions, has appointed John J. Walsh as Chief Strategy and Technology Officer and Bill Joll as Head of Worldwide Sales to address new cyber security market opportunities and lead the commercial rollout of current BlackRidge solutions.\nJohn J. Walsh will lead new business initiatives at BlackRidge to support the growth of the company in applying its cyber defense technologies to Critical Infrastructure, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and blockchains, as well as supporting specific government business development activities around the world. Walsh brings extensive experience in government, industrial, and commercial markets applications to BlackRidge. As Vice President of the Secure Technologies Group at Analog Devices, and President of Sypris Electronics, his visionary leadership led to their growth in cyber security. He is recognized as a thought leader in identity based crypto architectures, holding patents and having participated in leading security architecture implementations for IIoT and Smart Grid applications.\n\"In my past industry leadership positions, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with the BlackRidge team on their breakthrough identity-based trust platform,\" said Walsh. \"With the mobilization of the Government and Industry in response to the growing cyber threat to our critical infrastructure, I am excited to become part of the BlackRidge leadership team to address the critical infrastructure, IIoT, and blockchain market opportunities.\"\nBill Joll will utilize his extensive technology industry and international experience to lead BlackRidge commercial sales while also developing new International market opportunities in Europe, India and Japan. Joll, formerly CEO at ISC8, President and COO at QualMetrix, and, having held executive positions at Akamai, Nortel and On2, brings significant experience initiating and building shareholder value while managing businesses ranging from $100 million to over $1 billion. He has lived in and led businesses in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America.\n\"Having discussed the BlackRidge solution with many prospects around the world, the feedback has been consistent -- BlackRidge is addressing a void in the cyber security landscape. The market opportunities for new and innovative cyber security solutions and for BlackRidge's growth are significant,\" said Joll. \"Given the feedback and the market opportunities across the broad spectrum of industries, I look forward to leading BlackRidge's growth and expansion both domestically and internationally, especially by leveraging our strong position with the U.S. Department of Defense.\"\n\"BlackRidge provides a new level of network security and cyber defense that addresses the major failure point behind today's advanced threats and cyber-attacks,\" said Bob Graham, BlackRidge Chairman and CEO. \"Bill Joll and John Walsh are joining us at an opportune time to lead our efforts in bringing our new approach to cyber security to commercial markets and new opportunities to secure critical infrastructure, industrial control systems, and emerging blockchain networks.\"\nBlackRidge develops, markets and supports a family of products that provide next generation cyber security solutions for protecting enterprise and government networks, systems and cloud services.
