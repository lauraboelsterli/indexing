    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 3:45 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Americans are drinking a daily cup of coffee at the highest level in six years: survey Reuters Staff 3 Min Read NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - The number of Americans drinking a daily cup of coffee is at the highest level since 2012, with demand continuing to get a boost from at-home consumption and gourmet drinks, an industry study showed on Saturday.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo Sixty-four percent of Americans age 18 or over said they had a cup of coffee the previous day in 2018. That compares with 62 percent in 2017 and was roughly on par with levels last seen in 2012, according to results of a survey commissioned by the National Coffee Association (NCA) released during the group’s annual meeting in New Orleans. The survey underscores strong U.S. demand for the caffeinated beverage even as demand for soda and juice continues a years-long decline. Coffee, bottled water and tea have been major growth categories in recent years, the survey showed. The NCA survey asked about 3,000 respondents what they drank yesterday at different times of day. Daily coffee consumption declined into the mid-1990s, when Americans drinking coffee on any given day fell below 50 percent, according to results presented at an industry conference in New Orleans.

REUTERS/Mohammad Khursheed/File Photo Coffee is a bright spot for a global food industry facing stagnating demand growth for other products. In the United States, ready-to-drink products are boosting demand. In Brazil, demand for coffee pods and roast coffee is also growing. “We see the cola industry is declining, (but) coffee is in the front row,” Roberto Vélez, head of the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation, said in a separate presentation. “Emerging market consumption is going up ...Our industry is ready.” FILE PHOTO: Sandra Dias checks coffee beans as they are roasted at Redeye Coffee Roasters in Hull, Massachusetts, U.S., May 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo Among the Americans surveyed, at-home preparation continues to be the dominant spot for demand, with 79 percent of those surveyed saying they had had a cup of coffee at home the previous day. Coffee consumed at cafes and other out-of-home locations totaled 36 percent. Demand for gourmet coffee, which includes espresso-based beverages and ready-to-drink, was steady relative 2017 levels. The segment continued to get a boost from younger drinkers, with 48 percent of millennials saying they had a cup of coffee they consider to be gourmet the day before. Major coffee roasters have been trying to tap into that market. Folger’s maker JM Smucker is rolling out a new premium line this year and Nestle in late 2017 bought a majority stake in high-end cafe chain Blue Bottle Coffee. Use of smartphone apps and delivery services remained niche, the survey showed. Reporting by Chris Prentice; editing by Diane Craft",
