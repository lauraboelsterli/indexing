    "text": "March 22, 2018 / 6:30 PM / Updated 28 minutes ago Trump speaks with Turkey's Erdogan on shared concerns - White House Reuters Staff 1 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday about the importance of strong bilateral relations, the White House said, amid tensions over Turkey’s military actions in parts of Kurdish-controlled northern Syria. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a round table meeting with members of law enforcement about sanctuary cities in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis “The two leaders committed to continue efforts to intensify cooperation on shared strategic challenges and to address the concerns of both countries that affect the bilateral relations,” the White House said in a statement. The White House did not mention Syria, where Turkey’s military campaign risks confrontation between the NATO allies who have been at loggerheads over the U.S. policy in Syria and other issues.
