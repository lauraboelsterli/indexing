    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement is set to take the most Senate seats after Sunday’s national election, but all parties and coalitions will fall short of a majority, according to a projection aired on state TV RAI.\nPeople wait to enter to cast the votes at a polling station in Rome, Italy, March 4, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi The projection, based on the vote count, showed 5-Star winning 102-122 seats, short of the 158 needed for a majority.\nA center-right coalition, including former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, is set to get 118-150, the projection showed. Within that alliance, the far-right League would take 52-62 seats, and Forza Italia 46-56.\nThe ruling center-left Democratic Party is shown with 42-54 seats.\nReporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ",
