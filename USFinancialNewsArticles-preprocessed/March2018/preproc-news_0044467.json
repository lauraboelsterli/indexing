    "text": "Bryan Rust redirected a Sidney Crosby shot into the net 2:25 into overtime and gave the Pittsburgh Penguins a 5-4 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Sunday afternoon in Pittsburgh.\nCrosby shot the puck from the left wing, and Rust sent it past goalie Petr Mrazek from right in front.\nThe Penguins improved to 7-2-2 in their last 11 games and cut Washington’s Metropolitan Division lead to three points. Pittsburgh now has six games remaining while the Capitals have seven remaining.\nWashington has 95 points while Pittsburgh sits at 92. The Flyers are at 89 points and have given up five goals in each of their four losses to Pittsburgh this season.\nPhiladelphia has been playing better of late after winning just once in an eight-game stretch. This loss dropped the Flyers to 3-0-2 in their last five games.\nThe Flyers kept pushing on offense and outshot the Penguins, 45-32, but Pittsburgh goalie Matt Murray finished with 41 saves.\nTravis Sanheim gave the Flyers a 1-0 lead 5:03 into the first period by ripping a shot past Murray from deep between the circles.\nDerick Brassard tied it for Pittsburgh on a breakaway goal 9:38 into the game, bursting through the Philadelphia defense.\nHowever, the Flyers took the lead once more just 89 seconds later. That’s when Brandon Manning scored on a one-timer at 11:07 for a 2-1 lead, which is where it ended after one period.\nThe Penguins took the lead back with two early second-period goals. Patric Hornqvist tied the game when he wheeled around from rookie goalie Alex Lyon’s right and beat him with a shot inside the far post.\nThat power-play goal came 37 seconds into the period. Evgeni Malkin then scored his 42nd goal at 2:37 on a shot from between the circles, which ended Lyon’s day. Mrazek took over after Lyon allowed three goals on 11 shots.\nJordan Weal assisted on the first two Flyer goals before tying the game up with 2:50 left in the second period.\nCrosby then gave Pittsburgh a 4-3 lead just 17 seconds into the third period before Sean Couturier poked in a rebound in the final minute of regulation which forced overtime.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
