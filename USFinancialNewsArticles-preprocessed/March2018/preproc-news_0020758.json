These immunotherapies are based on a platform technology that utilizes live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) bioengineered to secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins. These Lm-based strains integrate multiple functions into a single immunotherapy, and are designed to access and direct antigen presenting cells to stimulate anti-tumor T cell immunity, activate the immune system with the equivalent of multiple adjuvants and simultaneously reduce tumor protection in the tumor microenvironment to enable the T cells to eliminate tumors. Advaxis has four franchises in various stages of clinical and near-clinical development: HPV-associated cancers, individualized neoantigen immunotherapy, cancer-specific hotspot mutation immunotherapies and prostate cancer.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180309005131/en/\nCompany:\nAdvaxis, Inc.\nNoelle Heber, 609-250-7575\nSr. Director Corporate Communications and Government Affairs\nHeber@advaxis.com\nor\nMedia:\nStern Strategy Group\nBrian Hyland, 908-325-3891\nBhyland@sternstrategy.com\nor\nRachel Auerbach, 908-325-3898\nRauerbach@sternstrategy.com\nor\nInvestors:\nLHA Investor Relations\nAnne Marie Fields, 212-838-3777\nafields@lhai.com\nSource: Advaxis, Inc.",
