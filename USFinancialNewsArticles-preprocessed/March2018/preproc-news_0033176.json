By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond Peyto's control, including the impact of general economic conditions, industry conditions, volatility of commodity prices, currency fluctuations, imprecision of reserve estimates, environmental risks, competition from other industry participants, the lack of availability of qualified personnel or management, stock market volatility and ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources. Readers are cautioned that the assumptions used in the preparation of such information, although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, may prove to be imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Peyto's actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what benefits Peyto will derive therefrom. Other than is required pursuant to applicable securities law, Peyto does not undertake to update forward-looking statements at any particular time. The Toronto Stock Exchange has neither approved nor disapproved the information contained herein.\nSource: Peyto Exploration & Development Corp.",
