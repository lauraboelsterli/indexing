    "text": "March 21, 2018 / 7:49 AM / Updated 37 minutes ago Norway's Telenor exits central Europe with $3.4 billion asset sale to Czech investor PPF Reuters Staff 2 Min Read OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian telecoms firm Telenor ( TEL.OL ) has agreed to sell its businesses in central and eastern Europe to Czech billionaire Petr Kellner’s investment firm PPF Group for 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion).

REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo “The transaction includes Telenor’s wholly owned mobile operations in Hungary, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Serbia and the technology service provider Telenor Common Operation,” the Norwegian company said in a statement on Wednesday. Telenor plans to pay a special dividend of 4.40 Norwegian crowns per share, corresponding to about 6.6 billion Norwegian crowns ($855 million), from the proceeds of the sale while the rest would be used for debt reduction, share buybacks and potential acquisitions. “With the sale of our CEE assets, we take an important step in simplifying and focusing Telenor’s portfolio on the regions where we see the strongest potential for value creation,” Chief Executive Sigve Brekke said in the statement. “Following this transaction, Telenor’s footprint will consist of integrated fixed and mobile operations in Scandinavia, and strong mobile positions in Asia.” With 3,500 employees and more than nine million customers the central European assets recorded combined revenues of 11.8 billion Norwegian crowns in 2017, corresponding to nine percent of Telenor’s overall sales. “The valuation is a bit lower than we had expected, although still in line with the European telecoms industry,” Carnegie analyst Haavard Nilsson said. “The key thing is that they free up capital but we’re questioning why the payout to shareholders is so low,” he added. Prior to the deal, Telenor had operations in 12 countries, including three in the Nordics, five in Asia and the four in central and eastern Europe, with a combined 176 million customers.
