An Alvean spokeswoman confirmed the firm, a joint venture of Cargill Inc and Brazilian sugarcane cooperative Copersucar, purchased 7,945 lots. Wilmar did not respond immediately to requests for confirmation or comment. The sugar was due from Brazil and Guatemala, the data showed, confirming a Reuters report that slightly less sugar than previously expected was tendered against the contract. The most-active raw sugar future contract was up 0.17 cent, or 1.27 percent, at 13.55 cents per lb by 10:12 a.m. EST (1512 GMT).
