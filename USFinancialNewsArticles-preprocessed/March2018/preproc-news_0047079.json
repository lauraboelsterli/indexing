    "text": "(Reuters) - Indonesian ride-hailing and online payment company Go-Jek is set to announce its first expansion to another country in Southeast Asia in the “next few weeks”, according to an internal company email seen by Reuters.\nFILE PHOTO: A Gojek driver rides his motorcycle through a business district street in Jakarta,Indonesia, June 9, 2015. REUTERS/Beawiharta/File Photo Go-Jek also plans to expand to three other Southeast Asian countries by the middle of this year, the email quoting Go-Jek Chief Executive Nadiem Makarim said.\nNews of the plans come after Uber Technologies Inc agreed this week to sell its Southeast Asian business to regional rival Grab.\nThe industry’s first big consolidation in Southeast Asia, home to about 640 million people, could put pressure on Go-Jek, which is backed by Alphabet Inc’s Google and China’s Tencent Holdings.\nMakarim described that Uber deal as a “great opportunity” because “fewer players means a smoother path to continued and deepened market leadership” for Go-Jek in Indonesia.\nRide-hailing companies throughout Asia have relied heavily on discounts and promotions, driving down profit margins and increasing pressure for sector consolidation.\nMakarim did not name the countries targeted for expansion in the email, but Go-Jek’s chief technology officer has previously said it aimed to set up operations in the Philippines this year.\n“Preparations are well under way and within the next few weeks our first new country launch will be announced,” the email Quote: d Makarim as saying.\n“This will be followed by three other countries in Southeast Asia by the middle of the year.”\nCiting the financial and strategic backing of its local and global partners, he added: “We are confident that we have more than enough support to take one of the most amazing growth stories in the world from being an Indonesian phenomenon to a global one.”\nGoogle, Singapore investor Temasek and China’s Meituan-Dianping are among investors in Go-Jek as part of a major fund-raising round.\nMakarim said that a “significant portion” of capital raised has been set aside for international expansion.\nReporting by Ed Davies; Editing by Louise Heavens and David Goodman\n ",
