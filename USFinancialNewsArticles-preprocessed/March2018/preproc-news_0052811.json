    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 8:21 AM / Updated 15 minutes ago Greek crews search for missing migrants near river on Turkish border Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nATHENS (Reuters) - Rescue crews in Greece were searching on Wednesday for migrants who sent out an emergency call from the Greek-Turkish border late on Tuesday, the Greek fire brigade said. \nState television said authorities believed about 15 people went missing as they tried to cross the swollen and fast-flowing Evros river which divides Greece from Turkey in the far northeast. \nFirefighters were responding to a call to the European Union-wide emergency number 112 but had not found anyone yet, a fire brigade spokeswoman said. \nMore migrants and refugees are attempting to cross into Greece through its land border with Turkey since a 2016 EU deal with Ankara all but closed the sea route to Greek islands which almost a million people took in 2015. \nThe Evros crossing is dangerous, and a woman and two children drowned in the river last month. At least 19 people drowned in 2010, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky",
