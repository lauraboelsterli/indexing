    "text": "JAKARTA, March 29 (Reuters) -\n* Indonesia-based budget airline company Lion Group expects to receive at least 36 new aircraft in 2018 amid 11 percent estimated growth in passenger numbers, its chief executive said on Thursday.\n* “We are optimistic that the deliveries will be on schedule,” Edward Sirait told a press conference.\n* The additions be made to Lion’s fleet in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and would include eight Airbus, 18 Boeing and 10 ATR aircraft.\n* This year Lion plans to focus on its domestic fleets, Sirait said, adding that it had no plans to expand into other countries but would review regional markets.\n* The group has ordered at least 700 new aircraft up to 2025, he said.\n* Lion Air, one of Boeing’s largest customers, ordered 201 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2012 and placed options for a further 150.\n* Transportation Partners, the leasing arm of Lion Group, has ordered 380 LEAP-1A engines from CFM International, a joint venture of GE and Safran Aircraft Engines, valued at $5.5 billion, to power its Airbus A320neo and A321neo aircraft, Sirait said.\n* Lion Group slowed its rate of fleet expansion for a second consecutive year in 2017, taking delivery of 29 aircraft, compared to 36 in 2016 and 57 in 2015.
