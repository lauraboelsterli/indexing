    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is visiting Britain this week, met with Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) group chief executive Bill Winters and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) group CEO John Flint on Thursday in London, two sources familiar with the matter said.\nFlint was due to appear on a panel at a conference on Thursday but the panelâ€™s moderator, Louis Taylor, director general of the Department for International trade said Flint had to meet with Prince Mohammed instead. An HSBC spokeswoman declined to comment.\nOne of the sources said Winters also attended the meeting.\nSaudi Arabia is looking at listing part of its state oil company Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE and banks are vying to win formal mandates for the initial public offering.\nReporting by Dasha Afanasieva and Lawrence White.
