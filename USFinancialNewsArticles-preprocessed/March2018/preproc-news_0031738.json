German Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses a news conference after talks with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven at the chancellery in Berlin, Germany, March 16, 2018. Speaking at a news conference with visiting Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, Merkel stressed the importance of multilateralism to Germany and Sweden and said both countries wanted to see the WTO take a strong role. “We believe the tariffs that the United States has proposed are against these principles of the WTO and we want to change or solve these problems via discussions if possible,” she said. Lofven said the planned tariffs were worrying and regrettable. Reporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by Paul Carrel",
