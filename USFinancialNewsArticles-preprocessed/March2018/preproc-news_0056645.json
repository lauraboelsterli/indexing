    "text": "Lauri Markkanen and Sean Kilpatrick each scored 13 points, and the Chicago Bulls snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 90-82 victory over the Orlando Magic on Friday at Amway Center in Orlando, Fla.\nCameron Payne added 11 points, and Cristiano Felico grabbed 16 rebounds for the Bulls, who completed the season sweep of the Magic and continued their dominance over Orlando with their 15th win in the last 21 meetings.\nAaron Gordon scored 18 points, and Nikola Vucevic scored 12 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for the Magic, who went 2-5 on their seven-game homestand, which came to a close Friday.\nMarkkanen, who has missed six of the last eight games with back spasms, returned to the lineup and scored 12 first-half points to help the Bulls build a 57-44 halftime lead.\nOrlando opened the third quarter with a 15-4 run, capped by a bucket from D.J. Augustin that cut Chicago’s lead to three. The Magic outscored the Bulls 25-9 in the third quarter and took a 69-66 lead into the fourth quarter.\nThe Bulls quickly regained the lead in the fourth quarter. They used a 14-0 run, capped by two Kilpatrick free throws that gave Chicago an 80-71 lead with 6:44 to play. Noah Vonleh and Ryan Arcidiacono hit 3-pointers during the Bulls’ spurt.\nThe Magic went scoreless for nearly six minutes during the Bulls’ run in the fourth quarter.\nWhile Markkanen provided a boost in his return, the Bulls were still without guards Kris Dunn and Zach LaVine. Both have been sidelined with injuries during Chicago’s losing streak.\nChicago hit 14 3-pointers and held Orlando to just 31.9 percent shooting in the win.\nOrlando travels to Atlanta on Sunday, followed by a trip to New York to take on the Knicks on Tuesday.\nThe Bulls return home to host the Washington Wizards on Sunday and the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
