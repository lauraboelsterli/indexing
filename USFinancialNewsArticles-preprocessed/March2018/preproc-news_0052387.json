    "text": "TOKYO, March 30 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks finished a weak first quarter on a positive note on Friday, with index heavyweight stocks rising and technology firms such as Tokyo Electron jumping in sympathy with a rebound in their U.S. counterparts.\nThe Nikkei ended 1.4 percent higher at 21,454.30 points, its highest close in more than a week.\nFor the week, the index gained 4.1 percent, though it lost 2.8 percent for the month and tumbled 5.8 percent on a quarterly basis, undermined by worries about higher U.S. interest rates, a stronger yen and growing fears of a global trade war.\nVolume was thin on Friday, as markets were shut for the long Easter weekend break in many of the world’s largest trading centres.\nOnly 1.14 billion shares changed hands on the main board, the lowest level since late December. Turnover was 2.14 trillion yen, also the lowest level since then.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.7 percent to 1,716.30.\nIndex-heavy Fast Retailing soared 3.1 percent, contributing a hefty 49 points to the Nikkei.\nRecently-battered semiconductor equipment makers rebounded, with Tokyo Electron up 4.2 percent and Advantest Corp 1.6 percent higher.\nSilicon maker Sumco gained 2.5 percent.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Kim Coghill\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
