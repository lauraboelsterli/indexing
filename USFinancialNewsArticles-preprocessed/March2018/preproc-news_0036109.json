We are pleased to continue to deliver significant growth in the Company's financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, highlighted by our full year loan origination volume of RMB65.6 billion, a strong 229.9% increase from RMB19.9 billion in 2016. The sustained dynamic growth was mainly attributable to the increase of our customer base. As of December 31, 2017, we had 65.4 million cumulative registered users and our cumulative borrowers had reached 10.5 million. In addition, our cumulative investors reached 559,760 in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 56.7% growth from the same quarter last year.\n\"With new regulations for the consumer lending space gradually unveiled and enforced, we have made some adjustments to our operations that have a minor impact on our core business model. We are confident we will satisfy any further requirements and that PPDAI is on track to complete the regulatory registration process. We firmly believe that the strengthened consumer lending regulatory framework is a big step forward and will support a healthy and sustainable industry environment. As an industry leader with the longest operating history in the sector and strong proprietary technologies and core capabilities, we are well positioned for future growth.\"\nMr. Simon Ho, Chief Financial Officer of PPDAI commented, \"In the light of regulatory changes impacting our industry, we're delighted to deliver strong operational results in the fourth quarter, which was reflected by an increase of 107.2% in Non-GAAP adjusted operating revenues excluding a one-time provision in our investor reserve funds from operating revenue to RMB1,019.8 million from RMB492.3 million in the same period last year. This solid growth is evidence of the strong market demand for online consumer finance as well as the strength of our fast-growing user base. Despite our high growth trajectory on a year-over-year basis, we recorded soft sequential performance in the fourth quarter in terms of loan origination volume and loan facilitation fees. During the quarter we proactively managed our loan volume in light of increased delinquencies and elevated credit risk in the industry, and we ceased the collection of upfront transaction fees, which had a one-off impact on our results in December. However, with the new U.S. GAAP revenue recognition standard taking effect in 2018, we are confident the changes in the transaction fee model will not impact our ability to grow revenues in 2018 and beyond.\n\"In addition, due to the sudden increase in credit risk across the market in the fourth quarter, we revised up our expected default rate assumptions, which resulted in charges for our risk reserve funds. These charges were mostly one-time and largely non-cash for the fourth quarter. Now that the current credit cycle has peaked, and we've reversed out all of our previously recognized gains, we believe most of these losses are behind us,\" added Mr. Ho.\nMr. Zhang concluded, \"Continuous technology innovation and a focus on superior user experience remain the cornerstones of our model. Looking ahead in 2018 and beyond, we will remain focused on technology innovation through multiple initiatives. For example, by exploring artificial intelligence, big data analytics, cloud computing and blockchain technology, we strive to enhance the accuracy, efficiency and effectiveness of our platform. As a pioneer and industry leader, PPDAI will continue to fulfill its mission to utilize the most innovative technologies to deliver highly accessible and convenient financial solutions while achieving our long-term business goals for the benefits of all stakeholders.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nOperating revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 85.3% to RMB 912.1 million (US$140.2 million) from RMB492.3 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to the increase in loan facilitation service fees, post-facilitation service fees and other revenues as a result of the substantial increase in loan origination volume, offset by a one-time provision of RMB107.7 million for the expected discretionary payments to investors in investment programs protected by the investor reserve funds due to the increase in delinquency rates.\nLoan facilitation service fees increased by 98.2% to RMB620.2 million (US$95.3 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB312.9 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to the substantial increases both in loan origination volume and the number of unique borrowers on the Company's platform. During the period, loan facilitation service fees were partially impacted by the discontinuation of collecting transaction fees upfront upon loan origination effective early December 2017. The average rate of transaction fees charged to borrowers was 6.24% in the period, compared to 6.35% in the third quarter of 2017 and 7.19% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPost-facilitation service fees increased significantly by 180.9% to RMB227.2 million (US$34.9 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB80.9 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to the substantial increase in loan origination volume and the rolling impact of deferred transaction fees.\nOther revenue increased by 74.9% to RMB172.4 million (US$26.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB98.5 million in the same period of 2016, primarily attributable to an increase in collection fees.\nNet interest income/(expense) and loan provisions losses for the fourth quarter of 2017 was an expense of RMB13.2 million (US$2.0 million), compared to an income of RMB3.6 million in the same period of 2016. This was primarily due to provisions for expected loan losses related to the Company's investments in trusts that were newly set up during the period.\nOrigination and servicing expenses increased by 153.9% to RMB296.3 million (US$45.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB116.7 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to the increase in headcount particularly for loan collection services, and to a lesser extent, due to an increase in referral fees paid to third parties for successful loan originations.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 87.2% to RMB238.6 million (US$36.7 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB127.4 million in the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily due to the increase in expenses associated with online customer acquisition, which mainly include expenses paid to internet marketing channels for online advertising and search engine marketing as well as to certain websites that enable PPDAI to reach quality borrowers, and branding.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 182.5% to RMB250.4 million (US$38.5million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB88.6 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to the increase in staff costs and the recognition of share based compensation of RMB106.2 million in the quarter related to employee options granted historically with a performance target contingent upon IPO and cancellation of the share based compensation plan of a subsidiary company.\nOperating income was RMB113.6 million (US$17.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with RMB163.1 million in the same period of 2016.\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating income , which excludes other income/(expenses), share-based compensation and a one-time provision for expected discretionary payments to investors in investment programs protected by the investor reserve funds from profit/(loss) before tax, was RMB327.4 million (US$50.3 million), representing an increase of 100.7% from RMB163.1 million in the same period of 2016.\nOther income recorded a loss of RMB 694.8 million (US$106.8 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with income of RMB124.7 million in the same period of 2016. Other income primarily consisted of a RMB27.1 million (US$4.2 million) realized gain from financial guarantee derivatives due to the amount of investment programs maturing during the period, offset by an expense of RMB271.9 million (US$41.8 million) related to the quality assurance fund and an expense of RMB460.4 million (US$70.8 million) from a fair value change of financial guarantee derivatives due to increased credit risks across the industry which led to upward adjustments to the Company's expected default rate for loans protected by the quality assurance fund and underlying loans in investment programs protected by the investor reserve funds. For the fourth quarter of 2017, RMB10.6 billion and RMB3.9 billion of loans facilitated on the Company's platform were protected by the quality assurance fund and investor reserve funds, respectively.\nIncome tax credits was RMB74.1 million (US$11.4 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with an expense of RMB21.8 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to the loss from the quality assurance fund and negative fair value change of financial guarantee derivatives during the period.\nNet loss was RMB507.1 million (US$77.90 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a profit of RMB266.0 million in the same period of 2016.\nNet loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company was RMB1,303.9 million (US$200.4 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB17.9 million in the same period of 2016 due to the accretion losses on the Company's Series A, B and C preferred shares.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB1,891.1 million (US$290.7 million) and short-term investments mainly in wealth management products of RMB1,958.9 million (US$301.1 million).\nThe total balance of the quality assurance fund, which includes restricted cash of RMB1,058.6 million (US$162.7 million) and the quality assurance fund receivable of RMB1,152.8 million (US$177.2 million), was equivalent to 17.9% of the total outstanding loans protected by the quality assurance fund.\nThe following table provides the delinquency rates for all outstanding loans on the Company's platform as of the respective dates indicated.\nAs of\n15-29 days\n30-59 days\n60-89 days\n90-119 days\n120-149 days\n150-179 days\nMarch 31, 2015\n0.79%\n1.75%\n1.10%\n1.01%\n0.87%\n0.67%\nJune 30, 2015\n0.88%\n1.06%\n0.67%\n0.54%\n0.89%\n0.67%\nSeptember 30, 2015\n0.67%\n0.89%\n0.61%\n0.54%\n0.44%\n0.35%\nDecember 31, 2015\n0.80%\n0.93%\n0.51%\n0.49%\n0.39%\n0.32%\nMarch 31, 2016\n0.62%\n0.93%\n0.72%\n0.61%\n0.48%\n0.32%\nJune 30, 2016\n0.82%\n1.01%\n0.63%\n0.43%\n0.47%\n0.44%\nSeptember 30, 2016\n0.83%\n1.11%\n0.80%\n0.63%\n0.49%\n0.39%\nDecember 31, 2016\n0.63%\n0.91%\n0.75%\n0.79%\n0.69%\n0.57%\nMarch 31, 2017\n0.57%\n0.95%\n0.79%\n0.59%\n0.54%\n0.51%\nJune 30, 2017\n0.86%\n1.11%\n0.79%\n0.51%\n0.55%\n0.52%\nSeptember 30, 2017\n0.89%\n1.40%\n1.15%\n1.02%\n0.79%\n0.60%\nDecember 31, 2017\n2.27%\n2.21%\n1.72%\n1.63%\n1.36%\n1.20%\nThe following chart and table display the historical cumulative 30-day plus past due delinquency rates by loan origination vintage for all continuing loan products facilitated through the Company's online marketplace:\nClick here to view the chart.\nMonth on Book\nVintage\n2 nd\n3 rd\n4 th\n5 th\n6 th\n7 th\n8 th\n9 th\n10 th\n11 th\n12 th\n2015Q1\n1.95%\n2.75%\n3.46%\n3.98%\n4.36%\n4.58%\n4.67%\n4.69%\n4.73%\n4.76%\n4.74%\n2015Q2\n1.74%\n2.66%\n3.38%\n3.75%\n4.02%\n4.15%\n4.30%\n4.38%\n4.45%\n4.46%\n4.46%\n2015Q3\n1.46%\n2.13%\n2.70%\n3.15%\n3.47%\n3.68%\n3.77%\n3.85%\n3.93%\n4.01%\n4.02%\n2015Q4\n1.54%\n2.27%\n2.88%\n3.17%\n3.53%\n3.77%\n3.97%\n4.12%\n4.26%\n4.32%\n4.33%\n2016Q1\n1.00%\n1.57%\n2.21%\n2.82%\n3.33%\n3.77%\n4.09%\n4.33%\n4.45%\n4.57%\n4.59%\n2016Q2\n1.75%\n2.49%\n3.21%\n3.77%\n4.17%\n4.39%\n4.59%\n4.76%\n4.88%\n4.94%\n4.96%\n2016Q3\n1.67%\n2.45%\n2.96%\n3.47%\n3.87%\n4.11%\n4.27%\n4.44%\n4.59%\n4.70%\n4.77%\n2016Q4\n1.29%\n2.07%\n2.66%\n3.15%\n3.59%\n3.97%\n4.32%\n4.62%\n4.88%\n5.07%\n5.18%\n2017Q1\n1.20%\n2.01%\n2.68%\n3.32%\n3.87%\n4.33%\n4.68%\n4.98%\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n2017Q2\n1.72%\n2.89%\n3.81%\n4.55%\n5.14%\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n2017Q3\n1.82%\n2.93%\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nOperating revenues for the fiscal year 2017 increased by 222.3% to RMB3,895.8 million (US$598.8 million) from RMB1,208.7 million in 2016, primarily due to the increase in loan facilitation service fees, post-facilitation service fees and other revenues as a result of the substantial increase in loan origination volume, partially offset by a one-time provision of RMB107.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the expected discretionary payments to investors in investment programs protected by the investor reserve funds due to the increase in delinquency rates.\nLoan facilitation service fees increased by 212.0% to RMB2,843.3 million (US$437.0million) for the fiscal year 2017 from RMB911.4 million in 2016, primarily due to the substantial increases in loan origination volume and the number of unique borrowers on the Company's platform. The average rate of transaction fees charged to borrowers was 6.5%, compared with 6.4% in 2016.\nPost-facilitation service fees increased significantly by 427.4% to RMB668.8 million (US$102.8 million) for the fiscal year 2017 from RMB126.8 million in the prior year, primarily due to the substantial increase in loan origination volume and the rolling impact of deferred transaction fees.\nOther revenue increased by 188.4% to RMB491.4 million (US$75.5 million) for the fiscal year 2017 from RMB170.4 million in 2016, primarily attributable to an increase in collection fees.\nNet interest income/(expense) and loan provision losses for the fiscal year 2017 was an expense of RMB15.2 million (US$2.3 million), compared with an income of RMB7.1 million in 2016, primarily due to provisions for expected loan losses related to the Company's investments in trusts that were newly set up during the period.\nOrigination and servicing expenses increased by 151.1% to RMB974.5 million (US$149.8 million) for the fiscal year 2017 from RMB388.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in headcount particularly for consumption loan products and loan collection services, and to a lesser extent, due to an increase in referral fees paid to third parties for successful loan originations.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 123.3% to RMB788.3 million (US$121.2 million) for the fiscal year 2017 from RMB353.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the increase in expenses associated with online customer acquisition, which mainly include expenses paid to internet marketing channels for online advertising and search engine marketing as well as to certain websites that enable PPDAI to reach quality borrowers, and expenses related to branding.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 147.5% to RMB588.7 million (US$90.5 million) for the fiscal year 2017 from RMB237.8 million in 2016, primarily due to the increase in staff costs and recognition of share based compensation expenses of RMB106.2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to employee options granted historically with a performance target contingent upon IPO and cancellation of the share based compensation plan of a subsidiary company.\nOperating income increased by 544.8% to RMB 1,529.2 million (US$235.0 million) for the fiscal year 2017 from RMB 236.8 million in 2016.\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating income , which excludes other income/ (expenses), share-based compensation expenses and a one-time provision for expected discretionary payments to investors in investment programs protected by the Company's investor protection funds in the fourth quarter from profit/(loss) before tax, increased by 635.9% to RMB 1,743.0 million (US$267.9 million) for the fiscal year 2017 from RMB236.8 million in 2016.\nOther income recorded a loss of RMB171.5 million (US$26.4 million) for the fiscal year 2017, compared to a gain of RMB312.9 million in 2016. Other income primarily consisted of a RMB5.9 million (US$0.9 million) gain from the quality assurance fund resulting from the growth in loans facilitated on the Company's platform that are protected by the quality assurance fund, and a RMB169.1 million (US$26.0 million) realized gain from financial guarantee derivatives due to the amount of investment programs maturing during the period, offset by a negative RMB383.1 million (US$58.9 million) fair value change of financial guarantee derivatives due to an upward adjustment in the expected default rate for underlying loans investment programs protected by the investor reserve funds.\nIncome tax expenses were RMB274.7 million (US$42.2 million) for the fiscal year 2017, compared with RMB48.3 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to improved profitability in fiscal year 2017.\nNet profit was RMB1,082.9 million (US$166.4 million) for fiscal year 2017, up 115.9% from RMB501.5 million in 2016.\nNet loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company was RMB1,990.6 million (US$305.9 million) for fiscal year 2017, compared with net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB60.5 million in 2016 due to the accretion losses on the Company's Series A, B and C preferred shares.\nRecent Development\nDue to the tightening regulatory requirements, the company has recently ceased to offer new investment programs with step-up returns to investors effective March 12, 2018, primarily to ensure regulatory compliance.

The Company encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nFor more information on this Non-GAAP financial measure, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP results\" set forth at the end of this press release.\nExchange Rate Information\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader.
