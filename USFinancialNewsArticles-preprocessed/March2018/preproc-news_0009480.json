To accomplish this, Brand USA utilizes a combination of brand marketing, public relations, travel trade outreach, and cooperative marketing programs that provide opportunities for partners of all types and sizes to participate.\nAccording to studies by Oxford Economics , over the past four years Brand USA's marketing initiatives have helped welcome 4.3 million incremental visitors to the USA, benefiting the U.S. economy with nearly $30 billion in total economic impact, and have supported, on average, 51,000 incremental jobs a year.\nAccording to the U.S. Travel Association, international travel to the United States is the country's top services export and supports 1.8 million American jobs (directly and indirectly) and benefits virtually every sector of the U.S. economy.\nAbout the Newly Appointed and Reappointed Board Members\nJohn Edman , director of Explore Minnesota Tourism, is responsible for the development and implementation of tourism plans, policies, and programs to promote Minnesota as a tourism and travel destination. He is the state's chief spokesperson for tourism-related issues and manages an agency with approximately 60 full-time staff and an annual budget of $13.9 million. First appointed to the Brand USA board of directors in Fiscal Year 2015, John's reappointment will run through Fiscal Year 2020.\nJohn has more than 25 years of CEO-level experience in some of the world's most prominent private and public sector travel organizations. He has managed programs for government agencies, for-profit corporations and convention bureaus, and was directly appointed by three Minnesota governors. John has been elected to leadership positions by peers in numerous national and regional organizations and helped reposition Explore Minnesota as a separate state agency to maximize private sector involvement.\nPreviously, he served as the director of Carlson Companies' destination marketing services, representing agencies and bureaus responsible for tourism marketing programs for hundreds of state and national tourism destinations throughout the world.\nJohn has been active in national and state leadership positions with numerous organizations and boards including:\nNational Council of State Travel Directors U.S. Travel Association Board of Directors Great Lakes USA Mississippi River Country Minneapolis/St. Paul Airport Foundation Minnesota Film and TV Board University of Minnesota Tourism Center\nJohn holds an MBA from the University of St. Thomas and a BSc degree from the University of Minnesota. He also is a graduate of the Carlson Executive Leadership Program at the University of Minnesota. He is a life-long resident of Minnesota, is married with two children in college, and loves traveling, skiing, fishing, golfing, hiking, dogs, and the great outdoors.\nNoel Irwin Hentschel is chairman, CEO, and co-founder of AmericanTours International (ATI), America's largest privately held, American-owned, visit USA tourism and marketing organization. Dually headquartered in Los Angeles, Calif. and Orlando, Fla. with regional offices in New York City, N.Y., and Hawaii, ATI was founded in 1977 and today serves nearly one million visitors and generates over $3 billion into the U.S. economy annually.\nHentschel and ATI revolutionized the inbound tour operator industry from the moment they opened their doors and continue to do so today, setting standards for quality of service, product innovation, and technological expertise. In its early years, ATI created and operated the first seat-in motorcoach tours and DriveAmerica fly-drive itineraries specifically marketed to international travelers. Today, ATI distributes wholesale hotel and attraction inventory from some 30,000 suppliers across all 50 states to clients in over 70 international markets.\nHentschel is a prominent voice for public policy issues that affect the tourism industry. She served six recurring terms on the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board and in 2018 was appointed to the board of directors of Brand USA. In 2007, Hentschel worked with U.S. and Chinese government officials to implement Approved Destination Status (ADS) for the United States. In 2008, ATI opened a representative office in Beijing to promote tourism to all 50 U.S. states and territories.\nHentschel also works with business and government to respond to humanitarian needs, including those that can be enriched through travel. Inspired by working with mentor Mother Teresa, in 1989 she established The Noel Foundation, focusing on women as untapped resources in developing countries and in America's inner cities. Partnering with the Urban League and ATI, the Foundation established the \"Education through Travel\" program that takes inner city youth across the United States to witness the majesty of its national parks and to learn the history of their nation. The foundation also partners with the Hashemite Social Development Fund to help train young men and women in Jordan to work in tourism.\nHentschel and her husband Gordon live in Los Angeles, Calif. and Hawaii. They own and operate Stonepine Estate, a retreat in Carmel Valley, Calif., and are the parents of seven children.\nMike Gallagher is co-chairman and co-founder of City Pass, Inc., an innovative attractions marketing company that provides significant savings on ticket packages to the top attractions in 12 North American destinations. The idea sprang from the collaborative efforts of co-founders Mike Gallagher and Mike Morey. Beginning in 1996, the two combined their respective attraction marketing and industry research skills to launch a company whose products currently enjoy a 98 percent customer recommendation rating. From its initial 1997 debut in the cities of San Francisco, Calif. and Seattle, Wash. the CityPASS program has expanded to include New York City, N.Y; Southern Calif., Atlanta, Ga; Boston, Mass; Chicago, Ill.; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Philadelphia, Pa; Tampa Bay, Fla; Toronto; and Southern Calif. The Southern California CityPASS card includes prepaid admission to four family-friendly theme parks: DisneylandÂ®, Disney California Adventure Park, SeaWorld San Diego, and LEGOLAND California.\nPrior to launching City Pass, Gallagher accumulated a wealth of experience as both a theme park executive and a tourism leader. He started his career in various operations and marketing capacities at SeaWorld San Diego, Calif. and the San Diego Zoo. In 1974, Gallagher joined Marine World Africa USA (now Six Flags Discovery Kingdom). In 1980, at the age of 28, he was promoted to the position of executive vice president of marketing, where he played a key role in all aspects of the park's operation, including serving as one of the primary forces behind Marine World's successful move from Redwood City to Vallejo, Calif. in 1985.\nGallagher is a leading figure in the travel industry. He is a founding commissioner of Visit California (formerly the California Travel and Tourism Commission), established in 1998. He was the chairman of the California Travel Industry Association in 1985 and again in 1995. In 2016, he was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce to a second two-year term on the Travel and Tourism Advisory Board.\nGallagher was also actively involved in the passage of the Travel Promotion Act in 2010 and was a member of the task force that created the blueprint for the Corporation for Travel Promotion, now Brand USA. In 2018, he was appointed to Brand USA's board of directors, where he will help to guide the efforts of America's official destination marketing organization.\nIn 2005, Gallagher was honored as California's Tourism Entrepreneur of the Year. More recently, he was recognized by the Pacific Area Travel Writers Association International (PATWA) with a 2010 Hall of Fame Lifetime Contribution in Tourism Award. In 2013, he was inducted into the U.S. Travel Association's prestigious Hall of Leaders, which recognizes \"sustained, noteworthy contributions that have positively impacted the travel industry, stimulated greater achievement, and raised industry-wide standards.\" And in January 2015, he was honored with the Hotel Excellence Awards' Lifetime Achievement Award for his efforts on behalf of New York City, N.Y.'s hospitality industry.\nGallagher and his wife, Connie, who have three children, split their time between their home in California's Napa Valley and their residence in Washington, DC.\nAbout the Brand USA Board of Directors\nBrand USA is governed by an 11-member board of directors appointed for a maximum of two consecutive three-year terms by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security. To allow for staggered term expirations, of the members first appointed to the board, three were appointed for terms of one year, four were appointed for terms of two years, and four were appointed for terms of three years. All members of the board are United States citizens and are either current or former chief executive officers, chief financial offers, or chief marketing officers, or have held equivalent management positions.\nDesignated board members have leadership expertise in specific sectors of the travel industry including: hotel accommodations; restaurants; small business or retail or in associations representing that sector; travel distribution; attractions or recreations; state-level tourism office; city-level convention and visitors bureau; passenger air; land or sea transportation; and immigration law and policy. At least two members of the board are audit committee financial experts. In addition, at least five members of the board have expertise in international travel promotion or marketing broadly representing various regions of the United States. Brand USA board members receive no compensation for their service on the Brand USA board.\nAbout Brand USA\nBrand USA, the destination marketing organization for the United States, was established by the Travel Promotion Act as the nation's first public-private partnership to promote the United States as a premier travel destination and to communicate U.S. travel policies and procedures to worldwide travelers. The organization's mission is to increase international visitation to the USA in order to fuel the U.S. economy and enhance the image of the United States worldwide. Formed as the Corporation for Travel Promotion in 2010, the public-private entity began operations in May 2011 and does business as Brand USA. According to studies by Oxford Economics, over the past four years Brand USA's marketing initiatives have helped welcome 4.3 million incremental visitors to the USA, benefiting the U.S. economy with nearly $30 billion in total economic impact, which has supported, on average, 51,000 incremental jobs a year.\nFor industry or partner information about Brand USA, visit TheBrandUSA.com .
