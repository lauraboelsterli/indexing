    "text": "JUPITER, Fla., March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Jupiter Orphan Therapeutics, Inc. (JOT) today announced that the well-known scientist Gino Cortopassi, Ph.D. joined JOT as a member of its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB).\n\"This is a great and timely addition to our company. Dr. Cortopassi's knowledge, network and reputation is very valuable to JOT's strategy to apply its JOTROL ™ platform product to several rare diseases affected by mitochondrial biogenesis,\" stated JOT CEO, Christer Rosén.\nDr. Cortopassi stated, \"I am excited about being able to work with JOT to bring drugs to patients who are waiting for a solution to their rare disease. It is well published how resveratrol boosts mitochondrial biogenesis but the poor bioavailability has stopped its utilization as an effective therapy. JOT ROL ™, based on pre-clinical trial, seems to be the solution to finally unlock the true potential of resveratrol. We have identified 11 mitochondria related indications where JOT ROL ™ can be utilized and are looking forward to get projects kicked off.\"\nAbout Professor Gino Cortopassi, Ph.D.\nCurrently Professor of Molecular Biosciences at University of California – Davis. Received his B.Sc. from Stanford (Biology), Ph.D. from UC Berkeley (Biochemistry), has previously been a Professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology at University of Southern California.\nDr. Cortopassi has authored/co-authored multiple scientific papers primarily related to mitochondrial science.\nAbout Jupiter Orphan Therapeutics\nJupiter Orphan Therapeutics, Inc. (JOT) is a clinical stage specialty pharmaceutical company developing therapies for rare diseases. JOT, a Delaware Corporation with its principal office located in Jupiter, FL, USA, was founded in the summer of 2015.
