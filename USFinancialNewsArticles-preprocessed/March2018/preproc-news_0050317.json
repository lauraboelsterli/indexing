    "text": "5 COMMENTS Steven Spielberg’s latest film, “Ready Player One,” is set in 2045, a dystopian future in which most of humanity escapes real life in the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation)—a virtual reality environment offering activities for work, education and entertainment.\nThe film is based on the novel by Ernest Cline. Speaking alongside Mr. Spielberg at Comic Con, San Diego in 2017, Mr. Cline said the film could change the speed with which virtual reality is adopted by exposing a much wider audience to the technology.\nSince the rollout of consumer VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR in 2016, pick-up has been slower than predicted.\n“I think through a movie like this, through showing off the possibilities of VR, I think there’s going to be a lot of people who now have an interest in trying it out,” says JB McRee, a marketing manager for HTC’s Vive headset. (The HTC Vive is the official VR partner for the movie.) \n“A lot of it comes down to the quality of the film,” IHS Markit’s lead VR analyst Piers Harding-Rolls says. “If it starts to snowball into something that becomes more of a cultural classic and something people have strong word of mouth about, then it starts to have a significant impact potentially.”\nCheck out the video above for a deeper look at how Hollywood’s representation of VR may affect real life.",
