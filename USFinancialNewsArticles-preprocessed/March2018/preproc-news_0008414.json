L1 Capital (Manager) is currently shortlisted for Money Management’s Long/Short Equities Fund Manager of the year award.\nThe investment team has shown their commitment and confidence in the LIC by investing more than $10 million in the IPO (with a 10 year escrow). Additionally, the team will also re-invest the after-tax value of the LICs performance fees back into buying shares in the LIC, with a 10 year escrow post listing. The Company is chaired by Andrew Larke who has also committed to invest $1 million in the offer.\nMark Landau, co-founder and joint chief investment officer of L1 Capital said;\n“We are delighted to bring our long short strategy to an ASX-listed vehicle that seeks to provide investors with capital protection without sacrificing returns. The Company will provide investors with the opportunity to access our proven investment approach and rigorous stock research”.\n“We are a committed team, with extensive investment experience and are collectively investing more than $10 million alongside investors in the IPO.”\nDetails of the Offer\nThe Company is offering up to 250 million new shares at $2.00 per share, to raise $500 million, with the ability to accept an additional 50 million shares, representing $100 million, in oversubscriptions ( Offer ).
