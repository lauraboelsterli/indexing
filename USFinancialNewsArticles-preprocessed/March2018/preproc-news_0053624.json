    "text": "TRIPOLI (Reuters) - The mayor of Libya’s capital was abducted by unknown gunmen from his house overnight, Tripoli’s city council said on Thursday.\n“The municipality of central Tripoli and its residents received the news of the abduction of mayor Abdulraouf Hassan Baitelmal by a foolish party after they stormed his house by force of arms and took him to an unknown destination,” the municipal council said in a statement.\nThe reason for the abduction was not immediately clear.\nThe council said it was suspending work in protest until further notice, and called on “competent authorities and residents” to work to secure his release.\n“These acts directly threaten the establishment of the state and its civilian life,” the council said.\nGovernment officials in Tripoli say security in the capital has improved over the past two years, though abductions remain common.\nArmed groups have held real power on the ground in Tripoli since Libya’s 2011 uprising.\nReporting by Ahmed Elumami; Editing by Aidan Lewis and Gareth Jones\n ",
