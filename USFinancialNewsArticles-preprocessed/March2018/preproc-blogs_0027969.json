    "text": "United States: U.S. House panel probes corruption allegations at Puerto Rico utility March 13th, 2018 Americas \nThe U.S. House Natural Resources Committee on Monday issued a letter seeking answers to allegations of corruption at Puerto Rico’s beleaguered electric utility, including reports that some officials accepted bribes to restore power to exotic dance clubs ahead of schedule. \nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) has failed to restore power fully to the U.S. commonwealth’s 3.4 million residents since Hurricane Maria in late September knocked out power to the entire island, caused a complete collapse of the utility’s already decrepit electric infrastructure and killed dozens of people. As of early March, 12.5 percent of PREPA’s customers still did not have electricity, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. \n  reuters.com",
