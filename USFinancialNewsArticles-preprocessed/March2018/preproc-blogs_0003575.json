    "text": "Retail Report People keep mistaking the National Restaurant Association for the NRA Some people have mistaken the National Restaurant Association for the National Rifle Association because the two organizations share the same acronym. Sen. Tammy Duckworth took to Twitter to specify that a $50 donation she received from an employee at the NRA was from the National Restaurant Association. Duckworth, a veteran of the Iraq War and double amputee, has been a proponent of stronger gun control legislation. Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. \nPlanning to support or take a stand against the NRA? Better make sure you've got the right organization. \nWhile a number of people have made their opinions of the National Rifle Association known in the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, some have mistaken another group for the NRA because it shares the same acronym. \nSen. Tammy Duckworth took to Twitter in February to inform constituents that a $50 donation she received from an employee at the NRA was from the National Restaurant Association and not the National Rifle Association. @TammyforIL: It is not true that I received a $50 donation from the NRA. I received a donation from an employee of the National RESTAURANT Association, not the National Rifle Association \n\"Every once in a while this happens,\" said a National Restaurant Association spokeswoman. \nDuckworth, a veteran of the Iraq War and double amputee, became the director of the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs in 2006. In 2009, she was appointed to the post of assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs by President Barack Obama. \nShe went on to be elected to Congress in 2012. Four years later, she was elected to the Senate. \nLast year, Duckworth signed Sen. Dianne Feinstein 's gun control legislation that would ban a range of guns such as the AR-15 and ban bump stocks. \n\"The senator was never confused about which organization supported her,\" a spokesman for Tammy for Illinois, the senator's campaign, told CNBC.
