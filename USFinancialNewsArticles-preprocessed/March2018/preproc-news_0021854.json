    "text": "Get email alerts The Wall Street Journal Dow Chemical’s Andrew Liveris to depart next month as Jim Fitterling to be CEO of new Dow Published: Mar 12, 2018 7:59 a.m. ET Share \nLiveris’s long run culminated in last year’s merger with DuPont Getty Images Liveris, 63 years old, had said he would likely depart this year, but he had delayed the move once already and the advisory board of the materials-science company, to be known as Dow, hadn’t yet named a successor. \nBy David Benoit \nLongtime Dow Chemical Co. leader Andrew Liveris plans to step down next month, ending a nearly 14-year tenure that culminated with the chemical giant’s combination last year with rival DuPont Co. \nLiveris will relinquish the role of executive chairman of the combined company April 1, it announced Monday. Co-lead director Jeff Fettig will assume that role at the company, now known as DowDuPont Inc. DWDP, +2.34% and soon to be broken apart. \nLiveris lieutenant Jim Fitterling will be chief executive of the materials-science company that is expected to be created when the breakup takes place next year. \nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the news of the executive changes early Monday. \nDow’s board and Liveris had gone through a search process that involved Fitterling, 56, who is chief operating officer for the materials business, and Howard Ungerleider, DowDuPont’s chief financial officer, according to people familiar with the matter. The candidates, both of whom have spent their entire careers at Dow and held several roles, met with directors and made presentations in recent months, the people said. ",
