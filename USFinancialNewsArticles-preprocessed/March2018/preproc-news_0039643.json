    "text": "Stocks fell on Friday, adding to their steep weekly losses, as investors assess the possibility of a trade war brewing between the U.S. and China.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average dropped 132 points, while the Nasdaq composite fell more than 1 percent. The S&P 500 declined 0.9 percent.\nWeek to date, the Dow and S&P 500 are both down more than 4 percent, while the Nasdaq composite has fallen 5.3 percent.\n\"We think the outlook on stocks is pretty balanced,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \"While we think corporate earnings are intact, the market is going to have to digest some pretty meaty events like the midterm election as well as all the trade policy news.\"\nPresident Donald Trump pressed ahead with long-promised anti-China charges on Thursday. The U.S. president signed an executive memorandum that will impose tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports.\nIn response, China's commerce ministry proposed a list of 128 U.S. products as potential retaliation targets, according to a statement on its website posted Friday morning. Beijing's ministry said it will take measures against the 128 U.S. goods in two stages if it cannot reach an agreement with Washington, adding that it could also take legal action under World Trade Organization rules.\n\"The response from the Chinese was fairly muted,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"Because it was cautionary in tone, I think the market is looking for something more specific.\"\nChina's announcement sent stock futures lower overnight before they recovered. The news also comes after Dow lost more than 700 points in the previous session, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined more than 2 percent.\nBrendan McDermid | Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. \"The market has been priced for perfection ... and that leaves the market vulnerable to surprises. In this case, it's trade,\" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. \"We had that steep sell-down in February, which creates a lot of downside momentum and until that momentum is broken, it's still the driving force.\"\nStocks briefly bounded earlier on Friday after Trump said he signed the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill into law Friday, despite threatening to veto the legislation earlier in the day.\nTrump signed the bill, but made his distaste for the rushed process known.\n\"I will never sign a bill like this again,\" Trump said during a news conference. \"As a matter of national security, I've signed this omnibus bill.\"\nIn a tweet earlier in the day, Trump said: \"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"\nTweet\nIn corporate news, shares of Dow-component Nike rose 2 percent after the apparel company reported better-than-expected earnings. Nike got a boost from sales in Greater China, which rose 24 percent during the third quarter.\nCisco Systems gained 0.7 percent after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its \"conviction\" list, noting they see the stock as a defensive play in a volatile market .\nâ€”CNBC's Nyshka Chandran contributed to this report.",
