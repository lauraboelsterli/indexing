Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net FUTURES POINT TO LACKLUSTRE TRADING (0709 GMT) European stock futures have opened modestly higher this morning, with only slight gains pointing to muted trading as investors await U.S. CPI data. FTSE futures are lagging the rest, down 0.1 percent ahead of the Spring Statement at 1230 GMT. Here's SocGen's economists' take ahead of the statement: \"The OBR will present updated economic and (better) fiscal forecasts. Mr Hammondâ€™s speech will be very short, however, because he will only acknowledge and welcome the improved forecasts but will not make any policy changes.\" Policy tweaks will have to wait for the Autumn Budget. (Helen Reid) EARLY MORNING COMPANY HEADLINE ROUND-UP (0657 GMT) While U.S. inflation is likely to focus the attention of investors today, there's also a lot of company results with OMV, Iliad, Wacker Chemie and Geberit among the firms reporting. And RWE's promised its shareholders higher dividends after its deal to break up Innogy with E.ON. Here's a quick round-up of the morning company headlines so far: RWE pledges higher dividends after Innogy break-up deal Telecoms group Iliad dials up higher annual profits Austria's OMV aims to increase core profit by 70 pct by 2025 Wacker Chemie sees 2018 earnings growing faster than sales French bank Natixis buying into 3 M&A boutiques, bolsters China presence Geberit sees decent construction market in 2018 Under pressure, ING scraps plan to raise CEO pay (Helen Reid)",
