    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Pipeline Company filed an embargo of shipments of crude oil from the Choate Road Jct. in Harris County, Texas to Baytown, Harris County, according to a filing with U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday.\nThe embargo is effective Wednesday and is due to a temporary pressure reduction taken on the Webster to Baytown mainline that “necessitates additional assessment of the Choate Rd. injection point prior to reinstatement,” according to the filing.
