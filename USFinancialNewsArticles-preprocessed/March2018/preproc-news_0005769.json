    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On the heels of raising $5MM in Series A funding, Evelar Solar is investing in their executive team with the addition of Steve Roy as the chief strategy officer (CSO) and Jennifer Hurst as the director of marketing.\nThese two executive team positions will further develop Evelar’s unique technology driven strategy for customer acquisition and market expansion through non-traditional solar sales channels. Poised to become one of the largest technology companies in the solar industry, Evelar has developed a streamlined SaaS-based solution that instantly calculates a homeowner’s energy usage requirements and qualifies them as a viable solar candidate.\n“The experience that Steve Roy and Jennifer Hurst bring to Evelar is perfectly aligned with our growth goals,” said Spencer Angerbauer, president and CEO of Evelar. “The solar industry is ripe for a new sales model that is nationally scalable and having the right talent on our team will fuel our success.”\nRoy brings a wealth of experience in strategy development around customer experience, market expansion and building high-performing organizations. During his tenure with Utah Science Technology and Research (USTAR) he evaluated over 900 start-up companies and provided executive coaching, funding and pitch preparation and marketing analysis to propel innovative companies to market. More recently Roy re-engineered the customer experience process for Vivint Solar.\nHurst brings more than 25 years of marketing and public relations experience to Evelar. Her calculated approach to marketing brings together research, personas, messaging and multi-channel outreach to drive business success. During her career, she has worked in real estate, technology, bio-tech and energy industries with companies like Energy Solutions, MarqMetrix and Rio Tinto/Kennecott Land.\n“We see ourselves as a technology company that will advance the solar industry with a scalable platform,” said Spencer Angerbauer, CEO of Evelar Solar. “Ultimately, to be successful, solar companies need to provide a better customer experience during the process from bid to operation and provide technology to integrate with other devices in their home to manage energy usage. That’s where Evelar is differentiating itself.”\nEvelar is employing a growth model, much like Uber, where technology drives the business functions, minimizes overhead expenses and is scalable for rapid expansion. This model inherently drives a better customer experience as the elements in the process from customer acquisition to operation are seamlessly integrated. Further improving the customer experience and optimizing energy management, Evelar has an application for homeowners to monitor energy production and consumption and will develop integrations with today’s leading smart home technology devices, such as Google Home, Amazon Echo, NEST and others.\nAbout Evelar Solar\nEvelar is a highly-focused, rapidly scaling technology company utilizing their proprietary platform to revolutionize how customers, sales professionals, installers (EPCs), and finance partners collaborate and create value in the highly fragmented residential and commercial solar marketplaces. As a leading provider of residential and commercial solar solutions, Evelar is simplifying sustainable and renewable energy options for its customers.
