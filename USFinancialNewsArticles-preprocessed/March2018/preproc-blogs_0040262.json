    "text": "Updated 17 Hours Ago CNBC.com \nCanada Goose Holdings : \"I just reiterated [my call on] Goose last week when it dropped to $32. It made no sense after we met the family and talked about the quarter. I think it's good. Now, don't get greedy. This market is heavily influenced by the technicals. If it doesn't take out $38, I think it's going to drop back. But I do think Canada Goose is a good long-term hold.\" \nDollar Tree : \"No, no, no. Dollar General is the right one. Dollar Tree really did miss [on earnings]. They've been distracted by how bad Family Dollar is. They bit off too much to chew.\" \nHoneywell Intl : \"We've been telling ActionAlertsPlus.com club members [to] pull the trigger. Honeywell's right. Don't forget, [CEO] Darius Adamczyk is doing some nice moves, getting out value.\" \nMarathon Petroleum Corporation : \"That is the best-managed refiner there is and I continue to recommend it. Not walking away.\" \nZagg : \"The guy I really liked there, the CEO, he stepped down. He retired, and that was one of the problems with the company. And the quarter wasn't that great, either. I should've been more negative when I was asked about it last.\" Watch the full lightning round here: show chapters",
