    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has received information that an Exxon Mobil ship is heading towards the east Mediterranean for oil and gas exploration, President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman said on Wednesday, amid a row between Ankara and Cyprus on the issue.\nIbrahim Kalin told a news conference Ankara would continue to preserve its rights concerning hydrocarbon exploration in the region. Last month Turkish military maneuvers prevented a vessel charted by Italy’s state-controlled Eni reaching an area Cyprus has licensed for drilling.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Ece Toksabay; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
