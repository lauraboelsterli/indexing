    "text": "SARASOTA, Fla., March 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- International Consolidated Companies, Inc.(OTC:INCC), is happy to provide detail to the shareholders regarding the American Nutritional Products Inc. (“ANP”) Acquisition.\nAmerican Nutritional Products, Inc. certifications\nINCC is proud to be moving forward with acquiring ANP., a Carson City, Nevada nutraceutical manufacturer. Owned by the former owners of Vitamin Research Products (“VRP”), Rob and Maria Watson built the NSF cGMP Organic 55 thousand square foot facility to house the VRP and Complementary Prescriptions (“CP”) physician’s brands. Combined they have over 50 plus years of industry experience. In 2010 they sold the brands with revenues exceeding $25 million with the highest retention rate the buyers had ever seen (80 plus percent).\nIn 2016 after the buyers failed and vacated the building, Maria Watson made the decision to \"start over\".\nA little background on Maria. Tragically in 1987 Maria Watson lost her 3-year-old son Joshua to a drunk driver. After three years of horrific depression she was introduced to an amino acid formula, which changed her life and put her on a mission to help others. She immersed herself in research, learning everything she could about nutrients and their effects on the mind and body. For Maria, this is a passion NOT a job!\nRob was ready to retire … Maria lasted three weeks in retirement! Unable to sit still she accepted a 2 year position as CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) for Neogenis now Human N and was part of the team that created “SuperBeets”.\nThe facility outfitted with breakthrough technologies, cutting-edge tools, and the original team of formulators was regrouped and was ready with the name “American Nutritional Products Inc.”.\nANP capabilities include contract manufacturing and co packing of:\nPowders; Capsules; Creams Lotions; Liquids; Tinctures; Vape oils\nThis acquisition will provide Vertical integration between the BluDog brand and manufacturing.\nhttp://www.anp-nv.com/about/\nIn addition to www.BluDogProducts.com INCC will own, post acquisition, the following brands:\nhttps://www.perfectvitaminproducts.com/\nhttps://www.scientifichealthsolutions.com/\nhttps://www.fullspectrumhemp.com/\n“We are excited about integrating and acquiring more nutraceutical co-packers as we venture off into a traditional roll up. Between the economies of scale and the natural symbiosis of our brands and manufacturing I believe we have a real tiger by the tail!” said Antonio Uccello, CEO BluDog Products LLC.\nBluDog Products is strategically introducing a water-soluble CBD oil super food and wellness drinks (with an extended release formulation) that are easily absorbed. Using a licensed, patented CBD delivery system BluDog’s CBD products are an alternative over-the-counter therapeutic option to help relieve post-sports inﬂammation as well as promote relaxation and well-being. BluDog’s CBD products interact naturally with the body’s anti-inﬂammatory system without any known side eﬀects.\nInternational Consolidated Companies (INCC) was founded in 2002. INCC is focused on acquiring and growing businesses that offer innovation, quality, and cost-efficient Cannabis technologies.\nForward-looking disclaimer\nThis press release may contain certain forward-looking statements and information, as defined within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the Safe Harbor created by those sections.
