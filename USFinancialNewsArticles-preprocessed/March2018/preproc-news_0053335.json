    "text": "Amber Road's Board Has Not Engaged in Discussions Despite Significant Premium\nAUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- E2open, a leading cloud supply chain management software company, announced today that it has withdrawn its proposal to the Board of Directors of Amber Road (NYSE: AMBR) (“Amber Road”) to engage in discussions regarding E2open's acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Amber Road for $10.50 per share in cash. The proposal represented a significant premium of more than 50% over Amber Road’s unaffected stock price on February 9, 2018.\n“We are extremely disappointed by the lack of engagement from Amber Road’s Board of Directors in connection with several of our proposals to engage in discussions regarding a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Amber Road for cash at the proposed price of $10.50 per share,” said Michael Farlekas, President and Chief Executive Officer of E2open. “Despite our repeated outreach, Amber Road's Board has refused to engage in any dialogue with E2open to discuss a potential transaction.”\nMr. Farlekas continued, “A combination of E2open and Amber Road would benefit both companies and their customers and would provide Amber Road’s shareholders with a significant and immediate cash premium to the company's market value. However, despite our clear commitment to engaging in a dialogue regarding a potential transaction and our conviction in a successful combination, there has not been any meaningful engagement by Amber Road’s Board of Directors. E2open is left with no other choice but to withdraw our offer to discuss a combination.”\nAdditional Information\nThis communication is for informational purposes only and is not intended to, and does not, constitute an offer to buy, or solicitation of an offer to sell, any securities, a solicitation of a proxy or a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, prospectus or other filing or document that E2open and/or Amber Road may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with a potential transaction involving the two companies.
