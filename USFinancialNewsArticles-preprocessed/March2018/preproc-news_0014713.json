    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The CFP Board Center for Financial Planning today announced that AssetMark, Inc. will support its work as a Chairs Circle Sponsor.\n\"The Center's work to address critical challenges facing the financial planning profession requires the collective resources from stakeholders across the profession,\" said Marilyn Mohrman-Gillis, Executive Director of the CFP Board Center for Financial Planning. \"We are grateful to AssetMark for sharing in our vision and for their generous contribution of expertise, thought leadership and financial support for initiatives that will diversify and sustain the workforce.\"\nCharlie Fitzgerald, III, CFP®, member of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. Board of Directors and the Center's Campaign Development Committee, attended AssetMark's Gold Forum in Orlando, Florida on Friday to accept the donation on behalf of the CFP Board Center for Financial Planning.\nAssetMark's giving commitment of $250,000 over five years aligns with the Center's mission to create a more diverse and sustainable financial planning profession so that every American has access to competent and ethical financial planning. The Center is convening the profession in researched-based initiatives to address the many challenges facing the financial planning profession, including an aging workforce that does not reflect the diversity of the public that it serves and a shortage of qualified faculty to teach and inspire the next generation of financial planning professionals.\n\"All of us at AssetMark are extremely excited to contribute to the Center's work. Enhancing diversity in our industry is critical as advisors begin to serve a new generation of investors, and doing so by teaching the next generation of advisors from all backgrounds and experiences is a major opportunity for all of us,\" said Charles Goldman, President and CEO of AssetMark. \"We are thrilled to partner with the Center because they have a plan that will move us toward a more diverse advisor workforce.\"\nAssetMark Chief Solutions Officer Natalie Wolfsen sits on the Center's Workforce Development Advisory Group and helps guide initiatives and communications that foster greater diversity in the industry. AssetMark also plans to expand its support beyond a monetary donation to encourage younger and more diverse individuals to consider a career as an independent financial advisor.\nTo learn more and support the Center's initiatives, visit www.CenterforFinancialPlanning.org . The work of the Center is also made possible through Center sponsors, including Lead Founding Sponsor TD Ameritrade Institutional and Founding Sponsor Northwestern Mutual.\nABOUT ASSETMARK, INC.\nAssetMark, Inc. is a leading independent provider of innovative investment and consulting solutions serving financial advisors.
