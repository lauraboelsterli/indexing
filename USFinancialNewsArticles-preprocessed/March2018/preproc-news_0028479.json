    "text": "LONDON and DUBLIN, Ireland, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Advanced Discovery , a leading global eDiscovery and risk management company, today announces the launch of its Irish practice with the opening of a Dublin-based office and data centre, as well as the appointment of Greg Deane as Advanced Discovery Ireland’s regional director.\nPrior to joining Advanced Discovery (formerly known as Millnet in the UK and Ireland), Deane spent 15 years working in some of Ireland’s leading law firms. Most recently, as head of eDiscovery and data management services at William Fry, Deane was responsible for building and overseeing the firm’s data management unit. His team assisted with a variety of projects such as due diligence exercises, regulatory investigations, discovery and data subject access requests.\n“Greg’s understanding of the Irish legal market will be key in taking our business forward to meet the new challenges of the evolving commercial and legal landscape in Europe,” says Julia Chain, UK managing director and executive VP, International of Advanced Discovery. “Our new practice in Ireland will further enhance our ability to serve clients with complex multijurisdictional and multinational issues. As Brexit looms ever closer, we are delighted to be investing in Ireland with its stable presence within the EU.”\n“I am excited at the prospect of establishing Advanced Discovery as a leader in eDiscovery and risk management in the Irish market. Our new Dublin-based office and ISO-certified data centre, patented solutions and teams of expert advisors will all benefit our Irish and growing roster of global clients as their eDiscovery and risk management requirements continue to expand,” says Deane. “As complexity increases, particularly with the advent of the GDPR, knowing what data you have and where it is stored is becoming increasingly important.
