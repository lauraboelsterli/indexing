    "text": "RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif., Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMPH) announced that the Company will release results for its fourth quarter of 2017 ended December 31, 2017, after the market closes on Monday, March 12, 2018, and will hold a conference call to discuss its financial results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.\nTo access the conference call, dial toll free (877) 881-2595, or (315) 625-3083 for international callers, five minutes before the conference. The passcode for the conference call is 7299298.\nThe call can also be accessed on the Investors page on the Company’s website www.amphastar.com .\nAmphastar is a specialty pharmaceutical company that primarily develops, manufactures, markets, and sells generic and proprietary injectable and inhalation products, including products with high technical barriers to market entry. Most of the Company’s products are used in hospital or urgent care clinical settings and are primarily contracted and distributed through group purchasing organizations and drug wholesalers.\nAll statements in this press release and in the conference call referenced above that are not historical are forward-looking statements, including, among other things, statements relating to the Company’s expectations regarding future financial performance, backlog, sales and marketing of its products, market size and growth, the timing of FDA filings or approvals, acquisitions and other matters related to its pipeline of product candidates, the timing for completion of construction at the Company’s IMS facility, its share buyback program and other future events. These statements are not historical facts but rather are based on Amphastar’s historical performance and its current expectations, estimates, and projections regarding Amphastar’s business, operations and other similar or related factors. Words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “believe,” “estimate,” and other similar or related expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult or impossible to predict and, in some cases, beyond Amphastar’s control. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described in Amphastar’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nContact:\nWilliam J. Peters\nChief Financial Officer\n(909) 980-9484\nSource:Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
