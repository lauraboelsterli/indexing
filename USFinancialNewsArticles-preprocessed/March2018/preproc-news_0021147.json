    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cryoport, Inc. (NASDAQ: CYRX) (NASDAQ: CYRXW) (\"Cryoport\" or the \"Company\"), the global leader in temperature-controlled logistics dedicated to the life sciences industry, today announced financial results for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017.\nJerrell Shelton, Chief Executive Officer of Cryoport, commented, \"2017 was an inflection point for our Company, as strong momentum in the biopharma market drove a year-over-year total revenue growth of 56%. We improved systems, added 'strength to our bench' of personnel and entered into long-term commercial logistics agreements supporting Gilead's Kite Pharma (Yescarta TM ) and Novartis (Kymriah TM ), the first FDA-approved CAR-T therapies to be commercialized. We believe our agreements supporting these first-to-market, high-profile and ground-breaking immunotherapies further cement our market leading position and reputation in the global biopharma market. As Kymriah™ and Yescarta™ are ramped to full commercialization, they are expected to drive significant revenue growth for Cryoport as commercial demand for these therapies is answered and accelerates.\n\"Cryoport's biopharma revenue increased 63%, contributing 76% of total revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, with clinical and early stage commercial programs providing the primary catalysts for our rapid expansion. In 2017, we reported a net increase of 85 clinical trials that we support as many of the industry's leading and most innovative biopharma companies have integrated our unrivalled cold-chain logistics solutions into their collection and distribution processes and consider Cryoport's logistics solutions to be essential to their cell-based regenerative immunotherapies such as CAR T-cell therapies and other regenerative therapies such as allogenic stem cell therapies.\n\"The regenerative medicine market continues to generate increased investment, with $7.5 billion raised in 2017, compared with $4.2 Billion in 2016, according to The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM) located in Washington, DC. Furthermore, we anticipate the potential of an additional 5-7 Cryoport supported new BLA/EMA filings in the next 12 months, increasing from our previous estimate of 2-4. We, therefore, expect Cryoport's position as the logistical backbone of the regenerative medicine industry to strengthen, accelerate and grow in both the near and long-term.\n\"Our technologically advanced logistics solutions and first-in-class reputation across the life sciences industry also drove new client agreements and improved revenue growth in our animal health and reproductive medicine markets throughout the year. In the fourth quarter of 2017, our 62% revenue growth in the animal health market compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily driven by a new client headquartered in Germany. In reproductive medicine, our United States market remains robust and, as a matter of priority, for the present, we continue to direct our sales and marketing efforts for our Cryostork SM solutions toward U.S. clients. Both animal health and reproductive medicine are consistent and growing sources of revenue and we plan to continue to expand our footprint in these markets throughout 2018,\" concluded Mr. Shelton.\nMarket Highlights:\nBiopharma\nBiopharma revenue increased by 72% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016; for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, biopharma revenue increased 63% compared to the same period in 2016. 85 new biopharma trials were added in the twelve-months ended December 31, 2017, and 19 new biopharma trials in the fourth quarter of 2017.

These financial measures are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In evaluating the Company's performance, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial statements prepared under GAAP. Management believes the following non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted EBITDA, to provide a useful measure of the Company's operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company's ongoing operating performance. Further, management and the Board of Directors utilize these non-GAAP financial measures to gain a better understanding of the Company's comparative operating performance from period-to-period and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financials, are useful to investors because they provide a basis for meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's ongoing operating results, including results of operations, against investor and analyst financial models, identifying trends in the Company's underlying business and performing related trend analyses, and they provide a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company's underlying business.\nCryoport Inc. and Subsidiaries\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\nNine Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n2016\nGAAP net loss\n$ (2,269,669)\n$ (4,283,854)\n$ (7,899,001)\n$ (13,113,220)\n$ (10,403,036)\nNon-GAAP adjustments to net loss:\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n172,851\n102,681\n664,831\n374,202\n301,297\nInterest expense\n-\n17,675\n15,693\n139,416\n58,222\nStock-based compensation expense\n1,017,923\n780,010\n3,547,781\n3,117,946\n2,329,003\nWarrant repricing expense\n-\n2,265,434\n-\n4,195,252\n4,195,252\nIncome taxes\n(912)\n311\n5,143\n5,673\n5,673\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ (1,079,807)\n$ (1,117,743)\n$ (3,665,553)\n$ (5,280,731)\n$ (3,513,589)\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cryoport-reports-56-revenue-growth-for-fiscal-year-ended-december-31-2017-300609361.html\nSOURCE Cryoport, Inc.",
