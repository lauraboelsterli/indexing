    "text": "Trump’s Opioid Battle Plan Includes Seeking More Death-Penalty Prosecutions \nMarch 18, 2018 7:05 p.m. ET \nPresident \nDonald Trump \non Monday will call for new steps to combat the opioid epidemic, including a push to reduce opioid prescriptions by a third over three years, asking the Justice Department to seek more death-penalty cases against drug traffickers under current law, and for federal support to expand the availability of overdose-reversal medication. \nThe proposals will come in a speech in the hard-hit state of New Hampshire. They form part of a broader blueprint by Mr. Trump, which senior White House officials on Sunday described as seeking to deploy education, law enforcement and treatment to try to reverse abuse of particularly addictive drugs that claim the lives of more than 100 people a day in the U.S. \nOther elements of the strategy, the White House said, would include a fresh public-awareness campaign about drug abuse, a research-and-development partnership between the National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies into opioid prescription alternatives, tougher sentences for fentanyl traffickers, and screening of all prison inmates for opioid addiction. \nBut it is the death penalty proposal that is likely to dominate discussion of the package. \n“The Department of Justice will seek the death penalty against drug traffickers when it’s appropriate under current law,” said \nAndrew Bremberg, \nthe president’s top domestic-policy adviser. \nSenior White House officials referred specific questions about the death-penalty stance to the Justice Department but emphasized that the administration was seeking to use current law rather than call for a new federal statute. \nA 1988 federal law imposes the death penalty on drug “kingpins” who commit murder in the course of their business. Some legal analysts say that it has resulted in dozens of sentences but few executions since then. \nJohn Blume, \na law professor at Cornell Law School and director of its death-penalty project, said the statute as enforced to date typically has ensnared “mid- to low-level drug dealers…None of them were really objectively the people they said they were going to get.” \nIn October, surrounded by addicts and their families, Mr. Trump declared addiction to the powerful prescription drugs and use of fentanyl and heroin a “public health emergency.” That designation was renewed after 90 days, a senior White House official said Sunday, and remains in effect. \nIt doesn’t require Congress to appropriate funds to tackle the emergency, and some Democrats, in particular, have accused Mr. Trump of failing to lead in expanding access to treatment. The White House has said it wants to see Congress agree to funding for treatment, and senior White House officials said Sunday that they would continue to work with lawmakers to allocate additional money in the coming government spending bill. \nThe October event was twinned with an announcement that the administration would allow states to waive a rule that effectively prevented hospitals and treatment centers from maintaining more than 16 psychiatric beds at a time. The White House said Sunday that Mr. Trump in New Hampshire also would call on Congress to fully repeal the rule. \nIn November, a presidential commission headed by Mr. Trump’s one-time political rival for the Republican presidential nomination, \nformer Gov. Chris Christie \nof New Jersey, issued a 56-recommendation report that included calls for the federal government to set up drug courts across the U.S., retrain medical prescribers on opioid use and reduce incentives for doctors to offer the powerful painkillers. It also called for engaging with states to expand access to naloxone, an overdose-reversal drug. \nThe administration accepts all 56 recommendations , a senior White House official said Sunday. \nAt a brief appearance at a White House summit on opioids earlier this month, Mr. Trump openly mused that other countries allow the death penalty for drug trafficking and that he believed they had less of a drug problem as a result. He said that translated into a need for more “strength.” \nHe offered few further details, saying only that he also wanted to see the federal government bring legal action against opioid manufacturers, because “if the states are doing it, why isn’t the federal government doing it?” \nSuch remarks had sparked speculation that Mr. Trump would seek a new death penalty for drug trafficking, and with it, a revived debate about the permissibility of such laws under the constitutional amendment prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. \nThe Supreme Court has rejected capital punishment for crimes such as child rape in recent years and has taken a narrower view of arguments that seek to execute people for indirectly causing deaths through criminal actions. \n“You do have murder convictions for repetitive drunk drivers, but you don’t have death penalties for them,” said \nFrank Zimring, \na University of California, Berkeley professor of criminal law and criminology. “It would be an extraordinary change in the boundaries of the Eighth Amendment.” \nWrite to Louise Radnofsky at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT",
