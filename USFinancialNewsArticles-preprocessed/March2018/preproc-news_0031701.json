It states that she would be obligated to pay Trump directly—not Essential Consultants LLC, the limited liability company Cohen used as a conduit to pay her—for damages if she breached the contract. Clifford sued Trump and Essential Consultants in Los Angeles County Superior Court earlier this month in an attempt to invalidate the agreement. \nRead the full version of this article at WSJ.com.
