    "text": "LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Britain does not recognise the European Union’s estimate of the amount of customs duties lost to fraud that the bloc has said the UK should pay, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday.\nThe European Commission has demanded that Britain pay 2.7 billion euros ($3.35 billion) of customs duties that should have been collected on imports of Chinese footwear and textiles but were not due to fraud.\n“We do not recognise the European Commission’s estimate of alleged duty loss,” the spokesman told reporters. “We believe the methodology used overestimates UK import values and is not suitable to produce an estimate of alleged customs duty undervaluation.” (Reporting by William James; writing by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
