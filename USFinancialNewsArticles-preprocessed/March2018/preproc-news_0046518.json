    "text": "1 COMMENTS How would you go about writing a history of religion in the modern United States? The obvious starting point would be the various religions that people identify with: Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Scientology and Prefer Not To Say. You could quantify Roman Catholics and Protestants, or regular and irregular churchgoers, with some nice clear pie charts. You could talk about the quiddities of the religious groups, each with its own forms of communal worship, dietary laws, marriage rituals and ethical teachings, more or less rigorously observed. The accent would lie on organizations—“churches”—and the communities that they create around them; collective rituals would tend to have a single, clear meaning (“giving thanks for the blessing of the harvest”).\nOr, instead, you could choose to start from the rich, chaotic mishmash of practices and rituals that make up most people’s day-to-day religious experiences. My religious life might include formal daily prayer; but it might also include reading newspaper horoscopes, yoga, charitable giving, putting flowers on relatives’ graves, erecting a fir-tree totem pole in my living room in mid-December, knocking on wood, dressing as a witch for Halloween, or making a wish while blowing out candles on my birthday cake. My own reasons for attending synagogue might be profoundly meaningful to me—loyalty to my wife, dealing with personal grief, an instruction in a dream—while bearing no relation whatsoever to the ritual’s official “meaning.”\nTwenty years ago, ancient Roman religion was usually seen as a quintessentially collective or “civic” affair. Most books on Roman religion concentrated on the bewildering variety of formal and informal cults that existed at Rome around the turn of the Christian era: mass state cults such as those of Jupiter Optimus Maximus or the deified emperor; “foreign” or local cults associated with particular ethnic groups (Judaism is the classic example); and weird and wacky elective cults such as those of Isis or Mithras or Christ, which laid a particular emphasis on the personal religious commitment of the worshiper but which still had communal worship and identity firmly at their heart.\nPantheon By Jörg Rüpke\nPrinceton, 551 pages, $39.95\nThis picture of Roman religion as an eminently social phenomenon, structured around mass collective rituals (especially animal sacrifice), has a lot to recommend it. Above all, it has helped us come to terms with the remarkably limited role that “faith” seems to have played in Roman religion. Romans could unhesitatingly worship the living emperor without necessarily ascribing to him any supernatural powers, because what mattered was the correct performance of collective public rites, not the private convictions of the individual worshiper. The universal observance of Christmas is not a bad analogy: Skepticism about the Nativity doesn’t stop atheists exchanging Christmas presents.\nJörg Rüpke’s “Pantheon” is subtitled “A New History of Roman Religion,” and for once the word “New” is well merited. Mr. Rüpke, a German scholar of immense learning and intelligence, has no truck with this collectivist, ritualist approach to Roman religion. It is true that most of our surviving evidence for Roman religion—poetry and philosophy written by elites, huge marble temples, public inscriptions on stone—relates to mass civic cults. But for Mr. Rüpke this shows only that civic religion tended to leave a larger footprint behind it, not that it was the most significant element of people’s religious experience. Think of modern spirituality groups that possess no distinctive architecture, religious artifacts or sacred texts; to the future archaeologist of 21st-century America, this entire strand of religious behavior will be completely invisible.\nInstead, Mr. Rüpke’s aim is to reconstruct individual Romans’ personal experience of the divine in their daily lives—what he calls “lived religion.” His huge book contains almost nothing on the traditional Roman pantheon (Jupiter, Minerva, Diana and the rest) and little on the great Roman civic festivals. “Ritual experience,” he argues, “took place most often in the close familial context of the apartment or house and the tomb.” “Pantheon” takes us into this intimate world of everyday Roman piety as never before.\nThe book is organized in roughly chronological order, but this is far from a conventional narrative history. Most chapters range over long periods of time (three or four centuries), from which material is cherry-picked at will. Mr. Rüpke singles out the reign of the emperor Augustus (27 B.C. to A.D. 14) as a crucial “saddle period,” during which a vast range of religious practices that had previously served as arenas for aristocratic competition—temple building, holding games or triumphs, introducing new cults—were appropriated by Augustus as his own personal monopolies.\nA still more crucial transition came in the third and fourth centuries A.D. The early Roman Empire was a world in which religious authority was widely dispersed: Freelance religious entrepreneurs abounded (astrologers, diviners, healers), and individuals and small groups were essentially free to pursue whatever forms of religiosity appealed most (worship of Mithras, dice oracles, even monotheism of one kind or another). The distinctiveness of late Roman Christianity—or so Mr. Rüpke argues, in one of the most bravura and unexpected passages of the book—lay in its character as a religion dominated by intellectuals, who claimed (as earlier Roman priests never had) the right to regulate all aspects of worshipers’ religious activity. Hence worshipers ended up “belonging” to the Christian church as no one had ever “belonged” to any single Roman cult. With the birth of this radical idea—that there are several different and distinct “religions” and that each person has one religion and one only—the pluralist Roman conception of religious activity was at an end.\nAll this is tremendously good stuff. Unfortunately, Mr. Rüpke makes few concessions to the nonspecialist reader, as even the blurbs on the back cover rather nervously acknowledge (“strikingly ambitious . . . vast erudition . . . uniquely engaged”). His prose (in David M.B. Richardson’s translation) is not, I fear, fleet of foot: “If under normal circumstances we perceive objects as special only by virtue of their extraordinary forms or materials, that is to say as a reflection of the exceptional financial means and perhaps cultural contacts of their donor, we must nevertheless assume that individuation, or the subjectification of the individual, always occurred in specific contexts, in accord with a particular individual’s acquired degree of sensibility in dealing with objects.”\n“Pantheon” also assumes a high level of specialist knowledge. Fraudulent visionaries were, Mr. Rüpke tells us, widespread in the Roman world: “Lucian, Celsus, and those who understood Montanus and his female acolytes as prophets (naturally, false ones) were in agreement about the frequency of such phenomena: religious authority, in both textual and personal form, was apparently easily obtained: perhaps not more easily than before, but by people from different social milieus.” The argument here is in fact perfectly sensible; but unless you already know a fair bit about the false prophet Alexander of Abonoteichus, Origen’s “Contra Celsum” and ancient critics of the Montanist heresy (and, frankly, why should you?), the sentence is simply gibberish.\nThis is a real pity, because “Pantheon” is a genuinely fascinating and innovative book that proposes a radically new way of thinking about individual religious experience in the Roman world. If you don’t mind having Wikipedia permanently open beside you while you read, and are able to stomach pedantic circumlocutions (our “gods” are Mr. Rüpke’s “not indisputably plausible actors”), then I recommend this book to you most warmly. A laborious climb, to be sure; but a tremendous view.\n—Mr. Thonemann is the author of “The Hellenistic Age.”",
