    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish financial services group Unlu & Co plans to sign M&A consultancy deals worth around $2 billion in the first half, with one of the deals worth $1 billion, its chairman Mahmut Unlu told Reuters.\nHe said he expected initial public offerings in Turkey this year to amount to $3 billion, one of the highest ever levels.\n“I think we will sign three or four M&A transactions in the first half of the year. One of them will have a volume of $1 billion,” Unlu said in an interview conducted on Wednesday.\nThe deals by Unlu & Co, which provides investment banking and asset management services, will be notably in infrastructure and consumption sectors, he added.\nReporting by Ebru Tuncay; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by Ece Toksabay\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
