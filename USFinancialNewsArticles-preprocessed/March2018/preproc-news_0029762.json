(NASDAQ: FTEK) , a world leader in advanced engineering solutions for the optimization of combustion systems and emissions control in utility and industrial applications, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter (“Q4 2017”) and full year (“FY 2017”) ended December 31, 2017.\nQ4 Operating Profit; Achieved Performance Targets for Second Half of 2017\n“We returned to operating profitability in Q4 2017 - our first operating profit since Q3 2014 - and reported our second consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA,” said Vincent J. Arnone, Chairman, President and CEO of Fuel Tech. “We also achieved our performance targets for the second half of 2017 when compared to the first six months of the year. For the second half of 2017, revenues increased by 48% in comparison to the prior year primarily reflecting the ongoing conversion of $36 million of new orders announced during 2017. SG&A declined 11.7% to $9.8 million, the result of our previously announced cost-containment initiatives that, in total, have removed approximately $19 million of costs (excluding one-time charges) for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017. We expect to realize the full benefit of this $19 million cost reduction in 2018.\n“We ended the year with a capital projects backlog of $22.1 million, up $14.1 million from backlog of $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. Our total cash position (including restricted cash) of $14.4 million at December 31, 2017 increased by $1.8 million as compared to June 30, 2017 and our long-term debt remained at zero.”\n2018 Outlook\nMr. Arnone continued, “We expect continuing operational improvement in 2018, based on the success of our cost reduction initiatives, our year-end backlog, and business development activities and pipeline. For 2018, we expect higher total revenues, driven primarily our Air Pollution Control (“APC”) business. We also expect to operate profitably and generate positive cash flow due, in large measure, to our lower cost structure.”\nHe continued, “We are also committed to capitalizing on all relevant opportunities for our base businesses, and expanding our product portfolio into new verticals and potential growth markets. To this end, and as previously announced, we have expanded our mission to include environmental solutions focused on water by entering into an exclusive license agreement with NanO2 LLC (“NanO2”) to market and sell NanO2’s dissolved gas technology. We are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities associated with the application of this technology in the water and wastewater industries.”\nQ4 2017 Results Overview\nConsolidated revenues rose 39.9% $13.4 million from $9.6 million in Q4 2016, reflecting the timing of project execution due to the conversion of previously announced new orders during the first half of 2017.\nSG&A expenses declined 16.5% to $4.9 million from $5.8 million in Q4 2016, reflecting the impact of ongoing cost containment initiatives.\nOperating income from continuing operations for Q4 2017 was $448,000, a significant improvement from an operating loss of $6.4 million in Q4 2016 which included an intangible assets impairment charge of $2.1 million.\nNet income from continuing operations was $470,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $8.5 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in Q4 2016.\nNet loss for Q4 2017 was $1.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $9.1 million, or $0.39 per share, in Q4 2016. Net loss in Q4 2017 included a loss from discontinued operations of $1.7 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily reflecting a $1.3 million impairment of an intangible asset and severance costs associated with the previously announced suspension of the Company’s Fuel Conversion initiative.\nNet loss in Q4 2016 included the above referenced intangible assets impairment charge of $2.1 million, income tax expense of $1.9 million primarily associated with the establishment of a full valuation reserve for China deferred tax assets, and a loss from discontinued operations of $0.7 million.\nAPC segment revenues in Q4 2017 rose by 89.7% to $9.5 million from $5.0 million in Q4 2016. Although the challenging operating environment for coal-fired utility and industrial plants remains, the pace of U.S. bookings increased considerably during 2017 as compared to historical levels. APC gross margin was $3.8 million, or 39.9%, as compared to $0.3 million, or 6.5%, in Q4 2016. APC gross margin in Q4 2016 included charges totaling $0.8 million consisting of $0.6 million related to a sub-contractor dispute and a non-cash excess and obsolete inventory reserve of $0.2 million; exclusive of these charges, APC gross margin in Q4 2016 would have been $1.1 million, or 23%.\nFUEL CHEM segment revenues decreased to $3.9 million during Q4 2017 from $4.6 million during Q4 2016, with gross margin of 47.2% as compared to 33.4% for the same period last year. Gross margin in Q4 2016 included the impact of the above-referenced inventory reserve of $0.6 million; excluding this impact, gross margin for Q4 2016 would have been 46%. This segment will likely continue to be affected by a reduction in electricity demand from coal-fired combustion units and low natural gas prices, which leads to fuel switching, unscheduled outages, and combustion units operating at less than capacity.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses for Q4 2017 and Q4 2016 were $0.3 million, respectively, which supports our continued development of new products.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Q4 2017 was $559,000 as compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.8 million for Q4 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $14.4 million, which included restricted cash of $6.0 million. Shareholders’ equity was $34.3 million, or $1.44 per share, and the Company had zero long-term debt.\nFY 2017 Results Overview\nConsolidated revenues for FY 2017 were $45.2 million as compared to $55.2 million in 2016, due primarily to the reasons cited above related to the FUEL CHEM segment revenues and overall decline in the APC segment revenues due to timing of business activity and project execution primarily due to the low backlog of $8.0 million at December 31, 2016.\nSG&A expenses for FY 2017 declined by 18.1% to $20.9 million from $25.6 million in FY 2016. On a total dollar basis, SG&A for FY 2017 decreased by $4.6 million from FY 2016 attributable to organizational actions taken in both 2016 and 2017.\nFor FY 2017, R&D expenses were $1.1 million compared to $1.8 million FY 2016, with the decline attributable to organizational actions taken in both 2016 and 2017.\nOperating loss from continuing operations was $7.1 million as compared to an operating loss of $12.0 million in 2016.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $7.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $14.6 million, or $0.62 per diluted share in FY 2016. Net loss was $11.0 million, or $0.46 per share, as compared to a net loss of $17.4 million, or $0.74 per share.\nLosses for FY 2017 included a $3.0 million building impairment charge, while losses in FY 2016 included a $1.4 million restructuring charge, $2.1 million intangible assets impairment charge, and income tax expense of $1.7 million.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on Tuesday, March 13, 2018 at 10:00 am ET / 9:00 am CT to discuss the results and business activities.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest income, income tax expense, depreciation expense, amortization expense, non-cash impairment charges, and stock compensation expense. The Company's reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP standards, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and ability to generate cash flow, which we believe is a meaningful measure for our investor and analyst communities. In many cases non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by these individuals to evaluate Company performance and ultimately determine a reasonable valuation for our common stock. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure of net income (loss) has been included in the financial table above.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180312006119/en/\nFuel Tech, Inc.\nJim Pach, 630-845-4500\nPrincipal Financial Officer\nor\nThe Equity Group Inc.\nDevin Sullivan, 212-836-9608\nSenior Vice President\nSource: Fuel Tech, Inc.",
