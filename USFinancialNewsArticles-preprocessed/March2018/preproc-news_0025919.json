    "text": "DALLAS, March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- GEX Management, Inc. (OTCQB: GXXM), a visionary management and professional services company announced that in a specially-held meeting, and in accordance with the company's governing documents, the Board of Directors has voted to separate the roles of CEO and president. Chelsea Christopherson was elected and now serves as President and COO of GEX Management. This decision allows Carl Dorvil to more exclusively devote his attention to his role as CEO.\nCFO Clayton Carter stated, \"The client growth we are seeing and the potential partnerships we are evaluating across the U.S. precipitate this decision.\"\nIn light of recent advances, the Board began to recognize months ago that it is in the best interest of the company to expand its structure by separating the roles of CEO and President. CEO Carl Dorvil stated, \"This move is in concert with my vision and will allow me to further develop strategic partnerships and leverage key opportunities for the purpose of increasing shareholder value. When we met as a Board, Chelsea Christopherson was the clear choice for the position by virtue of her proven track record of leadership, execution, and commitment over the course of many years within the company.\"\nAbout GEX Management\nGEX Management, Inc. is a licensed Professional Employer Organization (PEO) and a Professional Services Company providing comprehensive back office services to clients including HR, Payroll, Risk & Compliance, and Executive Consulting, and provides progressive and complete solutions for employee management and operational needs. http: www.gexmanagement.com\nInformation on Forward Looking Statements\nThe statements contained herein that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws (Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
