    "text": "CHICAGO, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Monroe Capital Corporation (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:MRCC) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a distribution of $0.35 per share for the first quarter of 2018, payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 16, 2018. The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of distributions on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash prior to the record date. As a result, when the Company declares a cash distribution, stockholders who have not opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan prior to the record date will have their distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s capital stock. The specific tax characteristics of the distribution will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year and in the Company’s periodic report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nABOUT MONROE CAPITAL CORPORATION\nMonroe Capital Corporation is a publicly-traded specialty finance company that principally invests in senior, unitranche and junior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, unsecured debt and equity investments in middle-market companies.
