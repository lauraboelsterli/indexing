    "text": "REVENUE UP 10.5% TO €3,138M EBITDA UP 15.4% TO €548M 20.5% INCREASE IN THE REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO TO €5.0 BILLION\nSTRONG NETWORK GROWTH OVER THE YEAR: 9,556 NEW BEDS\nNETWORK OF 86,650 BEDS AT 818 FACILITIES IN 12 COUNTRIES\nPUTEAUX, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nThe ORPEA group (Paris:ORP), a world leader in long-term care (nursing homes, post-acute and rehabilitation hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and homecare services), today announce its consolidated results 1 for the financial year to 31 December 2017, as approved by the Board of Directors held on 27 March 2018.\nYves Le Masne, Chief Executive Officer of ORPEA, commented :\n“2017 saw a new acceleration in the international expansion of ORPEA, as we established a base in Brazil and Portugal and continued our value-creating developments. Nearly 10,000 additional beds have been added to our network since the end of 2016, of which 60% by Greenfields\nThanks to our loyal teams, our high-quality model and our organisation, we have achieved this impressive momentum on the development front while delivering a brisk increase in our profitability and a stronger balance sheet, with:\nour EBITDA margin rising 80 basis points the size of our real estate portfolio growing by €845m to €5 billion our debt ratios improving.\nWe have demonstrated our willingness to become a world leader in long-term care, while generating strong profitability and maintaining a high level of financial flexibility. Over the past 2 years, our network has grown by 28% and the real estate portfolio by 44%. At the same time, our revenue and EBITDA have increased by 31% and 37% respectively. In parallel, we have settled the foundations for the next phase of global expansion over the coming 5 to 10 years and we are today in a unique position to meet the global challenge of population ageing.\nWe will thus continue to build up our international expansion, in our longstanding countries and new territories, harnessing our expertise in rolling out a model focused on quality and value creation.”\nSound earnings growth in 2017\n(€ m) (IFRS)\n2017 2016 Chg. Revenue 3,138 2,841 +10.5% EBITDAR (EBITDA before rents) 846 769 +10.0% EBITDA 548 475 +15.4% Recurring operating profit 394 348 +13.3% Net financial cost -135 -112 +21.4% Profit before tax 2\n275 259 +6.1% Net profit excluding ORNANE and discounting deferred taxes 2 198 178 +11.4% ORPEA’s 2017 revenue grew by 10.5% to €3,138.2m. It was underpinned by a strong organic growth of 5.4% and by a rapid pace of acquisitions outside France, including Spitex in Switzerland, Dr. Dr. Wagner in Austria, Anavita in the Czech Republic and Sanyres 3 in Spain.\nEBITDAR (EBITDA before rents) rose by 10.0% to €846.2m, representing 27.0% of revenue, almost stable compared to 2016. The EBITDAR margin excluding the principal acquisitions consolidated in 2017 (Spitex, Dr. Dr. Wagner, Anavita and Sanyres 3 ) came out to 27.5%, up 40 basis points compared to 2016.\nThanks to the strategy of increasing the real estate ownership rate (up to 45% at year-end 2017 from 39% in 2016), rental expenses barely rose to €298.5m from €294.9m in 2016.\nEBITDA increased by 15.4% to €547.7m, or 17.5% of revenue, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to 2016. The Group successfully achieved a significant increase in its profitability in parallel with its very strong development, including acquisitions and expansion into new countries.\nAfter €153.3m in depreciation, amortisation and provisions (up 21.2% owing to additions to the real estate portfolio), recurring operating profit came out to €394.4m (up 13.3%).\nNet financial costs rose by 21.4% to €135.4m as a result of numerous acquisitions completed over the past 12 months.\nIncome tax expense 2 declined by 4.6% to €81.7m thanks to the Group’s international expansion.\nLastly, net profit excluding ORNANE and discounted deferred taxes 2 rose by 11.4% to €197.8m. This increase outpaced the Group revenue growth, demonstrating the strength of ORPEA’s business model.\nDividend of €1.10 per share proposed\nAt the Annual General Meeting on 28 June 2018, the Board of Directors will propose paying out a dividend of €1.10 per share in respect of the 2017 financial year, compared with €1.00 for the previous financial year.\nFurther increase in the real estate portfolio to €5.0 billion 4\nThe 1.84m sq. metre real estate portfolio was valued at €4,970m 4 at 31 December 2017. This represented an increase of €845m in 2017 and €1.5 billion over the past 2 years. This 20.5% growth reflects the Group’s strategy of increasing its real estate ownership rate, specifically in Germany, Austria, Italy and the Czech Republic.\nIts real estate ownership rate now stands at 45%, close to the Group’s target, compared with 36% at 31 December 2015.\nIts valuation by independent appraisers implies an average capitalisation rate of 6.0%, compared with 6.1% at year-end 2016. It represents a conservative valuation by comparison with recent market transactions for the same type of assets, priced at yields of 4.5%.\nThis real estate portfolio gives ORPEA a unique position in the sector. It will secure its cash flow over the long term and make its balance sheet more flexible and secure.\nA strengthened financial structure\nNet debt stood at €4,413m 5 at 31 December 2017, almost stable compared to its level at 30 June 2017 supported by the ORNANE redemption and the strengthening of its equity.\nReal estate debt accounted for 85% of the total and debt ratios improved despite ORPEA strong pace of development. At 31 December 2017:\nthe financial leverage ratio restated for real estate stood at 2.1x compared with 2.3x at 31 December 2016 (covenant of 5.5x) restated gearing came to 1.4x vs. 1.5x at 31 December 2016 (covenant of 2.0x)\nThe average borrowing cost continued to fall to 3.1%. Net debt is fully hedged against the risk of interest rates rise.\nA favourable inflationary environment\nWith an anticipation strategy initiated several years ago, an upturn in inflation and in interest rates would have a positive effect on ORPEA’s profitability. The Group’s revenue will benefit from an inflation acceleration (most daily rates are inflation-linked), while its costs are tightly controlled: strengthened bargaining power, 50% of the rents are subject to a fixed rate or are capped, debt is fully hedged at a fixed rate.\nInaugural issue of a €400m public bond placement\nIn February 2018, ORPEA completed the placement of an inaugural public 7-year bond issue of €400m (due in March 2025) with an annual fixed-rate coupon of 2.625%.\nThe successful inaugural issue amid volatile market conditions is a testament to credit investors’ confidence in the Group (over 115, 44% outside France).\nThe issue is in line with the financing strategy implemented by the Group since 2012 consisting in:\ndiversifying its financing sources: after private bond placements and Schuldscheine, the public market will further expand its base of credit investors extending the debt maturity at an attractive cost.\nA network of 86,650 beds in 12 countries and a strong increase in the growth pipeline\nORPEA has continued to develop its network at a very fast pace with the expansion into two new countries (Brazil and Portugal) as well as new authorisations and/or acquisitions in countries where the Group already operates\nOver the last 12 months, the network has grown by 12% with 9,556 additional beds including:\n5,712 beds (60% of additional beds) through organic development 3,844 beds through acquisitions of groups (Anavita and Dr. Dr. Wagner) and independent facilities\nORPEA’s network now includes 86,650 beds at 818 facilities in 12 countries. The number of beds outside France now accounts for 61% of the overall network, compared with 40% only three years ago.\nThe pipeline of beds under construction and redevelopment has risen by 53% over the past two years to 13,379 beds, with 83% of them outside France. This pipeline provides the Group an exceptional visibility as it will fuel part of its organic growth over the next 4 to 5 years in locations with a strong purchasing power.\nNumber of\nfacilities\nNumber of\nbeds\nBeds opened Beds being\nrestructured\nBeds under\nconstruction\nFrance 357 33,437 31,214 1,130 1,093 Germany 165 17,572 14,997 0 2,575 Austria 81 7,042 6,858 0 184 Belgium 60 7,443 5,675 134 1,634 Brazil 13 2,185 0 0 2,185 China 1 140 140 0 0 Spain 47 8,071 7,764 0 307 Italy 15 1,736 1,471 0 265 Poland 18 2,080 972 0 1,108 Portugal 10 1,141 0 0 1,141 Czech Rep. 17 2,463 1,542 0 921 Switzerland 34 3,340 2,638 0 702 TOTAL 818 86,650 73,271 1,264 12,115 Dynamic and innovative training policy to retain employees\nTo support its strong development, ORPEA constantly expands its training policy in an effort to retain and promote internal mobility of its 55,000 employees. In 2017, the Group increased the number of training hours provided to all its employees by 30% through its 200 partnerships with schools.\nNew training courses were introduced outside France to reinforce the ORPEA culture of quality and internal promotion. For example, the Austrian subsidiary founded the SeneCura Academy, which delivers training recognised by the country’s supervisory authorities for all nursing staff. Similarly, the Senevita Academy is due to open in Switzerland in 2018. The university diploma of Care Facility Management created in partnership with the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis is being introduced across all the countries where the Group operates.\nORPEA has also created dedicated training for Facility Managers with the aim to develop a strategy of forward planning to prevent psychosocial risks and promote quality of life in the workplace.\nThese initiatives will raise the profile of the care occupations and bolster employees’ motivation, engagement and quality of life and, as a result, they will enhance the quality of care provided to our residents and patients.\nStrategy and outlook\nORPEA intends to continue its expansion strategy outside France, both in countries where the Group is already present and in new territories. This expansion will be done by the establishment of new facilities in regions with strong purchasing power and by opportunistic, selective and small-scale acquisitions. ORPEA, previously a European group, is becoming a world leader by leveraging its model focused on the quality of services it provides for the well-being of its residents and patients and on long-term value creation over the long term.\nORPEA reiterates its revenue target of €3,400m for 2018 (an 8.3% increase from 2017), together with an EBITDA margin equal to or higher than its 2017 level.\nNext press release: Q1 2018 revenue\n2 May 2018 after market close\nAbout ORPEA ( www.orpea-corp.com )\nSince its creation in 1989, ORPEA has expanded rapidly to become one of the main world leader in long-term care, with its network of 818 facilities, with 86,650 beds (13,379 of them under construction or redevelopment), including:\n33,437 beds in France (2,223 beds under construction or redevelopment) at 357 facilities 53,213 beds outside France (Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland) at 461 facilities (11,156 beds under construction or redevelopment)\nORPEA is listed on Euronext Paris (ISIN code: FR0000184798) and a constituent of the SBF 120, STOXX 600 Europe, MSCI Small Cap Europe and CAC Mid 60 indices.\nGlossary:\nOrganic growth Organic growth reflects the following factors:\n1. The year-on-year change in the revenue of existing facilities as a result of changes in their occupancy rates and per diem rates\n2. The year-on-year change in the revenue of redeveloped facilities or those where capacity has been increased in the current or year-earlier period\n3.
