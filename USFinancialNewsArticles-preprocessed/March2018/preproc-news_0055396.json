    "text": "SAN RAMON, Calif., March 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SteadyMed Ltd. (Nasdaq:STDY), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug product candidates to treat orphan and high-value diseases with unmet parenteral delivery needs, today provided a corporate update and announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nSummary Q4 2017 and Recent Corporate Update:\nIn November 2017, SteadyMed held an in-person Type A meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the necessary steps leading to a re-submission of its New Drug Application (NDA) for its lead drug candidate Trevyent, that is in development for the treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The Company believes the meeting was collaborative and constructive and has agreed to a path forward with FDA that it expects will allow for the resubmission and acceptance of its Trevyent NDA before the end of 2018.\nIn November 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO invalidating U.S. Patent No. 8,497,393 (the '393 patent) owned by United Therapeutics. The ‘393 patent related to a product made by a process to purify prostacyclin derivatives, such as treprostinil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient used in United Therapeutics' Remodulin® and SteadyMed's lead drug candidate Trevyent.\nIn October, 2017, SteadyMed received a notice of allowance for its European patent application No. 13720085.3 relating to enhanced reduction of infusion-site pain for drug delivery devices.\nIn March, 2018, the SteadyMed received a notice of allowance for U.S. Patent Application No. 14/456,416. The patent covers our PatchPump Drug Delivery Device broadly, including its ECell displacement generating battery and prefilled drug reservoir.\n“I am pleased that we ended 2017 with clarity from the FDA on the steps necessary for re-submission of our Trevyent NDA. The pre-design verification (pre-DV) testing of our Trevyent product is progressing to plan and we remain on track to re-submit our NDA and, subject to review by FDA, have it accepted for filing by the end of 2018,” said Jonathan Rigby, President and Chief Executive Officer of SteadyMed. “In addition, we ended 2017 with a cash balance of $32.5 million, bolstered by the proceeds of our successful April 2017 Private Placement and a warrant exercise by a large institutional shareholder. Overall, we believe that we are well positioned to execute on our primary strategic and operational objectives in 2018, and look forward to sharing updates of our progress with our shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Results\nSteadyMed recorded licensing revenues of $109,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to revenues of $320,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The recorded revenues were attributable to the recognition of revenue from the $3 million upfront payment received from Cardiome during 2015, in connection with the license of rights to Trevyent in Europe, the Middle East and Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2017, SteadyMed completed its obligations to provide services associated with the $3 million upfront payment and completed the recognition of revenue associated with the payment.\nFor the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, SteadyMed reported a net loss of $5.9 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.12 per share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. The loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 would have been greater than the current period loss but for financial income of $4.1 million from the revaluation of warrants. The current quarter's calculation of loss per share is based on 26,599,494 weighted-average shares outstanding, versus 20,139,826 outstanding shares in the prior-year period.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $5.0 million, compared to $6.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Research and development (R&D), general and administrative (G&A), and sales and marketing (S&M) expenses decreased during the quarter primarily resulting from cash conservation measures instituted by the Company in response to receiving the Refuse to File letter from the FDA at the end of August.\nR&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $3.2 million, compared to $4.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily due to a decreased use of sub-contractor services and materials for Trevyent and our other development programs offset by an increase in depreciation and impairment of property and equipment.\nG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.3 million, compared to $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to a decrease in legal and intellectual property expenses partially offset by an increase in personnel related costs.\nS&M expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.4 million compared to $0.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in S&M was primarily due to a decrease in consulting fees related to pre- commercialization of Trevyent offset by an increase in personnel related costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $1.0 million in financial expense primarily as a result of the change in the fair value of the warrants issued in the April 2017 and August 2016 private placements compared to $4.0 million in financial income for the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily as a result of the change in the fair value of the warrants issued in the August 2016 private placement.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Results Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 Financial Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, SteadyMed recorded licensing revenues of $1,065,000, same as the year ended December 31, 2016. The recorded revenues were attributable to the recognition of revenue from the $3 million upfront payment received from Cardiome during 2015, as discussed above.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, SteadyMed reported a net loss of $23.2 million, or $0.95 per share, compared to a net loss of $25.9 million, or $1.59 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. The current year’s calculation of loss per share is based on 24,421,288 weighted-average shares outstanding, versus 16,253,975 outstanding shares in the prior-year period.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $21.5 million, compared to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. While all operating expense categories decreased in the current year period, R&D led the decrease resulting from activities and projects in the department winding down as the Company prepared and filed the Trevyent NDA with the FDA in June.\nR&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $14.6 million, compared to $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily due to decreases in use of sub-contractor services and materials for Trevyent and travel offset by increases in personnel related costs and depreciation and impairment of property and equipment.\nG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.2 million, compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to decreases in legal and intellectual property expenses and other G&A consultants.\nS&M expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.7 million compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in S&M was primarily due to a decrease in consulting fees related to pre-commercialization of Trevyent offset by an increase in personnel related costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $2.8 million in financial expense primarily as a result of the change in the fair value of the warrants issued in the April 2017 and August 2016 private placements and issuance costs allocated to those warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $1.9 million in financial income primarily as a result of the change in the fair value of the warrants issued in the August 2016 private placement net of issuance costs allocated to those warrants.\nAs of December 31, 2017, SteadyMed had cash and cash equivalents of $32.5 million.\nAbout SteadyMed\nSteadyMed Ltd. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug products to treat orphan and high value diseases with unmet parenteral delivery needs.
