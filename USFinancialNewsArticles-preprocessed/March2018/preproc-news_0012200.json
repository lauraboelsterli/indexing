    "text": "LEXINGTON, Mass., T2 Biosystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTOO), an emerging leader in the development and commercialization of innovative medical diagnostic products for critical unmet needs in healthcare, announced today operating highlights and financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Business and Financial Performance Highlights:\nReported fourth quarter total revenue of $1.7 million, exceeded the high end of guidance and increased 87% year-over-year and was up 55% sequentially. Fourth quarter product revenue of $1.3 million, grew 125% year-over-year and was up 76% sequentially. Secured contracts in the fourth quarter with seven new hospitals, including two for the use of T2Bacteria® under a Research Use Only (RUO) program and one for a T2Bacteria contract in the EU. Increased targeted high-risk patients at newly contracted hospitals by 45,000, ahead of the 30,000 high-risk patients targeted in the prior quarter. Discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continue to be positive and productive regarding market clearance of the T2Bacteria Panel. The current timeline now suggests a more typical 6 to 9 month approval process which would lead to market clearance in the second quarter of 2018. Presented data at the Association for Molecular Pathology Conference highlighting the clinical value of the T2Bacteria Panel by comparing the improved specificity and sensitivity of T2Bacteria to commonly used blood culture. Concluded pre-clinical work on the proprietary T2Lyme Panel and remain on track to commence the FDA clinical trial in the first half of 2018.\nFull-Year Operational and Financial Performance Highlights:\nGrew 2017 product revenue 100% to $3.4 million and total revenue 15% to $4.7 million. Expanded the total worldwide installed base to 67 instruments covering 157 hospitals in the United States and Europe, providing access to an estimated 495,000 high risk patients that could be tested with the T2Candida and T2Bacteria Panels. Obtained the European CE Mark to market T2Bacteria Panel outside of the U.S. and filed a 510(k) application with the FDA for market clearance of the T2Bacteria Panel in the U.S. Continued progress growing the number of customer success stories in 2017 by presenting 19 posters or presentations at a number of leading industry conferences highlighting the attributes, benefits, and potential use of the T2Dx® Instrument, and the T2Candida and T2Bacteria Panels. Announced a number of new partnerships including a partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to use the T2Dx Instrument for detecting the superbug Candida auris and a second partnership with Cidara to use the T2Dx Instrument with the T2Candida Panel as a means of facilitating patient enrollment in Cidara’s Phase 3 clinical trial. Successfully closed an equity financing raising $20.1 million in gross proceeds that will fund commercial expansion and continued research and development of T2 Biosystems’ pipeline.\n“2017 was a productive year for T2, and we achieved a number of significant milestones that set the table for what we believe will be an exciting year for the Company,” said John McDonough, president and chief executive officer of T2 Biosystems. “We completed the T2Bacteria Panel FDA filing for market clearance in the United States, grew product revenue over 100%, expanded and reshaped our commercial infrastructure, closed two exciting new partnerships – including one with the CDC for the detection of the Candida auris superbug and closed a $20.1 million gross equity financing. Perhaps most importantly, we continued to see real world presentations, publications and stories from our customers that support the significant value our products can bring to patients and the healthcare system.”\nFourth Quarter Financial Results:\nRevenues were $1.7 million, a 55% increase over last quarter’s revenues of $1.1 million and an 87% increase over last year’s fourth quarter revenues of $910,000 and 42% over the high range of guidance.\nProduct revenues, primarily T2Candida Panel and T2Dx Instrument sales, were $1.3 million, a 76% increase over last quarter’s product revenues of $739,000 and a 125% increase over last year’s fourth quarter product revenues of $579,000.\nResearch revenues were $325,000 compared to $369,000 last quarter and $331,000 in last year’s fourth quarter.\nCosts and expenses, excluding cost of product revenue, were $9.8 million, a decrease of 14% over last quarter’s costs and expenses of $11.4 million and a 16% decrease over last year’s fourth quarter costs and expenses of $11.7 million. Costs and expenses were 14% less than the low range of guidance. The company is seeking to reduce research and development spending as it increases commercial sales activities.\nOperating margins were a loss of $14.5 million, a 17% increase over last quarter’s $12.4 million operating margin loss and a 12% increase over last year’s fourth quarter operating margin loss of $12.9 million. The company adjusted the carrying value of T2 owned T2Dx Instruments and incurred a non-cash charge of $2.4 million.\nWeighted average shares outstanding were 35.9 million this quarter compared to 31.4 million last quarter and 30.5 million in last year’s fourth quarter.\nAnticipated Events:\nThe company provides the following guidance for first quarter 2018:\nTotal revenue in the first quarter 2018 is expected to be in the range of $1.3 million to $1.6 million. First quarter 2018 product revenue is expected to be in the range of $.9 million to $1.1 million.\nThe company expects to close at least 6 new contracts in the first quarter, which include at least 6 new placements of T2Dx Instruments that provide access to a minimum of 35,000 high risk patients.\nOperating expenses, excluding cost of product revenue, for the first quarter 2018 are projected to be in the range of $10.7 million to $11.1 million including non-cash stock based compensation and depreciation expenses of $1.8 million.\nGoing forward, with the T2Bacteria clinical trial completed and as the company continues to focus on commercial revenue growth, operating expenses in Q2 and for the remainder of the year are expected to be in the range of $9.0 million to $10.0 million, a net reduction of approximately 20%. The reduction in expenses is not expected to impact the company’s investment in sales and support of revenue growth, and it is believed will allow the company to fully fund its product development pipeline.\nThe company expects to provide full-year 2018 financial guidance upon FDA clearance of the T2Bacteria Panel.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call today with the investment community at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the financial results and other business developments.
