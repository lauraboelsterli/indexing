The appointments come months after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed the need for greater workplace diversity, saying his firm would have to hire more women. Separately on Thursday, Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) announced a push to have women represent half of its global workforce over time, as   looks to accelerate its workplace diversity efforts.
