    "text": "Science Latest nor'easter could dump a foot or more of snow Much of the Northeast is bracing for blizzard conditions, a foot or more of snow and high winds as the third major nor'easter in 10 days bears down on the region. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for much of New England and a winter weather advisory for eastern New York and Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey. Published 5 Hours Ago The Associated Press Keith Bedford | The Boston Globe | Getty Images Luis Bernerdes shovels snow from a nor'easter storm off of his walkway in the Mattapan neighborhood of Boston on March 8, 2018. \nMuch of the Northeast is bracing for blizzard conditions, a foot or more of snow and high winds as the third major nor'easter in 10 days bears down on the region. \nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for much of New England and a winter weather advisory for eastern New York and Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey . \nThe storm is expected to hit about midnight and last through most of the day Tuesday, with snow accumulating at a rate of 2 inches per hour at times in some areas. \nThe weather service says Boston and areas south of the city could get a foot and a half of snow, with less to the west of the city. Providence, Rhode Island , is in line for about 15 inches. ",
