    "text": "CHANDLER, Ariz., March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Everspin Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRAM), the world's leading developer and manufacturer of discrete and embedded MRAM, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter, Full Year and Recent Highlights\nAchieved record revenue for the quarter and year 4Q revenue grew 43.3% year-over-year and 2017 revenue grew 32.6% over 2016 Gross margin for the year increased 550 basis points over 2016 Shipped and recorded first revenue for 40nm 256Mb STT-MRAM products In February, successfully raised $24.5 million in net proceeds from follow-on public offering\n“Everspin concluded a successful year in 2017 with record revenue and improved margins driven by a 27% year-over-year increase in MRAM product revenue, largely from our Toggle products,” said Everspin President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Conley. “We are focused on operational excellence to further improve manufacturing efficiencies and output on these products, as we seek to grow this business and improve our bottom line.\n“We made solid progress on several strategic priorities, most significantly on 256Mb STT-MRAM with the start of production and first recognized revenue in the fourth quarter. We believe our focus on technology innovation and development of high-value products for our customers will position Everspin to benefit from the growing demand for persistent memory solutions.\n“To gain the necessary capital for executing this strategy, Everspin raised a net $24.5 million, after underwriter fees, through a secondary public stock offering in February. These funds will be used as working capital to support ongoing operations and scale production, while developing both new products and future advanced MRAM technology.”\nFourth Quarter and 2017 Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter was a record $10.1 million, a 43.3% increase from $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a 12.4% increase from $9.0 million in the prior quarter.
