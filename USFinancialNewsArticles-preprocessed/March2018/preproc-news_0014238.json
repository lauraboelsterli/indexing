    "text": "NEW YORK, March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) today announced it has entered into a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.

The accelerated share repurchase agreement announced today will be executed under this existing authorization from the Board.\nConsistent with S&P Global's capital management philosophy, the Company expects to pay out at least 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders in 2018 through dividends and share repurchases.\n\"We are pleased that our strong financial position enables us to deliver on our ongoing commitment to create value for shareholders,\" said Douglas L. Peterson, President and CEO of S&P Global.\nForward-looking Statements:\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements,\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
