    "text": "-- Fourth Quarter Revenue Increase of 12% with Growth Across the Portfolio --\n-- Fourth Quarter Earnings Growth Reflects Positive 6% Comps and Enhanced Margins --\n-- Delivers Solid Full-Year Growth in both Revenue and Earnings --\n-- Board of Directors Authorizes 26% Increase in Quarterly Dividend --\n-- Expects Continued Sales and Earnings Growth in Fiscal 2018 --\nATLANTA, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oxford Industries, Inc. (NYSE:OXM) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 year ended February 3, 2018. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net sales increased 12% to $293.2 million compared to $261.0 million in fiscal 2016. Earnings from continuing operations on a GAAP basis increased to $1.41 per share in fiscal 2017 as compared to $0.72 per share in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased to $0.93 per share in fiscal 2017 from $0.63 per share in fiscal 2016; these adjusted results exclude the positive impact of tax reform and the impact of LIFO accounting, among other items.\nFull fiscal year consolidated net sales increased 6% to $1.086 billion. Full fiscal year earnings per share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis increased to $3.87 compared to $3.27 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased by 11% to $3.66 per share compared to $3.30 per share in fiscal 2016.\nThomas C. Chubb III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Each of our brands delivered a strong fourth quarter performance and we achieved very solid revenue and earnings growth for the full fiscal year. We grew revenue in all channels of distribution with particular strength in our e-commerce business, which represented 19% of our fiscal 2017 total revenue. Lilly Pulitzer’s momentum began to build in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter with 22% revenue growth and a 6% increase in comp store sales, a trend that has continued into the first quarter of our new fiscal year. Tommy Bahama maintained a sharp strategic and operational focus during the year and delivered significantly improved results in the fourth quarter, both in terms of profitability and revenue growth. Oxford’s 2017 success included full-year growth in total sales, positive comp increases in all four quarters, and expanded gross and operating margins. We are determined to follow those achievements with another solid year of profitable growth in 2018.”\nMr. Chubb continued, “In 2018, we will remain focused on driving long-term value to our shareholders. Our plan calls for modest top-line growth driven by robust e-commerce growth, healthy growth in our bricks and mortar channel partially offset by a planned contraction in our wholesale business. We will continue to carefully select locations for bricks and mortar expansion that are strategically valuable and financially compelling. To that end, we are excited to be opening a Lilly Pulitzer store on Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, our first Hawaii store for Lilly in Whaler’s Village on Maui, and a new Tommy Bahama Marlin Bar & Grill in Palm Springs. We also believe it is prudent, particularly in today’s environment, to have disciplined wholesale distribution. We have reduced our department store exposure to only 14% of our total sales and we expect to further focus that business on fewer, but more profitable doors.”\nMr. Chubb concluded, “We expect to deliver solid revenue growth, expanded gross margins and stronger operating profitability in 2018. These successes, along with a lower tax rate, should enable us to deliver good earnings growth and enhanced value to shareholders, including through the significant increase in our dividend announced today. At the same time, we will continue to invest in the business. In 2018, we will grow our marketing spend with a priority on customer acquisition. Our investment in technology will focus on enhancing the customer experience and ensuring that we have the tools to win in any retail environment. Most importantly, we will continue to invest in our ability to retain, attract and nurture talent and, as part of that, are pleased to enhance our 401(k) plan this year. Everything we do and everything we achieve flows from an incredible group of men and women who come to work every day focused on making our customers happy and coming back for more.”\nConsolidated Operating Results\nFourth quarter fiscal 2017 net sales increased 12% to $293.2 million compared to $261.0 million in the prior year period, including a 6% comparable store sales increase.

As a result, the net effect of taxes on earnings fiscal 2017 was a benefit of 34% compared to tax expense of 35% in fiscal 2016. For the full year, the Company’s effective tax rate was 22% compared to 37% in fiscal 2016.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nInventory decreased 11% to $126.8 million at February 3, 2018 from $142.2 million at the end of fiscal 2016. The Company believes that inventory levels in each of the operating groups are appropriate for planned sales.\nAs of February 3, 2018, the Company had $45.8 million of borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit agreement compared to $91.5 million in the prior year. The Company ended the quarter with $219.7 million of unused availability under its $325 million revolving credit agreement.\nIn the full 2017 fiscal year, cash flow from operations was $118.6 million and free cash flow was $79.8 million.\nOutlook for the Full Year and First Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nFor the full 2018 fiscal year, which ends on February 2, 2019, the Company expects net sales to grow to between $1.12 billion and $1.14 billion as compared to Fiscal 2017 net sales of $1.086 billion. In fiscal 2018, GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $4.28 and $4.48.

GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.11 and $1.21 and adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $1.15 and $1.25, as compared to GAAP results of $1.03 per share and adjusted results of $1.12 per share achieved in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nCapital expenditures in fiscal 2018 are expected to approach $60 million, compared to $39 million in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting investments in information technology initiatives, new retail stores and restaurants, and investments to remodel existing retail stores and restaurants.\nDividend\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors has approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per share payable on May 4, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 20, 2018.

Discontinued operations for all periods presented reflect the results from the Ben Sherman business, which was sold on July 17, 2015.

To supplement these consolidated financial results, management believes that a presentation and discussion of certain financial measures on an adjusted basis, which exclude certain non-operating or discrete gains, charges or other items, may provide a more meaningful basis on which investors may compare the Company’s ongoing results of operations between periods. These measures include adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income and free cash flow, among others. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operational and planning decisions to evaluate the Company’s ongoing performance. Management also uses these adjusted financial measures to discuss its business with investment and other financial institutions, its board of directors and others. Reconciliations of these adjusted measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are presented in tables included at the end of this release. These reconciliations present adjusted operating results information for certain historical and future periods.\nSafe Harbor\nThis press release includes statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
