    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 9:26 AM / Updated an hour ago Poland, United States sign $4.75 billion deal on Patriot missiles Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWARSAW (Reuters) - Poland and the United States signed a $4.75 billion agreement on Wednesday on the sale of Raytheon Co’s Patriot missile defence system to Warsaw. \n“Today we are starting to equip Poland with the most modern mid-range air defence system in the world,” Poland’s President Andrzej Duda said at the signing ceremony. \nNATO member Poland has sped up efforts to overhaul its military following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 and in response to Moscow’s renewed military and political assertiveness in the region.
