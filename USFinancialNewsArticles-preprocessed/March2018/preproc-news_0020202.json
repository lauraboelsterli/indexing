    "text": "Freehold, N.J., Jensyn Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ:JSYN) (“Jensyn Acquisition” or the “Company”) , a company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, today announced that stockholders have approved an extension of the date by which it must complete its initial business combination to June 5, 2018. Stockholders holding an aggregate of 1,825,506 shares of common stock exercised their right to convert their shares into cash in connection with the extension, leaving approximately $22,030,102 of cash in trust after giving effect to the conversions and the deposit of an additional $.09 per share in the trust for each public share that was not converted. This deposit increased funds available in Jensyn Acquisition’s trust account for the conversion of shares in connection with a business combination or a liquidation from approximately $10.53 per share on March 5, 2018 to approximately $10.62 per share.\nJensyn Acquisition obtained the extension to provide time for the Company to complete its previously announced business combination with BAE Energy Management, LLC (“BAE”), an energy marketing, finance and services firm based in Woodbury, New York. Jensyn Acquisition has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the Securities Exchange Commission in connection with a special meeting of stockholders to approve the business combination with BAE.\nAbout Jensyn Acquisition Corp.\nJensyn Acquisition Corp. is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.\nAbout BAE Energy Management, LLC\nBAE is comprised of two major subsidiaries, Big Apple Energy and Vantage Commodities Financial Services. Founded in 1998, Big Apple Energy is a market aggregator supplying small to medium size energy service companies (“ESCOs”) that typically lack the buying power and expertise to effectively compete in the deregulated natural gas and power markets. Big Apple Energy creates value for its clients through its purchasing and outsourcing capabilities and by aggregating the requirements of its clients to give them the leverage of larger ESCOs. Big Apple Energy also provides an EDI and billing software platform in addition to supply financing. Vantage Commodities Financial Services is a specialty finance company focused on providing supply and working capital financing to companies operating within the energy space.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United Stated Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
