    "text": "LIMA, March 25 (Reuters) - Peru’s central bank said on Sunday it would cut dollar reserve requirement to 36 percent from 37 percent starting in April to boost credit and offset the impact of a more restrictive monetary policy in the United States.\nThe measure will allow $181 million to be “immediately” injected into the local financial system, the bank said in a statement.\nThe monetary authority has been reducing its reserve requirement since January 2017 to counter a slowdown in credit and a period of higher international interest rates.\nThe reserves are a percentage of the deposits that financial institutions and banks must keep in their vaults.\nThe recovery of the Peruvian economy has been affected by a corruption scandal that has put the brakes on investment and last week led to the resignation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who was facing impeachment by Congress although he denies involvement in any corrupt activity.
