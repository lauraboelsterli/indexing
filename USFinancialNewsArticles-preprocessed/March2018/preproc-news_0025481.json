    "text": "March 13, 2018 / 7:17 PM / Updated a day ago Exclusive: G20 financial heads to urge crypto-asset monitoring to safeguard financial stability Jan Strupczewski 3 Min Read BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The world’s financial leaders will call on international standard-setting bodies on March 20 for stronger monitoring of crypto-assets and to assess the need for a multilateral response as such assets could at some point threaten financial stability. Cryptocurrencies are seen on a website that tracks the value of initial coin offerings (ICO) in this illustration photo taken September 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration The call appears in a draft communique prepared for the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors of the world’s 20 biggest economies in Buenos Aires on March 19-20, seen by Reuters. The financial leaders will say the technological innovation behind crypto-currencies has the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system. “Crypto currencies, however, raise issues with respect to consumer and investor protection, tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing. At some point they could have financial stability implications,” the draft communique adds. “We agree that international standard setting bodies strengthen their monitoring of crypto-assets and their risks... and assess whether multilateral responses may be needed.” Regulators globally have raised the alarm over cryptocurrencies, saying they may aid money laundering and terrorist financing, hurt consumers and undermine trust in the global financial system. Japan was the first country to adopt a national system to oversee cryptocurrency trading. It carried out checks on several exchanges this year after the theft of $530 million from one exchange, Coincheck Inc, in January. France and Germany have said they will make joint proposals to regulate the bitcoin cryptocurrency market. The head of the European Union’s watchdog said a short-term strategy could be to focus on applying anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules, warning consumers of the risk of trading in cryptocurrencies and preventing banks from holding them. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said last week that many online trading platforms for cryptocurrencies should be registered with the regulator and subject to additional rules, in a further sign regulators are cracking down on the digital currency sector. In a statement, the SEC said these “potentially unlawful” platforms may be giving investors an unearned sense of safety by labeling themselves as “exchanges.” The regulator said these platforms need to register with the SEC as a regulated national securities exchange or as an alternate trading system, or ATS. Virtual currencies have existed for years but speculation in them has recently ballooned - along with scams promising investors returns of over 1,000 percent in weeks. In a time of volatile markets, hackers are also active in the sector. Bitcoin, the best known virtual currency, lost over half its value earlier this year after surging more than 1,300 percent last year. Reporting By Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Hugh Lawson",
