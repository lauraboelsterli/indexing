    "text": "CHICAGO, March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- tronc, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRNC) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. Please note, the Company’s fiscal year 2017 consisted of 53 weeks with 13 weeks in each of the first three quarters and 14 weeks in the fourth quarter, compared to fiscal year 2016 which consisted of a 52-week year with 13 weeks in each quarter.\nFourth Quarter 2017 and Year-to-Date 2018 Highlights:\nStrong fourth quarter 2017 digital advertising revenue growth of 19% compared to fourth quarter 2016 Digital only subscribers were 320,000 in fourth quarter 2017, up 100% year-over-year Average monthly unique visitors of 79.3 million in fourth quarter 2017, up 40% from fourth quarter 2016 Entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Los Angeles Times, The San Diego Union-Tribune and various other California properties Acquired a majority ownership stake in BestReviews, an online product review company\n“The actions we took throughout the year brought solid digital growth along with our continuing commitment to deliver excellence in journalism,” said tronc CEO Justin Dearborn. “Looking ahead, we remain focused on the consistent execution of our growth strategy.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results\nFourth quarter 2017 total revenues were $435.0 million, up 2.3% compared to $425.4 million for fourth quarter 2016. Total revenues for the full year 2017 were $1.52 billion, down 5.1% from full year 2016. Revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 includes $32.6 million attributable to the New York Daily News (NYDN), which was acquired on September 3, 2017, and an additional $24.1 million of revenue relating to the extra week in 2017 generated by our other properties. Full year 2017 revenues include these amounts as well as an additional $7.6 million generated by the NYDN for the portion of the third quarter 2017 during which we owned it.\nFourth quarter 2017 advertising revenue was down 5.0%, compared to fourth quarter 2016, and decreased 11.7% for full year 2017 on a year-over-year basis. Digital Advertising showed growth of 18.8% in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to fourth quarter 2016. Circulation revenue for fourth quarter 2017 was up 17.3%, compared to the same period of 2016, and was up 6.8% for full year 2017 over full year 2016.\nTotal operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for fourth quarter 2017 were $405.7 million, up 5.8%, compared to $383.6 million for fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was mainly due to the impact of including NYDN and the additional week, partially offset by continued cost reductions. Full year 2017 total operating expenses of $1.46 billion were down 6.2% compared to $1.55 billion for full year 2016.\nNet loss for fourth quarter 2017 was $0.4 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to net income $19.4 million, or $0.53 per share, for fourth quarter of 2016. Full year 2017 net income was $5.5 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to $6.5 million, or $0.19 per share, for full year 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS for fourth quarter 2017 was $0.30, compared to $0.88 for fourth quarter 2016. Full year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS was $1.08, compared to $1.71 for full year 2016. Fourth quarter and full year 2017 net income was impacted by the introduction of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in that there was a $10.8 million, one-time reduction in deferred tax assets as a direct result of the federal statutory tax rate declining from 35% to 21%.\nAdjusted EBITDA for fourth quarter 2017 was $65.4 million, down 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. Full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $178.8 million, compared to $180.5 million for full year 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $26.2 million for fourth quarter 2017. Capital expenditures totaled $10.9 million for the quarter. Debt was reduced by $8.5 million and pension liabilities decreased by $1.8 million during the quarter, compared to third quarter 2017. Cash balance grew to $189.7 million, which translated into a net debt decrease of $13.0 million in fourth quarter 2017 compared to third quarter 2017.\nSegment Results\nThe Company operates in two segments: troncM, which is comprised of the Company’s media groups excluding their digital revenues and related expenses, except digital subscription revenues when bundled with a print subscription, and troncX, which includes all digital revenues and related expenses of the Company from local tronc websites, third party websites, mobile applications, digital only subscriptions, Tribune Content Agency, The Daily Meal and forsalebyowner.com .\ntroncM\nIncluded in the tables below is segment reporting for troncM and troncX for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 troncM total revenues were nearly flat at $366.0 million, compared to fourth quarter 2016. Full year 2017 total revenues were $1.29 billion, down 6.6% compared to full year 2016. Advertising revenue for fourth quarter 2017 declined by 11.2% on a year-over-year basis, which was partially offset by an increase of 15.5% in circulation revenues. Full year 2017 advertising revenue of $577.4 was down 15.2% compared to full year 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 operating expenses for troncM increased 4.8% compared to the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by the inclusion of NYDN. Full year 2017 operating expenses were down 5.3% on a year-over-year basis. Fourth quarter 2017 income from operations for troncM was $39.8 million or a 29.3% decline from the prior-year quarter.

Fourth quarter 2017 advertising revenues for troncX increased 18.8%, while content revenues, which includes digital only subscriptions and content syndication, increased by 4.4%.

These items include stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, transaction expenses, and certain other charges and gains that the Company does not believe reflects the underlying business performance (including spin-related costs). Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue. Management believes that because Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) certain non-cash expenses (such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and gain/loss on equity investments) and (ii) expenses that are not reflective of the Company’s core operating results over time (such as restructuring costs, including the employee voluntary separation program and gain/losses on employee benefit plan terminations, litigation or dispute settlement charges or gains, and transaction-related costs), this measure provides investors with additional useful information to measure the Company’s financial performance, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA (a) as a measure of operating performance; (b) for planning and forecasting in future periods; and (c) in communications with the Company’s Board of Directors concerning the Company’s financial performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, or a similarly calculated measure, is used as the basis for certain financial maintenance covenants that the Company is subject to in connection with certain credit facilities. Since not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be used by investors as a substitute or alternative to net income or any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Instead, management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be used to supplement the Company’s financial measures derived in accordance with GAAP to provide a more complete understanding of the trends affecting the business.\nAlthough Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations to using non-GAAP measures as an analytical tool are: they do not reflect the Company’s interest income and expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company’s debt; they do not reflect future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring and transaction costs, stock-based compensation amounts and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.\nTRONC, INC.
