The volume traded was 13.80 billion as of the last full trading day.\n** As of 04:06 GMT, China's A-shares were trading at a premium of 25.94 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares.\n** The Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day moving average and its 200-day moving average.\n** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 14.91 as of the last full trading day, while the dividend yield was 2 percent.\n** So far this week, the market capitalisation of the Shanghai stock index has risen by 0.24 percent to 29.29 trillion yuan.\n** In Hong Kong, the sub-index of the Hang Seng index tracking energy shares rose 0.3 percent, while the IT sector fell 0.3 percent. The top gainer on Hang Seng was Sunny Optical Technology Group Co Ltd up 3.94 percent, while the biggest loser was Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd which was down 1.81 percent.\n(Reporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath)",
