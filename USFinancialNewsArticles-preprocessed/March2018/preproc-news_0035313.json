Twenty-six of Solaron's professionals will join Sustainalytics immediately.\n\"Sustainalytics has always been deeply committed to providing the insights investors need to make informed decisions,\" said Sustainalytics' CEO, Michael Jantzi. \"Integrating Solaron's talented team of analysts, with their emerging market expertise and deep dive approach to assessing companies' ESG performance, will allow Sustainalytics to provide its clients with truly differentiated ESG-related research services.\"\nSolaron, originally founded by Vipul and Sonali Arora, established itself as a market leader in delivering specialized ESG research to institutional investors.
