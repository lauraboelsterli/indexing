    "text": "Target on Tuesday said it would raise starting wage for its employees to $12 from $11 later this spring, among other initiatives. \nThe company has promised to get to a $15 starting wage by 2020. \nTarget's investments in its workforce are one reason the discount retailer's profit margins were hampered during the latest quarter. Shares fell nearly 7 percent amid concerns that the company's burgeoning expenses will overwhelm any sales gains it makes. \nTo some degree, the wage hikes planned by Target are a response to a tighter labor market, where U.S. unemployment remains low. \nBut the company is making other investments to lure shoppers to its stores, and to keep pace with internet giant Amazon by improving the speed and ease of getting online orders to customers. \nCEO Brian Cornell announced Tuesday at a meeting with analysts and investors that the company is bringing \"Drive Up,\" a service available via Target's mobile app, to 1,000 stores by the end of this year. Currently, 50 stores have the service, which allows shoppers to have online orders brought directly to their cars. \nTarget still prefers for shoppers to pick up orders at its stores, even if the transactions begin online, according to Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan. This is one way the company has been able to cut expenses, he said, and bypass opening as many costly fulfillment centers. \nTarget is also rolling out free, two-day shipping for hundreds of thousands of items on Target.com. Previously, there was a $35 threshold, unless a shopper had a Target credit card. The company's acquisition of Shipt has been viewed as one way for Target to manage costs as it embarks on the free-shopping initiatives. In some instances, it will be able to move away from third-party providers such as FedEx or UPS . \nMeanwhile, Target's same-day delivery service of purchases made in stores will expand to five New York boroughs and select stores in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The service had preciously only been offered at a handful of locations in New York, thanks to Target's acquisition of Grand Junction late last year. \n\"You can expect us to continue to invest in our team as our greatest differentiator, and introduce and scale new experiences, services and brands, all in service to our guests,\" Cornell said.",
