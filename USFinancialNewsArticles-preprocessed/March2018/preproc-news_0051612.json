    "text": "ROCKVILLE, MD, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nMacroGenics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MGNX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, today announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 4,500,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $21.25 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, MacroGenics has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 675,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions.\nLeerink Partners, Deutsche Bank Securities and Evercore Group L.L.C. are acting as joint book-running managers of the proposed offering. Stifel, Nomura and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey are acting as lead managers and H.C. Wainwright & Co. is acting as co-manager. The offering is expected to close on or about April 2, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nMacroGenics anticipates the total gross proceeds from the offering (before deducting underwriters' discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses) will be approximately $95.6 million, excluding any exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. MacroGenics intends to use the proceeds of this offering, together with its existing cash and cash equivalents, for general corporate purposes and working capital needs consistent with MacroGenics’ business plan which would include, but would not be limited to: (i) potential late-stage development of flotetuzumab for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and/or margetuximab for the treatment of gastric cancer; (ii) continued development of immune checkpoint-based DART ® product candidates; (iii) further investment in the development of current pipeline programs as they continue to mature; (iv) other research and development programs; and (v) in-licensing or acquiring other products or technologies.\nThe shares are being offered by MacroGenics pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A preliminary prospectus supplement relating to and describing the terms of the offering was filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .
