    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 2:59 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago Sky agrees to share information relevant to Fox-Disney deal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Sky, the European pay-TV group at the centre of a takeover battle, said on Thursday it had entered into a confidentiality agreement with suitor Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox and Walt Disney. The Sky logo is seen on outside of an entrance to offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville/Files The agreement, which is required under UK takeover rules, will allow Sky to disclose information to the two companies that could be relevant in Disney’s separate attempt to buy Fox assets, including its stake in Sky. U.S. cable company Comcast gatecrashed Fox’s agreed offer for Sky with a rival $31 billion bid last month. Reporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton",
