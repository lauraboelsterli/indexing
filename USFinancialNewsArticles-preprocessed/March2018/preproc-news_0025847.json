    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Talen Energy Corporation today announced the appointment of Stacey L. Peterson as Vice President and Treasurer. Ms. Peterson will join Talen Energy on April 16, 2018 from Calpine Corporation, and will report to Alex Hernandez, the company's Chief Financial Officer.\n\"Stacey is an experienced finance executive with deep knowledge of our sector and a proven track record, and she will strengthen the capabilities of our management team,\" said Mr. Hernandez. \"Stacey will make a significant impact at Talen as we continue to drive the company's operational and financial performance.\"\nMs. Peterson will succeed Mr. Russ Clelland, Talen's retiring Treasurer, following an orderly transition period during the second quarter. As part of this transition, Ms. Peterson will assume the role as Co-Chair of the company's nuclear decommissioning trust fund and retirement plan committees, overseeing approximately $2.5 billion of invested assets. Mr. Clelland will remain a member of the retirement plan committee.\n\"I would like to thank Mr. Russ Clelland, our current Treasurer who is retiring after more than 40 years of distinguished service to Talen and its predecessor companies. Russ was a critical contributor in reshaping the Talen balance sheet during 2017 following our take-private transaction with Riverstone. He will be missed by our colleagues, banks, and investors.\"\nPrior to joining Talen Energy, Ms. Peterson spent a decade in various leadership roles within Calpine, which focused on financial planning and analysis, capital allocation, commodities structuring, strategy, treasury and capital markets. During her five years as Treasurer of Calpine, Stacey led the strategy for the company's capital structure, including the execution of $18 billion in financings and closing the recent Calpine take-private transaction. Stacey also led the company's global banking relationships across $2 billion of revolving credit facilities.\nDuring her years at Calpine, Ms. Peterson also played a key role in recruiting, mentoring, and developing talent. She was the executive sponsor of Calpine's analyst and associate rotation program and executive sponsor of the diversity and inclusion initiative. Prior to joining Calpine, Ms. Peterson held several commercial positions at BP Energy and spent time in various consulting roles.\nMs. Peterson holds a Bachelor of Science in Business, Finance from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University and has completed advanced studies at Harvard Business School.\nAbout Talen Energy\nTalen Energy is one of the largest competitive energy and power generation companies in North America. The Company owns or controls 16,000 megawatts of generating capacity in well- developed, structured wholesale power markets, principally in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southwest regions of the United States.\nFor more information, visit http://talenenergy.investorroom.com/index.php\nInvestor Contact\nYvonne Fletcher\nManaging Director, Investor Relations\n281-203-5366\nyvonne.fletcher@talenenergy.com\nMedia Contact\nTodd L.
