    "text": "Spotify expects revenue to grow by around 20 to 30 percent this year, the world's biggest selling music streaming service said on Monday, ahead of one of Europe's most anticipated stock market listings.\nThe Swedish company said it expected 2018 revenue of 4.9 billion to 5.3 billion euros ($6.1 billion to $6.8 billion), though that would mark a deceleration from 2017 when revenue rose 39 percent.\nFor the first quarter, the company said it expected revenue of 1.10 billion to 1.15 billion euros, up 22 to 27 percent.\nShares of Spotify Technology are set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on April 3 in an unusual direct listing without traditional underwriters.",
