    "text": "NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - The three major U.S. stock indexes gained ground on Thursday after a report that all countries could negotiate for exclusions from President Donald trump’s proposed metals tariffs and that Canada and Mexico could be exempted indefinitely.\nThe Associated Press cited unnamed sources for its report less than an hour ahead of Trump’s expected announcement.\n“If you see these negotiations play out in this surgical manner the administration has been referring to you might see a less risky outcome,” said Emily Roland, head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments in Boston.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 63.41 points, or 0.26 percent, to 24,864.77, the S&P 500 gained 9.75 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,736.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 28.61 points, or 0.39 percent, to 7,424.26.
