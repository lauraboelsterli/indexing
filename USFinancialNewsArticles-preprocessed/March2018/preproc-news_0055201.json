The key financial metrics we evaluate are Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD.\nAdjusted EBITDA.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest expense, net of interest income, income tax provision, depreciation, amortization and accretion, including our proportionate share of net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, amortization and accretion from our unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, and share-based compensation and transaction costs incurred for our acquisitions of projects; and excluding the effect of certain other non-cash or non-recurring items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance such as, but not limited to, mark to market adjustments to the fair value of derivatives related to our interest rate hedges. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. This measurement is not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. The U.S. GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of financial performance and borrowers' ability to service debt. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management for internal planning purposes including certain aspects of our consolidated operating budget and capital expenditures. It is also used by investors to assess the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to our Class A shareholders.\nHowever, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool because it does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital, does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt or cash distributions on tax equity, does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes, and excludes the effect of certain other cash flow items, all of which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. In addition, our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to EBITDA as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP measure, including net income (loss).\nCash Available for Distribution.\nWe use CAFD, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA less equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, cash interest paid, cash income taxes paid, maintenance capital expenditures, cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and principal amortization payments on any project-level indebtedness plus cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, indemnity payments and promissory notes from Sponsors, test electricity generation, cash proceeds from sales-type residential leases, state and local rebates and cash proceeds for reimbursable network upgrade costs. Our cash flow is generated from distributions we receive from OpCo each quarter. OpCo's cash flow is generated primarily from distributions from the Project Entities. As a result, our ability to make distributions to our Class A shareholders depends primarily on the ability of the Project Entities to make cash distributions to OpCo and the ability of OpCo to make cash distributions to its unitholders.\nWe believe CAFD is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to generate sustainable distributions. In addition, when evaluating a potential acquisition, our management team projects expected CAFD to determine whether to make such acquisition. The U.S. GAAP measure most directly comparable to CAFD is net income (loss).\nHowever, CAFD has limitations as an analytical tool because it does not capture the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our projects, does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and excludes the effect of certain other cash flow items, all of which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results from operations. CAFD is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. In addition, our calculations of CAFD are not necessarily comparable to CAFD as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP measure, including net income (loss).\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD:\n8point3 Energy Partners LP\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\n(in thousands)\nFebruary 28, 2018\nNovember 30, 2017\nFebruary 28, 2017\nNet income (loss) (1)\n$ 6,744\n$ 8,760\n$ (5,320)\nAdd (Less):\nInterest expense, net of interest income\n5,887\n5,739\n5,224\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n(13,169)\n(1,273)\n533\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion\n7,247\n7,302\n6,871\nShare-based compensation\n56\n57\n56\nAcquisition-related transaction costs (2)\n20\n6\n13\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivatives (3)\n13\n(357)\n(670)\nAdd proportionate share from equity method investments (4)\nInterest expense, net of interest income\n74\n(351)\n130\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion\n6,247\n6,335\n6,224\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 13,119\n$ 26,218\n$ 13,061\nLess:\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net with (4) above (5)\n(8,321)\n(16,076)\n(6,960)\nCash interest paid (6)\n(5,930)\n(5,838)\n(4,761)\nMaintenance capital expenditures\n—\n(25)\n—\nCash distributions to non-controlling interests\n(2,212)\n(2,693)\n(1,885)\nShort-Term Note (7)\n—\n—\n(1,964)\nAdd:\nCash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates (8)\n17,612\n33,820\n17,711\nIndemnity payment from Sponsors (9)\n—\n50\n65\nCash proceeds from sales-type residential leases, net (10)\n710\n765\n671\nTest electricity generation (11)\n—\n—\n10\nCash proceeds for reimbursable network upgrade costs (12)\n3,126\n1,626\n6,123\nCAFD\n$ 18,104\n$ 37,847\n$ 22,071\n(1)\nCosts incurred by the Partnership as a result of the strategic evaluation of the Proposed Transactions totaling $2.2 million, $1.9 million and zero in the first quarter of 2018, fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2017, respectively, as well as the release of deferred costs associated with the ATM Program totaling $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, were not excluded to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD.\n(2)\nRepresents acquisition-related financial advisory, legal and accounting fees associated with ROFO Project interests purchased.\n(3)\nRepresents the changes in fair value of interest rate swaps that were not designated as cash flow hedges.\n(4)\nRepresents our proportionate share of net interest expense, depreciation, amortization and accretion from our unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method.\n(5)\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates represents the earnings from the Solar Gen 2 Project, the North Star Project, the Lost Hills Blackwell Project, the Henrietta Project, and the Stateline Project and is included in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n(6)\nRepresents cash interest payments related to OpCo's senior secured credit facility and the Stateline Promissory Note.\n(7)\nRepresents the Short-Term Note, a promissory note from First Solar.\n(8)\nCash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates represent the cash received by OpCo with respect to its 49% interest in the Solar Gen 2 Project, the North Star Project, the Lost Hills Blackwell Project, and the Henrietta Project and its 34% interest in the Stateline Project.\n(9)\nRepresents indemnity payments from the Sponsors owed to OpCo in accordance with the Omnibus Agreement.\n(10)\nCash proceeds from sales-type residential leases, net, represent gross rental cash receipts for sales-type leases, less sales-type revenue and lease interest income that is already reflected in net income (loss) during the period. The corresponding revenue for such leases was recognized in the period in which such lease was placed in service, rather than in the period in which the rental payment was received, due to the characterization of these leases under U.S. GAAP.\n(11)\nTest electricity generation represents the sale of electricity that was generated prior to COD by Macy's Maryland Project for the three months ended February 28, 2017.
