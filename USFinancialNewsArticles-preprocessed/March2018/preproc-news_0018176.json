(NASDAQ:RDNT) , a national leader in providing high-quality, cost-effective, fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging services through a network of 297 owned and/or operated outpatient imaging centers, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Results\nFourth Quarter Report:\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, RadNet reported Revenue of $235.6 million, Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $40.7 million and Adjusted Net Income of $6.3 million. Revenue increased $10.6 million (or 4.7%), Adjusted EBITDA (1) increased $5.8 million (or 16.6%) and Net Income increased $2.6 million over the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted Net Income (adjusted for a one-time $13.5 million non-cash increase to our income tax expense in the quarter as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 and the revaluation of our deferred tax asset) for the fourth quarter was $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a Net Income of $0.08 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. These per share values are based upon a weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding of 47.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 46.4 million of diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAffecting Adjusted Net Income in the fourth quarter of 2017 were certain non-cash expenses and non-recurring items including: $944,000 of non-cash employee stock compensation expense resulting from the vesting of certain options and restricted stock; $255,000 of severance paid in connection with headcount reductions related to cost savings initiatives; $314,000 loss on the disposal of certain capital equipment; and $974,000 of amortization and write off of deferred financing costs and loan discount related to our existing credit facilities.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared with the prior year’s fourth quarter (and adjusting for the sale of our Rhode Island subsidiary in the second quarter of 2017), MRI volume increased 4.7%, CT volume increased 8.1% and PET/CT volume increased 11.6%. Overall volume, taking into account routine imaging exams, inclusive of x-ray, ultrasound, mammography and other exams, increased 3.4% over the prior year’s fourth quarter. On a same-center basis, including only those centers which were part of RadNet for both the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, MRI volume increased 3.1%, CT volume increased 7.2% and PET/CT volume increased 9.9%. Overall same-center volume, taking into account routine imaging exams, inclusive of x-ray, ultrasound, mammography and other exams, increased 2.5% from the prior year’s same quarter.\nDr. Howard Berger, President and Chief Executive Officer of RadNet, commented “I am very pleased with our fourth quarter results. It was the best financial quarter in our Company’s history, and included record Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. During 2017, we furthered our strategic plan in all aspects of our business: drove same center growth; established new joint ventures; expanded existing joint ventures; completed strategic acquisitions in our core markets; and grew our capitation business. Further, we completed the divestitures of some non-core assets and made important investments in our infrastructure to position ourselves to be an effective and scalable platform from which to grow. Healthcare is focused on migrating services towards ambulatory and lower cost settings. Not only do I believe RadNet is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, but I believe that we can continue to play a pivotal role with health plans, insurance companies, large medical groups and progressive health systems to accelerate and improve the changing landscape of the healthcare delivery system.”\nAnnual Report:\nFor full year 2017, the Company reported Revenue of $922.2 million, Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $142.5 million and Adjusted Net Income of $13.6 million. Revenue increased $37.7 million (or 4.3%) and Adjusted EBITDA (1) increased $9.5 million (or 7.1%). Adjusted Net Income for 2017 was $0.29 per diluted share, compared to Net Income of $0.15 per diluted share in 2016 (based upon a weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding of 47.4 million and 46.7 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively).\nAffecting Adjusted Net Income in 2017 were certain non-cash expenses and non-recurring items including: $6.8 million of non-cash employee stock compensation expense resulting from the vesting of certain options and restricted stock; $1.8 million of severance paid in connection with headcount reductions related to cost savings initiatives; $1.1 million loss on the disposal of certain capital equipment; $3.1 million gain on the sale of imaging centers; $3.2 million of expenses related to divested and closed operations; and $3.5 million of amortization and write off of deferred financing fees and discount on issuance of debt related to our existing credit facilities and refinancing transaction.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016 (and adjusting for the sale of our Rhode Island centers from both periods), MRI volume increased 4.8%, CT volume increased 6.7% and PET/CT volume increased 7.4%. Overall volume, taking into account routine imaging exams, inclusive of x-ray, ultrasound, mammography and other exams, increased 3.1% for the twelve months of 2017 over 2016.\nDr. Berger remarked, “In 2017, we demonstrated many of the aspects of our business that make RadNet unique within healthcare. We announced the establishment of significant joint ventures in Southern California with two large and well-respected health systems, Cedars Sinai and MemorialCare and expanded our existing joint venture with the RWJBarnabas health system in New Jersey as well as two of our venture partners in Maryland. We divested non-core assets, which included our facilities in Rhode Island and our Breastlink and oncological operations in California and redeployed the proceeds of the divestitures into highly strategic acquisitions in California, Maryland and Delaware. Our most significant acquisition was the purchase of Diagnostic Imaging Associates, the other significant outpatient operator in Delaware, which made us the largest outpatient provider of imaging services in that state. We also made strategic enhancements to the capabilities of our eRAD information technology platform, which is now fully deployed across the RadNet facilities. In 2017, we also made important investments in our infrastructure, particularly to our revenue cycle department by recruiting additional senior management talent, expanding customer service and patient collection teams and investing in tools and technology to increase productivity.”\nDr. Berger added, “2017 was also notable for improving our balance sheet by lowering our financial leverage from 4.8x Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA at year end 2016 to 4.0x at the end of 2017. We generated over $50 million of Free Cash Flow during 2017, ended the year undrawn on our $117 million revolving credit facility and had a cash balance of over $50 million. In August of 2017, we completed an amendment to our Senior Credit Facility which enabled us to retire the then existing Second Lien Term Loan, extend debt maturities and materially lower our cost of capital.”\nActual Results vs. 2017 Guidance:\nThe following compares the Company’s actual 2017 performance with previously announced revised guidance levels.\nRevised Guidance Range Actual Results Total Net Revenue (a) $895 million - $925 million $922.2 million Adjusted EBITDA (1) $135 million - $145 million $142.5 million Capital Expenditures (b) $55 million - $60 million $57.6 million Cash Interest Expense $35 million - $40 million $34.2 million Free Cash Flow Generation (c) $40 million - $50 million\n$50.7 million\n(a) Note the change from prior years. This metric is now after the subtraction of bad debt.\n(b) Net of proceeds from the sale of equipment, imaging centers and joint venture interests.\n(c) Defined by the Company as Adjusted EBITDA (1) less total capital expenditures and cash paid for interest.\nDr. Berger commented, “We met or exceeded our 2017 guidance levels in all categories. Our Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were at the high end of the guidance ranges. Our strong Adjusted EBITDA performance, controlled capital spending and lower interest expense than projected contributed to our exceeding Free Cash Flow guidance.”\n2018 Fiscal Year Guidance\nFor its 2018 fiscal year, RadNet announces its guidance ranges as follows:\nTotal Net Revenue $950 million - $975 million Adjusted EBITDA (1) $145 million - $155 million Capital Expenditures (a) $50 million - $55 million Cash Interest Expense $33 million - $38 million Free Cash Flow Generation (b) $50 million - $60 million\n(a) Net of proceeds from the sale of equipment, imaging centers and joint venture interests.\n(b) Defined by the Company as Adjusted EBITDA (1) less total capital expenditures and cash paid for interest.\nDr. Berger noted, “We are optimistic about 2018. First, Medicare rates for 2018 are commensurate with 2017 reimbursement. Second, we expect to benefit from some of the capital expenditures, infrastructure investments and acquisitions we made during 2017. Third, in 2018, we have launched the MemorialCare joint venture and expect to expand other joint ventures we currently operate on both costs. Fourth, we expect additional Revenue in 2018 from our continued adoption of 3D breast imaging. Fifth, we expect to continue to benefit from the migration of services from hospital settings to the outpatient marketplace. Lastly, we anticipate an ongoing earnings benefit from a significant reduction in our overall effective tax rate from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. It should also be noted that we are anticipating spending less on capital expenditures in 2018 than we did during the last two fiscal years as a result of having substantially completed the upgrade of our x-ray systems and the transition to 3D mammography.”\nConference Call for Today\nDr. Howard Berger, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Stolper, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call today, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Footnotes\n(1) The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, each from continuing operations and excludes losses or gains on the disposal of equipment, other income or loss, loss on debt extinguishments, bargain purchase gains and non-cash equity compensation. Adjusted EBITDA includes equity earnings in unconsolidated operations and subtracts allocations of earnings to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, and is adjusted for non-cash and extraordinary events which took place during the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used as analytical indicator by RadNet management and the healthcare industry to assess business performance, and is a measure of leverage capacity and ability to service debt. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity. As Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is therefore susceptible to varying methods of calculation, this metric, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n(2) As noted above, the Company defines Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less total Capital Expenditures (whether completed with cash or financed) and Cash Interest paid. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company uses Free Cash Flow because the Company believes it provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating activities. Free Cash Flow does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. In addition, our definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.\nFree Cash Flow should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity. As Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is therefore susceptible to varying methods of calculation, this metric, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSource:RadNet, Inc.",
