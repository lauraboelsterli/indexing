    "text": "ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia should accept Israel’s offer to supply its air force with F-16 fighter jets, the former Yugoslav republic’s national defense council said on Tuesday.\nCroatia asked five countries last year to bid for contracts to supply it with fighter jets: Sweden, Israel, the United States, Greece and South Korea.\nThe Israeli offer, which according to the media reports is worth some $500 million, includes a squadron of 12 already used F-16s.\n“The defense council has accepted that Israel made the best offer and accordingly gave a recommendation to the government,” the defense council, comprising top state and defense officials, said in a statement.\nIts recommendation must now be formally approved by the government.\nThe Swedish company Saab had offered a squadron of new Gripen fighters, in a proposal that local media reported was worth some 800 million euros ($992 million).\nCroatia joined the NATO alliance in 2009 and the European Union in 2013.\nIts air force currently operates a squadron of outdated MIG-21 fighter jets.\nReporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ",
