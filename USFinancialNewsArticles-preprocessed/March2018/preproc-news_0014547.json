    "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gold Resource Corporation (NYSE American:GORO) (the “Company” or “GRC”) today announced a seventh consecutive year of profitability, reporting net income of $4.2 million or $0.07 per share. Included in the financial results is a $7.3 million, or $0.13 per share, non-cash income tax expense related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Cash increased by $8.2 million to $22.4 million at year-end. The Company also confirmed its previously announced 2017 annual mill production of 28,117 gold ounces and 1,773,263 silver ounces for 52,050 precious metal gold equivalent ounces. The Company announced its 2018 precious metal Outlook targeting 27,000 ounces gold and 1,700,000 ounces silver plus or minus 10 percent. Gold Resource Corporation is a gold and silver producer, developer and explorer with operations in Oaxaca, Mexico and Nevada, USA. The Company has returned $110 million to its shareholders in monthly dividends since commercial production commenced July 1, 2010, and offers its shareholders the option to convert their cash dividends into physical gold and silver and take delivery.\n2017 ANNUAL HIGHLIGHTS\n7th consecutive year of profitability 7th consecutive year of organic growth $4.2 million net income, or $0.07 per share $75 total cash cost per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold $590 all-in sustaining cash cost per ounce (“AISC”) Cash increase of $8.2 million to $22.4 million $110 million net sales Achieved annual targets producing 28,117 gold ounces and 1,773,263 silver ounces 52,050 precious metal gold equivalent ounces produced (74.1:1 realized silver-to-gold ratio) 47,224 precious metal gold equivalent ounces sold 1,141 tonnes copper, 5,365 tonnes lead and 16,301 tonnes zinc produced $3.8 million physical gold and silver bullion treasury $1.1 million annual dividends paid, or $0.02 per share $110 million total dividends paid over 89 consecutive monthly distributions Acquired 5,300-acre East Camp Douglas property, Mineral County, Nevada Expanded Isabella Pearl Project to over 9,000 acres by acquiring additional 153 mining claims Acquired long lead-time capital equipment for Isabella Pearl Project, including crusher, radial stackers and conveyors, and commissioned “ADR” plant construction Extended strike length of Switchback vein system by 325 meters to 625 meters Completed full year of mine development at Switchback prior to initiating bulk tonnage mining 2017 Proven & Probable Reserve tonnes increased by 32%\n2017 Project Overview\n“I am pleased that Gold Resource Corporation delivered our seventh consecutive year of profitability,” stated Gold Resource Corporation CEO and President, Mr. Jason Reid. “During 2017, our Company posted annual net income of $4.2 million or $0.07 per share. That number factors in the $7.3 million in non-cash new tax law adjustments that lowered our earnings by $0.13 per share. We also returned $1.1 million back to our shareholders through dividends and added $8.2 million to our bank accounts, all while continuing to invest in the Company’s future growth in both Mexico and Nevada. We once again accomplished all of these highlights without diluting shareholders through equity sales and without going into long-term debt.”\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold 47,224 precious metal gold equivalent ounces at a total cash cost of $75 per gold equivalent ounce. Realized 2017 average sales prices were $1,267 per ounce gold and $17.10 per ounce silver. The Company recorded revenues of $110.2 million, mine gross profit of $42.1 million, and net income of $4.2 million, or $0.07 per share. Base metal production generated $57.6 million in revenue for 2017.\nThe calculation of our cash cost per ounce contained in this press release is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations\" contained in the Company’s most recent Form 10-K for a complete discussion and reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nThe following Production and Sales Statistics table summarizes certain information about our mining operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nProduction and Sales Statistics Three months ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Milled Tonnes Milled (1) 119,379 118,798 449,177 450,221 Tonnes Milled per Day (2) 1,357 1,373 1,301 1,295 Grade Average Gold Grade (g/t) 2.83 1.53 2.29 2.13 Average Silver Grade (g/t) 157 121 134 139 Average Copper Grade (%) 0.39 0.26 0.34 0.29 Average Lead Grade (%) 2.03 1.28 1.60 1.21 Average Zinc Grade (%) 4.95 3.98 4.39 3.78 Recoveries Average Gold Recovery (%) 85 87 85 89 Average Silver Recovery (%) 92 91 92 92 Average Copper Recovery (%) 72 82 75 78 Average Lead Recovery (%) 73 79 75 74 Average Zinc Recovery (%) 82 84 83 84 Mill production (before payable metal deductions) (3) Gold (ozs.) 9,209 5,088 28,117 27,628 Silver (ozs.) 555,550 419,683 1,773,263 1,857,658 Copper (tonnes) 337 258 1,141 1,035 Lead (tonnes) 1,782 1,202 5,365 4,049 Zinc (tonnes) 4,854 3,996 16,301 14,302 Payable metal sold Gold (ozs.) 7,700 4,330 25,221 25,426 Silver (ozs.) 508,133 366,667 1,630,003 1,704,336 Copper (tonnes) 297 224 1,066 964 Lead (tonnes) 1,633 1,168 4,932 3,797 Zinc (tonnes) 3,607 3,313 13,059 11,816 Average metal prices realized (4) Gold ($ per oz.) 1,279 1,184 1,267 1,256 Silver ($ per oz.) 16.60 16.17 17.10 17.18 Copper ($ per tonne) 7,164 5,499 6,354 4,792 Lead ($ per tonne) 2,531 2,224 2,371 1,936 Zinc ($ per tonne) 3,524 2,640 2,993 2,188 Precious metal gold equivalent ounces produced (mill production) (3) Gold Ounces 9,209 5,088 28,117 27,628 Gold Equivalent Ounces from Silver 7,210 5,730 23,933 25,395 Total Precious Metal Gold Equivalent Ounces 16,419 10,818 52,050 53,023 Precious metal gold equivalent ounces sold Gold Ounces 7,700 4,330 25,221 25,426 Gold Equivalent Ounces from Silver 6,594 5,006 22,003 23,299 Total Precious Metal Gold Equivalent Ounces 14,294 9,336 47,224 48,725 Total cash cost before by-product credits per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold (5) $ 1,157 $ 2,045 $ 1,294 $ 1,325 Total cash (credit) cost after by-product credits per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold (5) $ (170 ) $ 698 $ 75 $ 548 Total all-in sustaining cost per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold (5) $ 253 $ 918 $ 590 $ 845 Total all-in cost per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold (5) $ 270 $ 1,143 $ 617 $ 964\n(1) For the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, this includes nil, 17,605, 42,079 and 56,369 tonnes, respectively, of low-grade stockpile open pit ore. In addition, includes 3,019 and 6,350 tonnes of Mirador ore for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. (2) Based on actual days the Aguila processing facility operated during the period. (3) Mill production represents metal contained in concentrates produced at the Aguila processing facility, which is before payable metal deductions are levied by the buyer of our concentrates. Payable metal deduction quantities are defined in our contracts with the buyer of our concentrates and represent an estimate of metal contained in the concentrates produced at our Aguila processing facility which the buyer cannot recover through the smelting process. There are inherent limitations and differences in the sampling method and assaying of estimated metal contained in concentrates that are shipped, and those contained metal estimates are derived from sampling methods and assaying throughout the mill production process. The Company monitors these differences to ensure that precious metal mill production quantities are materially correct. (4) Average metal prices realized vary from the market metal prices due to final settlement adjustments from our provisional invoices when they are settled. Our average metal prices realized will therefore differ from the market average metal prices in most cases. (5) For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to total mine cost of sales, which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, please see Non-GAAP Measures in the Company’s most recently filed 10-K. 2018 Production Outlook\nThe Company is targeting 2018 annual production (with ranges based on plus or minus 10%) of 27,000 ounces gold and 1,700,000 ounces silver. The target range was estimated based on the Company’s 2018 mine plan, capital projects targeted for the year, the area of the deposit scheduled to be mined and estimated grade fluctuations.\nIn 2018, the Company remains focused on mining tonnes based on net smelter return (“NSR”) values per tonne of all metals to maximize cash flow. The Company will continue to focus on its overall margin from both precious and base metal production. Base metal production results in lower production costs per tonne and per ounce when used as a credit against production costs. The Company targets sufficient precious and base metal production in 2018 to support its plans for capital expenditures, exploration, dividends, taxes and future growth.\nYear-End 2017 Oaxaca Mining Unit Proven & Probable Reserve Update\nThe Company recently updated its 2017 Oaxaca Mining Unit Proven and Probable (“P&P”) Reserve Report as of December 31, 2017 in which it not only replaced the tonnes mined during 2017, but increased reserve tonnage by 32% to 2,501,100 tonnes grading 1.77 grams per tonne (“g/t”) gold and 136 g/t silver.\nMine life based on P&P at the Company’s Oaxaca Mining Unit has been increased from approximately three and one-half years to more than four and one-half years, assuming production at maximum throughput. Not included in the four and one-half year mine life calculation based on P&P is the report’s 1.8 million tonnes of mineralized material, of which the Company targets to convert into proven and probable reserves over time and with further delineation drilling. For additional details on the updated reserve report, please view the P&P press release dated March 8, 2018. The updated full reserve report will be available on the Company’s website in the near future. Third party Proven and Probable gold ounces from the Company’s Isabella Pearl development Project in Nevada, U.S.A. are not included in this December 31, 2017 reserve report.\nProject Update\nDuring 2017, the Arista Mine accounted for approximately 90% of production tonnage, with 55% coming from the Arista vein system and 35% from development ore from the Switchback vein system. The Aguila open pit supplied 8% of production tonnage, with the remaining 2% provided by the Mirador Mine. In 2017, the Company averaged 1,301 tonnes per day milled or 449,177 tonnes for the year. The nominal design capacity at the Aguila mill’s flotation circuit is 1,500 tonnes per day.\nThe Company successfully completed one full year of mine development during 2017 at the Arista Mine’s Switchback vein system before initiating bulk tonnage mining methods. Multiple stopes between levels 23 and 27 were prepared during 2017, with the first Switchback vein system stope coming online in February 2018. Development continues at the Switchback vein system, including the preparation of additional stopes, the installation of ventilation, construction of exploration drill pads, and the addition of water pumping stations.\nThe Arista vein system infill and step-out drilling continue to expand the mineralized horizon at the Arista deposit, with continued plans to drill vein extensions along strike, at depth and parallel to the deposit.\nSteady progress has been made in development and mining operations at the Company’s Alta Gracia Project, located 15 kilometers north west of the Aguila Project. The Company is initially targeting approximately 150 tonnes per day from the high-grade Mirador mine. In addition, a second historic portal near the Mirador Mine has been refurbished to access the Pitayo high-grade silver vein, which is expected to add additional working faces for mining operations at the Alta Gracia Project. Ore from Alta Gracia is trucked and processed through the Company’s agitated leach circuit at the Aguila Project.\nThe Company’s Nevada Mining Unit acquired 100% interest in the 5,300-acre East Camp Douglas property located in Mineral County, Nevada, U.S.A. in January 2017. The East Camp Douglas property was purchased because of its multi-gram high-grade gold drill intercepts and surface samples and its potential for open pit heap leach operations. The Company also purchased 153 additional mining claims contiguous to its Isabella Pearl Project, increasing the size of the Project to more than 9,000 acres.\nIn anticipation of receiving the final mine permit for the Isabella Pearl Project, the Company acquired long lead-time equipment in 2017 including a new crushing plant as well as new radial stacking and conveying equipment. The Company also placed an order of an “ADR” (absorption desorption, regeneration) plant, which is over 80% complete and expected to be delivered in mid-2018. The Company targets first Nevada gold production from Isabella Pearl at the earliest possible point in time subject to receiving a final mine permit, funding and construction timing.\nExploration Program\nThe highlight of 2017’s Oaxaca Mining Unit’s exploration program was the continued expansion and delineation of the Arista Mine’s Switchback vein system. Infill drilling at the Switchback vein system was successful in upgrading a significant portion of mineralized material into the Proven and Probable category. Step-out drilling at Switchback was also successful in significantly expanding the vein system along strike as well.\nThe main Oaxaca Mining Unit exploration focus for 2018 continues to be the extensions of the Arista Mine’s Arista and Switchback vein systems, both polymetallic epithermal vein systems which remain open along strike and at depth. Exploration drilling at the Alta Gracia Project is being conducted in and around the Mirador Mine. The Company has budgeted approximately $4.2 million for exploration at its Oaxaca Mining Unit for 2018.\nIn 2017, the Company completed successful drill programs at its Nevada Mining Unit’s Gold Mesa and Mina Gold properties. High-grade gold was intercepted at or near surface in multiple drill holes at both properties, and the Company plans additional drill programs in 2018 with a goal of expanding known mineralization. The Company anticipates spending approximately $2.0 million on exploration in Nevada during 2018.\nDividends\nThe Company maintained its instituted $0.02 per share annual dividend during the 2017 year, with dividends being distributed on a monthly basis. Total dividend distributions for 2017 totaled $1.1 million, or $0.02 per share. The Company has now distributed more than $110 million in dividends back to shareholders since July 2010.\nSee Accompanying Tables\nThe following information summarizes Gold Resource Corporation’s financial condition at December 31, 2017 and 2016, its results of operations including the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
