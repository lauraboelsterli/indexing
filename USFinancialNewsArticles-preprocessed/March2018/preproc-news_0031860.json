Washington has also backed growing European criticism of the Kremlin for its alleged role in the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the U.K. ‘From the very beginning we have supported parity regarding the number of individuals included in the sanctions list. Other steps are possible on our part, which we will calibrate, according to our own interests.’ Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov \nThe U.S. measures sanction 19 individuals and five entities, some of whom have already been hit by previous rounds, in what analysts agree is largely a symbolic strike against the Kremlin. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who is expected to win a presidential election on Sunday, has played the increasing tensions with the West to his advantage at home, presenting himself as a leader who can stand up to Europe and the U.S., who want to see Moscow brought to its knees. \nFurther measures from Moscow, although also likely more symbolic than practical, would represent the first escalation of a diplomatic tit-for-tat since last July. Then Moscow demanded Washington cut 755 diplomats and embassy staff in Russia in response to the administration of former President Barack Obama’s expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. ",
