    "text": "March 9th, 2018 South America \nPeru’s opposition-ruled Congress unanimously approved a bill on Thursday that aims to keep a massive corruption probe from paralyzing Peru’s construction sector. \nThe legislation, proposed by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski last month, will replace anti-graft rules that restrict the financial movements of companies that have acknowledged or been convicted of corruption. \nCritics have blamed the current rules, passed a year ago, for slowing economic growth and discouraging companies from telling prosecutors about bribes they may have taken part in or known about. \n  reuters.com",
