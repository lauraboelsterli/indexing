FILE PHOTO: Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of The Boeing Company, arrives at Trump Tower in New York City, U.S. January 17, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also told Reuters in an interview that Boeing was “making progress” in talks with the Brazilian aerospace company. It continues to study a number of possible structures for a deal, which some outside analysts have said could value Embraer at $5-6 billion. “Acquisitions of the scale of Embraer are not only very doable for us, they are also things we can selectively do, aligned with our (cash deployment) strategy,” Muilenburg said.
