Total revenue for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $8.4 million, or 15%, from $54.7 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Of the $8.4 million increase in total revenue, $6.8 million was attributable to the Water segment and $1.7 million was attributable to the Oil & Gas segment.\nThe Water segment generated total product revenue of $54.3 million for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $47.5 million for fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The $6.8 million, or 14% increase in product revenue was due to higher Mega Project (\"MPD\") and Original Equipment Manufacturer (\"OEM\") shipments in 2017.\nThe Oil & Gas segment generated total revenue of $8.9 million for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.2 million for fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The $1.7 million, or 24% increase in revenue was due to higher percentage-of-completion (\"PoC\") revenue recognition associated with the sale of multiple IsoBoost® systems as compared to 2016. License and development revenue of $5.0 million was recognized in both 2017 and 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company generated total revenue of $22.4 million. Revenue increased by $4.5 million, or 25%, from $17.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Of the $4.5 million increase in revenue, $5.6 million was attributed to an increase in Water segment revenue due to higher MPD and OEM shipments in the fourth quarter of 2017, offset by a $1.1 million decrease in the Oil & Gas segment revenue due to lower PoC revenue recognition associated with the aforementioned sale of multiple IsoBoost systems. License and development revenue of $1.25 million was recognized in each of the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGross Margin\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, product gross margin was 67.2%. Product gross margin increased by 310 basis points from 64.1% in 2016. This increase was largely driven by favorable price and product mix, manufacturing efficiencies, and higher production levels in the Water segment.

Total gross margin (1) increased 240 basis points from 67.4% in 2016.\nThe Water segment generated product gross margin of 70.5% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Water segment product gross margin increased by 490 basis points, compared to 65.6% in 2016. This increase was largely driven by favorable price and product mix, manufacturing efficiencies, and higher production levels in 2017.\nThe Oil & Gas segment generated product gross margin of 21.4% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 31.1% in 2016. This decrease was attributable to higher project costs and revenue adjustments. Including license and development revenue, the Oil & Gas segment total gross margin (1) for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was 65.8%.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, product gross margin was 68.5%.

Total gross margin (1) increased 350 basis points from 66.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, operating expenses were $40.8 million, an increase of $4.3 million from $36.5 million for fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in the Oil & Gas and Water segments.\nThe Water segment operating expenses for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were $8.9 million, an increase of $0.8 million from $8.1 million for fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.

This increase in operating expenses was primarily due to continued investment in research and development activities in the Oil & Gas segment and higher sales and marketing expenses in Water segment.\nBottom Line Summary\nTo summarize our financial performance, on a full year basis, the Company reported a net income of $12.4 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $1.0 million, or $0.02 per diluted share in 2016. This increase was driven by a tax benefit of $8.4 million, which included a net release of tax valuation allowance, a one-time tax expense related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and other tax adjustments. Excluding the tax benefit, net income for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.07 per diluted share.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company reported a net income of $11.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net income of $3.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. As noted above, this increase was driven by a tax benefit of $8.4 million. Excluding the tax benefit, net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.06 per diluted share.\nCash Flow Highlights\nThe Company ended the quarter with unrestricted cash of $27.8 million, current and non-current restricted cash of $2.8 million, and short-term investments of $70.0 million, all of which represent a combined total of $100.6 million.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 million driven by $12.4 million of net income, offset by $5.0 million amortization of the VorTeq TM License Agreement exclusivity fee, $4.1 million increase in working capital, and $0.4 million of non-cash adjustments, the largest of which were $8.9 million of income related to deferred income taxes, $4.1 million of share-based compensation, and $3.7 million of depreciation and amortization. Cash used in investing activities was $37.4 million driven by $31.5 million of net purchases of marketable securities and $7.4 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $1.5 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $0.9 million, driven by $5.5 million collected from the issuance of common stock related to option exercises, partially offset by $4.3 million in repurchases of common stock and $0.3 million in vested restricted shares withheld for tax withholdings.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this press release and on the conference call are \" \" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the Company's belief that the current expansion phase in the desalination business cycle will continue through 2018, and the Company's belief that it will make material progress towards commercialization of the VorTeq system throughout 2018. These are based on information currently available to us and on management's beliefs, assumptions, estimates, or projections and are not guarantees of future events or results. Potential risks and uncertainties include our ability to achieve the milestones under the VorTeq license agreement, any other factors that may have been discussed herein regarding the risks and uncertainties of our business, and the risks discussed under \"Risk Factors\" in our Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") for the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as other reports filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time. Because such involve risks and uncertainties, the Company's actual results may differ materially from the predictions in these . All are made as of today, and the Company assumes no obligation to update such statements.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including total gross margin. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same captions, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its operating performance and future prospects, develop internal budgets and financial goals, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of its operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.\n(1)\n\"Total gross margin\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the discussion under headings \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nConference Call to Discuss Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nLIVE CONFERENCE CALL:\nThursday, March 8, 2018, 7:00 AM PST / 10:00 AM EST\nListen-only, US / Canada Toll-free: 877-709-8150\nListen-only, Local / International Toll: (+1) 201-689-8354\nAccess code: 13676918\nCONFERENCE CALL REPLAY:\nExpiration: Sunday, April 8, 2018\nUS / Canada Toll-free: 877-660-6853\nLocal / International Toll: (+1) 201-612-7415\nAccess code: 13676918\nInvestors may also access the live call or the replay over the internet at ir.energyrecovery.com .
