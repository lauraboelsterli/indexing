    "text": "TORONTO, March 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (TSX:UTE.UN) Canadian Utilities & Telecom Income Fund (the “Fund”) announces results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Increase in net assets attributable to equity holders amounted to $0.96 million or $0.37 per unit. As at December 31, 2017, net assets attributable to equity holders were $18.11 million or $9.95 per unit. Cash distributions to equity holders totaling $1.86 million or $0.74 per unit were paid during the year.\nThe Fund’s investment objectives are (i) to pay unitholders monthly distributions in an amount targeted to be 7.0% per annum on the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund; and (ii) to preserve and enhance the Fund’s NAV while reducing portfolio volatility.\nThe Fund achieves its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio consisting principally of equity securities of large capitalization (over $1 billion) Utilities and, to a lesser degree, Telecommunications issuers listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”). Issuers selected for inclusion in the portfolio must have a minimum distribution yield of 2.0% per annum.\nThe Fund may also invest up to 25% of the Fund’s NAV in equity securities of other Utilities and Telecommunications issuers listed on a North American stock exchange, subject to a minimum market capitalization of $250 million and a minimum distribution yield of 2.0% per annum.\nThe Fund employs a proprietary investment strategy, Strathbridge Selective Overwriting (SSO), to enhance the income generated by the portfolio and to reduce volatility. The Fund may, from time to time, selectively write covered call options in respect of up to a maximum of 25 percent of the securities in the portfolio.\nThe Fund’s investment portfolio is managed by its investment manager, Strathbridge Asset Management Inc. The Fund’s units are listed on TSX under the symbol UTE.UN.\nSelected Financial Information: ($ Millions) Statement of Financial Position 2017 As at December 31 Assets $ 18.36 Liabilities (0.25 ) Net Assets Attributable to Equity Holders $ 18.11 Statement of Comprehensive Income For the year ended December 31 Income (including Net Gain on Investments) $ 1.76 Expenses (0.80 ) Increase in Net Assets Attributable to Equity Holders $ 0.96 For further information, please contact Investor Relations at 416.681.3966, toll free at 1.800.725.7172 or visit www.strathbridge.com\nJohn Germain, Senior Vice-President & CFO Strathbridge Asset Management Inc.\n121 King Street West\nSuite 2600\nToronto, Ontario, M5H 3T9\n416.681.3966; 1.800.725.7172\nwww.strathbridge.com\ninfo@strathbridge.com\nCommissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with investment funds.
