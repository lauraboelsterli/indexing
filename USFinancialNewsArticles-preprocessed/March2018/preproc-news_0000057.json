    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nektar Therapeutics (Nasdaq: NKTR) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash and investments in marketable securities at December 31, 2017 were $353.2 million as compared to $389.1 million at December 31, 2016. This does not include $1.85 billion in upfront payments from the new Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration, which was announced on February 14, 2018.\n\"This past year was truly transformational for Nektar as we achieved a number of successes with Nektar medicines across our three key therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology, immunology and pain,\" said Howard W. Robin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nektar. \"In the area of pain, we completed a successful Phase 3 program for NKTR-181 in over 2,100 patients and healthy volunteers that will comprise our NDA submission in the second quarter of this year. In immunology, we entered into a major partnership with Eli Lilly for NKTR-358, a potential first-in-class T regulatory resolution therapeutic, which will be developed to treat a broad range of auto-immune disorders. Finally, in immuno-oncology, the clinical success we achieved with NKTR-214 led to a groundbreaking collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb that now enables us to broadly and rapidly advance NKTR-214 into over 20 registrational trials in up to 15,000 patients.\"\nSummary of Financial Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $95.5 million as compared to $37.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a total of $60.0 million of non-recurring revenue related to a new sublicense agreement, a contract settlement agreement and the recognition of deferred revenue from several collaboration agreements.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $307.7 million as compared to $165.4 million in 2016. Revenue in 2017 included recognition of $130.1 million of the $150.0 million upfront payment from Nektar's collaboration with Eli Lilly & Company for the development and commercialization of NKTR-358.\nTotal operating costs and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $119.5 million as compared to $69.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total operating costs and expenses increased primarily as a result of higher research and development (R&D) expense. Total operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $367.4 million as compared to $278.3 million in 2016.\nR&D expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $81.4 million as compared to $50.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. R&D expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $268.5 million as compared to $203.8 million in 2016. R&D expense was higher in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily because of expenses for our pipeline programs, including the completion of Phase 3 clinical studies for NKTR-181, Phase 1/2 clinical studies of NKTR-214 and NKTR-358, and IND-enabling activities for NKTR-262 and NKTR-255.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expense was $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. G&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $52.4 million as compared to $44.3 million in 2016.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $33.8 million or $0.21 loss per share as compared to a net loss of $42.2 million or $0.28 loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $96.7 million or $0.62 loss per share as compared to a net loss of $153.5 million or $1.10 loss per share in 2016.\n2017 and Year-to-Date Business Highlights\nIn February 2018, Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into a global development and commercialization agreement to evaluate the full potential of NKTR-214 plus Opdivo ® (nivolumab) in more than 20 indications in 9 tumor types including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder and triple negative breast cancer. The first pivotal studies in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma are expected to be initiated in mid-2018. In December 2017, Nektar submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NKTR-262, a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors (TLRs) found on innate immune cells in the body. The REVEAL Phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor effect of NKTR-262, administered in combination with NKTR-214 (doublet) and in combination with NKTR-214 and nivolumab (triplet), in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancers. The company plans to enroll the first patients in the REVEAL study in March of 2018. In November 2017, Nektar announced positive data from the dose-escalation stage of the PIVOT-02 study of NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo at the 2017 SITC conference. Results showed compelling response rates and favorable safety data in both PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. In September 2017, Nektar initiated the PROPEL clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors, TECENTRIQ ® (atezolizumab) and KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) in patients with bladder and non-small cell lung cancer. Data from the PROPEL study is expected in the second half of 2018. In July 2017, Nektar and Eli Lilly announced a strategic collaboration to develop and commercialize NKTR-358, a potential first-in-class resolution therapeutic, that addresses an underlying immune system imbalance in patients with auto-immune conditions. A Phase 1 singe-ascending dose study is underway and a Phase 1/2 multiple-ascending dose study of NKTR-358 in patients with lupus is planned to begin in the second quarter of 2018. In July 2017, Nektar announced positive results from a Human Abuse Potential (HAP) study of NKTR-181, a first-in-class opioid analgesic. In May 2017, Nektar announced a new research collaboration with Takeda to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda's cancer portfolio including a SYK-inhibitor and a proteasome inhibitor. In March 2017, Nektar announced positive results from the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study of NKTR-181 in over 600 patients with chronic low back pain. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study demonstrated significantly improved chronic back pain relief with NKTR-181 compared to placebo (p=0.0019). Key secondary endpoints of the study also achieved high statistical significance. The study demonstrated that NKTR-181 had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated.\nThe company also announced upcoming presentations at the following scientific congresses during the first half of 2018:\nAmerican Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2018, Chicago, IL:\nAbstract 3755/Poster 5: \"Comprehensive antitumor immune activation by a novel TLR7/8 targeting agent NKTR-262 combined with CD122-biased immunostimulatory cytokine NKTR-214\", Kivimae, S., et al.
