    "text": "ANKARA, March 23 (Reuters) - Kurdish militant PKK group is withdrawing from Iraq’s Sinjar, the Firat news agency, which is close to the PKK, said on Friday, citing a statement by the KCK umbrella group, after Turkey threatened military action there.\n“Guerrilla forces intervened in Sinjar in order to rescue the Yazidis from genocide. With the confidence of reaching this goal, guerrillas are withdrawing from Sinjar,” KCK said in a statement on Friday, the Firat news agency reported.\nKCK is an umbrella group that includes the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party), PYD (Democratic Union Party), PJAK (Kurdistan Free Life Party), and PCDK (Kurdistan Democratic Solution Party).
