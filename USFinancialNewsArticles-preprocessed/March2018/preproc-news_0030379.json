Toure has shunned internationals since leading the Ivorians to the African Nations Cup title in early 2015 but made a surprise announcement in December that he wanted to return despite the country failing to rech this year’s World Cup. Soccer Football - Premier League - Burnley vs Manchester City - Turf Moor, Burnley, Britain - February 3, 2018 Manchester City's Yaya Toure warms up on the sideline during the match Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff Eric Bailly of Manchester United and Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha, both just back from injury, were also named by caretaker coach Ibrahim Kamara in a 24-man squad to play Togo on March 24 and Moldova three days later, both in Beauvais.
