    "text": "TEMPE, Ariz., March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VirTra, Inc. (Nasdaq:VTSI) (the “Company”), a global provider of simulators for the law enforcement, military, educational and commercial markets, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and 12 months ended December 31, 2017. The financial statements are available on VirTra’s website and here .\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial Highlights:\nQ4 2017 Q4 2016 % Δ FY 2017 FY 2016 % Δ Revenues $2.4M $3.0M (20.8)% $16.5M $15.7M 5.6% Gross Profit $0.9M $1.9M (50.2)% $10.2M $9.7M 5.7% Gross Margin 39.5% 62.9% (23.4)% 61.9% 61.9% 0.0% Income (Loss) from Operations $(1.5)M $(0.3)M N/A $1.3M $2.1M (38.6)% Impairment on Investment $0.6M - N/A $0.6M - N/A Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $(2.6)M - N/A $(2.5)M $0.1M N/A Net Income (Loss) $0.5M $(0.3)M N/A $3.3M $2.1M 59.1% Diluted EPS $0.06 $(0.04) N/A $0.39 $0.24 71.1% Adjusted EBITDA $1.8M $2.5M (28.0)% Business and Financial Highlights:\nAccepted onto the Nasdaq Capital Market and registered our common stock with the SEC, effective March 29, 2018. Received three delivery orders valued at approximately $4.6 million for law enforcement simulators under the previously announced indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with the United States Department of State (DOS). Formed a strategic partnership with Haley Strategic Partners, a provider of sophisticated firearms training, solutions and accessories, called “D7 Powered by VirTra.” Announced an order valued at $1.38 million with delivery to occur to a country in Africa, furthering VirTra’s international expansion. Installed a VirTra V-300™ simulator for the O’Fallon (Missouri) Police Department in its newly built Justice Center. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2.7 million for 2017 compared to $1.8 million for 2016. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $5.1 million at December 31, 2017, up from $3.7 million at December 31, 2016.\n“In 2017 not only did we exceed our previous year’s record revenue level but we also invested in improving our ability to serve our customers and shareholders in the future,” commented Bob Ferris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VirTra. “The simulator training industry continues to grow through new customer adoption and interest for our solutions is robust. Orders booked in the first quarter for delivery and recognition during 2018 represent a record for VirTra, bolstering our confidence that 2018 will be another record year with great potential for top and bottom-line growth. This progress validates our decision to invest to improve our entire organization to meet growing demand. Our customers, increasingly, are recognizing the value and benefits of simulations-based training, helping expand our addressable market and reinforcing our confidence in market demand. From that standpoint, 2017 was a year of investment, in people, processes, and enhanced solutions to build on VirTra’s already exceptional reputation in the market. Moving to the Nasdaq is an important step in this process, as a Nasdaq listing – along with our strong balance sheet -- provides confidence and comfort to potential customers around the world. In addition, our strong balance sheet and Nasdaq listing increases the number of potential acquisitions for us to carefully consider, creating additional growth opportunity for VirTra. As I look to the future, I have never been more excited about VirTra’s long-term potential, and I believe 2018 has the potential to be a very good year for us and our shareholders.”\n“While 2017 was a solid year for VirTra, the fourth quarter was impacted by a combination of accommodating customer delivery schedules that resulted in lower recognized revenue and one-time costs allocated to the fourth quarter,” continued Mr. Ferris. “To be sure, timing of orders and deliveries and revenue recognition rules can result in quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. The shifting of certain deliveries from late 2017 into mid-2018, coupled with continued strong demand and a higher-performing sales organization, bolsters our confidence in VirTra’s future.”\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal revenues were $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $3.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 20.8%. The year-over-year decrease was due to the timing of certain orders under contracts being delivered ahead of schedule and therefore being recognized during the third quarter 2017, while other orders were delayed by customers, shifting revenue into future periods.\nGross profit was $940,000, or 39.5% gross profit margin, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to gross profit of $1.9 million, or 62.9% gross margin, for the fourth quarter of 2016, a gross profit decrease of 50%. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to a non-recurring, non-cash adjustment in the carrying value of certain inventory.\nNet operating expense was $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The higher expense was primarily due to expanding staffing levels, annual increases in payroll and benefits for current staff, sales and marketing expansion, increases in non-recurring public company related one-time costs, new research and development work and IT infrastructure upgrades. Approximately $411,000 of these costs are non-recurring in nature.\nLoss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.5 million compared to a loss from operations of $303,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to decreases in revenues and increases in net operating expense to include $411,000 of costs that are non-recurring in nature.\nDuring the fourth quarter, VirTra recorded a non-cash, non-recurring income tax benefit of $2.6 million, reflecting a reversal of the Company’s previously established valuation allowance, partially offset by the effect of a change in the federal income tax rate due to federal income tax reform, applied to VirTra’s deferred tax assets and miscellaneous state income taxes.\nIn addition, management regularly evaluates the recoverability of its investment based on the investee company’s performance and financial position. During the fourth quarter, VirTra recognized an impairment loss of $613,000 related to the investment in Modern Round Entertainment Corporation.\nInclusive of this income tax benefit and the impairment loss, net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $470,000, or $(0.06) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $311,000, or ($0.04) per basic and diluted share, for the prior year’s fourth quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $(1,553,287) for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $(106,671) for the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 1,356%.\nFinancial Results for the 12 Months Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal revenues were $16.5 million for the full year 2017 compared to $15.7 million for the full year 2016, an increase of 5.6%. Gross profit was $10.2 million, or 61.9% gross profit margin, for the full year 2017 compared to gross profit of $9.7 million, or also 61.9% gross profit margin, for the full year 2016, a gross profit increase of 5.7%. Net operating expense was $8.9 million for the full year 2017 compared to $7.6 million for the full year 2016.\nIncome from operations for the full year 2017 was $1.3 million compared to $2.1 million for the full year 2016. Inclusive of the $2.5 million income tax benefit and the impairment loss described above, full-year net income was $3.3 million for 2017, or $0.41 per basic and $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $2.1 million, or $0.26 per basic and $0.24 per diluted share, for the full year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1.8 million for the full year 2017 compared to $2.5 million for the full year 2016, a decrease of 28.0% and includes $411,000 one-time costs and expenses associated with registering the company with the SEC and preparing the company to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nStockholders’ equity increased to $10.5 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $6.4 million at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were $5.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $3.7 million at December 31, 2016. The Company had essentially no outstanding bank debt at December 31, 2017.\nShare Repurchase\nSince June, 2017 the Company has been repurchasing shares of its common stock under the current share repurchase authorization approved by its Board of Directors in October of 2016. To date, these shares have been purchased in the open market pursuant to a trading plan that has been adopted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Adjusted EBITDA means net income (i) plus depreciation, (ii) plus non-cash stock option granted expense, and (iii) plus provision for income taxes. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently. We calculate adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is presented herein because management believes the presentation of adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to the Company’s investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and because adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, several of which present EBITDA and a form of adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative for net (loss) income, cash flows from operating activities and other consolidated income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is provided in the following table:\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income/(Loss) $ 470,176 $ (311,164 ) $ 3,262,281 $ 2,050,022 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 66,354 69,650 270,881 192,602 Non-cash stock option expense 7,124 87,796 167,475 181,786 Treasury stock cancelled - - - 2,981 Other income-receipt of unclaimed property - 17,913 - (17,913 ) Impairment loss on MREC 613,241 - 613,241 - Provision for income taxes (2,710,182 ) 29,134 (2,505,292 ) 102,753 Adjusted EBITDA $ (1,553,287 ) $ (106,671 ) $ 1,808,586 $ 2,512,231\nSource:VirTra, Inc.",
