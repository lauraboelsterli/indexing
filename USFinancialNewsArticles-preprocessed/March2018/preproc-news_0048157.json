    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government on Wednesday declined to comment on reports that lender Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) has begun searching for a new chief executive.\nFILE PHOTO: A statue is pictured next to the logo of Germany's Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, Germany September 30, 2016. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo “Deutsche Bank is a private company. I’ll therefore refrain here from doing any speculation...,” government spokesman Steffen Seibert said during a news conference.\nTwo people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that Deutsche Bank’s chairman of the board, Paul Achleitner, is looking for a new CEO to replace John Cryan as investors grow frustrated with the slow turnaround of the loss-making German lender.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber, editing by Thomas Escritt\n ",
