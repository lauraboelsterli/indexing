Christensen, partner at accounting firm Margolin Winer & Evens.\n\"It's a question that's one of many asked as a result of this sweeping tax legislation,\" he said.\nLeaving New York for Florida sounds like a no-brainer, yet tax professionals warn that entrepreneurs should proceed with caution. It'll take more than just moving your headquarters to ramp up your savings.\nHere's what you should know before relocating.\nLocation, location, location The issue of \"tax nexus\" — where you conduct your business — matters when it comes to whether you can easily pack up and move.\nEstablishing a tax nexus is based on a number of factors, including where your employees are, where your property is located and whether you have inventory in a particular location.\nBased on whether you have a nexus in a given state and the nature of your business, your company may be required to pay income and sales taxes there.\nClick on the image below for more information on sales taxes across the country.\nThis is why it's easy for a one-person shop — say, an Uber driver — to pick up and move from New York to Florida, but it's not so simple for a business with multiple locations and a wide client base.\n\"If half of my property is in North Carolina and half in New York, I need to file returns in both states,\" Christensen said. \"The taxes apportioned to those states will be based on shipments of property, where services are provided, and where the property is.\"\nStates themselves also use different methods to collect taxes from companies. Some assess levies based on where the work is performed, while others tax businesses based on where the customers are located.\nChanging residency Maybe you and your business can easily flee to a state with lower taxes.\nIn that case, you'll need to establish domicile — your true permanent home — in that new state in order to benefit from their friendlier taxes.\n\"We would recommend a driver's license change and updating your voter's registration, but it goes beyond that,\" said Christensen. \"It's where your social clubs are, where you return when you go on vacation.\"\nSee below for a breakdown of state income taxes.\nWork with your tax planner to make sure you get this right.\nNew York, which has a top marginal income tax rate of 8.82 percent, has been known to challenge individuals who claim to have left the Empire State for income-tax-free Florida.\nStructure matters Hero Images | Getty Images If it's difficult to uproot your business, talk to your accountant about whether it makes sense to change your company's structure from a pass-through entity to a C-corp.\nUnder the new tax law, pass-through entities — including S-corps, partnerships and limited liability companies — may qualify for a 20 percent deduction of qualified business income.\nThese small businesses get their name from the way income and profits \"pass through\" to the owner's individual tax return. Pass-throughs are subject to individual income tax rates, which run as high as 37 percent.\nBusiness owners with C-corps can take aggressive deductions — and they're subject to a corporate tax rate of 21 percent.\n\"If you're paying taxes in many different states, you should consider the large state and local income tax deduction that you can get as a C-corp but not as a pass-through entity,\" said Mark Nash, a tax partner at PwC.\nHowever, C-corps are subject to double taxation, meaning profits are taxed to the corporation and then levied a second time when shareholders get their dividends.\nYour accountant may help you develop a strategy to soften the blow.\n\"You might be able to avoid the double tax if you reinvest in the growth of the business,\" Nash said.\nMore from Personal Finance\nHere are the highest and lowest state and local taxes\nFour quirky tax deductions that could save you money\nHow to navigate that 20 percent tax break for small businesses.",
