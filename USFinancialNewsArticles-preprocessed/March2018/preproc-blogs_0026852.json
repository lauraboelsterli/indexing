    "text": "UPDATE 1-Rwandan economy grew 6.1 percent last year Published 7:33 AM ET Tue, 13 March 2018 Reuters \n(Adds further details) \nKIGALI, March 13 (Reuters) - Rwanda's economy grew 6.1 percent last year, accelerating slightly from 5.9 percent in 2016, boosted by better performances in agriculture and other sectors, the statistics office said on Tuesday. \nIn a statement, the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) said there was a good harvest of food crops last year which helped the agricultural sector to expand by 7 percent from the previous year. \nNISR said there was also a surge in production of mining and quarrying products, especially coltan and cassiterite. \nThe manufacturing sector too recorded healthy activity as output of cereals, textiles, clothes and leather products increased.
