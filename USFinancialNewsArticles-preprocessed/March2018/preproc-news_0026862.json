    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 8:53 AM / in 15 minutes Positive earnings give European shares a boost Reuters Staff 2 Min Read MILAN (Reuters) - European shares rose in early trading on Thursday helped by good-looking results from companies including insurance heavyweights Munich Re ( MUVGn.DE ) and Generali ( GASI.MI ) and Old Mutual ( OML.L ). The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Staff/Remote Their shares all rose more than 1 percent, pushing Europe’s insurance index to lead sectoral gainers and helping the pan-European STOXX 600 index rise 0.3 percent by 0811 GMT. Top gainer on the STOXX was British valve maker Spirax-Sarco Engineering ( SPX.L ), up 3.3 percent after it reported better-than-expected full-year revenues and profit. However Dufry ( DUFN.S ) shares fell 6.5 percent after results with traders attributing the drop to a lack of clarity on its dividend plans, while lower-than-expected quarterly sales sent the world’s No. 2 fashion retailer H&M ( HMb.ST ) down 4.3 percent. Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) was a weak spot in a positive banking sector, down 2.5 percent, after the French bank announced the unexpected departure of its deputy chief executive Didier Valet. Among country benchmarks, UK's FTSE .FTSE was up 0.2 percent and Germany's DAX .GDAXI added 0.5 percent. Reporting by Danilo Masoni, editing by Julien Ponthus",
