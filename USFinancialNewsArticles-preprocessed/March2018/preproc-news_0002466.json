    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. (NYSE: AHP) (\"Ashford Prime\" or the \"Company\") today reported the following results and performance measures for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. The performance measurements for Occupancy, Average Daily Rate (ADR), Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), and Hotel EBITDA are comparable assuming each of the hotel properties in the Company's hotel portfolio as of December 31, 2017 were owned as of the beginning of each of the periods presented. Unless otherwise stated, all reported results compare the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, with the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 (see discussion below). The reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\nSTRATEGIC OVERVIEW\nFocused strategy of investing in luxury hotels and resorts Targets conservative leverage levels of 45% Net Debt to Gross Assets Highly-aligned management team and advisory structure Dividend yield of approximately 7.4%\nFINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $23.2 million or $0.65 per diluted share. For the full year of 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $16.2 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Comparable RevPAR for all hotels that did not incur business interruption claims decreased 1.1% to $174.39 during the fourth quarter Comparable RevPAR for all hotels not under renovation decreased 2.7% to $181.23 during the fourth quarter Comparable Hotel EBITDA Margin for all hotels increased 299 basis points to 30.3% for the quarter Comparable Hotel EBITDA flow-through for all hotels was ­­­­101% for the quarter Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was $0.31 per diluted share for the quarter as compared with $0.34 per diluted share from the prior-year quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $22.0 million for the quarter, compared with $21.6 million for the prior year quarter During the quarter, the Company booked $4.1 million of business interruption income related to lost profits at the Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas and the Pier House Resort during September, October and November 2017 During the quarter, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement with Marriott to convert its Courtyard San Francisco Downtown hotel to an Autograph Collection property During the quarter, the Company announced that it had completed the sale of its Marriott Plano Legacy hotel in Plano, Texas for $104 million Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the 266-room Ritz-Carlton Sarasota in Sarasota, FL for $171 million ($643,000 per key) Capex invested during the quarter was $10.3 million\nUPDATE ON IMPACT FROM HURRICANES AND CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES\nAs previously announced, the Company's Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas resort received physical damage from Hurricane Irma and the Company continues to work with its insurers to assess the damage and impact to operations. Three of the six guestroom buildings on the property were damaged, and the Company, along with Ritz-Carlton, continues to work on a comprehensive capital investment plan to rebuild the resort. The resort, which represents 8.3% of Ashford Prime's Hotel EBITDA on a trailing twelve-month basis through the fourth quarter, remains functioning and currently has 83 of its 180 guest rooms available for those taking part in the recovery effort. The resort has suspended online reservations until October 2018.\nThe Company's Pier House Resort & Spa sustained minor physical damage from Hurricane Irma, and the hotel is currently accepting reservations and has resumed operations with all of its 142 guest rooms available and in service.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company recognized $4.1 million of business interruption income for these two properties related to lost profits for the period of September through November. The Company will continue to work with its insurers on the business interruption claim at these properties.\nDuring the quarter, the Company's two properties in Yountville, California – the Bardessono Hotel & Spa and the Hotel Yountville – were negatively impacted by the wildfires that affected Northern California. While neither property incurred any physical damage to their structures, the fires had a significant impact on the business operations of the hotels and the Company is in the process of working with its insurers on business interruption claims. As part of that effort, the Company expects to record $2.3 million in business interruption income in the first quarter for lost profits from the fourth quarter at these two hotels. The Company has a deductible of $500,000 associated with this claim.\nRITZ-CARLTON SARASOTA ACQUISITION\nOn February 16, 2018, the Company announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the 266-room Ritz-Carlton Sarasota in Sarasota, FL for $171 million ($643,000 per key). The purchase price represents a trailing twelve month cap rate, as of December 31, 2017, of 6.0% and the Company expects to realize a stabilized unleveraged yield of approximately 8% on its investment. To fund the acquisition, the Company plans to use cash on its balance sheet as well as either drawing on its revolving credit line or securing a non-recourse mortgage loan on the property. The acquisition is expected to close in April 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. Because the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, the Company can give no assurance that the transaction will be consummated by such date or at all.\nUPDATE ON NON-CORE HOTELS STRATEGY\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company announced the finalization of its strategy for its non-core hotels. On November 1, 2017, the Company announced plans to convert its Courtyard San Francisco Downtown hotel to an Autograph Collection hotel by December 2019 pursuant to a conversion PIP currently estimated to be approximately $30 million incremental to capital projects already underway - including updates to the guestrooms, guest bathrooms, corridors, lobby, restaurant, facade, and meeting space - which will create a distinctive theme and style for the property that is commensurate with the Autograph Collection product. Marriott will continue to manage the property after the conversion.\nAdditionally, on November 1, 2017, the Company announced that it had completed the sale of its Marriott Plano Legacy hotel in Plano, Texas for $104 million. The Company also announced that it is in the process of marketing for sale its other non-core hotel, the Renaissance Tampa in Tampa, FL.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had total assets of $1.4 billion. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $826 million of mortgage debt of which $48 million related to its joint venture partner's share of debt on the Capital Hilton and Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. The Company's total combined debt had a blended average interest rate of 4.3%.\nPORTFOLIO REVPAR\nAs of December 31, 2017, the portfolio consisted of twelve properties. During the fourth quarter of 2017, seven of the Company's hotels were not under renovation. The Company believes reporting its operating metrics for its hotels on a comparable total basis (all 12 hotels) and comparable not under renovation basis (7 hotels) is a measure that reflects a meaningful and focused comparison of the operating results in its portfolio. Details of each category are provided in the tables attached to this release.\nComparable RevPAR decreased 9.2% to $188.15 for all hotels on a 5.3% decrease in ADR and a 4.2% decrease in occupancy Comparable RevPAR decreased 2.7% to $181.23 for hotels not under renovation on a 0.8% decrease in ADR and a 1.9% decrease in occupancy Comparable RevPAR decreased 1.1% for all hotels that did not incur business interruption claims on a 2.2% increase in ADR and a 3.2% decrease in occupancy\nHOTEL EBITDA MARGINS AND QUARTERLY SEASONALITY TRENDS\nThe Company believes year-over-year Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA Margin comparisons are more meaningful to gauge the performance of the Company's hotels than sequential quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Given the substantial seasonality in the Company's portfolio, to help investors better understand this seasonality, the Company provides quarterly detail on its Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA Margin for the current and certain prior-year periods based upon the number of hotels in the Company's portfolio as of the end of the current period. As the Company's portfolio mix changes from time to time so will the seasonality for Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA Margin. The details of the quarterly calculations for the previous four quarters for the twelve hotels are provided in the table attached to this release.\nCOMMON STOCK DIVIDEND\nOn December 11, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per diluted share for the Company's common stock for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2017. The dividend, which equates to an annual rate of $0.64 per share, was paid on January 16, 2018, to shareholders of record as of December 29, 2017.\nThe Board also approved the Company's dividend policy for 2018. The Company expects to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share for 2018, or $0.64 per share on an annualized basis. The Board will continue to review its dividend policy on a quarter-to-quarter basis. The adoption of a dividend policy does not commit the Board of Directors to declare future dividends or the amount thereof.\n\"Hurricanes Irma and Maria as well as the wildfires in Northern California had a significant impact on the operations of four of our properties and on our overall results for the quarter,\" said Richard J. Stockton, Ashford Prime's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"However, on a positive note, we continue to work with our insurers on business interruption claims at the affected properties and during the quarter we were able to realize approximately $4.1 million in business interruption recoveries. We remain focused on the execution of our strategies within the luxury chain scale segment and are excited about our pending acquisition of the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota. With the upbranding of the Courtyard San Francisco, the sale of the Marriott Plano and the announced listing for sale of the Tampa Renaissance, we are pleased to have made significant progress on our strategy for our non-core hotels and refining our portfolio. We will continue to look for ways to accretively grow our luxury hotel portfolio and maximize returns for our shareholders.\"\nINVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL AND SIMULCAST\nAshford Hospitality Prime, Inc. will conduct a conference call on Thursday, March 1, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. ET. The number to call for this interactive teleconference is (719) 325-4821. A replay of the conference call will be available through Thursday, March 8, 2018, by dialing (719) 457-0820 and entering the confirmation number, 5950335.\nThe Company will also provide an online simulcast and rebroadcast of its fourth quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. The live broadcast of Ashford Prime's quarterly conference call will be available online at the Company's web site, www.ahpreit.com on Thursday, March 1, 2018, beginning at 11:00 a.m. ET. The online replay will follow shortly after the call and continue for approximately one year.\nSubstantially all of our non-current assets consist of real estate investments secured by real estate. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most industry investors consider supplemental measures of performance, which are not measures of operating performance under GAAP, to assist in evaluating a real estate company's operations. These supplemental measures include FFO, AFFO, EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA. FFO is computed in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than us. None of FFO, AFFO, EBITDA or Hotel EBITDA represents cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to a) GAAP net income (loss) as an indication of our financial performance or b) GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor are such measures indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. However, management believes FFO, AFFO, EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA to be meaningful measures of a REIT's performance and should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of our operating performance.\n* * * * *\nAshford Hospitality Prime is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investing in luxury hotels and resorts.\nAshford has created an Ashford App for the hospitality REIT investor community.

Forward-looking statements in this press release may include, among others, statements about the implied share price for the Company's common stock. These are subject to risks and uncertainties. When we use the words \"will likely result,\" \"may,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" or similar expressions, we intend to identify . Such statements are subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are outside Ashford Prime's control.\nThese are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including, without limitation: general volatility of the capital markets and the market price of our common stock; changes in our business or investment strategy; availability, terms and deployment of capital; availability of qualified personnel; changes in our industry and the market in which we operate, interest rates or the general economy; our ability to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions, and manage our planned growth, and the degree and nature of our competition. These and other risk factors are more fully discussed in Ashford Prime's filings Commission. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA yield is defined as trailing twelve month EBITDA divided by the purchase price. A capitalization rate is determined by dividing the property's annual net operating income by the purchase price. Net operating income is the property's funds from operations minus a capital expense reserve of either 4% or 5% of gross revenues. Hotel EBITDA flow-through is the change in Hotel EBITDA divided by the change in total revenues. Hotel EBITDA Margin is Hotel EBITDA divided by total revenues. Funds from operations (\"FFO\"), as defined by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") in April 2002, represents net income (loss) computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties and extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and net of adjustments for the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures.\nThe included in this press release are only made as of the date of this press release.
