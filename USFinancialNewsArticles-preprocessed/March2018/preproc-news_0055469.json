    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GCP Applied Technologies Inc. (NYSE:GCP) (“GCP”) announced today that it has priced an offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) at an issue price of 100.0% (the “offering”).\nThe Notes will pay interest semiannually and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of GCP’s subsidiaries. The Notes and the related guarantees will be offered to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nGCP intends to apply the net proceeds from the offering, together with up to $50 million of borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand, (i) to redeem and/or satisfy and discharge all of its $525 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 9.500% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing such 2023 Notes, (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing and the previously announced amendment to its existing revolving credit facility and (iii) for general corporate purposes.\nThe closing of the previously announced credit facility amendment is subject to obtaining lender commitments and consents, as well as market and other conditions. However, the offering is not conditioned on consummation of the credit facility amendment. If GCP does not consummate the credit facility amendment on or prior to the date the Notes are first issued, less than all of the 2023 Notes will be redeemed in connection with the offering.\nThe Notes and the related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\nThe closing of the Notes is subject to customary closing conditions.\nThis news release is not an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, any securities, and shall not constitute a notice of redemption with respect to any outstanding notes of GCP.\nAbout GCP Applied Technologies Inc.\nGCP is a leading global provider of construction products technologies that include additives for cement and concrete, the VERIFI ® in-transit concrete management system, high-performance waterproofing products, and specialty systems. GCP products have been used to build some of the world’s most renowned structures.\nThis announcement contains “forward-looking statements,” that is, information related to future, not past, events.

Such statements generally include the words “believes,” “plans,” “intends,” “targets,” “will,” “expects,” “suggests,” “anticipates,” “outlook,” “continues,” or similar expressions.

Grace and the value of GCP’s common stock following the spin-off; the inability to establish or maintain certain business relationships and relationships with customers and suppliers or the inability to retain key personnel; and the handling of hazardous materials and the costs of compliance with environmental regulation. These and other factors are identified and described in more detail in GCP's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which has been filed with the U.S. Commission and is available online at www.sec.gov .
