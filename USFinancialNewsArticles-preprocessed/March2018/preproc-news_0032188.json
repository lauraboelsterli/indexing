This result exceeded the Company's previously announced estimate of between 80 metric tons and 90 metric tons. Gross profit increased by 37% to $199.9 million from $146.4 million. Gross margin was 9.9% compared to 10.3%. Net income was $26.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $92.9 million, or $1.40 per diluted share. Book value per diluted share was $5.87 at December 31, 2017 compared to $4.26 at December 31, 2016.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights (all results compared to prior year period)\nNet sales were $657.1 million, compared to $357.6 million. Processed a total of 31.2 metric tons of 24-karat gold products, compared to 19.7 metric tons.

Kingold is determined to achieve further strategic expansion in China's gold industry and will continue to explore gold investment as a major component of Kingold's overall strategic development. We have leveraged the investment in gold in addition to purchasing gold to increase production and benefitted from rapid expansion, despite encountering challenges of a higher interest rate environment and a growing overall loan amount. As we are committed to becoming a more prominent player in China's gold industry, we expect to make timely adjustments in our investment and operation strategies in response to market changes to maintain our industry leading position and stay competitive.\"\n2017 OPERATIONAL REVIEW\nM etric Tons of Gold Sales\nThree Months Ended:\nD ecember 31, 2017\nD ecember 31, 2016\nVolume\n% of Total\nVolume\n% of Total\nBranded*\n16.8\n53.8%\n9.9\n50.3%\nCustomized**\n14.4\n46.2%\n9.8\n49.7%\nTotal\n31.2\n100.0%\n19.7\n100%\nYear Ended:\nD ecember 31, 2017\nD ecember 31, 2016\nVolume\n% of Total\nVolume\n% of Total\nBranded*\n51.5\n49.8%\n38.5\n51.1%\nCustomized**\n51.9\n50.2%\n36.9\n48.9%\nTotal\n103.4\n100.0%\n75.4\n100.0%\n*\nBr anded Production:\nT he Company acquires gold from the Shanghai Gold Exchange to produce branded products.\n**\nCustomized Production:\nClients who purchase customized products supply gold to the Company for processing.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company processed a total of 31.2 metric tons of gold, of which branded production was 16.8 metric tons, representing 53.8% of total gold processed, and customized production was 14.4 metric tons, representing 46.2% of total gold processed in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company processed a total of 19.7 metric tons, of which branded production was 9.9 metric tons, or 50.3% of the total gold processed, and customized production was 9.8 metric tons, or 49.7% of total gold processed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Kingold processed a total of 103.4 metric tons of gold, of which branded production was 51.5 metric tons, or 49.8% of total gold processed, and customized production was 51.9 metric tons, or 50.2% of total gold processed.

The increase in net sales was primarily driven by increase in total sales volume from 75.3 metric tons in 2016 to 103.4 metric tons in 2017, the increase in the average unit selling price for branded production from RMB 241.33 per gram in 2016 to RMB 257.20 per gram in 2017, as well as the increase in average unit selling price for customized production increased from RMB 4.26 per gram in 2016 to RMB 6.38 per gram in 2017.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $56.4 million, compared to $21.4 million for the same period in 2016.\nGross profit was $199.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $146.4 million for year of 2016. The increase in gross profit was due to the increase in total sales volume from 75.3 metric tons in 2016 to 103.4 metric tons in 2017, and the increase in unit selling prices.\nGross Margin\nThe Company's gross margin was 8.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 6.0% in the prior year period.\nThe Company's gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 9.9%, compared to 10.3% in the prior year period. The slight decrease was due to higher proportional increase in unit cost than unit price for the branded production sales.\nNet Income\nNet income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $10.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share based on 66.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to net income of $42.0 million in the prior year period, or $0.63 per diluted share based on 66.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the prior-year period.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $26.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted share based on 66.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to net income of $92.9 million in the prior year, or $1.40 per diluted share based on 66.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, in the prior-year. The decrease was mainly due to one-time sales gain on sale of Jewelry Park of 63.2 million in 2016, and increase in interest expenses in 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash flow\n(in millions except for percentages)\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n% Changed\nCash\n$ 5.0\n$ 21.3\n(76.5%)\nInventories (gold)\n$ 135\n$ 119.4\n13.1%\nWorking Capital\n$ 768.3\n$ 459.9\n67.1%\nStockholders' Equity\n$ 390.2\n$ 282.5\n38.1%\nNet cash used in operating activities was $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $74 million for the year of 2016. The change was mainly due to the decrease in net income, increase in value added tax recoverable of $60.2 million, increase in inventories of $7.3 million for the increased production to meet sales demand, offset by the increase in other payable and accrued expense of $4.1 million and increase in income tax payable of $4.7 million.\nKingold's net cash from operating activities can fluctuate significantly due to changes in inventories (principally gold). Other factors that may vary significantly include the Company's purchases of gold and income taxes. The Company expects that the net cash it generates from operating activities will continue to fluctuate as the Company's inventories, receivables, accounts payables, and the other factors described above change with increased production and the purchase of larger or smaller quantities of raw materials (principally gold). These fluctuations could cause net cash from operating activities to decrease, even if the net income grows as the Company continues to expand. Although the Company expects that net cash from operating activities will increase over the long term, but cannot predict how these fluctuations will affect Kingold's cash flow in any particular accounting period.\nOUTLOOK FOR 2018\nBased on its existing resources and capacity along with strong demand for 24-karat gold products in China, the Company believes that its gold sales are expected to be between 100 metric tons and 110 metric tons during 2018. This guidance is based solely on current projected, organic growth.\nConference Call Details\nKingold also announced that it will discuss these financial results in a conference call on March 16, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET.
