A bus carrying embassy staff and children leave Russia's Embassy in London, Britain, March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville Russian embassy workers waved to the leaving diplomats and their families as the buses pulled away, a Reuters photographer at the scene said. Last Wednesday, after the first known offensive use of such a nerve agent on European soil since World War Two, May gave 23 Russians she said were spies working under diplomatic cover at the embassy a week to leave.
