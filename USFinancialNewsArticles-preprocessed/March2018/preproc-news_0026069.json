The program was put in place by the Company’s Board of Directors following the Board meeting held on March 9, 2018.\nII – PURPOSES OF THE SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM\nIn accordance with the twenty-seventh resolution adopted at the AGM, the share buyback program may be used for the following purposes:\nto cancel the shares bought back ; or to hold shares in treasury for subsequent delivery in payment or exchange for external growth transactions, in accordance with market practices recognized by the applicable regulations, and provided the shares used for this purpose do not represent more than 5% of the Company’s capital; or to allocate shares on exercise of right attached to securities redeemable, convertible, exchangeable or otherwise exercisable for shares of the Company ; or to allocate shares for the implementation of (i) stock option plans or (ii) free share plans or (iii) employee share ownership plans ; or to maintain a liquid market for the Company’s shares under a liquidity contract entered into with an investment services provider that complies with a Code of Ethics recognized by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers ; or more generally, to carry out any transactions or market practices currently authorized or that may be authorized in the future by the applicable laws and regulations or by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers.\nThe Company may use derivatives for the purpose of implementing the share buyback program, except in relation to transactions carried out under the liquidity contract.\nIn accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, including stock exchange publications requirements, the Company reserves the right to (i) carry out the authorized reallocations of purchased shares from one of the program’s purposes to one or more of its other purposes, or (ii) sell the purchased shares either on or off-market through an investment services provider acting independently under a liquidity contract.\nIII – TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM\nMaximum proportion of the Company’s capital: the shares purchased under the buyback program may not represent more than 10% of the Company’s capital, determined based on the number of shares making up the Company’s capital at the date of the buybacks.\nMaximum number of shares : the number of shares acquired may not exceed 10% of the total number of shares making up the Company’s capital as at the date on which the authorization granted at the AGM is utilized.\nWhen shares are bought back for the purpose of maintaining a liquid market in the Company’s shares, the number of shares taken into account in order to calculate the cap of 10% of the Company’s capital corresponds to the number of shares purchased less the number of shares sold during the authorization period.\nAs the program provides for the possibility of using derivatives to carry out the share purchases, any Company’s shares that the Company may acquire through the exercise of call options will be included immediately as of the purchase (rather than the exercise) of the call options for the purpose of calculating the maximum number of shares that may be acquired during the eighteen-month validity period of the buyback program.\nType of shares that may be purchased: ordinary shares of the Company with a par value of €0.01 each.\nMaximum per-share purchase price: €25\nMaximum amount that may be invested in the program: €430,000,000\nThe acquisition cost of any derivatives that the Company may use for the purpose of the program will be included in the maximum authorized amount of the program at the time the derivatives are put in place. The amount corresponding to the price of any Company’s shares acquired on the exercise of call options will only be included when the options are exercised.\nAny sums allocated for the purpose of the liquidity contract will be included in the maximum authorized amount of the program.\nDuration of the buyback program: 18 months (from March 9, 2018 to September 9, 2019)\nIV – PURPOSES OF TREASURY SHARES HELD AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018\nNumber of shares held by the Company at February 28, 2018:\nin connection with the liquidity contract entered into on June 1 st , 2016 : 58.736 to hold shares in treasury for subsequent delivery in payment or exchange for external growth transactions: 183\nAs specified in Article 241-2 (Book II) of the General Regulations of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, in accordance with Article 221-3 of said Regulations, any material changes during the buyback program to any of the information set out above will be rendered public as promptly as possible.\nAbout Elior Group\nFounded in 1991, Elior Group has grown into one of the world's leading operators in the catering and support services industry, and has become a benchmark player in the business & industry, education, healthcare and travel markets.
