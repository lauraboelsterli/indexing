    "text": "March 26, 2018 / 9:17 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago UPDATE 1-China Evergrande says core profit nearly doubles, beats estimates Reuters Staff * Core profit nearly doubles to $6.45 bln, beats estimates * Net profit up 110 pct, borrowings up 37 pct * Net gearing ratio drops to 184 pct from 432 pct By Clare Jim HONG KONG, March 26 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group , the nation’s third-biggest property developer by sales, on Monday said 2017 core profit surged 95 percent to a record high, boosted by the sale of more apartments and the redemption of high-interest perpetual bonds Core profit, which excludes revaluation gains, was 40.51 billion yuan ($6.45 billion) for the full year, beating a consensus forecast of 27.26 billion yuan from 18 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate. Many major property developers are widely expected to book best-ever profits for 2017 on record sales, as industry consolidation brought economies of scale that helped developers minimise the impact of government measures that were aimed at slowing the rate of property price rises. Evergrande said net profit surged 110 percent to 37 billion yuan, while revenue increased 47 percent to 311 billion yuan. Total borrowings rose 37 percent to 732.6 billion yuan. Evergrande, which has pledged to slash debt by 2020, said its net gearing ratio dropped to 184 percent from 432 percent a year earlier. “The group, through a series of capital markets transactions, improved its offshore debt structure, extended its maturity profile and reduced financing costs,” Evergrande said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The developer is currently planning a so-called backdoor listing in China, where valuations are usually higher than in Hong Kong, by injecting almost all of its property assets held by Hengda Real Estate Group Co Ltd into Shenzhen Real Estate . The company raised 130 billion yuan through three rounds of fundraising last year from strategic investors, who will hold about 36.5 percent of the enlarged equity interest of Hengda. The company’s stock was the biggest winner in the industry last year, surging 460 percent in response to the widely expected backdoor listing, fresh capital from strategic investors, and share buybacks. State-owned China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd said earlier on Monday its 2017 core profit rose 9.2 percent from a year earlier to HK$34.3 billion ($4.4 billion), lagging forecasts.
