    "text": "NEW YORK, March 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BeyondSpring Inc. (NASDAQ:BYSI), a global, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of transformative cancer therapies, announced today the appointment of Edward Dongheng Liu as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, effective immediately.\n“Edward’s extensive experience over the years in key leadership roles at Epiphron Capital, Jefferies and J.P. Morgan makes him a perfect fit for our team,” said Dr. Lan Huang, BeyondSpring CEO. “With 2018 set to be a milestone year for BeyondSpring’s first-in-class, lead asset, Plinabulin, the deep industry knowledge that Edward brings to BeyondSpring comes at an opportune time. His distinct blend of healthcare and in-depth financial expertise will be a key addition to the leadership team’s collective experience as we advance toward our goal to submit New Drug Applications in China around year-end 2018 / early 2019, and in the U.S. beginning in 2019.”\nMr. Liu has more than a decade of senior banking experience, having served in roles of increasing responsibility at J.P. Morgan and Jefferies, where he supported dozens of initial public offerings, share placements, bond offerings, mergers and acquisitions. Prior to joining BeyondSpring, he served as partner and executive director at Epiphron Capital, an early investor in BeyondSpring.\n“The invaluable skillset and financial acumen that Edward brings to the table is further enhanced by his familiarity with BeyondSpring’s unique story as an investor in the Company for the past two years,” added Dr. Huang. “In positioning Plinabulin to transform multiple therapeutic indications, we are focused on building the most strategic, data-driven team possible, and bringing Edward on board during such a pivotal moment in BeyondSpring’s history represents a critical piece in making our mission a reality.”\nMr. Liu received his bachelor’s degree in economics and mathematics from Yale University. He also studied biomedical engineering at Tsinghua University.\nAbout BeyondSpring\nBeyondSpring is a global clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative immuno-oncology cancer therapies with a robust pipeline from internal development and from collaboration with University of Washington in de novo drug discovery using ubiquitination platform.
