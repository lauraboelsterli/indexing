    "text": "ZURICH, Feb 28 (Reuters) - EFG International on Wednesday reported a worse-than-expected full year net loss as it absorbed integration costs from its takeover of rival Swiss private bank BSI.\nEFG reported a net loss of 59.8 million Swiss francs ($63.63 million) worse than the 4.7 million franc Swiss franc loss expected by analysts polled by Reuters, as net new money remained negative.\nThe Zurich-based bank reported outflows of 5.8 billion francs, a worsening from the 5.4 billion francs leaving the bank during 2016 following its purchase of BSI. The companyâ€™s dividend was kept at 0.25 francs per share, the same level as a year earlier.\n$1 = 0.9398 Swiss francs Reporting by John Revill\n ",
