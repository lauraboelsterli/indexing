    "text": "Fans are going crazy over \"Black Panther,\" but perhaps no one more so than 18-year-old Twitter user Sophia Robb, who has become social-media famous for her reaction to a scene when the charismatic villain Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, takes off his shirt.\nIn her excitement, Robb clenched her teeth so hard that she snapped the wire on her retainer and was forced to head to the orthodontist for an emergency visit. Her orthodontist then wrote about her, anonymously, on Tumblr, and a tweet including a screenshot of his comment went viral.\nWhen Robb saw the tweet, her first thought was that it was about someone else because it mistakenly identified her as 17, not 18. \"My initial reaction was, 'I have to find this girl and I have to be her best friend,'\" she tells CNBC Make It . \"'We already have so much in common!'\"\nAfter looking up the Tumblr user who left the comment, she realized the writer was indeed her orthodontist and he was referring to her own mishap. Robb then shared the tweet, adding, \"Wait. That girl is me. That is my orthodontist's tumblr. This is a post about me? I'm going to kill myself.\"\nTWEET. \nTWEET. \nRobb's tweet immediately went viral, too. It has been liked more than 515,000 times as of press time and retweeted more than 130,000 times. She went from having around 200 Twitter followers to more than 8,000. Robb received so many notifications that her phone crashed.\nShe even caught the attention of the man who started it all: Michael B. Jordan.\nThe movie star responded to Robb's tweet with an offer to pay to have her retainer fixed. \"Since I feel partly responsible for breaking your retainers, let me know if I can replace them,\" he said.\nTWEET. \nRobb was beside herself to hear from Jordan, tweeting that it was \"the best day of my life.\" In another tweet she added, \"I'm so happy to say that this is the best thing that has ever happened to me! Wow!\"\n\"You do not understand joy until you see Michael B. Jordan in your mentions,\" she tells CNBC Make It. \"That wasn't even in my realm of things that I thought were going to happen,\" she adds. \"That was just wonderful and incredible.\"\nTWEET. \nTWEET. \nLuckily, Robb's retainer was covered by insurance and only cost her around $50 to repair, so she declined to take Jordan up on his offer. Her one request of the star is that he take a photo with her and her orthodontist for her yearbook the next time he's in town.\nRobb isn't embarrassed that her awkward story has now been shared by thousands. \"I think people who are like 'you exposed yourself' are hilarious because of course I did!\" she told BuzzFeed News . \"It's a funny story and I'm not embarrassed about it. If anything it speaks to how great of a movie 'Black Panther' is.\" \nFor now, she wants to use her newfound social-media fame for good. \"My focus is on trying to answer everyone's DMs and trying to at least say hello,\" she tells CNBC Make It. \"And the occasional telling people to register to vote and drink some water. I want to use this to do something.\" \nShe also wants to encourage everyone to see \"Black Panther\" which, she says, is \"a retainer-breaker for sure!\" \nThis article has been updated to include quotes from CNBC Make It's conversation with Sophia Robb. \nDon't miss: Why Tiffany Haddish has worn her $4,000 Oscars dress at least 3 times \nLike this story?
