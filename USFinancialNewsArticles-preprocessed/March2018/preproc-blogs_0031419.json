    "text": "GDP outlook Industrial output rises on gains in manufacturing, mining U.S. industrial production jumped 1.1 percent in February, the largest increase in four months, due to a weather-related rebound in construction and a rise in output from the nation's oil and gas fields and mines. Manufacturing output rose 1.2 percent, the biggest gain since October, the Federal Reserve said in its monthly report. Published 7 Hours Ago Reuters Ty Wright | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee welds a joint on an industrial clothing rack at Staber Industries in Groveport, Ohio. \nU.S. industrial production jumped 1.1 percent in February, the largest increase in four months, due to a weather-related rebound in construction and a rise in output from the nation's oil and gas fields and mines. \nManufacturing output rose 1.2 percent, the biggest gain since October, the Federal Reserve said in its monthly report. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.3 percent rise in industrial production. Output for January was revised down to a decline of 0.3 percent from the previous 0.1 percent drop. \nThe U.S. central bank's measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. \nFebruary's increase in output was driven by a 2.3 percent rise in construction supplies and a recovery in the output of business equipment, which had stalled in the prior three months. \nThe utilities index fell nearly 5 percent after a wave of unseasonably warm weather reduced demand for heating. \nManufacturing output edged up 1.2 percent and mining production surged 4.3 percent. \nIn the 12 months through February overall industrial output rose 4.4 percent. \nThe percentage of industrial capacity in use rose 0.7 percentage point in February to 78.1 percent, the highest since January 2015.",
