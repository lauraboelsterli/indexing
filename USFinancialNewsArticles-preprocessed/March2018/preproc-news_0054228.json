She replaces former CFO John Divers, who is retiring after serving CDT for almost 20 years.\n“I’m thrilled that we have identified such a strong and experienced professional as Ms. Cheng to continue the work that John Divers has performed so well for many years,” said CDT President and CEO Joseph Reilly. “I know our staff and our investors are eager to welcome Grace to the CDT team.”\nMs. Cheng also previously worked at Morgan Stanley for eight years in the Investment Management practice, overseeing the global accounting, reporting and operations of its flagship Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds. She began her professional career as an auditor at Ernst & Young with a focus in the financial services and real estate industries. Ms. Cheng holds a B.S. in accounting from Binghamton University and an MBA from New York University, and is a certified public accountant in New York.\nAbout CDT\nThe Community Development Trust (CDT) is a national investor in affordable housing.
