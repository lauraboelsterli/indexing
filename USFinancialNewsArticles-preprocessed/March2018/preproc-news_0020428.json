    "text": "Conference Call Wednesday, March 7 at 10:00 a.m. ET\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Qumu Corporation (NASDAQ: QUMU) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter revenue was $7.2 million, compared to $9.3 million in the fourth quarter 2016, and net loss was $(3.2) million, or $(0.35) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(267,000), or $(0.04) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was negative $(805,000), compared to positive adjusted EBITDA of $790,000 for the fourth quarter 2016.\nFor the full year 2017, revenue was $28.2 million, compared to $31.7 million in the prior year, and net loss was $(11.7) million, or $(1.25) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(11.2) million, or $(1.23) per diluted share, last year. For the full year 2017, adjusted EBITDA was negative $(4.6) million, compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $(6.6) million last year.\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company modified its term loan credit agreement with Hale Capital Partners, LP, concurrent with its plans to refinance the term loan. As previously announced, the Company closed a $10.0 million credit agreement with ESW Capital, LLC (through its ESW Holdings, Inc. subsidiary) on January 12, 2018, which replaced the Company’s then existing $8.0 million term loan credit agreement with Hale Capital Partners, LP. In connection with this refinancing plan, the Company accelerated the amortization of deferred financing costs related to the loan modification during the fourth quarter 2017. As a result, net loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 reflects $1.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, of interest expense for the incremental amortization of deferred financing costs related to the loan modification.\n“As I noted in our fourth quarter 2017 preliminary release, our financial results are disappointing to our team,” said Vern Hanzlik, Qumu’s President and CEO. “Qumu closed 2017 with an enviable base of blue chip customers and channel partners and the most comprehensive, extensible enterprise video platform in the industry. To set the business right, we made strategic hires during 2017 including our new Chief Financial Officer, EVP of Worldwide Sales and Business Development, VP of Worldwide Channel and Alliances, and VP of Marketing. Together, the team has developed and is tenaciously executing on a plan for success by continually aligning our expenses with the market opportunity and focusing on four strategic pillars for 2018: sales execution, customer success and retention, market-focused product innovation and strengthening our financial performance.\n“Qumu is the only solution provider in the industry offering a full stack set of deployment models – cloud, hybrid and on-premise, under our Qx enterprise video platform,” Hanzlik continued. “We have been investing to achieve this result for years and it enables us to address every company’s enterprise video needs with a single solution. With multiple hybrid installations at global enterprises and with Qumu Cloud representing half of our new customers, our Qx strategy is taking hold and we are well positioned for the future.”\nOther Financial Highlights\nSubscription, maintenance and support revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 was $4.3 million compared to $6.2 million for the fourth quarter 2016 and for the full year 2017 was $19.4 million compared to $21.4 million last year. Fourth quarter 2016 revenue included subscription, maintenance and support revenue of $1.2 million and professional service revenue of $0.4 million of previously deferred revenue contingent on a customer's acceptance, which was received in the 2016 fourth quarter. Gross margin for the fourth quarter 2017 was 65.7% compared to 70.7% for the fourth quarter 2016 and for the full year 2017 was 63.6% compared to 61.0% last year. The benefit to gross margin relating to the above-mentioned customer acceptance was 6.1% and 1.8% for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA improved by $2.0 million for the full fiscal year 2017 reflecting operating efficiencies and economies of scale resulting from our Qx product and go-to market strategy. Total headcount was 121 as of December 31, 2017 compared to 120 as of September 30, 2017 and 150 as of December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $7.7 million as of December 31, 2017, which was unchanged from September 30, 2017, reflecting the fourth quarter operating loss offset by cash from changes in working capital. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, as noted above, the Company closed a $10.0 million credit agreement with ESW Capital, LLC. After repayment of the outstanding principal, interest, fees and expenses associated with the refinancing, the Company added $805,000 in net cash to the balance sheet. BriefCam, Ltd., in which the Company has a $3.1 million investment reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements using the cost method basis of accounting, released its 2017 results, which reflected revenue growth of 100%, the addition of 119 new customers and a client footprint now spanning over 40 countries.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company is issuing the following financial guidance for the full year 2018:\nCore bookings growth is expected to be 25% in 2018, compared to 2017, emphasizing growth in sales of the Qx platform. Revenue for 2018 is expected to be approximately $25 million, which includes an approximately $1.1 million unfavorable revenue impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard (ASC Topic 606) in 2018, as well as the loss of a large customer representing revenue of approximately $3.2 million annually. Gross margin is expected to be in the mid to high 60s. Adjusted EBITDA loss for 2018 is expected to be approximately $(3.5) million. The Company expects to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 excludes stock-based compensation of approximately $1.0 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $2.1 million, depreciation expense of approximately $0.5 million, income tax benefit of approximately $0.2 million, and interest expense of approximately $2.0 million. Net loss for 2018 is expected to be approximately $(9.0) million.\nConference Call\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call and webcast to review its fourth quarter 2017 results tomorrow, March 7, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The dial-in number for the conference call is 877-456-6914 for domestic participants and 929-387-3794 for international participants. Investors can also access a webcast of the live conference call by linking through the investor relations section of the Qumu website, www.qumu.com . Webcasts will be archived on Qumu’s website.\nNon-GAAP Information\nTo supplement the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, the Company uses adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure), which excludes certain items from net income (loss) (a GAAP measure). Adjusted EBITDA excludes items related to interest income and expense, the impact of income-based taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liability, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-operating income and expenses.\nThe Company uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating the Company’s performance. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides supplemental information that allows investors to review the Company's results of operations from the same perspective as management and the Company's board of directors. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only for understanding our operating results. The non-GAAP results should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nSee the attached Supplemental Financial Information for a reconciliation of net loss, a GAAP measure, to adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
