The company includes three wholly owned subsidiaries: ALARIS, Encore Unlimited and ForeSight Medical. Paradigm and its subsidiaries improve health outcomes and lower medical spend for high-cost, complex cases, with a market leading and differentiated outcome-based approach.\nMarijo Storment, CEO of ALARIS and Encore Unlimited\nMarijo Storment, in her new role as CEO for both ALARIS and Encore Unlimited, will unify the company's case management offering and ensure the delivery of the highest quality case management services.\nMarijo previously served as CEO of ALARIS, a role she's held since 2012, as she led the company's national expansion and acquisition by Paradigm Outcomes in October 2016. ALARIS and Encore will continue to operate as two separate case management brands within the Paradigm portfolio. Since becoming the first ALARIS CEO in 2012, Marijo has been a driving force behind the company's coast-to-coast expansion. ALARIS now serves all 50 U.S. states with its extraordinary national network of healthcare professionals committed to care, communication and case management efficiency.\nJennifer Hinshaw, Chief Product and Strategy Officer\nJennifer Hinshaw will now serve as Chief Product and Strategy Officer. In this newly created role, Hinshaw will be responsible for innovation of Paradigm's core offerings, building the next generation of services and tools that empower the company's clinicians and case managers to work more efficiently. She will also drive new product development to allow the company to scale and serve more people with catastrophic and complex medical conditions.\nJennifer brings more than 25 years of experience in healthcare strategy, operations and large-scale change management to the role. Prior to joining Paradigm in 2015, Jennifer served as Vice President of Admissions at CRC Health (now part of Acadia Healthcare). There, she was responsible for leading the transformation of the intake, admissions and call center operations and for improving UR and managed care contracting capabilities across the company's residential and outpatient treatment facilities. Previously, Jennifer was the COO and a founding member of two health- and education-related startups, where she led product design and development as well as day-to-day operations. Earlier, Jennifer was a partner at Accenture, where she focused on strategy development, care management strategy and operational improvement for health services organizations.\nTom Mastri, Executive Vice President of Finance and Business Development\nTom's new role as Executive Vice President of Finance and Business Development will focus on bringing operational excellence and a common set of best practices throughout the combined enterprise. He will lead the identification of new partnership and market opportunities to expand Paradigm's impact. Tom will also continue as a member of Paradigm Outcomes Board of Directors.\nPreviously, Tom served as Paradigm's Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administration Officer. He oversaw the company's corporate finance, risk management, legal, human resources, IT and analytics departments. Over the course of his 25-year career, he has managed all aspects of financial policy and planning, launched strategic initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions and regulatory compliance, and taken on leadership roles working with boards of directors, private equity and venture capital firms, public accountants and investment bankers.\nBefore joining Paradigm, Tom served as CFO, Treasurer and Vice President of Coventry Health Care, and as Vice President and Controller of First Health, which was acquired by Coventry. He has also worked in auditing at the public accounting firm Ernst & Young. He also led the expansion of two software companies, Achievo Corporation and Initiate Systems, Inc.\nAbout Paradigm Outcomes\nParadigm Outcomes is the market leader in managing catastrophic and complex cases for the workers' compensation industry.
