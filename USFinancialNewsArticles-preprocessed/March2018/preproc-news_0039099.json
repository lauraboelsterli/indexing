    "text": "- Company Reports 2017 Pre-Tax Income at Upper End of Range of Guidance, Operating\nCash Flow in Excess of Expectations; Defense Backlog at $301.3 Million –\n– Separately Company Announces Acquisition of Aerospace Component and Assemblies Manufacturer Welding Metallurgy, Inc. –\n– Management to Host Conference Call at 8:30 a.m. ET Today –\nEDGEWOOD, N.Y., March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (“CPI Aero ® ”) (NYSE American:CVU) today reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 financial results.\nFull Year 2017 vs. Full Year 2016\nRevenue was $81.3 million compared to $81.3 million; Gross profit was $18.6 million compared to $4.3 million; Gross margin was 22.9% compared to 5.3%; Pre-tax income (loss) was $8.5 million compared to $(5.7) million; Net income (loss) was $5.8 million compared to $(3.6) million; Earnings (loss) per diluted share were $0.65 compared to $(0.42) per diluted share; Cash provided by operations was $1.6 million compared to cash used in operations of $6.6 million; and Total backlog at $388.7 million with multi-year defense contracts comprising 78%.\nFourth Quarter 2017 vs. Fourth Quarter 2016\nRevenue of $23.8 million compared to $24.3 million; Gross profit of $5.5 million compared to $5.9 million; Pre-tax income of $2.8 million compared to $3.4 million; Net income of $2.1 million compared to $2.1 million; Earnings per diluted share of $0.23 compared to $0.24; and Cash provided by operations was $1.8 million compared to $0.2 million.\n“Fiscal 2017 was a turning point for CPI Aero during which we returned to annual profitability and positive operating cash flow while continuing to execute on our defense-market growth strategy. I am especially pleased to report pre-tax income at the upper range of our financial guidance and operating cash flow in excess of our expectations reflecting the benefits gained from an improved cost structure and leaner operations,” stated Douglas McCrosson, president and chief executive officer. “During the year, our strategic focus on the defense market gave us a year-end backlog of $301.3 million that includes awards for some of the most advanced military aircraft programs, notably the Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lighting II, Sikorsky’s UH-60 Black Hawk, and UTC’s TacSAR reconnaissance system, as well as new awards or contract extensions on current platforms. Long-term defense budget trends should continue to drive top-line opportunities for defense primes and larger tier 1 suppliers, and we expect to continue to win our fair share based on our growing reputation in the military supply chain as a high quality, lower cost alternative to in-house assembly work.”\n2018 Financial Guidance\nCPI Aero issued full-year 2018 financial guidance assuming the Company closes the acquisition of WMI on May 1, 2018:\nRevenue in the range of $92.0 million to $96.0 million as compared to $81.3 million in the fiscal 2017 full year ended December 31, 2017; Pre-tax income in the range of $9.1 to $9.6 million as compared to $8.5 million in fiscal 2017; Effective tax rate of 23% - 24%.\nCommenting on the Company’s financial guidance for fiscal 2018, Mr. McCrosson stated, “Our financial guidance for fiscal 2018, which includes the addition of WMI for the last eight months of the year, excludes the contributions from new program awards that have been delayed as the Department of Defense continues to operate on a continuing resolution basis in addition to near-term uncertainty over the U.S. defense budget priorities. Having implemented operational improvements over the past three years, we are committed to increasing top-line growth by fully leveraging our improved cost structure and enhanced competitiveness. Rather than wait for budgetary resolutions, we are actively exploring inorganic growth, targeting opportunities that will give us more defense content and ensure we are on a growth trajectory. As an example, the announced acquisition of WMI today further aligns us to long-term defense industry trends with unique capabilities and complimentary programs and customers.\n“In pursuit of organic growth, we recently added executive level leadership with extensive experience at a leading global defense company to head our business development and strategy across key growth segments, particularly in the areas of electronic warfare (EW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and autonomous systems. With a multi-pronged strategy for growth in fiscal 2018 – our backlog, a strong bid pipeline of key growth segments and additional opportunities – we have the tools to ensure our long-term success,” concluded Mr. McCrosson.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the company’s results as well as recent corporate developments.
