Elizabeth Holmes, CEO of Theranos, attends a panel discussion during the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in New York, September 29, 2015. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo As part of the settlement, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Holmes must also return millions of shares to the privately-held company and cannot serve as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years.
