Labourers shift sacks filled with paddy crop at a wholesale grain market in Chandigarh October 22, 2013. REUTERS/Ajay Verma/Files Exporters will get a 7 percent incentive of the value of the shipment, the government said in its order. Chickpea prices have fallen 38 percent in the past six months to a three-year low in the world’s biggest producer and consumer of the pulse, also known as chana. On Thursday, chickpea futures provisionally closed at 3,673 rupees ($56.42) per 100 kg, compared with the government-fixed support price of 4,400 rupees. India’s chickpea production is likely to jump 18.3 percent to a record 11.1 million tonnes in 2017/18. The country, which imports chickpeas from Australia, Russia and Tanzania, recently raised the import tax on the pulse to 60 percent to protect local farmers. ($1 = 65.1000 Indian rupees",
