    "text": "LITTLETON, Colo., March 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ur-Energy Inc. (NYSE American:URG TSX:URE) (\"Ur-Energy\" or the \"Company\") has filed the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Management's Discussion & Analysis, all for the year ended December 31, 2017, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml and with Canadian securities authorities on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . These filings also may be accessed on the Company's website at www.ur-energy.com . Shareholders of the Company may receive a hard copy of the consolidated financial statements, free of charge, upon request to the Company.\nUr-Energy CEO, Jeff Klenda provided the following on the Company's 2017 performance: \"Despite difficult market conditions, which persisted throughout the year, I am very pleased to report that we generated $14.0 million in gross profits and $5.4 million in free cash flows, while at the same time improving our safety performance and not subjecting our shareholders to unwanted dilution. Our people made this possible through their hard work, initiative, and innovative approaches to the operation of this Company. I would like to express my deep gratitude for their many contributions.\n\"Still, uneven trade practices continue to put pressure on an already weakened market, forcing additional production cuts, cost reductions and unfortunately, the loss of valuable, highly-experienced employees, who either leave due to the vagaries of the situation, or are forced to leave as more and more cut backs are announced. The situation is not simply a matter of project economics, for as you know, our Lost Creek project is a very economical project, but one of far greater importance: the national security of our very own country. It is for this, and many other reasons, that we participated in the filing under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Rest assured, we will do what we can to protect our employees, our shareholders, our Company and our nation from this growing dependence on foreign uranium products, which is contrary to U.S. national security.\"\nFinancial Results\nThe Company ended the year with a cash and cash equivalents balance of $3.9 million. We recognized a gross profit of $14.0 million on sales of $38.4 million during 2017. The gross profit from uranium sales was $13.9 million in 2017, which represents a gross profit margin of approximately 36%. The Company realized an average price per pound sold of $49.09, as compared to $39.49 in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average contract prices in 2017 as compared to 2016. Also, there were no spot sales in 2017, while 2016 included spot sales that lowered the average price for that year. Our cash cost per pound sold for the year was $24.08 while our total cost per pound sold was $31.28. Respectively, this compares to $17.15 and $28.20 in 2016.\nWe recorded $1.4 million income from operations after deducting total operating expenses of $12.6 million, which includes exploration and evaluation expenses, development expenses and general and administrative expenses. After recording interest and other expenses, the net earnings before income taxes for the year was $0.1 million, as compared to a net loss before incomes taxes of $3.0 million in 2016. As at February 28, 2018, our unrestricted cash position was $7.5 million.\nLost Creek Operations\nDuring 2017, 265,391 pounds of U 3 O 8 were captured within the Lost Creek plant. A total of 254,012 pounds were packaged in drums and 257,213 pounds of the drummed inventory were shipped to the conversion facility where 261,000 produced pounds were sold to utility customers. The cash cost per pound and non-cash cost per pound for produced uranium presented in the following Production Costs and U 3 O 8 Sales and Cost of Sales tables are non-US GAAP measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning within US GAAP or a defined basis of calculation. These measures are used by management to assess business performance and determine production and pricing strategies. They may also be used by certain investors to evaluate performance.\nProduction figures for the Lost Creek Project are as follows:\nProduction and Production Costs\nUnit\n2017 Q4\n2017 Q3\n2017 Q2\n2017 Q1\n2017 YTD\nPounds captured\nlb\n67,982\n52,812\n65,257\n79,340\n265,391\nAd valorem and severance tax\n$000\n$\n160\n$\n119\n$\n227\n$\n241\n$\n747\nWellfield cash cost (1)\n$000\n$\n686\n$\n743\n$\n599\n$\n889\n$\n2,917\nWellfield non-cash cost (2)\n$000\n$\n574\n$\n730\n$\n780\n$\n776\n$\n2,860\nAd valorem and severance tax per pound captured\n$/lb\n$\n2.35\n$\n2.25\n$\n3.48\n$\n3.04\n$\n2.81\nCash cost per pound captured\n$/lb\n$\n10.09\n$\n14.07\n$\n9.18\n$\n11.20\n$\n10.99\nNon-cash cost per pound captured\n$/lb\n$\n8.44\n$\n13.82\n$\n11.95\n$\n9.78\n$\n10.78\nPounds drummed\nlb\n60,461\n48,336\n70,833\n74,382\n254,012\nPlant cash cost (3)\n$000\n$\n1,210\n$\n1,120\n$\n1,267\n$\n1,488\n$\n5,085\nPlant non-cash cost (2)\n$000\n$\n493\n$\n494\n$\n491\n$\n491\n$\n1,969\nCash cost per pound drummed\n$/lb\n$\n20.01\n$\n23.17\n$\n17.93\n$\n20.00\n$\n20.02\nNon-cash cost per pound drummed\n$/lb\n$\n8.15\n$\n10.20\n$\n6.93\n$\n6.61\n$\n7.75\nPounds shipped to conversion facility\nlb\n73,367\n36,797\n74,406\n72,643\n257,213\nDistribution cash cost (4)\n$000\n$\n48\n$\n24\n$\n26\n$\n47\n$\n145\nCash cost per pound shipped\n$/lb\n$\n0.65\n$\n0.65\n$\n0.35\n$\n0.65\n$\n0.56\nPounds purchased\nlb\n-\n109,000\n210,000\n200,000\n519,000\nPurchase costs\n$000\n$\n-\n$\n2,196\n$\n4,870\n$\n4,015\n$\n11,081\nCash cost per pound purchased\n$/lb\n$\n-\n$\n20.15\n$\n23.19\n$\n20.08\n$\n21.35\nNotes:\n1\nWellfield cash costs include all wellfield operating costs. Wellfield construction and development costs, which include wellfield drilling, header houses, pipelines, power lines, roads, fences and disposal wells, are treated as development expense and are not included in wellfield operating costs.\n2\nNon-cash costs include the amortization of the investment in the mineral property acquisition costs and the depreciation of plant equipment, and the depreciation of their related asset retirement obligation costs. The expenses are calculated on a straight line basis so the expenses are typically constant for each quarter. The cost per pound from these costs will therefore typically vary based on production levels only.\n3\nPlant cash costs include all plant operating costs and site overhead costs.\n4\nDistribution cash costs include all shipping costs and costs charged by the conversion facility for weighing, sampling, assaying and storing the U 3 O 8 prior to sale.\nIn total, wellfield, plant and distribution cash costs were very consistent quarter on quarter during 2017. The respective cash costs per pound increased overall during the year primarily driven by decreasing levels of production.\nU 3 O 8 Sales and Cost of Sales\nSales and cost of sales\nUnit\n2017 Q4\n2017 Q3\n2017 Q2\n2017 Q1\n2017 YTD\nPounds sold\nlb\n-\n289,000\n241,000\n250,000\n780,000\nU3O8 sales\n$000\n$\n-\n$\n11,674\n$\n11,797\n$\n14,819\n$\n38,290\nAverage contract price\n$/lb\n$\n-\n$\n40.39\n$\n48.95\n$\n59.28\n$\n49.09\nAverage price per pound sold\n$/lb\n$\n-\n$\n40.39\n$\n48.95\n$\n59.28\n$\n49.09\nU3O8 cost of sales (1)\n$000\n$\n376\n$\n11,157\n$\n6,573\n$\n6,295\n$\n24,401\nAd valorem and severance tax cost per pound sold\n$/lb\n$\n-\n$\n3.15\n$\n4.26\n$\n4.00\n$\n3.60\nCash cost per pound sold\n$/lb\n$\n-\n$\n29.11\n$\n31.54\n$\n26.12\n$\n29.51\nNon-cash cost per pound sold\n$/lb\n$\n-\n$\n17.52\n$\n19.13\n$\n15.48\n$\n17.92\nCost per pound sold - produced\n$/lb\n$\n-\n$\n49.78\n$\n54.93\n$\n45.60\n$\n51.03\nCost per pound sold - purchased\n$/lb\n$\n-\n$\n20.15\n$\n23.19\n$\n20.08\n$\n21.35\nAverage cost per pound sold\n$/lb\n$\n-\n$\n38.61\n$\n27.26\n$\n25.18\n$\n31.28\nU3O8 gross profit\n$000\n$\n(376)\n$\n517\n$\n5,224\n$\n8,524\n$\n13,889\nGross profit per pound sold\n$/lb\n$\n-\n$\n1.78\n$\n21.68\n$\n34.10\n$\n17.81\nGross profit margin\n%\n0.0%\n4.4%\n44.3%\n57.5%\n36.3%\nEnding Inventory Balances\nPounds\nIn-process inventory\nlb\n26,796\n22,306\n19,010\n28,164\nPlant inventory\nlb\n9,043\n21,948\n10,446\n14,019\nConversion facility inventory\nlb\n94,077\n17,813\n160,094\n113,528\nTotal inventory\nlb\n129,916\n62,067\n189,550\n155,711\nTotal cost\nIn-process inventory\n$000\n$\n315\n$\n221\n$\n352\n$\n712\nPlant inventory\n$000\n$\n369\n$\n824\n$\n479\n$\n670\nConversion facility inventory\n$000\n$\n3,831\n$\n675\n$\n6,620\n$\n4,379\nTotal inventory\n$000\n$\n4,515\n$\n1,720\n$\n7,451\n$\n5,761\nCost per pound\nIn-process inventory\n$/lb\n$\n11.76\n$\n9.92\n$\n18.46\n$\n25.28\nPlant inventory\n$/lb\n$\n40.81\n$\n37.53\n$\n45.85\n$\n47.79\nConversion facility inventory\n$/lb\n$\n40.72\n$\n37.89\n$\n41.35\n$\n38.57\nNote:\n1.\nCosts of sales include all production costs (notes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the previous Production and Production Costs table) adjusted for changes in inventory values.\nThere were no U 3 O 8 sales in Q4. For the year, we sold 780,000 pounds all of which were under contract at an average price per pound of $49.09 for total uranium sales of $38.3 million. There were no spot sales during the year. A total of 261,000 pounds were sold from Lost Creek production. Additionally, we sold 519,000 purchased pounds into our contractual obligations.\nIn 2017 Q4, our cost of sales totaled $0.3 million. This is the result of lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments which are included in our cost of sales, recorded during the quarter. For the year, our average cost per pound sold was $31.28, as compared to $28.20 in 2016. In 2017, we purchased 519,000 pounds at an average price of $21.35 per pound. The average cost of the 261,000 pounds we sold from production was $51.03 per pound. As previously discussed, our produced costs per pound were substantially higher than in 2016 due to lower volumes. This, combined with the write down of $2.6 million from lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, increased our cost of produced product sold by $10.34 per pound.\nOn a combined basis, the total average cost per pound sold of $31.28 was composed of $1.20 per pound for ad valorem and severance taxes, $24.08 per pound of cash costs from production and purchases, and $6.00 per pound of non-cast costs related to production.\nAt the end of the year, we had approximately 94,077 pounds of U 3 O 8 at the conversion facility at an average cost per pound of $40.72. The following table shows the average cost per pound of the conversion facility pounds.\nEnding Conversion Facility Inventory\nCost Per Pound Summary\nUnit\n31-Dec-17\n30-Sep-17\n30-Jun-17\n31-Mar-17\nAd valorem and severance tax cost per pound\n$/lb\n$\n1.65\n$\n2.41\n$\n2.82\n$\n2.74\nCash cost per pound\n$/lb\n$\n25.31\n$\n22.47\n$\n24.62\n$\n23.48\nNon-cash cost per pound\n$/lb\n$\n13.76\n$\n13.01\n$\n13.91\n$\n12.35\nTotal cost per pound\n$/lb\n$\n40.72\n$\n37.89\n$\n41.35\n$\n38.57\nGenerally, the cost per pound in ending inventory at the conversion facility increased during the year.

The cash and non-cash cost components are identified in the above production cost table.\nThe cost of sales includes ad valorem and severance taxes related to the extraction of uranium, all costs of wellfield, plant and site operations including the related depreciation and amortization of capitalized assets, reclamation and mineral property costs, plus product distribution costs. These costs are also used to value inventory and the resulting inventoried cost per pound is compared to the estimated sales prices based on the contracts or spot sales anticipated for the distribution of the product. Any costs in excess of the calculated market value are charged to cost of sales.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands of U.S. dollars):\nYear ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n$\n$\nSales\n38,368\n27,305\nCost of sales\n(24,401)\n(15,848)\nGross profit\n13,967\n11,457\nExploration and evaluation expense\n(2,623)\n(2,964)\nDevelopment expense\n(4,340)\n(2,886)\nGeneral and administrative expense\n(5,090)\n(4,740)\nAccretion expense\n(527)\n(534)\nWrite-off of mineral properties\n-\n(62)\nNet profit (loss) from operations\n1,387\n271\nInterest expense (net)\n(1,377)\n(1,977)\nWarrant mark to market gain\n-\n36\nLoss from equity investment\n(5)\n(5)\nWrite-off of equity investments\n-\n(1,089)\nForeign exchange loss\n(50)\n(278)\nOther income\n121\n15\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n76\n(3,027)\nIncome tax recovery (net)\n-\n17\nNet income (loss)\n76\n(3,010)\nIncome (loss) per share – basic\n0.00\n(0.02)\nIncome (loss) per share – diluted\n0.00\n(0.02)\nRevenue per pound sold\n49.09\n39.49\nTotal cost per pound sold\n31.28\n28.20\nGross profit per pound sold\n17.81\n11.29\nGuidance for 2018\nIn 2017, the average spot price per pound of U 3 O 8 , as reported by Ux Consulting Company, LLC and TradeTech, LLC, increased approximately 17% from $20.25 in December 2016 to about $23.75 per pound in December 2017. In early 2017, spot pricing moved higher on news of supply-side reductions, only to retreat to the $20 level, where it remained until November 2017. In November, spot prices again increased following several new supply-side announcements. Thus far in 2018, the average spot price per pound of U 3 O 8 has decreased to $21.63 as of February 28, indicating the fundamentals of market pricing have not changed sufficiently to warrant further development of MU2.\nIn response to this persistently weak uranium market, we took aggressive measures in 2016 and 2017, and will again do so in 2018. In 2016, we deliberately slowed development activities at MU2, reduced costs, and focused on enhancing production efficiencies from our operating MU1 header houses. In 2017, we continued to employ this limited-development strategy, implemented further cost reductions, and supplemented existing mine production with favorably priced uranium purchases to meet our 2017 contractual commitments. For 2018, we have suspended further MU2 development activities, implemented further cost reductions, and secured purchase contracts for nearly 100% of our 2018 delivery obligations.\nFor 2018, we expect to sell 470,000 pounds under term contracts at an average price of approximately $49 per pound. We have entered into purchase contracts to cover 460,000 pounds at an average price of approximately $24 per pound. Production from our operating MU1 and MU2 header houses, expected to be between 250,000 and 350,000 pounds, will be used to build an inventory position of finished, ready-to-sell, product at the conversion facility.\nWe recently implemented a limited reduction in force to further streamline our operations and reduce costs. This is the third reduction in force in force in two years; the layoffs since 2016 have affected personnel in all three company locations. The most recent reduction was focused on those departments not directly related to production and is expected to reduce our labor costs by approximately $0.6 million per year.\nTogether, these actions will give the Company the additional flexibility necessary to quickly react to changing market conditions and easily re-start development activities in MU2 when warranted. With future development and construction in mind, the staff who were retained had the greatest level of experience and adaptability allowing for an easier transition back to full operations.\nAlthough we made a small (10,000 pound) spot sale in January, we are not forecasting any further spot sales for 2018 at this time; we may, however, choose to do so if market conditions improve. We expect our average gross profit in 2018 to be between $10 and $12 million, which represents a cash-basis gross profit margin of between 45% and 50%.\nOperating costs in 2018 are expected to be lower than 2017 because of the suspended MU2 development activities. Other costs including capital expenditures and loan repayments will be similar to 2017.\nAs at February 28, 2018, our unrestricted cash position was $7.5 million. Given our current cash resources, contracted sales positions, and expected margins, we do not anticipate the need for additional funding in the near term unless it is advantageous to do so.\nThe Company has contractual sales commitments of 470,000 pounds during 2018, at an average price of approximately $49 per pound. We have established the schedule for those commitments and determined that an effective model for dealing with the current pricing environment is to continue production from our fully operational header houses in MU1 and MU2, and purchase uranium at favorable low-prices in order to meet our sales commitments. This operating strategy for Lost Creek will allow us to control production costs, minimize development expenditures, maximize cash flows and maintain the flexibility to respond to market conditions.\nAbout Ur-Energy\nUr-Energy is a uranium mining company operating the Lost Creek in-situ recovery uranium facility in south-central Wyoming.
