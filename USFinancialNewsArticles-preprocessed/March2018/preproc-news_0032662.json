    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hibbett Sports, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: HIBB):\nFourth Quarter EPS of $0.51, in Line with Recent Business Update Comparable Store Sales Increased 1.6% in Fourth Quarter One-time Gain of $0.07 Per Diluted Share in Fourth Quarter due to Sale of Team Division Issues Fiscal 2019 Outlook\nHibbett Sports, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: HIBB), an athletic specialty retailer, today provided the following business updates:\nFourth Quarter Results\nThe fourth quarter and Fiscal 2018 ended on February 3, 2018, included 14 weeks of results in the fourth quarter and 53 weeks of results in Fiscal 2018. Net sales for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018, increased 8.0% to $266.7 million (including $13.5 million for the 53 rd week) compared with $246.9 million for the 13-week period ended January 28, 2017. Comparable store sales increased 1.6% on a 13-week to 13-week basis. E-commerce sales represented 7.6% of total sales for the fourth quarter.\nGross margin was 31.5% of net sales for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018, compared with 33.0% for the 13-week period ended January 28, 2017. The decrease was mainly due to promotions and markdowns taken to improve our inventory position, and a $0.9 million one-time charge to establish a reserve against the Company’s Team Division inventory as a result of selling the business.\nStore operating, selling and administrative expenses were 23.2% of net sales for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018, level with 23.2% of net sales for the 13-week period ended January 28, 2017. The fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 included a one-time gain of $3.1 million due to the sale of the Company’s Team Division.\nNet income for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018, was $9.7 million compared with net income of $12.1 million for the 13-week period ended January 28, 2017. Earnings per diluted share was $0.51 for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.54 for the 13-week period ended January 28, 2017. Earnings per diluted share for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018, included a one-time gain of $0.07 per diluted share due to the sale of the Company’s Team Division, and a benefit of $0.08 per diluted share due to the 53 rd week in Fiscal 2018. As expected, the recent tax reform legislation did not have a significant impact on earnings in the fourth quarter.\nJeff Rosenthal, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We continue to expand our customer base by connecting with more and more customers through e-commerce and selective new store growth. Ease of shopping continues to improve across both channels, and we are expanding our assortment every day to better serve our customers. We will continue to place a significant focus on omni-channel in Fiscal 2019, which will bring exciting new functionality to improve the shopping experience and to help us improve the long-term profitability of the business.”\nFor the quarter, Hibbett opened 12 new stores, expanded two high-performing stores and closed 14 underperforming stores, bringing the store base to 1,079 in 35 states as of February 3, 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Results\nNet sales for the 53-week period ended February 3, 2018, decreased 0.5% to $968.2 million compared with $973.0 million for the 52-week period ended January 28, 2017. Comparable store sales decreased 3.8% on a 52-week to 52-week basis.\nGross margin was 32.3% of net sales for the 53-week period ended February 3, 2018, compared with 34.8% for the 52-week period ended January 28, 2017. The 53-week period ended February 3, 2018, included a $0.9 million one-time charge to establish a reserve against the Company’s Team Division inventory as a result of selling the business.\nStore operating, selling and administrative expenses were 23.9% of net sales for the 53-week period ended February 3, 2018, compared with 22.9% of net sales for the 52-week period ended January 28, 2017. The 53-week period ended February 3, 2018, included a one-time gain of $3.1 million due to the sale of the Company’s Team Division.\nNet income for the 53-week period ended February 3, 2018, was $35.0 million compared with $61.1 million for the 52-week period ended January 28, 2017. Earnings per diluted share for the 53-week period ended February 3, 2018, was $1.71 compared with $2.72 for the 52-week period ended January 28, 2017. Earnings per diluted share for the 53-week period ended February 3, 2018, included a one-time gain of $0.07 per diluted share due to the sale of the Company’s Team Division and a benefit of $0.07 per diluted share due to the 53 rd week in Fiscal 2018.\nFor the year, Hibbett opened 44 new stores, expanded 11 high performing stores and closed 43 underperforming stores.\nLiquidity and Stock Repurchases\nHibbett ended the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 with $73.5 million of available cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet, no bank debt outstanding and full availability under its $60.0 million unsecured credit facilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 611,596 shares of common stock for a total expenditure of $9.3 million.
