A live webcast and replay of the call will be available at the Investor Relations section of the Company’s web site at ir.r1rcm.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by R1’s management team in financial and operational decision making, the Company supplements its GAAP consolidated financial statements with certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are included .\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017: As of January 1, 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Subsequent to adoption of Topic 606, the non-GAAP financial measure referenced in the press release is adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income before net interest income, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, and severance & certain other items.\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2016: Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the company included gross cash generated from customer contracting activities, and net cash generated from customer contacting activities. Gross cash generated from customer contracting activities was defined as GAAP net services revenue, plus the change in deferred customer billings. Accordingly, gross cash generated from customer contracting activities was the sum of (i) invoiced or accrued net operating fees, (ii) cash collections on incentive fees and (iii) other services fees. Net cash generated from customer contracting activities was defined as net income before net interest income, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, severance and certain other items, and change in deferred customer billings. Deferred customer billings included the portion of both (i) invoiced or accrued net operating fees and (ii) cash collections of incentive fees, in each case, that did not meet our prior revenue recognition criteria. Deferred customer billings are included in the detail of our customer liabilities and customer liabilities - related party balance in the consolidated balance sheets available in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur board and management team use non-GAAP measures as (i) one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and (ii) a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive incentive compensation programs, as well as for incentive compensation programs for employees.\nTables 4 and 5 present a reconciliation of GAAP net services revenue to gross cash generated from customer contracting activities, GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA, and GAAP net income to net cash generated from customer contracting activities. Table 9 presents a reconciliation of GAAP operating income guidance to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA guidance. Adjusted EBITDA and net cash generated from customer contracting activities are non-GAAP measures and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release includes information that may constitute “ ,” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
