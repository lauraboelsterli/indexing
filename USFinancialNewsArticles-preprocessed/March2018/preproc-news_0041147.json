    "text": "Would Replace Significant Revenue from Proposed Sale of Waste Asset Targeted to Close in the Second Quarter of 2018\nMILTON, GA , March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attis Industries, Inc. (f/k/a Meridian Waste Solutions, Inc.) (NASDAQ: MRDN ) (“Meridian Waste” or the “Company” and recently announced name change to “Attis Industries, Inc.” or “Attis”), an integrated technology and innovations company, today announced the execution of a non-binding letter of intent to purchase a transactional-based virtual currency company.\nFor the past several months, Attis Industries has been evaluation this opportunity with the goal of having the opportunity stand on its own with significant growth for the future, as well as bridging our Innovations and Healthcare platforms into the integration of the consolidated company. The preliminary review of the targeted company has included extensive and continued management meetings, financial discussions focused on historical audited and internal financial statements, analysis of business plans in its current markets, discussions of bringing Attis into additional markets with its Innovations and Healthcare divisions, as well as developing further markets in FinTech when blending the divisions together. Completing the transaction is subject to customary due diligence requirements and the parties continuing their due diligence which has already begun and then entering into a binding agreement for the acquisition. If a binding agreement is entered into, the closing of the transaction would still be subject to customary closing conditions.\nThis acquisition will provide Attis an opportunity to replace a significant portion of revenue and earnings from the proposed sale of its waste assets while allowing the Company to continue to focus on innovative technology in growth industry segments, such as this FinTech opportunity. Attis is anticipating a close of this transaction in the second quarter of 2018.\n“Today’s announcement commences a potential new division for Attis Industries as we pivot from our previous sole focus in the waste industry to our new pathway as an innovation and technology company,” stated, Jeff Cosman, Chief Executive Officer of Attis Industries. “I’m amazed with our new partner’s management team of proven entrepreneurs and their track record of success, all of which will be an asset to our existing senior leadership team at Attis. Virtual currency and its underlying blockchain technology have the potential to enhance the current banking environment. We see highly compelling opportunities for innovation in this area, both in banking and in our other existing businesses. We intend to be at the forefront of virtual currency adoption, a trend that is already strong as demonstrated by many Fortune 500 companies accepting the currency for payments.”\nAbout Meridian Waste Solutions, Inc. / Attis Industries, Inc.\nMeridian Waste Solutions, Inc.
