    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 1:29 AM / Updated 13 minutes ago BOC Aviation says to buy six Boeing aircraft worth $1.7 billion Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - BOC Aviation Ltd said on Thursday it would buy six new Boeing 787-9 aircraft from Boeing worth a combined $1.7 billion (£1.2 billion) at list prices. The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company Boeing (BA) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 22, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nAsia’s second-biggest aircraft lessor, which had 491 aircraft as of the end of last year, said it expected to take delivery of the aircraft in 2018 and 2019. The deal will be funded through cash on hand, loans and borrowings. \nThe Singapore-based company, which is majority-owned by Bank of China, this month posted a better-than-expected 40 percent rise in full-year net profit on higher revenue and U.S. tax cuts.
