    "text": "Company Provides Development Update and Issues Long-Term Growth Targets\nAnnounces Appointment of New Director\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. (“The ONE Group” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:STKS), today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also provided a development update, issued long-term growth targets and announced the appointment of a new director.\nHighlights for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nTotal GAAP revenue increased 6.1% to $21.7 million compared to $20.4 million in the same period last year; Comparable sales for owned and managed STK units, inclusive of our international units*, increased 9.5% compared to the same period last year. Domestic comparable sales were +6% and international comparable sales were +15.5%; GAAP net income from continuing operations before income taxes was $71,000 compared to a loss of $2.1 million for the same period last year; GAAP net loss attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. was $331,000 or $0.01 loss per share compared to GAAP net loss of $16.1 million or $0.64 loss per share for the same period last year; Adjusted EBITDA** increased 58% to $2.4 million compared to the same period last year and 54% to $7.0 million for the full year; and, Total restaurant expenses decreased 540 basis points from 88% to 83% as a percentage of revenues.\nEmanuel “Manny” Hilario, Chief Executive Officer, said, “Fiscal 2017 was an outstanding year for both sales and profitability at The ONE Group. We stayed committed and made strong progress implementing and executing our four-point strategy of driving comparable sales; focusing growth on license and management deals; improving operational efficiency in the restaurants; and reducing corporate G&A. The comparable sales and EBITDA growth in our fourth quarter further demonstrates the successful execution of this strategy and we are confident this success will continue. We are particularly proud of the 540 basis point increase to consolidated restaurant level margin compared to last year as well as the over 50% increase in our fourth quarter and annual profits at the EBITDA level.”\nMr. Hilario continued, “Looking ahead, 2018 is shaping up to be even more exciting than last year. Interest in our brand is growing stronger as evidenced by the development pipeline for our high margin, asset-light business and we continue to see interest in our brand on a world-wide basis. Strong execution at the restaurant level coupled with our highly differentiated experience provides us with great confidence that 2018 will be a highly productive year for our business.”\nMr. Hilario concluded, “We are pleased to be providing greater transparency to our investors by articulating long-term growth targets. Growing our top-line will be based upon an asset-light model of adding three to five licensed units and one to two food and beverage hospitality deals annually, coupled with comparable sales growth in the low single digits (1% to 2%). We also intend to maintain strong restaurant-level EBITDA margins, benefitting from economies of scale and operating efficiencies, while remaining disciplined in our G&A management. If these targets can be achieved, we should be able to generate consistent growth in Adjusted EBITDA of 20%+ over the long-term.”\n*Comparable sales or same store sales (“SSS”), represents total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units opened for a full 18-month period. This metric includes total revenue from our US owned and managed STK locations as well as the revenue reported to us with respect to comparable sales at our international locations (measured in constant currency), and excludes revenues where we do not directly control the event sales force (Royalton Hotel in NY and The W Hotel in Westwood, CA).\nTotal food and beverage sales at owned and managed units, a non-GAAP measure, represents our total revenue from our owned operations as well as the revenue reported to us with respect to sales at our managed locations, where we earn management and incentive fees at these locations. For a reconciliation of our GAAP revenue to total food and beverage sales at our owned and managed units and a discussion of why we consider it useful, see the financial information accompanying this release.\n** Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, represents net loss before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment loss, deferred rent, pre-opening expenses, non-recurring gains and losses, stock based compensation, losses from discontinued operations and certain transactional costs. For a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP and a discussion of why we consider it useful, see the financial information accompanying this release.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal GAAP Revenue increased 6.1% to $21.7 million in 2017 compared to $20.4 million in the same period last year due to sales increases in comparable and new stores along with increased revenue from management, license and incentive fee revenue.\nTotal owned net revenues increased 2.0% to $18.3 million in 2017 compared to $18.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due the opening of the STK in Denver in January 2017 and an increase in comparable sales, partially offset by the closing of the STK in Washington, DC in December 2016.\nComparable sales from owned STK units increased 5.8%, while comparable sales from both owned and managed STK units increased 6.0%. These increases reflect strong performances of the STK brand.\nManagement, license and incentive fee revenue increased 36.5% to $3.3 million in 2017 compared to $2.4 million in 2016. The increase was driven by higher management and incentive fees reflecting the strong performances of our European locations along with the launch of the licensed STK in Dubai in December.\nGAAP net loss attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. in 2017 the quarter was $331,000 or $0.01 loss per share compared to GAAP net loss of $16.1 million or $0.64 loss per share in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA** increased 57.7% to $2.4 million in 2017 from $1.5 million in 2016.\nTotal food and beverage sales at owned and managed units* increased 1.4% to $44.3 million in 2017 compared to $43.7 million in 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal GAAP Revenue increased 10.2% to $79.8 million for the full year 2017 compared to $72.4 million in 2016 due to sales increases in comparable and new stores along with increased revenue from management, license and incentive fee revenue.\nTotal owned net revenues increased 7.7% to $68.9 million in the full year 2017 compared to $63.9 million in the full year 2016. The increase was primarily due to the opening of our STK in Denver and the increase in comparable sales across the brand restaurants.\nComparable sales from owned STK units increased 0.5% while comparable sales from owned and managed STK units increased 2.6% reflecting the success throughout the year of focused sales initiatives.\nManagement, license and incentive fee revenue increased 29.0% to $10.9 million in the full year 2017 compared to $8.5 million in the prior full year. The revenues increase was primarily driven by our UK operations.\nGAAP net loss attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. in the full year 2017 was $4.2 million or $0.16 loss per share compared to GAAP net loss of $16.7 million or $0.66 loss per share in the full year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 53.6% to $7.0 million in the full year 2017 from $4.5 million in the full year 2016.\nTotal food and beverage sales at owned and managed units* increased 8.0% to $169.8 million in the full year 2017 compared to $157.2 million in the full year 2016\nDevelopment Update - Projected 2018\nOwned Restaurants - STK San Diego\nLicensed Units - STK Dubai- Downtown, STK Doha, STK Puerto Rico, and STK Mexico City\nLong-Term Growth Targets\nThe Company is providing the following long-term growth targets:\nThree to five licensed restaurant units and one to two food and beverage hospitality deals annually; Comparable sales growth of 1% to 2%; Consistent Adjusted EBITDA growth of at least 20%; and, Continued focus on our asset light model and disciplined G&A management, while benefitting from economies of scale and operating efficiencies.\nAppointment of New Director\nThe Company named Dimitrios J.

In this press release, we also make references to the following non-GAAP financial measures: total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units and adjusted EBITDA.\nTotal food and beverage sales at owned and managed units. Total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units represents our total revenue from our owned operations as well as the revenue reported to us with respect to sales at our managed locations, where we earn management and incentive fees at these locations. We believe that this measure represents a useful internal measure of performance as it identifies total sales associated with our brands and hospitality services that we provide. We believe that this measure also represents a useful internal measure of performance. Accordingly, we include this non-GAAP measure so that investors can review financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing performance of restaurants and other services we operate, whether or not the operation is owned by us. However, because this measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP, it is susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, this measure as presented may not be directly comparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies. This non-GAAP measure is presented as supplemental information and not as an alternative to any GAAP measurements. The following table includes a reconciliation of our GAAP revenue to total food and beverage sales at our owned and managed units (in thousands):\nFor the quarter ended\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\n(unaudited) (unaudited) Owned restaurant net revenue (a) $16,554 $15,647 $58,654 $54,068 Owned food, beverage and other revenues (a) 1,767 2,320 10,227 9,880 Total owned revenue 18,321 17,967 68,881 63,948 Management, license and incentive revenue 3,340 2,447 10,917 8,466 GAAP Revenues $21,661 $20,414 79,798 72,414 Food and Beverage Sales from Managed Units (a) $25,979 $25,733 $100,963 $93,255 Total Food and Beverage sales at Owned and Managed Units $44,300 $43,700 $169,844 $157,203 (a) Components of Total Food & Beverage Sales at Owned and Managed Units The following table presents the elements of the Comparable sales measure for Fiscal 2017 on a quarterly basis. Note that comparable sales for international managed business is determined on a constant currency basis.\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nYear\nUS Owned Restaurants -1.8% 1.2% -0.9% 5.8% 0.5% US Managed Locations 8.3% 2.5% 6.5% 6.6% 6.0% US Total 2.6% 1.7% 1.9% 6.0% 2.6% International 13.2% 2.6% 9.4% 15.5% 10.0% Global 6.0% 2.0% 4.6% 9.5% 5.2% Adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment loss, deferred rent, pre-opening expenses, non-recurring gains and losses, stock based compensation, losses from discontinued operations and certain transactional costs. Adjusted EBITDA has been presented in this press release and is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP.\nWe believe that adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance, as it provides a clear picture of our operating results by eliminating certain non-cash expenses that are not reflective of the underlying business performance. We use this metric to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and to analyze the factors and trends affecting our business as well as evaluate the performance of our units. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies; accordingly, you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is included in this press release because it is a key metric used by management. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We use adjusted EBITDA, alongside other GAAP measures such as net income (loss), to measure profitability, as a key profitability target in our annual and other budgets, and to compare our performance against that of peer companies. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information facilitating operating performance comparisons from period to period.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated (unaudited, in thousands):\nFor the quarters ended December 31, 2017 2016 Net loss attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. $ (331 ) $ (16,148 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 117 21 Net loss (214 ) (16,127 ) Interest expense, net of interest income 363 187 Provision for income taxes 285 13,937 Depreciation and amortization 430 819 EBITDA 864 (1,184 ) Deferred rent (1) (21 ) (250 ) Pre-opening expenses 377 1,513 Lease termination and related asset write-offs (2) 898 529 Loss from discontinued operations — 93 Transaction costs (3) 167 788 Stock based compensation 330 115 Adjusted EBITDA 2,615 1,604 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interest 187 64 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. $ 2,428 $ 1,540 For the years ended December 31, 2017 2016 Net loss attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. $ (4,199 ) $ (16,688 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 188 233 Net loss (4,011 ) (16,455 ) Interest expense, net of interest income 1,167 464 Provision for income taxes 650 10,370 Depreciation and amortization 3,051 2,647 EBITDA 857 (2,974 ) Deferred rent (1) (61 ) (657 ) Pre-opening expenses 1,663 5,994 Lease termination and related asset write-offs (2) 1,781 529 Loss from discontinued operations 106 92 Transaction costs (3) 421 1,293 Derivative income — (100 ) Stock based compensation 1,074 838 Settlements 1,295\n—\nEquity share of settlement costs\n270\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA 7,406 5,015 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interest 456 491 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. $ 6,950 $ 4,524 (1) Deferred rent is included in owned restaurant operating expenses and general and administrative expense on the statement of operations and comprehensive income.
