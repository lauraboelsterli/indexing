    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE: HTA), a fully integrated real estate investment trust that focuses on owning and operating high quality medical office buildings in desirable markets across the U.S., announced today that its Board of Directors appointed Ms. Vicki U. Booth as new Independent Director.\nMs. Booth currently serves as the President of the Ueberroth Family Foundation, which is actively engaged in working with groups and organizations focused on healthcare, human services and improving the lives of youth. Through these activities, Booth has established strong relationships within the healthcare community that result in strategic insight into health system plans. Her relationships have led to current roles as a Director for Hoag Hospital, part of the Providence St. Joseph Health system, and Member of the Texas Christian University (TCU) Chancellor's Advisory Council, which is overseeing the founding of the TCU Medical School. In addition, Booth currently serves as the chair of the steering committee of the Family Foundation Alliance and is a member of the Orange County Funders Roundtable. She is the past chair of the Board of Governors of the Orange County Community Foundation where she continues to chair the Community Impact Committee.\n\"We are pleased to welcome Vicki to our team. She has experience working with healthcare systems and brings a wealth of relationships through her work at the Ueberroth Family Foundation,\" said Scott D. Peters, HTA Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Healthcare is changing at a tremendous pace and Vicki's insights and relationships will be tremendous assets to HTA as we continue to move our company forward.\"\nMs. Booth will serve on the Board of Directors for the remainder of the term and will be up for election at the Annual Meeting in July 2018.\nAbout Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE: HTA)\nHealthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE: HTA) is the largest dedicated owner and operator of medical office buildings in the United States, based on gross leasable area. We provide the real estate infrastructure for the integrated delivery of healthcare services in highly desirable locations. Over the last decade, we have invested approximately $7 billion primarily in medical office buildings and other healthcare assets comprising over 24 million square feet of GLA. Our investments are targeted in 20 to 25 key markets that we believe have superior healthcare demographics that support strong, long-term demand for medical office space. We have achieved, and continue to achieve, critical mass within these key markets by expanding our presence through accretive acquisitions, and utilizing our in-house operating expertise through our regionally located property management and leasing platform. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona and directed from our full-time service offices, HTA has developed a national brand with dedicated relationships at the local level. We have achieved scale in 16 markets with greater than 500,000 square feet and 10 markets with approximately 1 million or greater square feet; in each market we service our healthcare providers through our institutional full-service operational platform including property management, leasing and development services. This drives efficiencies, strong tenant and health system relationships, and strategic partnerships that result in high levels of tenant retention, rental growth, and long-term value creation across the portfolio. Founded in 2006 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, HTA has produced attractive returns for its stockholders that we believe have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and US REIT indices. More information about HTA can be found on the Company's website , Facebook , LinkedIn and Twitter .\nForward-Looking Language\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements.
