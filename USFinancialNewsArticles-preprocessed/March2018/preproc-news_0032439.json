A Japanese flag flutters atop the Bank of Japan building in Tokyo, Japan, September 21, 2016. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has been approved for another five-year term after his current one ends in April. Masazumi Wakatabe, an academic known as a vocal advocate of aggressive easing, and career central banker Masayoshi Amamiya will become Kuroda’s deputies next week. The nominees were approved during a lower house plenary session, following approval by the upper house. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling coalition holds a comfortable majority in the both chambers.
