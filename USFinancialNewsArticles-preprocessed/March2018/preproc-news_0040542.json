    "text": "Net cash position at EUR 3 million as of December 31, 2017\nPositive operating cash flow at EUR 0.5 million over the 2017 financial year\nGRENOBLE, France & DURHAM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nMEMSCAP (NYSE Euronext: MEMS) (Paris:MEMS), the leading provider of innovative solutions based on MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) technology, today announced its earnings for the 2017 financial year ending December 31, 2017.\nAnalysis of the consolidated income statement\nIn line with the previous quarterly press releases, MEMSCAP reported an audited revenue of EUR 11.7 million for FY 2017, a similar amount to FY 2016. Expressed in US dollar, consolidated sales for FY 2017 amounted to US$ 13.2 million against US$ 12.9 million for FY 2016. It is to be noted that sales made in US dollar represented approximately 84% of the Group's revenue in 2017 and 2016.\nConsolidated revenue distribution by market segment, over FY 2017, is as follows:\nMarket segments / Revenue (In million euros) FY 2017 % FY 2016 % Aerospace 6.2 53% 5.6 48% Optical communications / Adaptive optics 2.6 22% 3.9 33% Medical / Biomedical 2.0 17% 1.4 12% Others 0.9 8% 0.8 7% Total 11.7 100% 11.7 100% (Any apparent discrepancies in totals are due to rounding.)\nMEMSCAP’s consolidated earnings for FY 2017 are given by the following table:\nIn million euros For the year ended\n31 December 2017\nFor the year ended\n31 December 2016\nRevenue 11.7 11.7 Standard products*\nCustom products\n8.0 3.7\n7.0 4.7\nCost of revenue (8.3) (7.9) Gross margin 3.4 3.8 % of revenue 29% 32% Operating expenses** (4.0) (3.8) Operating profit / (loss) (0.6) 0.0 Financial profit / (loss) 0.0 0.1 Income tax expense (0.2) 0.0 Net profit / (loss) (0.8) 0.1 (Financial data were subject to an audit by the Group’s statutory auditors who will issue their reports at a later date. On March 21 st , 2018, the MEMSCAP’s board of directors authorized the release of the FY 2017 consolidated financial statements. Any apparent discrepancies in totals are due to rounding.)\n* Including the royalties from the dermo-cosmetics segment.\n** Net of research & development grants.\n* * *\nThe sales of the Standard Products division (+14% vs. FY 2016) benefited from the continued dynamism of the avionics business (+EUR 0.6 million vs. FY 2016) as well as from the recovery observed in the medical segment. Representing 53% of the consolidated sales (FY 2016: 48%) with an annual revenue of EUR 6.2 million, the avionics business remains the Group's leading market segment.\nThe sales of the Custom Products division were down by 22% compared to FY 2016 due to the temporary slowdown in demand on the optical communications / adaptive optics segment during the first three quarters of FY 2017. However, the last quarter of 2017 marked the return to similar levels of sales for this business compared to 2016.\nThe transformation of the Group's industrial organization, initiated during FY 2017 and in line with the previously announced strategy, impacted the consolidated margin rate at 29% of the consolidated sales compared to 32% for FY 2016. The consolidated gross margin amounted to EUR 3.4 million compared to EUR 3.8 million for FY 2016.\nThe consolidated operating expenses, net of research and development grants, amounted to EUR 4.0 million for FY 2017, an increase of EUR 0.2 million compared to the previous year. This trend is mainly due to the intensification of the Group's research and development programs in the avionics sector. For FY 2017, research and development expenses, net of grants, represented 11% of the consolidated sales (FY 2016: 9%). The total number of full-time equivalent employees in the Group went from 58 in 2016 to 56 in 2017, a decrease of 3%.\nIn 2017, the Group reported an operating loss of EUR 0.6 million compared to break-even operating earnings for FY 2016. The consolidated financial income for FY 2017, including foreign exchange losses of EUR 0.1 million, was at the break-even level. In 2016, the financial profit was EUR 0.1 million including foreign exchange gains of EUR 0.1 million. The tax expense recognized over FY 2017 amounted to EUR 0.2 million and corresponded to the change in deferred tax assets related to the Norwegian entity, without any impact on the Group's cash position.\nThe Group therefore reported a net loss of EUR 0.8 million for FY 2017 compared to a net profit at EUR 0.1 million for FY 2016.\nIncrease of the net cash position\nThe positive operating cash flow amounted to EUR 0.5 million for FY 2017 compared to EUR 1.2 million for FY 2016. At December 31, 2017, consolidated available cash was EUR 3.9 million including cash and short-term deposits as well as cash investments (Corporate bonds) recorded under financial assets available for sale. In addition to this amount, the available unused credit lines amounted to EUR 0.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, net cash was EUR 3.0 million increasing by EUR 0.2 million compared to the net cash position at December 31, 2016.\nMEMSCAP shareholder’s equity totalled EUR 17.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nAnalysis and perspectives\nAs previously announced, MEMSCAP has initiated in 2017 the transformation of its industrial organization in order to increase significantly the flexibility of the Group's production capacities. This program is progressing according to the Company’s plans. In line with its strategy focused on the high-added-value segments of aerospace, medical and optical communications, the Group is continuing its disengagement from low-margin services in favour of the development of its activities backed by its own intellectual property.\nThough this evolution has impacted the profitability of MEMSCAP over the 2017 financial year, it should enable the Group to benefit from a marked increase in its margin levels over the coming years.\n* * *\nQ1 2018 earnings: April 24, 2018\nAnnual meeting of shareholders: May 24, 2018\nAbout MEMSCAP\nMEMSCAP is the leading provider of innovative micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based solutions.\nMEMSCAP’s products and solutions include components, component designs (IP), manufacturing and related services.\nFor more information, visit our website at: www.memscap.com .\nMEMSCAP is listed on Euronext Paris ™ -
