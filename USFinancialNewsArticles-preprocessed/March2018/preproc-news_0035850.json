A man walks past a Canara Bank office in Mumbai, India, January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade By 0405 GMT, shares in the bank were down 3.80 percent at 254.15 rupees after earlier falling to a low of 250 rupees. The case is the latest in a string of bank frauds reported to authorities in the aftermath of a sprawling $2 billion fraud that was unearthed weeks ago at Punjab National Bank.
