    "text": "2018 adjusted earnings per share expected to increase more than 30 percent on market strength and improved execution\nST. LOUIS,\nA PDF accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/eb2af9eb-f507-40b7-99fe-b669ff411f5a\nRevenues reached a record $1.36 billion in FY’17 compared to $1.22 billion in FY’16, an increase of 11 percent, driven by growth across all three segments.\nFY’17 loss per diluted share was $2.08 compared to income of $0.84 per diluted share in FY’16. FY’17 adjusted (non-GAAP) 1 earnings per diluted share were $1.03 compared to $1.10 in FY’16.\nAdjusted operating income in FY’17 grew 9.9 percent compared to FY’16, driven by increases within Corrosion Protection, Energy Services and Infrastructure Solutions’ North America CIPP businesses that were partly offset by losses within the restructured businesses.\nNew orders increased 20 percent in FY’17 to $1.36 billion. Contract backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $689.0 million, an increase of $96.2 million, or 16 percent, from contract backlog at December 31, 2016, each excluding backlog for the large deepwater pipe coating and insulation project, which was substantially completed during FY’17.\n1 Adjusted (non-GAAP) results exclude certain charges related to the Company’s restructuring activities, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, impacts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, impacts from 2016 legal settlements and reversal of a contingency reserve. Reconciliation of adjusted results is below.\n2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nInfrastructure Solutions set new records in FY’17 for both revenues of $612.2 million and new orders of $658.1 million. Strong top-line results were offset by nearly $16 million of adjusted losses, or $0.33 adjusted earnings per diluted share, from portions of the business subject to restructuring actions in Denmark, Australia and Fyfe North America.\nCorrosion Protection delivered near record revenues of $456.1 million and a more than threefold increase in operating income in FY’17 compared to FY’16, driven by the successful execution of the large deepwater pipe coating and insulation project.\nEnergy Services revenues grew 17 percent and adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points from FY’16 on growth across all revenue streams.\n“Aegion’s order intake growth across all three segments was a highlight of 2017. Resulting strong revenues and execution generated record contributions from the North America CIPP business and a marked turnaround at Energy Services. We also successfully completed the large deepwater pipe coating and insulation project. These results helped offset significant losses in the restructured businesses as well as execution challenges within our U.S. cathodic protection operations.\n\"Looking forward, we feel confident in the decisive actions we have taken to return troubled businesses to profitability in 2018. These efforts, combined with ongoing market strength and our backlog position, drive our favorable outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share improvement of more than 30 percent in 2018.”\nCharles R. Gordon, President and Chief Executive Officer\nSTRATEGIC ACTIONS\nIn August 2017, the Company announced a series of strategic actions intended to generate more predictable and sustainable long-term earnings growth. Activity during 2017 included:\n• Initiating a process to divest the Corrosion Protection’s pipe coating and insulation business in Louisiana.\n• Restructuring activities associated with the decision to exit the Infrastructure Solutions’ North America activity for non-pressure pipe contracting applications of the Tyfo® system.\n• Restructuring activities associated with realigning the Infrastructure Solutions’ operations in Australia and Denmark.\n• Restructuring activities associated with Corrosion Protection’s operations in Canada, which also included downsizing activities reflecting current and anticipated market conditions.\n• Implementation of other cost savings initiatives across the Company.\nTotal charges of $110.1 million were incurred in 2017 related to the above restructuring actions, which included cash charges of $13.7 million and a related impairment charge of $86 million. For 2017 and 2018, total restructuring and impairment charges are estimated to be between $115 and $120 million, with total cash charges of $19 to $21 million, most of which are expected to be completed before the end of 1H'18.\nThe Company expects the restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives to achieve annualized cost reductions in excess of $20 million. Cost reductions are partially offset by strategic investments made across the Company.\nTAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT\nAegion has completed an initial assessment of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company expects its 2018 effective tax rate will be between 23 and 24 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company also recorded a provisional estimated net tax expense of $2.4 million, which consisted of a charge of $10.4 million for the deemed mandatory repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, reduced by a $7.1 million release of a deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings and $0.9 million of other reform-related impacts. This one-time charge was excluded from adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per diluted share. The impacts of the legislation may differ materially from this estimate (and the amount of the provisional charge may be adjusted over the course of 2018) due to changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the tax legislation.\nCREDIT FACILITY AMENDMENT\nOn February 27, 2018, the Company amended its existing Credit Facility to, among other items:\nExtend the expiration date from October 2020 to February 2023;\nAllow the sale of the Company's pipe coating and insulation business in Louisiana; and\nUpdate the credit facility's defined terms to allow for the add-back of certain charges related to the 2017 Restructuring when calculating our compliance with financial covenants.\nIn the event of the sale of the Company's pipe coating and insulation business, the net cash proceeds are required to first be applied against any outstanding borrowings on the revolving line of credit. Additionally, upon such a sale, the aggregate principal amount of the revolving line of credit will be reduced from $300.0 million to $275.0 million.\nIn October 2017, the Company’s board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $40.0 million of the Company’s common stock in 2018 open market transactions. The recent credit facility amendment limits open market share repurchases to $30.0 million in 2018, with flexibility to increase levels to $40.0 million in 2019 and beyond, pursuant to further board of directors approval.\nSelected FY’17 Consolidated Financial Highlights\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands, except earnings per share) As Reported\n(GAAP) Adjustments\n(1) (2) As Adjusted\n(Non-GAAP) As Reported\n(GAAP) Adjustments\n(3) As Adjusted\n(Non-GAAP) Revenues $ 1,359,019 $ — $ 1,359,019 $ 1,221,920 $ — $ 1,221,920 Cost of revenues 1,074,207 (156 ) 1,074,051 968,756 (3,905 ) 964,851 Gross profit 284,812 156 284,968 253,164 3,905 257,069 Operating expenses 225,826 (11,017 ) 214,809 197,099 (3,843 ) 193,256 Goodwill impairment 45,390 (45,390 ) — — — — Definite-lived intangible asset impairment 41,032 (41,032 ) — — — — Gain on litigation settlement — — — (6,625 ) 6,625 — Acquisition and divestiture expenses 2,923 (2,923 ) — 2,696 (2,696 ) — Restructuring and related charges 12,814 (12,814 ) — 9,168 (9,168 ) — Operating income (loss) (43,173 ) 113,332 70,159 50,826 12,987 63,813 Net income (loss)\n(attributable to Aegion Corporation) (69,054 ) 103,839 34,785 29,488 9,153 38,641 Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (2.08 ) $ 3.11 $ 1.03 $ 0.84 $ 0.26 $ 1.10 Net income and diluted earnings per share includes non-controlling interest.\n(1) 2017 Non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments:\nRestructuring: Charges for cost of revenues of $156 primarily related to the write-off of certain other assets; charges for operating expenses of $11,017 primarily related to wind-down and other restructuring-related charges; and charges of $12,814 related to employee severance, extension of benefits, employment assistance programs and early lease and contract termination costs.
