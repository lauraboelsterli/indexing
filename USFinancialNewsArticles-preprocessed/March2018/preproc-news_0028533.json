Washington last year levied tariffs against imports of soyoil-based biodiesel from Argentina and palm oil-based supplies from Indonesia. “It’s a very big boost for the domestic biofuels industry and we intend to continue to protect the growers in America and the processors of biofuels,” Ross said during a Senate hearing on infrastructure.
