The March 2018 distribution will be paid on March 29, 2018.\nThe Fund is a limited purpose, open-ended trust established under the laws of the Province of Ontario that, through The Keg Rights Limited Partnership (the \"Partnership\"), a subsidiary of the Fund, owns certain trademarks and other related intellectual property used by Keg Restaurants Ltd.
