    "text": "CNBC.com Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images A person uses an Apple Watch Series 3 at the Apple Omotesando store on September 22, 2017 in Tokyo, Japan. \nApple will launch the fourth iteration of its smartwatch this fall, with a 15 percent larger display and \"trendy\" new design, according to an analyst report obtained by 9to5Mac . \nThe new version of the Apple Watch may also have a longer-lasting battery, according to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who wrote his predictions in a note seen by 9to5Mac. Kuo also predicted new health-monitoring sensors for the Watch, 9to5Mac said. \nApple's Series 3 smartwatch, announced in September , was the first to feature cellular connectivity, allowing users to access phone-like features without a handset nearby. That, among other features, moved Apple to the top spot in the wearable device market for the first time in the fourth quarter, according to IDC . A new form factor could provide a visible cue to new customers. \nWhile Kuo is considered a top-performing Apple analyst, Apple rarely confirms any details of products prior to launches. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.",
