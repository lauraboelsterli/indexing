    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. If someone hasn’t bored on to you about blockchain yet, it’s only a matter of time as real techies, but also the snake oil salesmen, take to conference stages to explain how the tech can be applied to the digital advertising supply chain. The Drum has a timely guide on when to call B.S. on the industry’s latest buzzword .\nTwo Minutes to Midnight If you feel like TV has been overstuffed with commercial breaks recently, you’re not imagining things. An analysis from Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser last month found the average national commercial load in January had experienced its most significant increase since 2015. But some networks have plans to cut back. Not long after NBCUniversal said it was experimenting with cutting ad time by 10% during its original prime-time programming, Fox has stated an even more aspirational goal. As CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports, Fox Networks Group’s ad sales chief, Joe Marchese, wants to reduce commercial time across the broadcast network to two minutes an hour by 2020. To avoid a revenue slump, Fox would need to raise its ad prices and change the way ad buyers think about buying media. Mr. Marchese is looking to sell ads using a time spent metric, versus the number of views, which will require a considerable shift in buyers’ mind-sets to successfully reach that two-minute mark in just two year’s time. Reminder: 21st Century Fox, which owns the Fox broadcast network, shares common ownership with Wall Street Journal parent News Corp.\nYou Don’t Know You’re Beautiful Take a look at a selection of fashion beauty ads, and you’d be forgiven for thinking movements like #MeToo hadn’t happened: You’re likely to run into highly sexualized shots and the same old body-image stereotypes. But, as WSJ reports, a number of major clothing and cosmetics brands are shifting to produce ads that neither objectify women nor depict unachievable physical beauty . New York-based designer Alexander Wang’s latest ad campaign goes a step further by not showing women’s faces or bodies at all, instead displaying the clothes and focusing on the “spirit” of the women who wear his clothes. And it was only last fall, when the label’s ads included an image of a scantily clad model dangling an Alexander Wang handbag between her legs. Highly sexualized ads are now seen by many young women as uncreative and outdated, and consumers have the megaphone of social media to call brands out when they lean on tone-deaf tropes.\nOscarrrghs And the winner is…well, maybe it wasn’t ABC. The television audience for the Academy Awards on Sunday pulled in a record low of 26.5 million viewers , down 19% from last year, WSJ reports. Perhaps it’s finally time for a shake-up… or maybe more screw-ups , as WSJ’s Jason Gay suggested, recalling the squirmingly uncomfortable 2017 Best Picture gaffe. The Oscars is a mammoth four-hour-long show and while there was a fun addition to the format this year, when host Jimmy Kimmel brought some Oscars attendees to surprise a theater of unexpected moviegoers next door, the event in its current format is still an endurance test. If ratings continue their downward spiral, will advertisers still want to use the show as a vehicle to launch new campaigns or make big statements? That said, the Oscars still pulls in a big audience and is far from the only live broadcast to shed ratings this year. The Super Bowl suffered last month and the Grammy Awards declined in January, too.\nComplete Control I write to you today from the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA) conference in London. Unsurprisingly, accountability and marketers taking control of their media spend were key themes, hammered home by Procter & Gamble Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard’s keynote address that reminded the room about the changes the consumer-goods giant has been making in its digital ad spending and agency relationships. He also said marketers should promote inclusion, noting P&G has introduced audio description to 89% of its ads in the U.K., helping the two million people with sight loss in the region better experience its advertising. Later, Carolyn McCall, CEO of ITV, the U.K.’s largest commercial broadcaster, delivered the sales pitch for TV advertising (and advertising on ITV, in particular), while rounding on digital rivals. “Gone should be the days when Google and Facebook, TV’s main competitors for advertising, embed their staff in marketing departments to advise them on media planning under the pretext that the more data there is, the better that data is,” Ms. McCall said, recalling when Facebook’s Ad Manager tool claimed advertisers could reach more people of certain age groups that census data show actually exist.\nBest of the rest Amazon is in talks with big banks including JPMorgan Chase about creating a checking-account-like product that would appeal to younger consumers and people without bank accounts. [ WSJ ]\nMarriott International is shifting its media account from WPP’s Wavemaker to Publicis. [ Axios ]\nDisney has named James Pitaro as ESPN’s new president, ending a three-month search after the sports company’s former boss John Skipper suddenly resigned, citing substance-abuse issues. Mr. Pitaro had been Disney’s consumer products and digital chief since 2016. [ WSJ ]\nCox Media’s viral content site Rare.us says it will shut down at the end of the month following Facebook’s algorithm changes. [ Axios ]\nMatthew Henick, who has been leading BuzzFeed’s film and TV output, has jumped ship to Facebook to lead its video content strategy and planning. [ Hollywood Reporter ]\nThe Athletic, a two-year-old subscription-based sports media startup, has raised $20 million to fund its expansion.
