    "text": "TORONTO, March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Canadian World Fund Limited (“CWF” or the “Company”) and Third Canadian General Investment Trust Limited (“Third Canadian”) announced today that they have entered into a definitive acquisition agreement (“the Acquisition Agreement”) providing for the acquisition by Third Canadian of all of CWF’s issued and outstanding common shares (the “Shares”) not already owned by Third Canadian and its affiliates and associates by way of a plan of arrangement under the Ontario Business Corporations Act (the “Arrangement”).\nThird Canadian is controlled indirectly by Vanessa Morgan and Jonathan Morgan, who, together with their affiliates and associates, beneficially own or exercise control or direction over approximately 64% of the outstanding Shares. Vanessa Morgan and Jonathan Morgan are also directors and officers of the Company and of Morgan Meighen & Associates Limited, the Manager of the Company (the “Manager”).\nUnder the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, each CWF minority shareholder will receive cash consideration per Share equal to 95% of the Net Asset Value per Share calculated and announced by press release on the day that is four business days prior to the meeting of shareholders of the Company which will be called to consider the Arrangement. The net asset value will be calculated in accordance with the valuation principles set out in the Company’s Annual Information Form and consistent with past practice. Generally, publicly traded securities held by the Company are valued based on their closing market prices.\nA special committee comprised of independent directors of the Company (the “Special Committee”) has received a fairness opinion from KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) which provides that, subject to the assumptions and limitations contained therein, the consideration to be received by the Company’s shareholders per Share pursuant to the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Shares (other than Third Canadian and its affiliates and associates).\nActing on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, and after consideration of the advice from KPMG, among other things, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) has determined that the Arrangement (including the consideration payable per Share) is fair to the shareholders of the Company (other than Third Canadian and its affiliates and associates) and that the Arrangement is in the best interests of the Company. Accordingly, the Board has approved the Arrangement and recommends that the Company’s shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement. Vanessa Morgan, Jonathan Morgan and Michael Smedley did not participate or vote in such Board determination or approval.\nThe net asset value per Share of the Company at March 2, 2018 (the last valuation date prior to the signing of the Acquisition Agreement) was $9.84. On such date, the closing price of the Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange was $6.19, so as at such date the consideration per Share was at a 51.1% premium to the then applicable trading price.\nCompletion of the Arrangement is subject to certain customary and other conditions , including, among other things: (a) receipt of court approval and, subject to the court’s approval, approval of the Arrangement at a special meeting of the Company’s shareholders by not less than: (i) two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of Shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, voting as a single class; and (ii) the majority of the votes cast by holders of Shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting in accordance with minority approval requirements of applicable Canadian provincial securities laws, voting as a single class; and (b) a 15% increase or decrease in the net asset value of the Shares from their net asset value on the date hereof will constitute a material adverse effect under the Acquisition Agreement and permit Third Canadian to terminate the transaction at its discretion.\nThe Company anticipates that the special meeting of shareholders of the Company will be held on or about April 26, 2018 and the Arrangement will be completed shortly thereafter.\nThe factors considered by the Special Committee and the Board, a copy of KPMG’s fairness opinion and other relevant background information will be included in the information circular to be mailed to the Company’s shareholders in advance of the special meeting of such shareholders. A material change report, which provides more details on the Arrangement and Acquisition Agreement, will be filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities shortly and will be available at www.sedar.com .\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:\nJonathan A. Morgan, President and CEO or Vanessa L. Morgan, Chair\nPhone: (416) 366-2931\nFax: (416) 366-2729\ne-mail: cwffund@mmainvestments.com\nwebsite: www.canadianworldfund.ca\nCaution Concerning Forward-looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements relating to the proposed acquisition of CWF by Third Canadian, including statements regarding the completion of the proposed Arrangement.
