    "text": "March 12, 2018 / 6:11 AM / Updated an hour ago Facing break-up, energy group Innogy unveils further costs cuts Reuters Staff 2 Min Read ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Innogy ( IGY.DE ), which faces a break-up under plans recently unveiled by parent RWE ( RWEG.DE ) and rival E.ON ( EONGn.DE ), on Monday announced fresh cost cuts in a bid to survive cut-throat competition in the energy market.

Reuters/Thilo Schmuelgen/File Photo E.ON and RWE on Sunday said they planned to divide the assets of the networks, renewables and retail firm among them, marking the biggest overhaul in Germany’s power sector since Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. The deal, if approved, would spell the end for Innogy as a standalone company less than two years after it was carved out from RWE and listed separately on the stock exchange to become Germany’s largest energy group by market value. Innogy, in turmoil since former Chief Executive Peter Terium resigned in December, on Monday said controllable costs would be slashed by about 400 million euros ($499 million) through the end of 2020. “By doing this, we are making Innogy fit for future challenges, just like our customers, employees and shareholders expect us to. We will comment on the latest announcements by RWE AG and E.ON SE in due course,” the group’s new CEO, Uwe Tigges, said. Innogy, which reported a 3 percent rise in adjusted operating profit, also said it would propose an unchanged dividend of 1.60 euros per share for 2017, compared with the 1.61 euro average forecast in a Reuters poll.
