Widely considered to be the father of the securitized mortgage market, he served as Vice Chairman of Salomon Brothers, Inc. In this role, he developed the capital markets as a source of funds for housing and commercial real estate, established Salomon’s leadership position in the mortgage-backed securities area, and also led the effort to obtain federal legislation to support and build the market. At Salomon, Mr. Ranieri had responsibility for the firm’s activities in the mortgage, real estate and government-guaranteed areas.\nIn addition, Mr. Ranieri is regarded as an expert and innovator in both the mortgage and capital markets and has served as Co-Chairman on the National Association of Home Builders Mortgage Roundtable continuously since 1989. In recognition of his dedication and lifelong achievements in the housing industry, Mr. Ranieri was inducted into the National Housing Hall of Fame. He is also a recipient of the lifetime achievement award given by the Fixed Income Analysts Society, Inc. and was subsequently inducted into the FIASI Hall of Fame for outstanding practitioners in the advancement of the analysis of fixed-income securities and portfolios. In November 2004, BusinessWeek magazine named him one of “the greatest innovators of the past 75 years,” and in 2005, he received the Distinguished Industry Service Award from the American Securitization Forum.\n“Lewis is an incredible asset, and I’m honored that he is joining the SolomonEdwards Board of Directors,” said CEO Ed Baumstein. “His guidance will substantially enhance our leadership role as a professional services advisor to the banking/financial services industry.
