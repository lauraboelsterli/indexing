    "text": "-Company Increases Share Repurchase Plan By 500K Shares-\nDAYTON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- REX American Resources Corporation (NYSE: REX) (“REX” or “the Company”) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2017 fourth quarter (“Q4 ‘17”) and fiscal year ended January 31, 2018. REX management will host a conference call and webcast today at 11:00 a.m. ET.\nConference Call:\n(212) 231-2908 Webcast / Replay URL:\nwww.rexamerican.com/Corp/Page4.aspx\nThe webcast will be available for replay for 30 days REX American Resources’ Q4 ‘17 results principally reflect its interests in six ethanol production facilities and its refined coal operation. One Earth Energy, LLC (“One Earth”) and NuGen Energy, LLC (“NuGen”) are consolidated, while those of its four other ethanol plants are reported as equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates. REX’s financial results for fiscal 2017 also reflect the refined coal entity acquired by the Company on August 10, 2017, as well as the impact related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company reports results for its two business segments as ethanol and by-products, and refined coal.\nREX’s Q4 ‘17 net sales and revenue were $109.5 million, compared with $121.6 million in Q4 ‘16, primarily reflecting lower average selling prices for ethanol during the quarter. The Company’s Q4 ‘17 gross profit for its ethanol and by-products segment declined to $10.0 million, from $25.2 million in the comparable prior year period. Equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates in Q4 ‘17 decreased to $1.3 million, from $2.9 million in Q4 ‘16, leading to income before income taxes of $6.5 million in Q4 ‘17, compared to $22.1 million in Q4 ‘16 for the ethanol and by-product segment. The Company also recorded a gross loss from its refined coal operation of $4.0 million in Q4 ‘17. While gross profit was negatively impacted, the Company recognized benefits related to its refined coal operation in the form of a lower effective tax rate. The Company reported income from continuing operations before income taxes and non-controlling interests in Q4 ‘17 of $1.7 million, compared with $21.2 million in Q4 ‘16.\nNet income attributable to REX shareholders in Q4 ‘17 rose to $19.1 million, from $12.4 million in Q4 ‘16, primarily reflecting the Company’s $14.4 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of its deferred tax liabilities in connection with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. Q4 ‘17 diluted net income per share attributable to REX common shareholders was $2.89 per share, compared to $1.88 per share in Q4 ‘16.\nPer share results in Q4 ‘17 and Q4 ‘16 are based on 6,604,000 and 6,591,000 diluted weighted average shares outstanding, respectively.\nNet sales and revenue for the twelve months ended January 31, 2018 were $452.6 million, compared to $453.8 million in fiscal 2016, while gross profit for fiscal 2017 was $44.2 million, which included a $7.3 million loss from the Company’s refined coal operation, compared to $71.0 million in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates was $3.2 million, compared with $6.1 million in fiscal 2016.\nFor fiscal 2017, REX reported net income attributable to REX shareholders of $39.7 million, which includes the $14.4 million benefit related to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax liabilities, compared with $32.3 million in fiscal 2016. This led to diluted net income per share attributable to REX common shareholders of $6.02 in fiscal 2017, compared to $4.91 per share in fiscal 2016.\nPer share results for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017, are based on 6,596,000 and 6,587,000 diluted weighted average shares outstanding, respectively.\nSegment Income Statement Data:\nThree Months\nTwelve Months\nEnded\nEnded\n($ in thousands)\nJanuary 31,\nJanuary 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet sales and revenue :\nEthanol & By-Products (1) $ 109,295 $ 121,587 $ 452,153 $ 453,799 Refined coal (2) (3) 240 - 433 - Total net sales and revenues $ 109,535 $ 121,587 $ 452,586 $ 453,799 Gross profit (loss): Ethanol & By-Products (1) $ 9,981 $ 25,171 $ 51,509 $ 71,039 Refined coal (2) (3,957) - (7,348) - Total gross profit $ 6,024 $ 25,171 $ 44,161 $ 71,039 Income (loss) before income taxes: Ethanol & By-Products (1) $ 6,545 $ 22,110 $ 38,352 $ 59,447 Refined coal (2) (4,336) - (10,021) - Corporate and other (550) (939) (2,938) (2,536) Total income (loss) before income taxes $ 1,659 $ 21,171 $ 25,393 $ 56,911 Benefit (provision) for income taxes: Ethanol & By-Products $ 13,004 $ (5,913) $ 3,245 $ (18,259) Refined coal 5,250 - 15,168 - Corporate and other 222 291 1,106 866 Total benefit (provision) before income taxes $ 18,476 $ (5,622) $ 19,519 $ (17,393) Segment profit (loss): Ethanol & By-Products $ 18,261 $ 13,021 $ 35,880 $ 33,950 Refined coal 1,108 - 5,628 - Corporate and other (316) (640) (1,802) (1,617) Net income attributable to REX common shareholders $ 19,053 $ 12,381 $ 39,706 $ 32,333 (1) Includes results attributable to non-controlling interests of approximately 25% for One Earth and approximately 1% for NuGen. (2) Includes results attributable to non-controlling interests of approximately 5%. (3) Refined coal sales are reported net of the cost of coal. REX American Resources’ Chief Executive Officer, Zafar Rizvi, commented, “Similar to much of 2017, the fourth quarter presented a challenging period across the ethanol sector as significant pressure on ethanol pricing impacted our results. Despite these challenges, we were able to leverage our ethanol and by-products operations, as well as our refined coal operation, to post another profitable quarter and fiscal year.\n“We remain optimistic regarding our ethanol business and are confident that our recent investment in refined coal will continue to benefit our financial results. Finally, we ended 2017 with a strong balance sheet and healthy liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents of $191 million and working capital of $212 million, which favorably positions us to execute on our operating initiatives.”\nBalance Sheet and Share Repurchase Program\nAt January 31, 2018, REX had cash and cash equivalents of $191.0 million, $74.1 million of which was at the parent company, and $116.9 million of which was at its consolidated production facilities. This compares with cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2017, of $188.6 million, $79.5 million of which was at the parent company, and $109.1 million of which was at its consolidated ethanol production facilities.\nOn March 20, 2018, REX’s Board of Directors approved an increase in the share repurchase plan providing the Company with the authority to repurchase up to an additional 500,000 shares of its common stock. Reflecting the balance of the Company’s prior repurchase authorization, REX is now authorized to repurchase up to 655,334 shares of its common stock. The Company had 6,558,679 shares outstanding at January 31, 2018.\nRepurchases by the Company will be subject to available liquidity, general market and economic conditions, alternate uses for the capital and other factors. Share repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, block trades or in private transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations and other legal requirements. There is no minimum number of shares that the Company is required to repurchase and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. All shares purchased will be held in the Company’s treasury for possible future use.\nThe following table summarizes select data related to the\nCompany’s consolidated alternative energy interests:\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nJanuary 31, January 31, 2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nAverage selling price per gallon of ethanol $ 1.27 $ 1.54 $ 1.40 $ 1.45 Average selling price per ton of dried distillers grains $ 119.20 $ 113.50 $ 105.89 $ 123.97 Average selling price per pound of non-food grade corn oil\n$\n0.28\n$\n0.28\n$\n0.29\n$\n0.28\nAverage selling price per ton of modified distillers grains $ 57.03 $ 43.85 $ 45.87 $ 50.10 Average cost per bushel of grain $ 3.18 $ 3.28 $ 3.35 $ 3.45 Average cost of natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 4.65 $ 3.69 $ 3.75 $ 3.24 Supplemental Data Related to REX’s Alternative Energy Interests:\nREX American Resources Corporation\nEthanol Ownership Interests/Effective Annual Gallons Shipped as of January 31, 2018\n(gallons in millions)\nEntity\nTrailing Twelve\nMonths Gallons\nShipped\nCurrent\nREX\nOwnership\nInterest\nREX’s Current Effective\nOwnership of Trailing Twelve\nMonth Gallons Shipped\nOne Earth Energy, LLC\n(Gibson City, IL)\n123.1 75.1% 92.4 NuGen Energy, LLC\n(Marion, SD)\n132.9 99.5% 132.2 Big River Resources West Burlington, LLC\n(West Burlington, IA)\n107.9 10.3% 11.1 Big River Resources Galva, LLC\n(Galva, IL)\n126.4 10.3% 13.0 Big River United Energy, LLC\n(Dyersville, IA)\n129.5 5.7% 7.4 Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC\n(Boyceville, WI)\n57.0 10.3% 5.9 Total 676.8 n/a 262.0 Fourth Quarter Conference Call\nREX will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET today.
