REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo \nSaudi oil giant Aramco agreed in February last year to buy a $7 billion stake in Petronas’s [PETR.UL] Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project, but the issue was then delayed by “technical issues”. \nRAPID is a $27 billion project located between the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea, conduits for Middle East oil and gas bound for China, Japan and South Korea.

REUTERS/Olivia Harris/File Photo \nThe two companies said in a statement that they signed the deal on Wednesday but did not confirm the value of Aramco’s investment. \nSaudi Aramco will supply 50 percent of the refinery’s crude oil with an option of increasing it to 70 percent, the statement said. \nThe development will contain a 300,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery and a petrochemical complex with a capacity of 7.7 million metric tonnes a year. Refinery operations are set to begin in 2019, with petrochemical operations to follow 6-12 months afterwards. Reporting by Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Susan Fenton",
