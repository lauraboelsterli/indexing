    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ( RBS.L ) has reached a $500 million settlement with New York state to resolve claims over its sale of risky residential mortgage-backed securities that contributed to the 2008 global financial crisis.\nFILE PHOTO: A worker cleans the glass exterior next to the logo of RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland) bank at a building in Gurugram on the outskirts of New Delhi, India, September 8, 2017. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Tuesday said the accord includes a $100 million cash payment to the state, plus $400 million of consumer relief for homeowners and communities.\nSchneiderman said RBS admitted to having sold investors RMBS that did not meet underwriting guidelines, contrary to its representations, and did not comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Steve orlofsky\n ",
