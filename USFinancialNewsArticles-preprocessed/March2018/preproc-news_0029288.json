    "text": "DALLAS, March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Riata Capital Group (\"Riata\") today announced that Eric Anderson has joined Acuity Eyecare Group (\"Acuity\"), a Riata portfolio company that owns and operates leading North American eyecare groups and optometry practices, as Chief Executive Officer. Anderson is a proven industry leader who brings over three decades of business and optical industry experience spanning multi-billion dollar companies across both domestic and international markets. He most recently served as Executive Vice President at Fossil Group, leading its $3 billion multi-brand licensed portfolio. Prior to Fossil, he spent almost 20 years at Luxottica in several prominent leadership positions, including President and GM of LensCrafters North America.\nRiata also announced that Acuity has acquired two new regional eyecare groups: One Hour Optical, based in Denver, and 20/20 Image Eye Centers, based in Phoenix. Including these two acquisitions, Acuity now operates more than 70 optometry locations across eight states, owns a large full-service digital lab operation, and expects to grow to over 100 locations by mid-2018.\n\"Acuity is off to a strong start and we are very excited about what lies ahead under Eric Anderson's leadership,\" said Jeff Fronterhouse, Managing Partner of Riata Capital Group. \"Eric is a proven industry leader who brings tremendous optical experience, a strategic vision for growth, and a track record for developing great talent. Eric joined Acuity's board in October of 2017, and we have been able to see Eric's impact firsthand. His exceptional leadership skills, and passion for growth and people, will be critical to realizing our future potential in the marketplace.\"\nRegarding the acquisitions of One Hour Optical and 20/20 Image Eye Centers, Fronterhouse said, \"We are excited to have successfully completed these recent acquisitions. They are both strong additions to our existing Acuity portfolio and provide expansion into new markets that are dynamic and growing.\"\nAcuity is the second platform investment of the Riata principals in the eyecare sector. From 2011 to 2015, certain of the principals organized and led the very successful investment in Vision Source, a market-leading network of independent optometry practices across the United States. Under the leadership of a very seasoned management team, Vision Source grew from 2,300 to over 3,150 locations, making its network of member optometrists second only to Walmart in terms of number of locations. Vision Source was sold to Essilor USA in late 2015, generating strong returns for its investors.\nAbout Eric Anderson\nPrior to joining Acuity, Anderson served as Executive Vice President at Fossil Group leading their $3 Billion multi-brand licensed portfolio.
