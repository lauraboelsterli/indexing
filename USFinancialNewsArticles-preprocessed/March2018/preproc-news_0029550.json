    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MindTickle , a company revolutionizing how businesses prepare and train their sales teams, today announced the hiring of Patrick Lynch for the role of Vice President of Enablement Excellence and Innovation. Fitting perfectly into MindTickle’s vision, Lynch’s role is to advocate for the entire practice of sales enablement and to spearhead MindTickle’s effort to drive better outcomes for its customers through innovation and world-class enablement.\nPat Lynch, VP of Enablement Excellence and Innovation, MindTickle\n“This is an exciting time for sales and enablement leaders where technologies like MindTickle are making it possible to correlate the impact of readiness programs with sales performance. However, doing this successfully requires a thoughtful and proven approach,” said Jules Ehrlich, President at MindTickle. “With Pat joining, we are able to bring our customers a perfect combination of field-tested best practices and technology. His deep background of more than 23 years in sales and experience as an industry analyst makes him the perfect fit to help our customers create and deliver effective data-driven enablement.”\nPreviously, Lynch served as a Director/Chief Customer Officer at CSO Insights, where he collaborated with some of the most forward-thinking enablement professionals in the industry and helped companies apply best practices in sales enablement and benchmark their results. He also serves as a founding member of the Sales Enablement Society, Denver chapter. Prior to CSO Insights, Lynch was the managing partner for Salesbridge, LLC, a sales transformation consultancy working with Fortune 500 companies.\nLynch served in various executive-level roles over his career, including holding P&L responsibility for all sales and operations for regional and national managed services accounts at Xerox, supporting the national sales team at the Customer Solutions Group at FedEx, and expanding channel sales at Ricoh.\n“I have seen first-hand how the very best sales organizations are run and what is unique about their enablement approach,” said Lynch. “Regardless of their technology, great enablement leaders are maniacal about achieving results and correlating enablement initiatives with sales performance. I am excited to join MindTickle, which is leading global organizations towards this goal and understands how to turn this approach into reality.”\nAbout MindTickle\nMindTickle offers the industry's most comprehensive readiness solution for closing the knowledge and skill gaps found in customer-facing teams.
