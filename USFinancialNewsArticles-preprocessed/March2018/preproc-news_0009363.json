Cole will replace the retired Frank Palladino, who launched Mi Rancho’s retail expansion in 2010. Cole brings 30 years of retail sales and distribution experience to Mi Rancho, mostly in the food and grocery business, and will assume responsibility for Mi Rancho’s expanding retail sales channel.\nDennis Cole, Director of Retail Sales, Mi Rancho\nCole comes to Mi Rancho from Peet’s Coffee, where he served as Operations Manager – DSD/CPG Grocery Division. Over the past three decades, Cole has worked for a variety of name brands such as Pepsi Cola and Kraft Foods. He also has extensive experience in tortilla sales and distribution having managed retail sales for one of the largest tortilla suppliers in the United States.\n“We are delighted to welcome Dennis to the Mi Rancho family,” said Manuel Berber, owner and President of Mi Rancho. “Dennis knows the tortilla business and has the expertise we need to build sales through retail outlets across California and the western US. His tenure in the business also means he has the contacts and expertise to help us expand to other regions when the time comes. Mi Rancho maintains a high standard, both in the quality of our products and in our business relationships, and we know Dennis has what it takes to open the right doors for the Mi Rancho brand.”\n“When I was approached about the opportunity with Mi Rancho, I recognized the opportunity to promote an amazing product line,” said Cole. “The Berbers have a real passion for the business and for the quality of their tortillas, and I welcome the challenge of helping promote Mi Rancho as a premium tortilla brand up and down the west coast.”\nMi Rancho has been producing high-quality specialty foods since 1939 and has always used the finest ingredients and centuries-old production methods to make authentic tortillas.\nAbout Mi Rancho\nMi Rancho® is an innovator in the specialty foods market specializing in tortillas and Mexican food products. Founded as a family-run Mexican bakery and grocery store in Oakland in 1939, Mi Rancho started to expand in the 1950s, providing tortillas to local restaurants. Today the company remains family owned and operated by the third generation of the Berber family, with plans of succession to the fourth generation currently working within the company. Mi Rancho produces 4.5 million tortillas each day or 1.3 billion tortillas each year, serving various segments including foodservice, retail, industrial, and international.
