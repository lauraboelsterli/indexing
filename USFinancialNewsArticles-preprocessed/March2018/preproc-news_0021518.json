    "text": "(Corrects paragraph 1 to say .. 75 million euros ..not.. 76 million euros)\nBELGRADE, March 7 (Reuters) - The Serbian central bank bought 75 million euros ($94 million) on the local interbank market on Wednesday to stem gains in the dinar against the common currency.\nThe bank, which a day earlier purchased 15 million euros, intervened as the dinar traded at the rate of 117.9.\nIn a statement, the bank said it intervened to prevent excessive fluctuations in the dinar exchange rate.\nAt 1655 GMT, the dinar traded at a rate of 118.04, Reuters data showed.\nThe Serbian central bank keeps the dinar in a managed float versus the euro, a preferred foreign currency in the European Union candidate country. ($1 = 0.8068 euros) (Reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic Editing by Hugh Lawson)\n ",
