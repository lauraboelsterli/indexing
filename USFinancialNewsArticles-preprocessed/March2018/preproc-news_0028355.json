The action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges that the Company violated federal securities laws.\nIn particular, the complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that (1) Johnson & Johnson has known for decades that its talc products include asbestos fibers and that the exposure to those fibers can cause ovarian cancer and mesothelioma; and (2) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nShareholders have until April 9, 2018 to petition the court for lead plaintiff status.
