The survey found a big increase in interest in the products, particularly in the area of international equity and emerging markets, which attracted $239 billion in fund flows last year, per Morningstar. \nTo that point, 54 percent of survey respondents said they would use actively managed ETFs in emerging markets, and 45 percent said they would do so in international developed markets. \n\"I think we may see a spike in demand for actively managed ETFs this year,\" Sullivan said. \nThe explosive growth in so-called smart beta funds also suggests investors are not as comfortable buying the market or segments of it through simple indexing. Assets in smart beta funds surpassed $1 trillion in December and now comprise about one quarter of the entire ETF market. \nThe funds still passively track an index, but they use a rules-based methodology to screen a universe of securities for desirable factors, such as profitability, high dividends, low volatility or value for equities. In the fixed-income market, popular factors to emphasize include credit quality, yield and duration.

Privacy Policy . \nSome product manufacturers are taking things a step further and creating their own indexes for funds to track. Last summer BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, launched some fixed-income ETFs — specifically, the iShares Edge Investment Grade Enhanced Bond ETF ( IGEB ) and iShares Edge High Yield Defensive Bond ETF ( HYDB ) — that track a proprietary index rather than a popular benchmark such as the Barclays Capital US Aggregate Bond Index. \nIn November the financial giant announced plans to launch seven actively managed equity sector ETFs to be called iShares Evolved. Instead of tracking industry indexes created by financial companies and joint ventures like MSCI, S&P Dow Jones Indices and others, the funds will use indexes created by robots employing machine learning to classify potential components. The company did not comment further on its plans. \n\"Companies are trying to move the needle in terms of index creation,\" said Sullivan. \"With self-indexing, a team creates a methodology to produce an index and then launches an ETF to track it.\" \nWisdom Tree Investments, one of the pioneers of smart beta investing strategies, is putting an active twist on passive investing in emerging markets. The company's WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund ( CXSE ) tracks a proprietary index of the broad market that excludes companies with more than a 20 percent state-ownership interest \"There seems to be a growing interest in actively managed equity products in an ETF wrapper.\" -Ryan Sullivan, vice president of global ETF services at Brown Brothers Harriman \n\"We focus the fund on companies that are freer to compete in the global market,\" said Luciano Siracusano, chief investment strategist for WisdomTree. \"We're giving investors the option to control for the risk of state ownership.\" Last year the CXSE had a return of 80 percent — more than double the return on the iShares China Large Cap fund , which includes the state-owned enterprises in the index. WisdomTree has launched a similar fund, with ticker symbol XSOE , for the broader Asian market. \nLast June the company also launched its first multifactor U.S. equity fund ( USMF ). It screens for 200 stocks with the highest combined score on four factors: value, fundamental quality, momentum and low volatility. \"Factors behave differently in different markets,\" said Siracusano. \"The goal is to get most of the upside [of the S&P 500] and protect against the downside.\" \nIn a suddenly volatile market, more investors may be looking for that kind of protection. \n— By Andrew Osterland, special to CNBC.com Andrew Osterland Special to CNBC.com Related Securities",
