Foley, II. “The closing of T-System Holdings on October 17 was an important milestone for Cannae given the large market opportunity that we see in the Healthcare IT and Services sector. T-System operates in the medical documentation and coding market which is expected to see significant growth over the next several years. In addition to the robust market growth, we also see an opportunity to build the company through acquisitions given the significant fragmentation that exists in the company’s primary end markets. Importantly, our acquisition pipeline has grown quickly since our closing; and, we are currently reviewing many attractive candidates that would enhance T-System’s capabilities as well as their addressable market opportunity.\n“Additionally, we completed the split-off from Fidelity National Financial on November 17 th and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ‘CNNE’ on November 20 th . Cannae Holdings is now a legally separate, stand-alone public company. This is an important step in our Company’s growth as it will provide the necessary flexibility for our team to pursue investments in new sectors which we believe will provide long term growth and shareholder value like the aforementioned acquisition of T-System.\n“Turning to our restaurant group which continues to experience a challenging market backdrop, we delivered positive same store sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. Importantly, we are working with American Blue Ribbon’s management team to drive operational improvements designed to deliver sales growth and margin expansion over the balance of 2018 as we reduce the company’s expense structure, improve store productivity and enhance our customers’ satisfaction levels with their dining experience. We also announced in the beginning of February, that J. Alexander’s did not receive the required votes to support the planned merger of J. Alexander’s and 99 Restaurants. Though we are disappointed with the outcome of the vote, we cannot emphasize enough how pleased we are to keep 99 Restaurants in our portfolio, as it is a strong brand that generates substantial free cash flows.”\nMr. Foley concluded, “We also announced in January that Ceridian confidentially submitted a draft registration statement for an Initial Public Offering. The number of shares of common stock that will be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined. The initial public offering is expected to commence after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions.”\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, Cannae will host a conference call tomorrow, March 15, 2018, to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time).

GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization as a percent of revenue (EBITDA margin).\nAny non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, Cannae's non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided below.\nForward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors\nThis press release contains that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
