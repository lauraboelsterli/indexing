    "text": "PARSIPPANY, N.J., March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Wyndham Worldwide (NYSE: WYN) today announced it has publicly filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with its planned spin-off of its Hotel Group segment. The filing may be accessed at www.sec.gov under Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. This filing contains important information regarding the transaction. In addition to the public filing of the Form 10, the Company has posted supplemental business and financial information about each of the post-spin companies to its investor website.\n\"Today's filing marks an important next step toward the successful completion of the planned spin-off of Wyndham Worldwide's hotel business,\" said Stephen P. Holmes, Chairman and CEO, Wyndham Worldwide. \"Both our hotel business and our vacation ownership and exchange business are well-positioned for long-term success, and we believe that this separation will result in continued growth and enhanced shareholder value. Each company will have significant scale and a leadership position within its industry, strong cash flows, and a rich portfolio of trusted brands.\"\nWyndham Hotel Group will become a publicly traded hotel franchising and hotel management company with a strong portfolio of renowned brands and will be known as Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (\"Wyndham Hotels\"). Wyndham Vacation Ownership will be joined with RCI to create the world's largest vacation ownership and exchange company, which will be known as Wyndham Destinations, Inc.\nThe spin-off of the hotel business is subject to final approval by Wyndham Worldwide's Board of Directors, execution of intercompany agreements, arrangement of financing facilities, the effectiveness of the registration statement, and other customary conditions. The Company has received favorable rulings from the Internal Revenue Service regarding certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction. Wyndham Worldwide expects the transaction to be tax-free to itself and its shareholders. The separation will not require a shareholder vote and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018.\nWyndham Worldwide's previously announced additional strategic transactions — its planned sale of its European vacation rentals business and its planned acquisition of La Quinta Holdings Inc.'s hotel franchising and hotel management businesses — are also expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. The La Quinta acquisition will be part of Wyndham Hotels following its separation from Wyndham Worldwide.\nABOUT WYNDHAM WORLDWIDE\nWyndham Worldwide (NYSE: WYN) is one of the largest global hospitality companies, providing travelers with access to a collection of trusted hospitality brands in hotels, vacation ownership, and unique accommodations including vacation exchange and managed home rentals.
