Wilmot-Sitwell joined in 2012 from UBS, where he was investment banking chairman. Montag said that he would stay at the bank for the next few months to ensure a seamless transition. However, no replacement was announced. Last September the bank made Jim O’Neil co-head of its corporate and investment bank in Europe, alongside Bob Elfring. They reported to Wilmot-Sitwell and Christian Meissner, head of global CIB. (Reporting by Christopher Spink)",
