    "text": " 16 p.m. ET Share \nPresident continues to lash out at fired FBI officials Getty Images FBI Duputy Director Andrew McCabe was fired Friday night. \nBy Dave Michaels \nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday sought to undercut reports that fired former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe has provided memos describing his conversations with the president to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. \nIn a Twitter posting on Sunday morning, Trump wrote that he “spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me.” \n“I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date,” Trump wrote. “Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?” Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2018 \nMcCabe was fired late Friday by Attorney General Jeff Sessions after the Justice Department’s inspector general found a “lack of candor’’ in McCabe’s disclosures about contact with the news media. The FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility recommends dismissal if “lack of candor’’ is found, but allies of McCabe say the finding was rushed and lacks a substantive basis. \nOn Saturday, a person familiar with the situation said McCabe had written memos , soon after the events they describe, detailing his interactions with Trump, the White House and what former FBI Director James Comey told him about his own dealings. They were provided to Mueller, who is leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign.",
