    "text": "The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is in talks to acquire the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday citing sources.\nChinese-led North America Casin Holdings was previously trying to acquire CHX Holdings, the parent company of the Chicago Stock Exchange, but the deal collapsed in February after it was rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe NYSE has discussed paying around $70 million for CHX which would be triple the price offered by North America Casin Holdings, the WSJ said.\nCHX declined to comment on the story when contacted by CNBC. NYSE was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nCHX has been looking for acquirers and earlier this month said in a statement that it was exploring \"strategic alternatives\" which could include a sale. The Chicago Stock Exchange is small and handles less than 1 percent of U.S. stock trading.\nRead the full Wall Street Journal report .\n",
