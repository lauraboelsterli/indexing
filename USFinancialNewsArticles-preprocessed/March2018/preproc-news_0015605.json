    "text": "7 COMMENTS Good morning. Props to Adweek’s Kristina Monllos for this headline: “ The Billboard Industry Thanked ‘3 Billboards’ Using ‘3 Billboards’-Inspired Billboards. ” The news was that the Outdoor Advertising Association of America leapt to action to congratulate the filmmakers and cast behind “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” which won big at the Oscars on Sunday. I wonder if the product placement industry is rustling something up for “Blade Runner 2049,” winner of the cinematography award. The movie’s dystopian cityscapes feature t ons of prominent nods to brands , including Coca-Cola, Peugeot and Johnnie Walker Black Label.\nThe Face That Launched a Thousand Scripps Amid all the big U.S. media upheaval in recent months, you might have forgotten about the not-so-small matter of Discovery Communications acquiring Scripps Networks, combining channels such as HGTV, Discovery, Food Network and TLC. That $11.9 billion deal closed Tuesday , and WSJ’s Keach Hagey has the skinny on what that means for the merged entity, which will be renamed—wait for it, branding fans—“Discovery Inc.” Discovery now has a compelling set of channels and library of nonfiction programming to bring to market a direct-to-consumer offering. A skinny bundle in the U.S. is one thing in the works, combining the likes of “Shark Week” and “Chopped” into a $6-8 monthly package. On the advertising front, Keach tells me : Discovery will also have a new strategy to sell more of the kind of branded integrations that Scripps specialized in, as evidenced by former Scripps executive Jon Steinlauf’s elevation to U.S. advertising sales chief of the combined company last week.\nIdol Hands Have you been suffering withdrawal symptoms since Fox took “American Idol” off the airwaves two years ago? In the age of TV revivals, ABC is bringing the singing competition out for its encore on Sunday , and as WSJ’s Joe Flint reports, it’s betting big on the show being a success. ABC is spending significantly more on the celebrity judging panel than Fox did in the show’s final years, when viewership waned. ABC will be hoping ad deals will help absorb some of those costs: The network says it’s already sold out 75% of the show’s commercial time and has sponsorship deals with Macy’s and Zyrtec. Joe also tells me : A 30-second commercial costs between $150,000 and $160,000, according to people close to ABC. That’s around the same rate that Fox got in its last season. One ad buyer said spots on the new “Idol” could be had for as low as $120,000. But it isn’t known what sort of reach advertisers are being guaranteed. Media buyers predict “Idol” will be hard-pressed to reach a 2 rating in the coveted 18-49 demographic, which equals 2.58 million people. The show averaged a 2.2 rating in adults 18-49 in its last season on Fox.\nRay of Light New product development is usually a constant in a beer company’s marketing department. Not so for the team at Corona, which hasn’t released a new Corona-branded drink in the U.S. for 29 years. But that’s about to change with the launch of Corona Premier, a new light beer that has 9 fewer calories than Corona Light, WSJ reports. The idea, according to Corona owner Constellation brands, is that Americans are trading up and choosing healthier options in all sorts of other categories, so why not light beer too? Prepare yourselves for a light beer advertising bar fight : AB InBev is launching a lower-calorie version of Michelob Ultra made with organic grains, and Molson Coors says it plans to compete by heavily marketing its Mexican light beer import Sol. New brand extensions encourage consumers to sample new products, but they do risk cutting into existing sales or causing confusion. Indeed, Corona Premier is about to compete with three other new products Constellation has in the works, including a flavored malt drink targeting women called Corona Refresca.\nTop of the Pods We’ve covered a lot of revenue diversification tactics in this newsletter as publishers look to lessen their reliance on the unpredictable display ad market. Writing for Wired, Felix Salmon explores how podcasts, done right, can be a savior . “The Daily” from the New York Times is generating “millions of dollars in new revenue” and has “supplanted the front page of the newspaper as the most coveted spot for Times journalists to get their story featured,” he writes. A Times spokeswoman tells me ad inventory for “The Daily” was completely sold out in 2017. Yet advertiser spend on podcasts—estimated by the IAB and PwC to reach around $220 million in the U.S. in 2017—is still a drop in the ocean compared with other digital media. Still, some brands have fully leaned in and are launching entire podcasts of their own , such as Casper’s “In Your Dreams” and MasterCard’s “Fortune Favors the Bold,” creating a platform to reach a highly engaged—and generally affluent and educated—audience, all without interruption.\nBest of the rest Deborah Wahl, the former chief marketing officer at McDonald’s, has joined Cadillac in the same role. Ms. Wahl, a marketing veteran, also previously held roles at Lexus, Chrysler and Ford. [ WSJ ]\nUnivision has canceled plans for an initial public offering and has replaced its chief financial officer. According to Bloomberg, Univision also passed up a $13 billion-plus offer from Discovery last year. [ Bloomberg ]\nWeinstein Co. is headed toward bankruptcy once again after an investing group organized by investor Ron Burkle and publicly led by businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet pulled out of a tentative deal. [ WSJ ]\nDating and networking app Bumble has become an LA Clippers jersey sponsor. [ TechCrunch ]\nNickelodeon held its upfront on Tuesday and said it will deliver more than 800 new episodes of new and returning shows in 2018-19, up 20% from last year. [ Deadline ]\nVegemite has ended its 74-year relationship with JWT and is shifting the account to Australian agency Thinkerbell. [ Agency Spy ]\nPenske Media has acquired SheKnows Media, which includes SheKnows.com, Stylecaster, HelloFlo and the BlogHer events business. [ CMO Today ]\nAd tech company Videology has shed 6% of its headcount in a global restructuring.
