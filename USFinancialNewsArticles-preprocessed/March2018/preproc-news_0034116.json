    "text": "March 21, 2018 / 1:00 AM / Updated 24 minutes ago RPT-COLUMN-Feast and famine in the global tin market(s): Andy Home Reuters Staff 7 Min Read (Repeats with no changes. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) * LME Tin Stocks and Spreads: tmsnrt.rs/2Ga3IUY * LME and ShFE forward curves: tmsnrt.rs/2FNlHB8 By Andy Home LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - The last British tin mine closed in 1998. When South Crofty ceased operating, it brought the curtain down on two millennia of tin mining in the southwestern county of Cornwall. However, hope springs eternal in Poldark country, as the region has been dubbed after the hugely successful television series based on the eponymous novels of Winston Graham. Two companies are now actively looking at reviving Cornwall’s tin fortunes. Strongbow Exploration is focused on South Crofty itself, which needs to be dewatered before any new mining can occur. Strategic Minerals is drilling the Redmoor site, a historic tin mining area also hosting tungsten reserves. Both companies will take heart from the fact that the London tin price, although off January’s 13-month high of $22,000 per tonne, is still holding just below there at a current $20,835. The London Metal Exchange (LME) contract, moreover, seems to be signalling extreme tightness with registered stocks chronically low and time-spreads chronically backwardated. The only problem is that there is another market in Shanghai which is signalling exactly the opposite. This “double vision” in the tin market is nothing new but the contrast is getting ever starker and there is more metal moving from China to the rest of the world than meets the eye. Graphic on LME tin stocks and spreads: tmsnrt.rs/2Ga3IUY NOT ENOUGH TIN LME stocks are super-low at a current 1,765 tonnes, or 1,535 tonnes if you strip out the 230 tonnes of “cancelled” metal awaiting physical load-out from the exchange’s warehouse system. A year ago they were above the 5,000-tonne level and three years ago there were over 10,000 tonnes of the soldering metal in LME warehouses. Unsurprisingly given this low physical liquidity base, the front part of the LME tin curve has been in continuous backwardation for almost a year. The benchmark cash-to-three months time-spread CMSN0-3 was valued at a backwardation of $70 per tonne at Monday’s close. That’s a bit looser than the cash premium of over $200 per tonne seen in late January. But spread tightness is becoming hard-wired into the London market with “tom-next” CMSNT-0, the shortest-dated spread of them all, spending as much time in backwardation as in contango these days. The tightness would be even more acute, were it not for the LME’s lending rules on dominant long position holders such as the one currently sitting on 50-80 percent of exchange tin stocks <0#LME-WHL>. If you throw cash and “tom-next” positioning into the mix, there are actually three significant longs gracing the LME’s daily report <0#LME-WHC>, one of them with positions equivalent to over 90 percent of available stocks. Yet despite a constant incentive to deliver metal into the LME system, arrivals have totalled just 1,305 tonnes this year and have failed to offset departures. The LME tin contract’s low and declining liquidity is undoubtedly accentuating the spread tightness but the fact that this has been going on for almost a year does seem to be signalling an underlying short-fall of available metal.
