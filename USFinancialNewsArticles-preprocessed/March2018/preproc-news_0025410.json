    "text": "FAIRFAX, Va., March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Council for Technology-Industry Advisory Council (ACT-IAC) today announced that GSA Administrator Emily Murphy will be the keynote speaker at Acquisition Excellence (AE) 2018. The event will be held on March 27 at the Renaissance Washington hotel.\nACT-IAC's Acquisition Excellence (AE) Conference is the place where several hundred government and industry attendees – roughly half from each sector – gather annually to hear about the latest policy and regulatory changes, acquire useful tools and strategies, and share challenges with peers from a diversity of functions and organizations. Developed by the acquisition community for the acquisition community, it's both an educational and interactive collaborative event focused on changing the acquisition system to create better outcomes for agencies.\nUnder the leadership of Tim Cooke (ASI Government), Tiffany Hixson (GSA), Jose Arrieta (HHS) and Ken Brennan (DOD), this year's event will address the 'Acquisition Innovation Avalanche'. Conference chair Tim Cooke stated, \"Today's acquisition system will soon be a relic of the past – replaced by innovative approaches and technologies that produce mission-oriented results faster and more efficiently while increasing the return on the investment of taxpayer dollars. This year's Acquisition Excellence Conference will help our community understand and navigate these changes.\"\nKeynoters include two leaders who are reshaping the acquisition system - the Honorable Emily Murphy, GSA Administrator, and the Honorable James Geurts, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition.\nWorkshop topics include \"Overcoming the Fear of Testing New Acquisition Approaches\", \"How Robots, AI and Blockchain are Transforming Acquisition\", \"Show me vs Tell Me Competition\", \"How Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs) Got Hot\", \"Category Management in Practice\", \"IT Modernization – How Acquisition Can Help Drive Success\", and \"Government e-Commerce Marketplaces in Practice.\"\nAcquisition Excellence 2018 is designed to provide attendees with the most up-to-date information on the latest policy initiatives, practical ideas and best practices that can be used on the job, insights into how the acquisition process will change, examples of innovative new approaches to acquisition that other agencies are using to streamline and improve the acquisition process, opportunity to share challenges and issues with peers, and new connections with people who are changing the acquisition process.\nFor additional event information and registration, please visit www.actiac.org/acquisition-excellence-2018-0 .\nAbout ACT-IAC – Advancing Government Through Education, Leadership and Collaboration\nThe American Council for Technology and Industry Advisory Council (ACT-IAC) is a non-profit educational organization established to improve government's service delivery and operational performance through the effective and innovative application of technology.
