    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â€” U.S. stocks are edging higher Friday after several days of losses. Energy companies are rising with the price of oil while technology companies are slipping. While retailers are mostly higher, jewelry chain Tiffany is falling after a weak sales report and disappointing forecast. The S&P 500 has slipped for four days in a row and is still down 1 percent this week.\nKEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index gained 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,752 as of 1:45 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average added 90 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,964. The Nasdaq composite lost 2 points to 7,478. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks jumped 7 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,584.\nAfter a dramatic drop at the beginning of February followed by a rapid recovery of some of their losses, stocks haven't done that much over the last month. Positive news about the economy has been countered by concerns about rising tensions over international trade. The Dow, which surged past 26,000 in mid-January, has been wobbling around 25,000 for about a month and a half.\nLOOKING GOOD: Ulta Beauty climbed $14.64, or 7.1 percent, to $220.78 after the beauty products retailer's fourth quarter report. Software maker Adobe reported results that beat analysts' forecasts and rose $6.78, or 3.1 percent, to $225.66.\nSchlumberger picked up $1.22, or 1.9 percent, to $66.57 and Anadarko Petroleum advanced $1.17, or 2 percent, to $59.08.\nOIL: Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.02, or 1.6 percent, to $62.21 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, climbed 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.06 a barrel in London.\nGEM STONED: Tiffany dropped $5.06, or 4.9 percent, to $97.65 after it reported weaker sales than analysts expected. Its forecast for the current year was also below what investors were looking for.\nOVERSTOCK SINKS: Online discount retailer Overstock.com said profit margins have fallen hard because of competition with Wayfair, and CEO Patrick Byrne said the company will \"respond in kind,\" meaning Overstock will try to ramp up its growth and will be willing to lose money to achieve that goal. The stock dropped $3.68, or 7.6 percent, to $44.53 while Wayfair lost $5.24, or 6.2 percent, to $78.72.\nFED AHEAD: The top policymakers at the Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday, and they are expected   again. Since the market is fairly sure of what the Fed will do, there will be a lot of focus on what it says. After the meeting ends, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold his first news conference since he replaced Janet Yellen last month.\nSEPARATE WAYS: While Broadcom is no longer trying to buy rival chipmaker Qualcomm, both companies are still at the center of deal discussions. The Financial Times reported that former Qualcomm chairman Paul Jacobs wants to take the company private and has had talks with potential investors and the Qualcomm board. Qualcomm added 89 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $60.78, which gives it a market value of about $94 billion.\nBroadcom withdrew $117 billion offer for Qualcomm on Wednesday after President Donald Trump blocked the deal, but the company says it still sees opportunities for other deals. The company also disclosed its quarterly results, and its shares fell $10.45, or 3.9 percent, to $257.31.\nINDICATORS: The Federal Reserve said factory output continued to rise as companies in the U.S. produced more cars, computers and furniture. It reported that manufacturing output rose 1.2 percent in February after three months of weak results. Factory output has increased 2.5 percent over the last year.\nThe Commerce Department said homebuilders started work on fewer apartment buildings in February, and that caused overall housing starts to drop 7 percent. Builders have shifted their efforts to single-family homes recently as the economy has improved.\nBONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.85 percent from 2.83 percent.\nMETALS: Gold dipped $5.50 to $1,312.30 an ounce. Silver lost 15 cents to $16.27 an ounce. Copper fell 2 cents to $3.11 a pound.\nCURRENCIES: The dollar declined to 106.20 yen from 106.24 yen. The euro fell to $1.2267 from $1.2303.\nOVERSEAS: The German DAX gained 0.4 percent while Britain's FTSE rose 0.3 percent. The CAC 40 in France added 0.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.6 percent while South Korea's Kospi edged 0.1 percent higher and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dipped 0.1 percent.\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP .
